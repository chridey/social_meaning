Doris Day, the first actress to get billing over Cagney in over 30 years, deserved a nomination, but lost out to Eleanor Parker in "Interrupted Melody", also at MGM.
Cameron Mitchell as Johnny Alderman, the musical director who loves Etting, Harry Bellaver, Robert Keith and Tom Tully were all first rate.
After Judy Garland was fired from Annie Get Your Gun, the first person that they wanted to play Annie was Betty Garrett, but because of her an-gent she lost out having the role of a lifetime in the movies, and after this happened, Betty Garble wanted to play Annie in the worst way, but 20th Century wouldn't lend her out, so finally after seeing Betty Hutton in The Perils of Pauline, she was hired to play Annie.
Originally, Audrey Hepburn was the not the first choice for Breakfast at Tiffany's, instead they wanted Marily Monroe, and she would have been great, but her schedule wouldn't allow, and many others lost out to roles like these did.
Also people left out of this story include Martin Snyder's first wife and his daughter from that marriage.
Cameron Mitchell as Johnny Alderman (real first name Myrl) does very well as the man who eventually became her second husband as does the rest of the cast.
Having seen this movie more often than all others, and one of those you will never forget the theater in which you saw it the first time, it undoubtedly is Doris Day's best.
This is one of the first movies they ever made me stare at the screen speechless, before bursting out into laughter.
This particular movie always interested me, I saw this movie on Turner Classic Movies and fell in love with the singing of Doris Day, I didn't know there was a real Ruth Etting, I didn't know she was really portraying a real life singer, I didn't check out the real Ruth Etting until 2 years ago, I saw her for the first time in "Hips Hips Hooray" on Turner Classic Movies and was kind of shocked the real Ruth wasn't anything like how Doris Day portrayed her.
The real Ruth Etting seems frail and too sweet, she's adorable, which makes me wonder why she hooked up with a gangster anyway but then again looks can be deceiving, I heard she wasn't the sweet, girl next door type in the first place and she wasn't so naive and a pushover like Doris Day portrayed her.
At first proud of his wife's success, Marty's admiration quickly turns to jealousy as he begins to sense a growing affection between Ruth and her piano player, Johnny Alderman (Cameron Mitchell).
The score for the film is first rate.
Not being a great Cagney fan, I didn't have high hopes for this film when I first saw it.
"Death Becomes Her" was Meryl Streep's first attempt at (dark) comedy and she outdoes even herself ("She-Devil") with an energetic, brassy, loud, and devilishly good performance reminiscent to a blonde Velma Kelly (Chicago)...who's afraid to get older.
This was one of my favorite movies the first time I saw it.
Bruce Willis's acting was so good I did not reconize him the first time I saw this move.
I mean, I doubted this movie at first from the beginning in Broadway.
Madeline is first dumbfounded then jealous.
The film is flawed no doubt, it should have developed the characters a bit more, we never really understood why Madeline and Helen were friends in the first place as it seems like they've always hated each other, they could have just explored the friendship a little further.
When I first watched this movie, I felt like it is just one of those movies that I would give a 6 score.
I never saw "Death Becomes Her" when it first come out because of a review I had read somewhere.
Many have made a good or even flawed but interesting first feature, and then either showed how good can really be (i.e.
Tarantino's Pulp Fiction) or how the hits of their hit'n'miss first effort were just coincidential (i.e.
His first movie The Miracle of P. Tinto was very irregular, it had some great moments (like the opening B&W short) and also tons of unfunny and lame jokes and weirdness for the sake of weirdness.
I have read a Fesser interview where he said he didn't enjoy the first live-action AstÃ©rix movie because no matter how good the lookalikes were, it didn't respect the essential of the comics.
I missed the first 10 minutes of the show and I am eager to watch the entire movie and I am sure there are so many bits that I missed whilst watching it on TV, watching this show over and over will be a treat.
Mortadelo & Filemon's first film (and may be not the last because it's going to be a success) is just great.
The movie isn't based in any of the comics, but takes several elements from their first long comic, El Sulfato Atomico (1968), but there are many other references.
It's really imaginative, with many original ideas and things (like Prof. Bacterio's cool inventions)  Finally, must say that the special effects are simply amazing, and really believale (they don't look cheesy or fake), the best in spanish movies, and there are so many details that it's impossible to see them all if you see it only once; there are lots of gags and funny details that you won't notice at first sight, so look sharp!
The goateed Kravaal, likable at first, grows increasingly deranged as the film progresses, but still manages to hold the audience's sympathies; a brilliant scientist using unethical methods to achieve great ends.
Those that find his work crazy, most of these films show that Karloff, at first anyway, was completely sane and determined to help his fellow man if allowed to continue his work unabated, and this was so often not the case.
This little known gem from 1940 is impressive for a few reasons: first, it stands head and shoulders above most of the B movies of the era, largely due to a good script and a great performance from Boris Karloff.
In this movie we see a character being killed within the first five minutes of the movie.
When I first saw this movie(Vampire) on TV some years ago, and have looked for it ever since, I was enthralled with Richard Lynch, his portrayal is 'right on' in this role..............now some of you may not agree with me, but I also put Rutger Hauer in a similar category, delightful to watch, downright scary in some of his roles,(Nighthawks) but the ultimate romantic, if given half a chance...........of course, my all-time favorite love story movie is Ladyhawke, so I admit to being a tad prejudiced.......I have seen Richard Lynch in a number of TV movies, series, etc, but have lost track of him over the recent years......  there are also websites for Rutger Hauer where his fans can go to keep up with his movie roles, etc........He also is the founder of an organization that helps AIDS victims, mostly children, i believe.....called STARFISH.
I liked it when I first saw it in '79 and I like it more now.
I highly recommend this movie for vampire movie fans and for Richard Lynch fans it is a MUST SEE I believe this was really the first time I noticed Richard Lynch.
Most thrillers will spend the first hour developing the characters, involving you in their story so when they are in danger you are frightened for them.
Before the first hour is over, our heroine is already fighting for her life, and it would appear the story is about to come to an end.
For a first movie by the young director one can only say "great" even if he were an old hand it would still be a great thriller and one that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
After the first ten minutes, you'll think that you've made the right choice in deciding to see the movie.
I saw the Criminal on Palm Pictures VOD and i must say, while at first I was skeptical, I thought it was a fantastic movie that unwounded perfectly with many twists and turns along the way.
I'd like to be kind as this was the director's first film.
Rachel (Lorreta Young) lives in the shadow of Big Davy's (William Holden)first wife when she is 'bought' to keep house and educate the young son.
Holden, at first a grief-stricken widower, cold and unwelcoming, begins to open up to Rachel and appreciate her as a wife and companion, not a slave.
What at first appeared to be a run-of-the-mill frontier cabin story turned into an absorbing, well-written, well-acted human interest story with four engaging characters, a beautiful locale (the movie would have benefited from color), and a fine score to boot.
For the first time Rachel has someone who actively engages her.
Jim's attentions build up Rachel's status in Davey's eyes while causing David to see her obvious attractions for the first time.
The "finger shadow" scene before the rape was a touch of cinematic genius that I almost missed the first time around.
'Gone With the Wind' has been on top of that list since I first saw it, in 1949.
Black Robe took second place when I first saw it, 2 nights ago.
This one is mostly about Indian life at first contact with the Whites.
While the clash of cultures is presented, so are the clashes within cultures -- notably among the first nations but covering conflicts among Europeans as well.
I saw this movie when it first came out and I loved it.
The first time I saw this film was about 15 years ago when it was first released.
The first of which makes it clear that worker health and safety was a very minor concern at best in this primitive era.
In fact, the Hurons were the first Indians of New France to accept catholic religion.
He gets lost on the journey in the cathedral-like forest and rejoices and being found by Algonquin hunters, who express some bemusement that the Black Robe got lost in the first place.
By avoiding the tendency of films depicting Native American life to romanticize, Bruce Beresford has captured more profoundly the daily harsh realities of life for the peoples inhabiting the northeastern portion of North America at the arrivals of the first trickling of Europeans.
The First World War is an usual subject for comedy, especially because of the massive lost of life and the first time many countries suffers the affects of total war.
The hero of this series finds himself as a captain in the first world war holed up in the trenches with his batman Baldrick and his lieutenant George, played as a simple and well meaning fellow again by Hugh Laurie.
The first five and a half episodes are however pure comedy of the highest order.
My first real introduction to WW1, began in 1964.
Here are some figures: just the first day's 'Battle of The Somme' resulted in a loss of almost 60,000 British soldiers.
The way each character started to become aware of what was to come and for the first time start to be afraid was just wonderfully done and the closing scene has got to be the best end of any series ever.
As such there was some controversy when it was first broadcast by the BBC for its apparent lack of respect to those who fought and lost their lives for the sake of freedom & democracy.
Like other reviewers, I was going to avoid this movie within the first few minutes because of its austere quality.
I saw this film for the first time over a week ago and can't get it out of my mind.
At first I wondered if I would like the movie but soon found I could not take my eyes off the screen.
Duvall's accent is a little trying at first, but once you listen for a few minutes, it resonates as the only possible way his character could express himself.
I'm not sure that I would have seen the movie, had I read the story first; however, having seen the movie, I want to read the book.
Simon has some friends that are not real and at first Laura plays along with it but there comes the ghost story.
The first part of the movie is slightly scary but as the movie goes along and things happen, this movie turns into a huge mystery.
Well,i watched this movie first reading on IMDb as to what a masterpiece it it.and i must say Am not Disappointed at all but inundated by the amount of effort put in to make such a classy piece of cinematic experience.
The Orphanage (2007) - directed by Juan Antonio Bayona and produced and introduced by Guillermo del Torro whose ghosts films El Espinazo del diablo and Pan's Labyrinth most certainly were the inspiration for the first time director.
When first looking at The Orphanage's plot outline I was less than enthralled, in fact I almost didn't watch it.
For this the first time director Juan Antonio Bayona should be given huge credit.
A woman moves into the haunted house of her memories, discovers ghosts and a mystery, starts working it all out while a cynical husband states that it can't be real, and eventually resolves the pained past of what causes the haunting in the first place, thus leading to transcendence.
"The Orphanage" is certainly not the first film to use the "creepy kids" angle, but screenwriter Sergio SÃ¡nchez made the story original and engrossing enough to be wholly enjoyable.
They have an agenda, for sure, but what may at first glance seem malevolent could be nothing of the kind.
'El Orfanato' surprised me first in successfully thrilling me with its surface, and surprised me again in how deeply it moved me with its core.
I was lucky enough to see one of the first ever screenings of this Spanish horror film last week during the Leeds' International Film Festival.
The Orphanage is the first film from director Juan Antonio Bayona and was produced by his long-time friend Guillermo Del Toro, director of my film of last year, Pan's Labyrinth.
Attended the first commercial screening of The Orphanage (El Orfanato) last night at FrightFest, London.
Juan Antonio Bayona and writer Sergio G. Sanchez have delivered something really special for their first feature.
Pairing the producer's innate knowledge of the cinematic language of horror with the raw and untested talents of a first time director paid off brilliantly.
Together with her husband and adopted son Simon, Laura tries to make the huge old building ready to receive it's first new residents, but all is not quiet in the dusty rooms and grounds, and gradually she starts to feel sinister presences from the past making themselves known.
The film, unfortunately, badly lacks pace and several shots run longer than is necessary - apart from it being somewhat repetitive (particularly during the possessed nun's sex-and-death rampage and her subsequent attempts to cover her tracks, which scenes may have influenced the first half of THE ANTICHRIST [1974]; SATANICO PANDEMONIUM itself was partly inspired by Matthew Lewis' celebrated novel THE MONK - which Luis Bunuel, friend of the director and my personal favorite film-maker, adapted for the screen {but didn't direct} around this same time...and which I managed to catch while in Hollywood early last January!)
This is actually the first Korean movie i ever saw, and it was really hilarious.
The first half an hour happens to be ineffective in a way and that would be the only reasons why I felt compelled to turn it off throughout the first minutes and leave it incomplete.
By my count, the gas station is attacked four times in the film's first five minutes.
Before seeing this film for the first time I didn't expect much, from the title and all, but I was very surprised on the humour and direction of Attack the Gas Station.
There is no camera art and no first grade performances, but I doubt that is what anyone going into this film expects.
Bored again after their first attack on the gas station our 4 heroes return and start running the place with the staff held hostage - the situation begins to go out of control after run ins with the local gangsters, the "delivery boys union" and the cops.
This film takes you from the beginning all the way to the end, at first you really don't like these protagonist, but near the end you want to join their gang.
It is these group dynamics that are perhaps the most fascinating aspect of ATGS, as we watch No Mark and his gang utterly dictates situations that seem at first totally out of control.
While the first film gained notariety due to it's allegedly real sex scenes, it otherwise was a boring waste of time.
the sequel (which has nothing to do with the first film other than the name) offers more of the same.
Another year on and the first 'Wild Orchid' film with a script attributed totally to ZK was released.
In the first minutes there is auto flagellation (good gore) , lesbian nun sex, and Satan.
From the very first episode, Jim Bronson became a powerful influence on my young and impressionable personality.
As such, however, he does include everything one has come to expect from a babes-behind-bars epic; problem is its all crammed into the first 40 minutes, the remainder being dedicated to a rather laborious trek across the desert and the decidedly predictable and anti-climatic round of score settling with The Man.
I'm still trying to figure what it is they are doing in the first one!
It was when Lora's good friend, who got her the job as a nurse in the first place, the kindly but looking the other way, in what Dr. Ranger was doing, Dr. Arthur Bell, Charles Winninger, finally grew a pair of you know what and not only came to Desney and Nanny's rescue, in defiance of the evil Dr. Ranger, that this horror or horrors the wanton starving of the little girls finally came to and end!
Stanwyck's first assignment is to take care of two sick children of a wealthy mother.
The first half is the reasonably normal, and interesting story of a young nurse learning her trade and dealing with typical hospital stuff - the only slightly odd thing being the constant focus on showing these nurses in their lingerie as they change from street clothes into uniform several different times.
A revolution parallel to the release of the first jazz recordings by the Original Dixieland Jazz Band.
The first is young Barbara in training to be a nurse and teaming up with Joan Blondell, another would be nurse, in a typical Joan Blondell role.
That's because Captain Picard and his crew were fresh when they first appeared after decades of Star Trek starvation.
After eagerly waiting to the end, I have to say I wish I wouldn't have joined the whole series at the first place.
When she first appeared, season 4 was focused on her for too many of the episodes but it evened out after that.
and you'd never think he was first officer, he's completely pushed aside most of the time.
The first time it happened, I was very surprised.
Contrary to her personal code of conduct (she will rarely work more than once with the same director, always looking for new experiences to further her craft and personal growth), she went on to star in Ozon's deceptively upbeat SWIMMING POOL and took a supporting role in his first failure to date, the atrocious ANGEL.
In following the mundane activities of their trip and first night away we learn quite a bit about them.
After seeing Swimming Pool (my first Ozonic experience - his first American-language movie), all of his previous films and now this one, I've come to the conclusion that Francois Ozon is a truly brilliant filmmaker, someone who is capable of foraging deep, DEEP under the surface of things - as only a Scorpio can - to convey what is nearly non-conveyable in films: psychological state and motivation.
This is first shown in the dinner party scene as she discusses Jean flippantly and in the present tense, Ozon using a study of Marie's friends' reactions to show that something is not right.
In the first instance, when confronted by Amanda after the dinner party and after a lecture, Marie uses changes in language to switch the tone of the conversation.
Later in the film, as Marie's defences begin to get breached, she resorts to both anger and insults in order to keep her personal reality from being destroyed.. she transcends her calm veneer for the first time when confronted about Jean by Vincent, and when confronted by her mother-in-law she resorts to petty insults.
It is also hinted at during her conversation with her mother-in-law: the two of them trading insults over who will be the first to end up in a psychiatric home, while Ozon makes studies of the mother-in-law's aging features.
As a fond of Ozon I was really happy, when Russia became the first country where "Sous le sable" was presented.
I first watched 'Tokyo Cowboy' at a film festival in TromsÃ¸, Norway, and at that time considered it one of the best films I have ever seen.
I disagree with a few comments below: first, I believe it 'is' appropriate to switch back and forth between French and English because the character is an english literature professor in Paris and has bilingual friends; second, I feel it is unfair of anyone to characterize the main character as elderly, she is sensual, attractive, and tentatively has a good life to live in her future.
That, the initial meeting of the two leads, their first skirmish with the Iron Boat gang, and much later, the remote inn that they 'rent' for a month to set up an elaborate ambush, and lastly, the lair of the gang, where SUN builds up to and sustains a lengthy climax, demonstrates a lot of imagination.
Chi Ming-Sing soon runs into a wanderer Cheuk Yi-fan (Fu Sheng) who does not reveal himself at first, but decides to crusade against the clan together.
I wasn't expecting much after the first half hour, but the film surprised me somewhat by the way it eventually comes together, climaxing with an exciting sequence that sees the central character really go off the rails.
Smug, anal, successful and ambitious detail-oriented Wall Street yuppie businessman Bart Hughes (exceptionally well played by Peter Weller in his first lead role) has his cozy and comfortable life thrown out of whack when a large and crafty rat invades his fancy brownstone apartment.
), but the first time when she dances for Robert Davi you can see a nip slip, not much I know but the best you gonna get; also Emmanuelle Vaugier shows her ass   My Grade: D-
This is my first review ever, please be gentle....
Republicans, and claimed "patriots" ideas are violating the constitution much more than said "radical" liberals do, we fight for the people, which is what this country is based on in the first place.
The first scenario is of an American woman being hooded, and then abducted by Chinese security forces and then taken to an unknown location where she is asked some uncomfortable questions.
A previous comment titled "Duh", at first glance, makes us all seem as though we are somehow keenly aware that civil rights are being denied...in America.
Arnold's contribution to the movie was not just that of the leading character, he also recommended Stan Winston after the first Predator creation was curtly rejected by John Mctierman.
It has no physical presence in the film at first, it just takes the role of observer.
I first saw this film back in '88 and it scared the hell out of me.
When I first saw this film I had the feeling something completely new was achieved by the film maker.
Having not being born when Predator came out, the first I heard about any sort of Predator was the Alien vs.
The first rescue team is found disembowelled and skinned.
McTiernan ditches the lush, steamy jungle from the first two acts and completely turns it around into a strikingly Gothic, baroque, supernatural landscape.
I was definitely excited at first, but after being back in the belly of the beast and being treated so horribly, I curse this film and the subject.
The first deaths suggest vengeance if not some sort of ritual, but later ones suggest that the alien may be feeding off of his (or her) victims.
When I first saw just a brief part of Predator when I was about five, I was freaked out and scared to even watch the movie for many ages, but eventually, once getting older, came to like it.
I've seen Predator many many times since i first watched it back in 1989 and i love it each and every time.
The entire concept of Predator is really clever and it certainly made me sit on the edge of my seat while watching it the first time.
My problems don't revolve around the exceptionally linear themes or plots that you could drive a jumbo jet through sideways, nor around the alcohol, sex and drug abuse, or even the switch of leads from the first season to the next.
I was finally able to catch the first 7 episodes here in the states on BBC America & I was disappointed.
It shouldn't be a welcome relief when a main character "bites it", as we say over here, however when Ella sticks it to Cassie we find ourselves really applauding a situation for the very first time in this show - SEVEN EPISODES IN!
Hex is a one of the best programmes, need i say more, loved every minute of it, i just hope they make a third series as bot the first two series are fantastic, no sorry, MAGNIFICENT.
first series gets the viewers to get a feel for the programme and teach important lessons about witchcraft and superstition.
When I first saw in the DVD shop I thought it would be a nice show like Buffy or Angel, but I was wrong...
The first few episodes it was a little slow (and I mean little) but it started to pick up speed and it snowballed and its just each breath-taking episode after each other now.
Can the first season if its before this summer, be downloaded or purchased on DVD?
would really appreciate anyone letting us know where we can get a copy of what am assuming the first season, it would be appreciated, or are we possibly a season behind here in the US?
because Cassie died mid way here and from what I read, she was there for the first 2 seasons.
Thelma, you will find out, is probably the most interesting character, after she is killed in the first episode by Azazeal.
Those who like shows such as Buffy because of the action might not enjoy Hex as much and might find it slow, but Hex is not the first show to carry the story through the characters and their relationships.
After the first episode I was hooked, tuning in every Sunday to see the next episode.
Jemima Rooper is superb as Thelma and was easily my favourite character from the first episode.
the first episode was OK but as the series progresses it seems to get better and better.
this show is about feelings(mostly sad ones) and about both avoiding and facing your destiny...  **major spoilers ahead**  True the first season were very different from the second one, but they had the same mood and theme.
I liked this unexpected twist and how it affected the characters, this also makes the change in series 2 more warranted, with the Antichrist born and free the story arc about Cassie and her family history is not needed anymore, a bit sad and strange at first but it keeps the show much more interesting.
I loved this movie from the first time I ever saw it.
From the quirkiest of the quirky, Steve Buscemi premieres his first film with a nuclear blast.
Join the Army - but see this movie first.
The film itself has to be watched twice to apreciate it as the first time all i got from it was a story about a drunk.
Movie appears on first sight plot less but actually it isn't at all: Buscemi's search for a second chance to escape from the morass of his own making is riveting.
Lars vTrier is a genius,no doubt.Everything he did,especially The Kingdom is extraordinary and very very good,shocking..but there is something that makes me feel humiliated.In Epidemic this feeling comes to its peak.It is like 'you stupid audience,watch whatever I do with your open mouth where I can put everything I want,it can be a candy or ..it'.The first I saw from him was 'Breaking the Waves' that impressed me so much that I begun waiting for the next work of the director.That was 'Dancer in the Dark'and I became a child who ate a chocolate bonbon(Danser in the Dark) after a caramelized bonbon(Breaking the Waves).In the meanwhile I found the opportunity to see Riget on the TV,this was a box filled with chocolate candies filled with caramel.Even though,all those candies were taken with no finishing,I was still a child with wide open mouth.And then 'dogville'came.Another big different candy.
Epidemic has been scheduled in order to obtain money for another movie - Lars intended to ask money for two different movies and to use almost all of the money to realize the first one (Europe), leaving few dollars to realize the second one (Epidemic).
And if by reading this the first thought that came to your mind is "black comedy", then go to the top of the class cause you're absolutely right.
The first time I played the movie for him, he sat quietly and watched it in its entirety.
The first movie with the Sesame Street friends for the first time in 14 years.
And if parents don't want thier kids to hear bad language, this is a must watch along with the first movie.
Savior is the first western film of its kind.
I first saw this film when it was screened on the small screen by the BBC here in the UK a couple of years ago.
I've watched this film several times, the first time being in the late 90's, and then again just recently.
My wife is a Croatian citizen, and her family fled the country in the early 90's when the region first began to break apart, just hours away from being swept up into the war themselves.
First things first , I doubt very much there`s any truth in this " True story " Producer of SAVIOR Oliver Stone also wrote the screenplay of MIDNIGHT EXPRESS and unlike the account of Billy Hayes book the film version is a work of complete fiction .
I remember disliking it first time I saw it because I`d written an unproduced screenplay set during the Balkans conflict called SOLITUDE which plays out totally different from SAVIOR even though my screenplay also involves western mercs and also having a subtext that there`s no good guys in the Bosnian conflict .
okay first of all what happened to the bad ass Kalina she is now an old whore who is aways calm but in the second game she was evil twist did whatever the *bleep* she wanted she didn't care who she hurt or how it was done she would do anything to save herself.
the awesome sound track from the second is replaced with the worst band in history maybe i did make the mistake of playing the second game first but it did rule.
This completes the new series, and takes the consequence of the ones before it, similar to how Warrior Within(the saving method of which this retains) built on the first.
It's a way to take out opponents, typically when they aren't yet aware of your proximity, and all you truly need is to get the timing right, albeit the first time you try the specific ones, before you know what's coming, you will have to react split-second, as well as not get trigger-happy.
Yuri is back, and thankfully, he left the vast majority of the emo back in the first one, but he did bring the humor with him, as well as what comes of his inner talks with his... other half(who's got a nasty case of cynicism).
This is the first video game I've ever rated or commented on, but this game was so cool I had to put in my two cents.
The different obstacles and moves were just difficult enough to where I couldn't overcome them the first time around, but they weren't so difficult that I had to give up.
It also happens to be HBO's first animated series since Spawn.
It is a bit difficult to follow the plot, since there are so many different ages edited together, but as the very first sequence shows us, this is only Cinema.
If you don't blink you will see William Hartnell who played TV's very first Dr. Who as a bus conductor.
He makes his first appearance late in the film, but the first time we see him he's lovingly updating his scrapbook of newspaper cuttings concerning the Necktie Strangler.
The later was one of the first attempts to rethink and reevaluate the past involvements of all layers of society in Stalin terror.
At first, Conway get shot after Tanner tries to stop the robbery, but he, with the help of Tanner only rewinds time.
Conway gets the money, holds them (but not the check) and rewinds the time, and then cashes the check again, still holding the money for the first time.
As I know we can find a lot of funny bad movies in the 80's, it's the first time I see a recent movie being so ridiculous.
The first 10 minutes and I already was disgusted by the hero, who kept using his time-travel device to go back 10 minutes and, (like Bill Murray in "Groundhog Day") think of better lines to pick her up.
This icky courtship by the wunderkind is just repellent to watch, and already in the first 10 minutes, I hated the main character (Astin)!
The first is of the Steven Seagal-category: meant to be cheap fun, and that's what it is.
)**Why isn't this on the bottom 100 with the rest of the cr*p?I mean this was so bad,it caused my brain to hurt and bleed.Here is how it began.It picks up where the first left off.Duwayne(spelling correction)and Belial have taken a steep fall from the hotel,and the paramedics pick them up; and place them on the ambulance.They arrive at the hospital to be treated,but they don't stay for long.A person disguised as a hospital worker kidnaps them both,and puts them in a van.She turns out to be Granny Ruth,and both she and her Granddaughter,run a boarding house for freaks.They're introduced first to a three armed gargoyle,with a really bizarre laugh.They are soon introduced to other creatures who are disabled in the "looks" department.One of them looks like it had an xylophone crammed up its mouth.Why does another one look like the symbol for "The Morton Downey Jr.Show"?Its basically a really large mouth that can sing opera,as Granny Ruth demonstrates.One looks like a giant maggot with glasses,another one looks almost like Swamp Thing.There's another one that was really hairraising,and one has to ask questions.What exactly did they do to Mac Tonight?He was a half moon man, that used to be shown on older McDonalds commercials back in the late 80's and early 90's.Was this supposed to be funny?Did they have something against him?It looks like they washed his face with a cheese grater,or an SOS pad.How rude!Then Belial is introduced to a female,reptilian freak named Eve who's an invalid.They later fall in LURVE with each other.Granny says she found her lying beside the road one day.I dunno,but I think she accidently backed over Eve with a Van,while she was crossing the street.Never mind.Duwayne develops a crush on Ruth's granddaughter,Susan,but she refuses his advances.We later see three other freaks,not introduced earlier.Two of them show up in a scene,where Duwayne is examining his scars.The male freak looks like a mouse,and his wife looks like something ripped off from "Troll".Another freak that really takes the cake is the frog one.This crossed eyed thing,is seen secretly looking at the reporter.Enough about the freaks,here's what I detest about the movie SO much.First, the freaks and monstrositys look down right stupid and poorly designed.Maybe it was intentional to be funny,or maybe the costume designer has the creativity and skill of a broom handle.Second,one has to question how some of the human freaks came to be;especially the ones like the mouse and frog.The story is weak with some plot holes,and scenes don't make any sense.The mouse freak says "Uh Oh!"
I've just finished watching the second movie for the first time, it's really good!
The story is clever and stays true to the Bradley history as explained in the first movie.
If you loved the first film and thought it was a great movie with the exception of the low budget and occasionally bad acting then you might not like this film very much.
If you saw the first film first you would see that Belial tried to kill Duane because of jealousy but in this film they just brush it off like nothing happened and they tried to say it was an accident.
It's not nearly as dank and sadistically toned as the first one - actually, it has a more of a "sitcom" kind of atmosphere going on with the obvious sound stages and slight melodramatic touches - but there's some pretty crazy effects.
Everyone's favourite surgically-separated Siamese-twins, Duane (Kevin Van Hentenryck) and Belial, return for more freakish fun in Basket Case 2, in which the brothers escape from hospital (after their near fatal fall in the first film) and find sanctuary at the home of 'Granny Ruth' (Annie Ross), who runs a haven for the physically deformed.
That pretty much sums up how I feel about the first sequel to Basket Case.
If you have seen the first movie you'll probably be wondering how can another Basket Case movie be a continuation of the first!
Anyway it begins just from where the first end.
This little, mid-aged lady together with an girl help Duane and Belial to escape and shelter from the police, chasing them for the first movie's massacre!
To be honest I found this one really entertaining, much more then the first one that was more like an"original" slasher movie!
I can't say if I prefer this one ore the next one, but sure this two are very different from the first Basket Case: here you will find true comedy painted in a gory way, but no suspense or thrills!
I really like the first Basket Case back in (1982) as it was very Gory also really funny and a lot of Fun  And now they are back again and this movie start from by showing what happened at the end of The Basket Case, Soon start from the ending of the first movie  The twins are now main headline on the news , Granny Ruth and her Grandaugter are watching the news and know who these two are, as they rush to the hospital, Duane and Belial break out of the hospital after he killed one of the doctors.
There are very funny scenes in this movie and gore was good not as gory as the first but then make up effect for the Freaks were GREAT, or outstanding and I really like the way the movie ended as it perfect ending for this movie.
The first "Basket Case" movie looked like it was made on a shoe-string budget.
There was obviously some more money to spend this time, compared to the first movie.
Not in the least of course due to the later success and cult following the first movie received.
The story is of course silly but it also still is a notch up when compared to the first movie.
Supriningly much better than the first movie, due to the fact it was made with more money and people involved and because the movie luckily doesn't take itself serious at all.
SEMI-SPOILERS: This is a fun little movie about Belial and Dwayne (who didn't really die in the first one, rather ended up in the hospital) finding their way to a house of freaks, where they fit in.
I do agree the third one wasn't in the same league as the first one and this great sequel.
This is the first ever Region 1 DVD that I've had to import to the UK as it's that good!
This show came out when there were a lot of first run syndicated programs.
The cheesy way of noticing non-humans was the first thing that made me roll my eyes.
i had seen this film when first released in early 85. though the pacing is slow and deliberate i find myself hypnotically fastened to the visuals aided by a good john lurie score.
This is her first film after her 18 years contract with Warner Bros. ended, and it proved once again what she could do with a meaty part.
Hollywood can never get the idea that a book is famous because people read it, because the author got "it" right the first time--in published form.
Among many things: first movie ever with a whole sequence fully computer generated (the opening credits), the recreation of downtown Las Vegas, and the Nevada desert inside the studio, the use of multiple computer-guided cameras (as developed by Lucas)...
Find a copy to rent, duplicate it and save it for your next first date with someone.
That being said, I wish it could've done a better at the box-office, if only had it been released as an art-house film, or (dare I say it) hadn't been so overblown with the finances in it, as it was the film that first put Coppola into chapter 11.
My wife and I have loved this film for years, having first seen it on the hard-to-find VHS tape, and later on the even harder-to-find LaserDisc.
Also, he worked closely with Sony to develop "Electronic Cinema" - this may be the first electronically edited film.
I first watched this movie when I was on my own and it made me think of my girlfriend .It is so fantasy in a modern day setting that it cannot fail to enchant .I don't know if it is charming or stark but it does have realism in an unreal state .The story is simple but nevertheless believable .You know how they feel !
It was the first film to launch his self financed Zoetrope Studios.
Coppola's decision to cast Frederic Forest and Teri Garr seems daring at first, almost brave.
From the first, the couple is fascinated with the pair but particularly with LoÃ¯c, the sexually ambiguous brother, (played to perfection by Stanislas Merhar).
The first one for the provincial backdrop and a dash of gastronomy.
Before making their dreary universe with its constricting etiquette falter in the dry-cleaner's, he will at first indirectly galvanize them to accomplish their desires.
Jean-Marie's answer is meaningful: "however when we started, you wanted to be the first one to help me to settle here...".
As for Jean-Marie, he appears hesitant and undetermined but maybe would he like (unconsciously or not) change his life in spite of an eloquent sequence: when he takes LoÃ¯c downstairs to show him concrete memories of his first years spent in the shop.
There are, of course, other substantial differences, where Mr Sloane came, as it were, out of nowhere, Loic (Stanislas Merhar) is first encountered by Nicole (Miou-Miou) and Jean-Marie (Charles Berning) Kunstler in a club where he is performing a cross-dressing act with his sister Marilyn (Mathilde Seigner)and only goes to live with the Kunstlers some time later when Marilyn leaves both him and the act in favour of life with her boy friend.
If so they came to the right place for the amoral Loic is happy to oblige, first by seducing Nicole - not terribly difficult as she was ripe for seduction - and then, with less success, Jean-Marie.
Parts that would make the movie seem more plausible and give an insite into the reason for the invasion in the first place are chopped to a couple of minutes.
The first hour is that collection of stories, and the final thirty minutes is the madness that is Coffin Joe running rampant in the nightmarish realm of these four selected "victims".
Hoping for another Academy nod, Jean-Xavier de Lestrade unsuccessfully tries to duplicate the gritty, grainy realism that won Maha productions its first Oscar.
Well, first of all this is a great excellent documentary.
And the judge decided to impose life imprisonment but for first degree murder it could have been the death penalty.
Since I first watched the film, I've read an excellent book by Diane Fanning about the Michael Peterson case.
If this is your first, the surprises at the end (which is well edited) will be new.
We get that dynamite is needed to clear the trail; dynamite is used to get water flowing in the superior first film 'Riders of Destiny' (1933).
When I first saw it my girlfriend (who isn't Jewish) and I and the vast majority of the audience, were roaring with laughter.
If you have read my other reviews of Chaplin's comedy shorts, you may have noticed that I have generally given very poor reviews of films made during his first couple years in Hollywood (1914-1915).
I saw this first at Sundance and again last week.
When I went to look about info on the actors on this film I noticed it was almost all first time actors...AMAZING with this brilliant, brilliant cast.
Issues of sexual identity are explored as is the pain of a first love experience by a slightly overweight but winsome young teen, Ellen.
I wonder if the talent in "Camp" have ever acted before or if this is their first attempt.
That is why films like the Star Wars saga really aren't Sci-Fi, but action/adventure first (and in the case of Star Wars, fantasy) and science fiction second at best.
I do know that I couldn't even watch the first 10 minutes of the new Hairspray musical with John Travolta.
This video is first class from first tape to last of the 5-volume set.
I saw it when it first came out, and it seemed hopelessly dated then.
I first saw it a couple of years ago and had my belly aching from laughing by the time it was over.
I first saw this movie in the early 80's and fell in love with it immediately.
At first, it reminded of me "The Talk of the Town," the one where Cary Grant is wanted by the law and Jean Arthur gives him shelter, unwillingly.
Here Chase is the fugitive, hiding in the garage of his first wife Hawn, unbeknown-st to her second husband Charles Grodin (who is being considered for the post of Attorney General of California.
There are plenty of amusing sections: Chase fighting back fear and hysteria when he is with the kidnapping bank robbers (when he compliments the wording of the bank robbing note, the robber who wrote it thanks him); Hawn's fighting for the underdog legal practice, which results in her having a growing number of clients she is helping to get honest employment for - even in her own household; Gould's judge trying to get to the point of the ridiculous arguments and fact patterns that first Hawn and later Grodin put into his court; Grizzard's governor looking forward to dinner with his future attorney general, and his favorite dish, only to find the state's number one criminal is serving it to him.
The first poorly acted scene with legendary starlet Bo Derek was just a harbinger of things to come.
Few of them turned in a scene that didn't seem like a first take.
The first time Brent Spiner farted, maybe.
Kay The Master of Disguise was funny the first time I saw it because I can take kiddish humor.
That is why films like the Star Wars saga really aren't Sci-Fi, but action/adventure first (and in the case of Star Wars, fantasy) and science fiction second at best.
I have to admit, after the first time seeing it I thought it was awful, but my 8 year old daughter and 4 year old son have it on tape and think it's hilarious.
Unfortunately the movie really isn't very good and it shows upon first view.
i first saw 'master of disguise' when it came out on DVD in early 2003. i remember it being funny, but now i see it as being kind of silly.
I can only assume he missed the daily's as any reasonable person would have quit after the first day.
As for Spiner (you knew I was getting to it); first of all, he's gorgeous.
Elements of the plot that attempt to keep the movie going for the first hour are immature and crude.
there are SEVEN occasions when people faint after seeing twins, which wasn't funny the first time.
I only watched the first half hour before giving up.
I really hope that "Big, Bad Wolf" is the first and last movie made with this cast of characters.
You may think at first it is inappropriate, but I assure you the effect overall is very good.
It may also be the first time I've ever seen a werewolf that engages in witty banter with his victims, so props for originality.
I mean, the game on XBox 360 already looks like it could have run fine on the first XBox (and I'm not kidding there), but some images are just too dark.
When I first heard that Prey was coming out for the PC, I expected it to be another normal and boring PC game.
I bought Prey off Ebay for 5.00 pounds and When I played it the first thing I realized was the beautiful and realistic graphics.
The portals are so important in this game and Prey was the first game ever to have portals in it.
The health regeneration is a little annoying at first, but then you learn to appreciate it somewhat, as it is less disruptive than having to go back 2 or 3 saves and start over.
In fact, it's relatively basicÂ.at first.
Bound for tragedy, the nine year old title has made it to stores this summer triumphant, albeit the interminable delay from first showcasing in 1997 to shelves circa 2006 has resulted in much confusion, hence the less-than-stellar critical reactions you may see elsewhere.
For Prey is being bunched with the on-going, and oft exhilarating, slew of first person shooters, still in vogue and dominating proceedings, particularly on the PC.
Forget all that: Prey is a masterpiece, putting fun and superlative storytelling first.
Watching the Yank and the Canucks learn first to tolerate than take a positive delight in one another is a riot.
The first story deals with a former government agent (Kirk Douglas) who searches for his son, who has been kidnapped by the feds who want to exploit his telekinetic powers.
John Cassavetes plays the kidnapper, who happens to be Douglas' partner (all these connections are established within the first 20 minutes, so I'm not spoiling it for you) The bulk of the film deals with Gillian (Amy Irving), another psychic who Douglas enlists to find his son.
Despite the change, the technical credits are still first rate.
The acting is first rate as well.
And if you pay close attention, you'll see Bill Finley in a cameo in the first 12 minutes or so.
Once again, I first saw this Movie on my Mum and Dad's old Phillips V2000, when it was first released onto the U.K's Home Cinema market (hired from a seedy old Video rental shop on the Woolworth road), and boy did it leave it's mark!
But the ending, as with so many De Palma movies, just came on to quickly, left too many questions unanswered (one of them being why the baddies did the experiments on Robin in the first place) and just felt over-rushed in every sense of the word.
When I first saw "The Fury" I was blown away, there wasn't a thing I disliked about it.
The script by John Farris based on his own 1976 novel of the same name, which I have not read so I cannot compare the two although it's said that the film is considerably condensed, plays more like a thriller than horror for the first half, it sets up it's secret Government agency, the bad guy, the good guy, it has a few chases & even a bit of comedy relief in the shape of two bumbling cops & a new car.
It does have a couple of slow moments and maybe it was a tad too long, but it's well compensated by superbly tense situations and blistering action sequences, especially in the first opening hour involving Douglas's character when his son is kidnapped and when his hiding out from government agents.
On first glance it looks like a cheap spoof but the more you watch it the more details you notice.
Viewing figures where therefore low and the dull marketing people could nod and feel they were right in not backing it in the first place.
I first watched this show about 4-5 years ago, I had bought it on DVD because I had heard such great things about it.
This show should not be missed, and if you were unsure about it the first time, give it another shot.
Me and my friends have had proper Darkplace tourrettes since we first saw this show, and it never gets old.
I can't believe I missed it the first time around.
Its got all these crappy low budget sci-fi shows down to a T. I've only seen the first two episodes and I'm already totally obsessed with it, this show is just sheer genius, it's hard to explain why it's so funny but you just have to watch it to understand the brilliance of this show.
Like the equally strong but in no way similar Peep Show, Darkplace is a program that can be watched multiple times and still remain as fresh and hilarious as it did first time around, how many American sitcoms can boast that claim?
When it all comes down to it though, no amount of words can really describe what Darkplace is like, it's a show you have to experience first hand.
I was a bit concerned after the first episode that the jokes would quickly wear a bit thin but this hasn't proved to be the case.
I've only seen the first episode (as well as the 'Official' Garth Marenghi website) and I screamed in a miasmous catatony - I gaped shudderously at the incomprehousity of the spectacle - I laughed till I stopped laughing.
Channel 4 (and E4) are now for the first time running six episodes from the series, and Garth Marenghi has said he is willing to be personally held accountable to God for the consequences."
9/10 (and I've only seen 3 episodes from the first series so far)  "the pube on the pipe idea came from a real life situation" Garth Marenghi
It was my first viewing of an Italian postwar piece, and I was quite impressed.
This was my first real exposure to the wonderful explosion of realism in Italian cinema from the '60's.
The first fight scene with Onion is right out of the first Trinity movie except it mostly done with onions.
I saw this film for the very first time not too long ago on TV.
During the first ten minutes or so it seems a standard European western, but then appears a horse pulling a wagon full of onions where "Onion" (Franco Nero) is hidden.
Let's first admit that this movie is not some deep drama or social commentary.
At first, it appears that the adults in town are going to turn out to be cardboard cutouts transplanted from all the other movies in the genre, but it quickly turns out that the adults are not evil, nor stupid, nor uncaring.
my 20 month old son loves footloose he first watched when he was 6 months old and now watches it 2-3 times a day its fantastic and dances every time its on and follows the steps that they perform he knows footloose is about to start as soon as the paramount picture comes up on the screen.
i recently had to buy another copy of this movie as he had worn the first one out he also has a copy in his granddads van so he watch it whilst out.if there was ever a remake of this film I'm sure my son would love it just as much a the original one.
It's amazing how so many actors never repeat their efforts of their first breakthrough movie (See Lou Diamond Phillips, Chris Rock and Madonna for starters) -Also starring in this movie is one of Hollywood's greatest lesser known brothers, Sean Penn's brother Christopher.
I believe that for one of the first times, Burns demonstrated his directing chops extremely well.
When I first began this film I was upset with the choice of actors.
There's adorably cute Tommy, a dark-haired young man, whose first sexual experience was with gorgeous Maria, but then they got married, and he started wanting every woman he saw on the street, and so he and Maria got divorced, and now he's just trying to get a date.
Griffin has a lovely wife, Annie, who is an idealist, whose first love turned out to be gay.
The acting is real, the directing first rate.
I wish everybody would stop complaining about how they can't find a decent guy or girl out there, when they really need to examine themselves first to see if they are even "decent" and ready for a real relationship.
This brash, perceptive, ultimately winning cyclical comedy first introduces us to good-looking, nice-guy Tommy (Ed Burns) who has just split up with his girlfriend and has been thrown out of her apartment.
Meanwhile, the scenarists have more fun with the familiar mistaken identities gag that dominates the first two-thirds of the film.
Those first 10 minutes or so reminded me of the heist scene in "Rififi" (1955), in that this scene too was captured with no dialog, letting the viewer see for himself how the action plan was set into motion.
This was my first experience of Dennis Potter.
Despite having a hard time understanding the accents during first few minutes of the movie, I really liked this film.
At first viewing it's excellent, then after I thought about the film some more I gained appreciation for it.
When I first heard that there was an Arabian movie featuring the Western icon "Hopalong Cassidy"(William Boyd) and the Gothic icon Boris Karloff, the idea sounded like a disparate joke.
This is the first silent drammatic film my kids have thoroughly enjoyed, (until now only preferring silent comedic standards by Keaton, Chaplin, and Harold Lloyd.)
But after watching it, I am inspired to write my first review ever!
The acting is first class.
I first saw "Get Real" in mid-May 2006.
I recommend it to any young person, straight or gay, and any "old" person who wants to re-live the pangs of youth and unrequited (or requited... if temporarily as here) first love.
But it transports you into it's charming world of first love and that feeling you get once you become infatuated with someone.
A perfect movie for anyone who remembers their first crush, in fact, a perfect movie for any occasion.
At first I thought this would be a Santa Clause rip-off, but after seeing it, I would recommend it to anyone.
I did not care for the first one much at all, and I did not like this one all that much either.
I liked how they opened by recapping the first one and then basically telling you it had nothing to do with this one.
Because last month was Halloween I did a non-stop binge on horror movies (AKA movies found in my horror section)and I saw this with the first.
The first movie was made with gross out humor but also with restraint that things never got too out of control.
(this is firstly a function of Margaret Gibson's source story, which is told from the author's POV) At first you get squirmy and expect that the parallel this character articulates between her and drag queen Russell - "We're both crazy" - will be used as an excuse for the good old queer self-loathing, but in fact this is in a different tradition, that King-of-Hearts, madness-as-sentimental-symbol-for-nonconformity thing that was in vogue then.
I first saw "Outrageous!"
Entertaining movie for those who don't like the majority of average Hollywood movies you see with dull plots and you already know what is going to happen after watching the first 10 minutes of the movie.
Otherwise an excellent first movie.
The first thing I must say is that I have not read the book so I can only go by what I saw on the small screen and at this point a further introduction is necessary.
Um, no; he got knocked out cold the first time up to bat with the bad guy, and in the end the police did all the hard work.
Bad guy (creepy and menacing up to that point) gave up too easily; Shari Belafonte was oddly stiff -- and there were a lot of things left unclear, like how Cannon's brother figured out what was up in the first place.
I only wish I would have come here first and found out how horrible this movie really was.
The always engaging Rob LaBelle makes a fine scientific sidekick (who actually does most of the work - not to mention acting), and Gardiner Millar as the chief villain is solid - even when the special effects have him reenacting the last scenes of the first Indiana Jones film.
Rajesh Khanna and Asha Parekh teamed for the first time in Kati Patang and the result was some powerful performances and great screen chemistry between the two.
Gaur passed on all the subsequent offers to Shakti and returned to his first love writing.
)besides the outlandish first meeting and the night cap, my fiancÃ©e and I had much of the same trial and errors that they experienced in the movie.
Well aside from the obvious point that Susan Sarandon (Nora,) looks radiant most of the time, and probably never looked better on film, Spader's character (Max,) is not quite as preppy as he appears, and has more in common with Nora than first meets the eye.
Oxygen starts one sunny afternoon in New York City as Frances Hannon (Laila Robins) is walking her pet dog around the block, a man (Adrien Brody) approaches her a begins to chat to her, at first he seems a pleasant & charming young man but he soon changes as he becomes aggressive, he threatens her & makes her get into a nearby car.
The bad guy, Harry, at first seemed a simple-minded villain.
I do remember stories of people being buried alive, especially since I'm old enough to have seen the original Vincent Price movies when first released & am familiar with the Poe fears and stories.
And the chemistry between her and Brody is amazing - after the first meeting of both you are not able to turn this movie out.
The first half is still remotely amusing, since the inept dialogs and cheesy massacres supply the film with a handful of chuckles, but then the whole thing gets too stupid to even smile at.
Inspiring and clarifying, it makes one wonder first of all why it's always the wrong movie people that get elected in politics.
The first half of the series, which takes place in New Hampshire, is extremely funny, especially in showing how the citizens there have become inured to the hoopla of the candidates and the media.
The last two episodes, at the convention, lack the bite of the first five or or six, and could be skipped without losing much.
And touches of irony help along the way, like how Veronica Cartwright's reporter, who at first is not getting much of the scoop, and how she soon acquires the fired former camerman on Tanner's inner circle (let go for an uproariously stupid montage video on drug legalization, taken mostly from Tanner's notebook) who shoots like many a pretentious reality-TV cameraman- and then also reports first on the affair scandal to boot!
This recognition that the powers of the camera-wielding Lumieres are in fact limited, that they are not as omniscient as they once thought they were, is perhaps dramatised in the figure of the father, one of the brothers, one of the first great director-stars, paving the way for Chaplin, Keaton and Welles.
One day, when she sees a book for spells, her first cast will be bringing back her mother to life.
at first i thought OK a doll comes to life how gay.
I used to hate it and think it was really lame, bad plot, blah, blah, blah, but after reading all the comments on the first page, it really got me thinking.
The first time I ever even heard of the movie (and saw it) was on Disney Channel.
I also did not recognize Tyra Banksat at first.
At first Casey is very upset and hates Eve, her doll, for ruining her chance of having her Mum back, but then gradually she gets to know Eve and appreciates her... She even learns that she can't bring back her Mum, she's gone and she has to live with it and love her Dad with all her might, she still has him and needs to appreciate him more too...
At first glance I bet 90% of people would under estimate it.
But often they come on TV and I happen to catch the first few minutes and then get swept up and, on occasion, thoroughly entertained.
And the way the story is presented is sort of mismatched and should've been shown in the proper order, from front to back, not from back to front (with the ending being first.)
It's not really a surprise when one knows the history of the journey that this project would be his first feature film effort.
Since I missed the first few moments I was a little confused by what was going on since the scenes jumped from the jail cell to the church to the past.
If "The Natural" is a home run into the light towers, then "The Road Home" is a dribbler to first base.
A universal story based on so many peoples lives, their first love, life experiences, growing up and most importantly discovering who loves them the most.
It's about being young and feeling all those wonderful undiscovered feeling that we all humans feel for the first time.
It's the first truly independent film I've seen with heart.
What an accomplishment for this first time director!
It's not a new story, but it captures the feeling of a first love in a way that is hard to not be moved.
At first we can't see who they are, and it is hard not to imagine that it is Pauline and Neel in adulterous embrace.
Daniel Auteil who usually plays hapless contemporary men at first looks as out of place in a period costume drama as Harvey Keitel does, but he brings the intellectual and moral sensibility of the 20th century to a true story from an earlier one.
I haven't seen the first bit, but the last hour and a half is definitely awesome.
I think the fart scenes could have been left out, although the first is an almost a deserved scene to accentuate the burned out bad boy and over the top good boy irony; and the cavity search seemed totally unnecessary and basically out of character for the movie or at least out of place except the director felt uncomfortable with any "aww"s certain scenes might have evoked.
The first half introduces us to the star-crossed lovers, and the usual boy-meets-and-woos formula.
Then there's Kareena Kapoor (credited as Karriena Kapoor, in her first pair up with SRK and looking more voluptuous than her skinnier self now) as Kaurwaki, the princess who together with the king-in-waiting Prince Aryan (Sooraj Balaji) and their trusted general Bheema (Rahul Dev) are in hiding because of a plot from someone in the democratic senate out to murder them to take over the throne.
The film paints a very emotional Asoka that Shah Rukh Khan excelled in bringing out, especially when three women in his life played an important part in his life-changing decisions, such as his mom's involvement for him to see the outside world, Kaurwaki in being his first true, and unattainable love that he yearns and pines for, and his eventual wife Devi (Hrishitaa Bhatt), a Buddhist who would be instrumental in his embracing of the religion after coming to his senses in the aftermath of his most brutal war waged just because of his insatiable appetite for more territory, though of course done in the name of uniting India.
Also, not to mention Rahul Dev and first time newcommer Hrishitaa Bhatt for there commendable performances.
The first half of the film is so-so because of its poor film editing.
I was a bit caught off guard by the singing/dancing numbers at first, but the story and visuals won me over.
Like many (I assume), this was the first Indian film I'd ever really seen.
And like many, I presume, the first time a song/dance number came up, I was surprised, and even started laughing.
The muscial accompaniment had me, at first, shaking my head and thinking "what in the world"...but now I can't imagine the film without it.
The film is a journey, a character study, of Asoka's progression to the time when he first embraced the Buddha.
This is the first commercial Indian film to receive nationwide distribution in the US, in this case through the independent First Look Pictures, and it is poised to bring an otherwise unknown film-making tradition in the American mainstream to a wide US audience.
This was the first bollywood movie i ever saw, and it's still one of the tops on my list.
Storywise, this is the really the first big budget Indian Epic that I can remember...very strongly influenced by GLADIATOR.
I mean, the story doesnt focus on Asoka's romantic life, but it does play an important role... Once you get past the first 15 minutes or so, the story really takes off.
The movie is an epic and the first example of International Indian cinema on a wide scale, bigger canvas and projected through the eye of a master filmmaker.
It is ironical that a film inspired by history is destined to make history itself by being the first Indian masterpiece to be shown at so many festivals, in so many countries and shown nationwide breaking into mainstream British cinema.
I love this film when i first saw it, and once i watched it again it got even better.
There's next to no extraneous incident, which means that Williams has to get the tone pretty right first time.
made on a shoestring, we dive headfirst into the seedy sleazy underworld of London life, the pimps, hookers and general lowlifes that crawl through the gutters of this world... we meet a downtrodden prostitute and an 11 year old girl (a fabulous performance by Georgia Broome) on the run, which is not obviously clear why at first.
Winner of the Best New Director Award at the Edinburgh Film Festival with a style reminiscent of the raw immediacy of Shane Meadows and the social awareness of Ken Loach, Paul Williams in London to Brighton has delivered an outstanding first feature.
This is a very raw, rough first feature (BAFTRA nominated) by Paul Andrew Williams.He wrote & produced the film as well.
I was really looking forward to seeing this, and for the first hour or so I wasn't disappointed - good story, good acting, good use of flashbacks - but then... For me, this film seemed to paint itself into a corner as it got towards the end.
I really wanted to like this film, and I did at first, but then the story didn't seem to know what to do with itself, and couldn't find an ending to live up to its beginnings.
It's just if you're going to call the thing London to Brighton I would have suggested some research on part 2 of your title, I was even a little doubtful of the first part.
It all starts when Kelly's pimp Derek asks her to locate a young girl for one of his clients; Kelly refuses at first but eventually gives in.
The film was well handled by the first time writer/director Paul Andrew Williams.
The film explodes into action from the first frame with Kelly (Lorraine Stanley) and Joanne (Georgia Groome) bursting into a ladies' room where Kelly hides Joanne in a toilet.
This film is exceptionally good; the first few minutes had me hooked with the gritty realism of the places, people and scenarios presented.
And acting is really first rate.
It's nearly impossible to make a first feature film.
What I was expecting was some amateurish first film effort which I hoped would have enough good ideas to make it worth a full viewing; what I got instead was a minor masterpiece of cinema.
It's amazing to think that this is a first feature from writer\director Paul Andrew Williams, made on a nothing budget.
But overall London to Brighton is an impressive first feature by 'Paul Andrew Williams' and most of the cast.
For a first time director Paul Andrew Williams pulls off a very confident film, it can be quite hard hitting, very well written with some really good performances.
The first half of the film has a few pacing problems as nothing truly jumps out and grabs you Â but when the unspeakably effective background segments are interjected London to Brighton receives a well-deserved jumpstarting kick up the arse, continuing down a perfectly-paced path.
Baadshah is a wonderful mix of comedy and drama, and is good for lighthearted fun, although the plot becomes rather fast-paced nearing the end of the movie and some may find it hard to keep up (although I first saw this movie when I was about 10 and I had to read the subtitles, and I followed it fine, so.......) The songs are pretty good, one of my favorites being "Woh Ladki Jo Sab Se", the scene in which Raj- "Baadshah" (Shah Rukh Khan) first starts his job to con Seema (Twinkle Khanna).
But Shah Rukh Khan adds such a refreshing and believable twist to the story that you'll be seeing it again for the first time.
Raakhee impresses in her first scene, but after-wards she looses her place in the movie.
(The fact that I was having to read subtitles didn't help) Surprisingly, the story holds together much better than it seemed to at first.
When I first saw this movie I gave up the notion of a superior creator and decided that the Man should be the biblical celluloid that dictates my life and takes me to places I never thought possible.
Another unintentionally amusing Irish moment is when our hero pours out some of his deeper thoughts to the priest and the priest's first reaction is to say "You're confused."
Their first combat mission occurred on December 20, 13 days AFTER Pearl Harbor.
When I was a little boy I first watched this movie in Denver, Colorado for the admission price of 35 cents.
The movie goes into a flashback where we see how Scott got interested in flying as a young boy back in Georgia and eventually joined the USAF ending up in China as the first US military man to become a member of the "Flying Tigers"; The Tigers were exclusively made up of foreign, mostly Americans,volunteers.
The camera-work and editing, especially in the first half, are overly artsy, sometimes hysterical and often completely unnecessary.
Monic Hendrickx and Peter Blok are good as always, but also Sophie van Winden was great, it's one of her first movies, she did a great job.
let's get the good stuff out of the way first...  the story line and the writing both are amazing... in the hands of a more capable director, this movie could've been an excellent movie.
(but no comedy whatsoever)..  but it was really really really bad directed, and you can notice that from the very first shot of the film.
a summer trained director trying his luck, and thinking that having a star like Hayden Panettiere can sell the movie - which i don't know why she agreed to do the movie in the first place??
Fell in love with this show the first time I watched it.
After being disgusted by the first D&D movie, I went into the Wrath of the Dragon God with trepidation.
From what I had heard about the first film, I was better off skipping it and watching the second.
I can't compare it to the first in the series, but as a Dungeons and Dragons player since the 80s and a great fan of fantasy, I can analyse it on its own merits.
The first thing and the main thing that impressed me was the inclusion of several aspects from the actual game.
The good guys, although certain area's with the characters were a bit plastic, they did have character which was lacking in the first.
In conclusion this isn't the best film I have ever seen but it does have a lot of the elements that I wanted to see and I hope will spawn more films of this type but maybe a series starting the characters from their first adventure.
I thought the cast acted well, as nobody was over the top or tried to call attention to themselves as super-hero extraordinaire (unlike the first movie).
Also I liked the First D&D movie (know well that it was going to be a bad "B" Movie)  That being said, THIS is what I was hoping for in the first one.
We have our villain, Damodar AKA Mr Blue-Lip-Gloss (who was the evil side-kick from the first movie).
Unfortunately they each die before you can really associate with their characters (unlike the first movie).
I had expected this sequel to be in line with the first D&D movie with regards to the general feel and content/quality, but was quite disappointed.
The visual effects were notably a lot worse, a lot of jerky, stuttered animation in the movements of the creatures, not at all the same kind of quite natural movement I expected to see after having seen the first movie.
Then, the acting: Sure, it's not been a strong point in the first movie either, but once again, a lot less convincing to put the characters down.
It almost makes the first one look like a masterpiece.
The fight choreography was lame, the dialogs were clichÃ©, the special effects were pathetic (except perhaps for the first dragon but even there...), the actors were either mediocre or stunningly uncharismatic and the story... well I don't remember what the story was nor did I care much about what was happening.
More character classes than the first,more monsters,more races, just more everything.I do agree with the poster who said get rid of Damodar he's played out.
The producers wisely dumped all of the characters and plot except the bad guy's assistant, Profion, from the first movie; changed the setting; and conformed the fantasy world to be more in line with the latest version of the Dungeon & Dragons game.
If the first D&D movie had been half as good as this one, well, I might actually watch it again.
The first movie was horrible.
The characters were engaging and the actors were good enough that I believed them in their roles (something else the first movie was lacking).
I'd recommend this one without reservation, where as I'd never EVER recommend the first movie.
The first D&D movie was one of the worse I'd ever seen; even more so as I'm a fan of D&D.
The heroes are also a lot more natural and likable, although still a bit two-dimensional, and the plot is still a bit weak compared to a decently written adventure for D&D, but in comparison with the first film this one is an Oscar nominee.
If you swore you'd never watch another D&D movie after the first one, it might be worthwhile reconsidering.
It was far more the film that the first outing should have been, which was truly awful.
At least it was better than that sewer slop that was the first movie.
If you're a D&D fan, it's worth taking the time to watch it, but I wouldn't buy it on DVD or anything, unless you bought the first one and just want to have the set.
BUT This movie was more sincere in its efforts than the first.
Like the first film, I was impressed with their exotic use of Lithuanian film locales.
Bruce Payne is an interesting choice to bring in from the first movie, and he handles the role of evil Damodar well, despite having no real motivation outside pure revenge.
I liked the fact Damodar, the only good thing from the first abysmal movie, was the main villain in this one.
My guess is that Berek is a higher level fighter than Damodar (who was put at 7th level in the first movie in Jeff Grubb's adventure adaptation of the movie), and he knew it.
This movie is everything that the first movie should have been.
My 6-year old's mouth was hanging open for pretty much the first 10 minutes of the movie, he lost interest once there was a lot of talking, or course, but he really liked the scene where they traverse the tiled floor backwards (a classic D&D staple).
I enjoyed this more then the first.
There was no slapstick comedy which really teed me off in the first film.
The first few minutes were the visual equivalent of a bad novel's prologue.
Unlike the first movie, D&D:Elemental Might go back to the book.
I was amazed when I found out that they were making a sequel to the horror that was the first Dungeons & Dragons movie.
Despite the poor quality all around of the first one some people gave the source the benefit of the doubt and were willing to try it again.
All things being equal this movie is superior to the first.
The final battle is not as kinetic as the first films finale, but manages to be a fitting climax to the quest.
The first D&D movie was largely hated by D&D players, partly because it wasn't a good movie, but also because it was not very much like D&D the game.
Perhaps because of the cool reception of the first, this was changed dramatically in the sequel.
The first movie also suffered from this problem, but in this movie, it's probably because most of the actors are new, this generally being their first film.
After a two minute introduction to the Bigfoot mythos that seems like it could have been plucked out of "Legend of Boggy Creek", we first meet the shag carpeted, snaggle-toothed creature himself.
I saw this film 17 years ago, and I must say that I found Johnny Yune's performance funny when I first viewed it...
Also, Johnny's character of Bruce has lived in the United States since childhood, having immersed himself in American culture for many years, yet he comes-off as a confused tourist who is in the states for the first time?
I saw this movie for the first time about a week ago and it is the funniest movie I have ever seen!
This film presents an excellent opportunity for some to recall what really happened in Hungary in 1956, for others a first insight.
What made Children of Glory a delight, was besides the scenes of historical value, and its recreation of street battles, it had possibly the first water-polo sports game in a movie I had watched, and filmed it with plenty of excitement that you can't help but to cheer the Hungarian team on as they battle for pride, and for their countrymen's struggles back home, as they meet arch nemesis Russia during the 1956 Melbourne Olympic games, resulting in what was a bloody match in the pool.
It grabs human destiny by a love story of a young sportsman and a student girl who met first at the start of the revolution.
You'll be scared by thinking it through, it's so real...  Kriszta Goda's second movie direction here makes you need to see the first as well.
My family had first hand experience with them.
Unfortunately, this is Levy's first starring role since he became a household name with his role in the "American Pie" films.
There are some absolutely breathtaking shots of the frozen tundra and the performances of the actors battling the elements are first rate.
As far as I can tell the story is faithful to the real events that transpired in 1928 during and after General Nobile's first attempted expedition to the North Pole by air.
The first few minutes consist of very tastefully done 'period' footage of Nobile's expeditions, as the aged general watches newsreels of the events on a TV.
More importantly, for the first time he names the ruthless Lundborg (Hardy Kruger) as his prosecutor-a move that Lundborg assures him will mean that the jury will reach a verdict for the first time.
In the 1920's, Italian General Nobile sought to be the first to fly over the North Pole in a dirigible, of all things!
Peter Finch is very good as Nobile, and so is Connery as Amundsen - and it's an historic well-known fact that the first man to reach the South Pole, Amundsen, vanished in his attempt to save Nobile.
Was it his vanity to be the first to cross the pole by air, that led to the calamity?
It is the first and in some ways still the best of Connery's wise old man performances.
He is the first to reach the survivors.
His motives for rescuing the Nobile over the General's objections that he take the other members of his expedition first, some of whom are badly injured, may have been less than admirable, but it is this act that will ultimately save the others.
The production values--sets, costumes, score--are all first rate and the acting is of a high quality.
However the first is overwrought and the second underused.
Mr Clint Eastwood gives a first - rate performance as Block,father of two daughters,ashamed of his needs,sometimes loathing what they have turned him into.Only with his kids or his dogs - all capable of unconditional love - does he appear even remotely human.
If this is a his debut, and it is very good for a first directorial effort capturing the noir atmosphere very effectively, I am almost itching to see what Richard Tuggle could come up with next, whether in this genre or not.
Directed by Clint's protÃ©gÃ© Richard Tuggle (who wrote the screenplay to the earlier Siegel-Eastwood classic ESCAPE FROM ALCATRAZ (1979), the film's first half is uncertain and suffers from clichÃ©d (albeit well staged and visualised) New Orleans locations - shady whorehouse dives, red light tinged bars and over officious police procedural rooms and locker-room banter.
My wife and I had our first Sundance Cinema experience this week with a showing of Die Grosse Stille.
When I first saw trailers on The Man, I immediately formulated what I wanted this movie to be.
The first comment absolutely missed the point of the movie.
I hope viewers will give the film a chance, including viewers who might become impatient with its slowness and its difference at first.
"Rain" is another visual masterpiece and "Bedtime Story" was one of the first truly "Over the Top Expensive" videos of the day and one of the first to use massive amounts of computer altered graphics, A real masterpiece!
Madonna's videos are no stranger to awards either, "Take A Bow" received the AMA and the MTV VMA "Video Of The Year" Award, while "Ray Of Light" won MTV VMA "Video Of The Year" Award, also helped usher in one of Madonna's first four Grammy's!  
People watching Heavy Metal for the first time with on prior knowledge of the magazine or the basic concept of the movie, like me, will undoubtedly give you mixed reviews.
The b-17 segment still is as exciting and creepy as it was when I first saw it.
Heavy Metal is a classic, and I'll be first to admit that it's got problems, but believe it or not, problems sometimes add to a classic's being considered a classic in the first place.
The first story is quite great, with that cynic taxi driver, and the voluptuous girl.
The 2 I give to this film is due to this first story, without it, it would be a 0.
The first part with the taxi driver is almost ok!
I rented this because it was refereed to as one of the first adult-orientated cartoons.
This movie looks like a bunch of comic book artists decided to make an animated feature, but without bothering to learn how to animate first.
Naked women in a cartoon and action and humor, amazing, I bet the heavy metal 2 sucked since it wasn't like the first one.
I'm the first kid (in 2006) to probably see heavy metal.
The first thing that many viewers will notice will be that the animation makes the worst Hanna-Barbera cartoons of the 1970s look pretty good in some ways.
Too bad the crappy elements of HM are all that seemed to make it into this movie... a series of short sci-fi/fantasy cartoons linked by the lame device of some evil, sentient green jewel that sets out to kill the one person that can destroy it... but first, it's going to tell its victim several irrelevant stories.
The first story is, OK.
I have to admit, I loved this movie from when I first saw it.
The first two seasons were wonderful.
Put it this way, give me the first 2 or 3 seasons, and 3 words can answer that.
I have been hooked right from the start, and it really ticked me when they canceled it after the first year, and then moved it out of Vancouver.
I saw the cartoon 'Page Miss Glory' on TURNER CLASSIC MOVIES for the first time in about 10 or 15 years and it brought back for me good memories of when I was a kid and a rushed home because I knew that the 'good' cartoons were going to be on Channel 5 here in New York.
They say Aandhi is based on the life of India's first woman Prime Minister, India's Iron Lady - Indira Gandhi.
Indira Priyadarshani Gandhi was daughter of India's first Prime Minister, Nehru.
BUCK PRIVATES is the first film in which famous comedy team Abbott and Costello played the main characters.
High-octane A&C, their first starring roles and a really kinetic blending of musical numbers and comedy routines.
Still and all, Bowman must first lose his privileged arrogance before being accepted into the great American melting pot.
In the first, ONE NIGHT IN THE TROPICS, the boys were purely there for comic relief and played a very small part in the film.
If you've read my previous comment on A & C's first film One Night in the Tropics, you know the story of how their next one, Buck Privates, came to be.
I mean such routines like "Money Changing" (first time a reprise from a previous film was used), "Dice Game", "You're Forty, She's Ten", and especially "Drill" (which was extended by producer Alex Gottlieb using several different takes of Costello's ad-libs) helped the boys' popularity go into high gear.
Well, when they started work on their first Fox feature, the movie they made, Great Guns, came on the heels of the success of Buck Privates and if one looked at the original script of the Fox/L & H picture, you'd know that indeed the studio wanted to capitalize on the Universal/A & C blockbuster as evidenced by this unfilmed exchange between Stan & Ollie: O: Wait-, S: What's the matter?, O: Don't throw the water out there!, S: Why not?, O: The sergeant is just liable to come walking in!, S: What's the matter with that?, O: Don't you remember?
Bud and Lou in their first starring film enlist in the army to escape being arrested for selling ties without a licence.
This is fantastic for Abbott and Costello's first feature film.
The Andrews Sisters are lovely as always, especially in their first appearance in the film, when they sing "You're a Lucky Fellow Mr.
Abbott and Costello's first major success, this film was a tremendous hit in its day and wound up beating 'great' films like CITIZEN KANE and HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY when 1941's box office receipts were counted up for the end of the year.
Having seen this movie dozens of times on TV over the years, I was also surprised to see a couple of minor scenes, for the very first time, that had always been cut by our local TV station in order to make room for the commercials.
I first saw this movie when I was five years old, and I LOVED it!
It was interesting for the first time to be able examine characters in the background, see facial expressions more clearly and especially, watch Lou 'working' both Bud and the crew off screen.
After a supporting role in their first movie "One Night in the Tropics", Abbott and Costello scored in a big way in this 1941 film, and Universal Studios had a comedy machine on their hands.
Nat Pendleton serves as comic foil, first as a cop on the beat and later as the hapless sergeant who can't control Costello's antics.
The first time I saw this movie I missed the first 30 minutes or so; I saw it fully last night and I didn't know the kid's uncle went to prison for 25+ years and the same with his mom!
But Buck Privates is an Abbott and Costello film, not a serious drama about the first peace time draft in American history.
Well, first off, the surf/beach movies were already a parody unto themselves.
He is accepted to college and at first his gets a full scholarship but then something changes and it is taken away.
first off , why isn't this on DVD?
i first saw this flick on hbo, when i was eight, didn't see it again till i was 15 and found it in a video store, i rented it over a hundred times and eventually wore their copy out.
No discernible logic exists in the movie, but it doesn't really matter as viewers who last past the first 5 minutes won't care anyway.
The screenplay is very good but sometimes it loses control and the movie becomes a little bit boring, especially at the beginning, until the first death.
It's not as faithful to the book as it could have been--a whole major subplot is given just a few small scenes; several characters who were more substantial in the book are reduced to barely more than window dressing--but it is remarkably true to the main story, sticks to it nicely, and allows both Poirot and the viewer to come to such a completely logical conclusion about the murder that you will wonder on repeat viewings how you could have possibly missed the clues the first time.
In particular, Simon MacCorkindale (more familiar to American audiences from MANIMAL, FALCON CREST, and COUNTERSTRIKE) is a criminally underused actor, and he does a spectacular job here in this, his first movie role, playing the hopeless and hapless Simon Doyle, caught between two captivating women (Lois Chiles and Mia Farrow--wow, what a choice to have) and ultimately driven by greed as he chooses between them.
Moreover, Guillermin's visual storytelling is a bit repetitive (he shows all the possible versions of the murder in detail, which tends to become a bit tedious after a while), and the first half could have been shortened a bit.
The acting, and locales were first rate.
In short, the acting is first rate.
I first learned about this movie on the mia-farrow.com website and saw a photo from it.
When I first watched it, I thought that maybe Mia Farrow was the daughter of Maggie Smith (maybe because of the red hair) and somehow conspired.
Moreover, Guillermin's visual storytelling is a bit repetitive (he shows all the possible versions of the murder in detail, which tends to become a bit tedious after a while), and the first half could have been shortened a bit.
Peter Ustinov stepped into the role of Hercule Poirot for the first time and despite no resemblance to Christie's descriptions of Poirot, made the role his own for the next decade.
This movie was the first and best of Peter Ustinov's performances as Hercule Poirot.
He is a brilliant actor, one of the very best, and I expect first class entertainment.
All the supporting characters are great as well...Witness Dennis Farina talking to his Vegas Lawyer, played by Philip Baker Hall (not the first time he would be a guy in a suit in Vegas named Sidney!
Jack does find John, in New York City, the first day.
I have seen it twice - first when it appeared more than 15 years ago, and then again yesterday.
I first saw this movie some years ago on TV having missed it at the cinema, and found it very entertaining.
I saw this movie recently and found myself liking into the first 30 minutes.
Upon first viewing of the film, I was dumbstruck to find what I thought was Travolta acting poorly and the story seemed to be absolutely forgettable and pointless!
His first story deals with a computer tycoon in hot water with the U.S. government for selling his products to an Eastern-Bloc country.
Perhaps most significant of all are the couple of brief family shots from the Indian village shortly before the first massacre, neatly echoing the scenes with the settler family.
The first question is: which massacre?
This film is not for the squeamish, and those of a delicate stomach should close their eyes at the first sound of "Anyone Who Had A heart", and not open them until it ends.
The acting is first class as is the subtle direction.
the first which I have not seen is apparantly about an alien or something, this is completley different featuring a story about a disgraced army guy (can't remeber who he worked for) who needs to rasie 5 million for a special new cancer treatment that will save his son and other children.
It is great to revisit the town of KorsbÃ¦k in 2007, approximately 25 years after it was first aired.
When Matador was shown the first time on TV, the streets of Denmark lay empty.
I was really impressed by The Book of Caleb - the first low-budget indie for the young director, Matt Manahan.
And it looked Amazing - how many first features shoot in 35mm these days?
the movie is about a day in the life of a young girl, who gets pregnant, dumps her boyfriend and is starting her first day as a maid in a big hotel.
I first saw it - not long after it came out - on Dutch public television in my final year in high school.
His laconic Aussie is frightening from his first entry into this two-hander, and he ably sustains that looming, brooding character right through to the end of the film.
A sublime movie within a movie after you see it once and the ending you have to watch it again, the first time you see it tells you a whole new movie now that you know, you watch it again and see it from a different perspective.
Quaid's hit man is kind, thoughtful, and contemplative all the while simmering with potential violence, while occasionally flashing a glimpse of the goofy grin we first saw from him in Peter Bogdanovich's 'The Last Picture Show'.
Let me first say that I completely agree with the idea of reducing our dependence on oil.
If this is the first time you are hearing about Peak Oil, you are among the majority of the population.
In his 2006 State Of The Union address, President Bush publicly acknowledged for the first time that we are addicted to oil.
Relocalization, reduction, more efficient use of energy and a serious reduction in consumption are great first starts.
Well done, especially considering this is director von Manahan's first full-length film.
That is the first and last piece of rhetoric - the rest is cold examination of evidence; which is perhaps one of the reasons it then has to work so hard to make its rather dry subject interesting .
I saw this film many years ago, when I was first discovering Cary Grant and going through some of his big films, and somehow it never made a big impression on me, and I largely forgot it.
The best he's able to come up with for the first half of the film is Miss Gone-With-The-Wind, who he admits he had just met.
It is one of the first times where the actors were encouraged to ad lib responses, and make comments on top of other characters lines.
This is Grant and Dunne's first screen pairing together, they would go on to make two more successful films after 'The Awful Truth'.
We often dive in feet first and wind up right back where we started only to find the ghosts of the past are still waiting.
I recently had the good fortune to see this movie for the first time in a Paris movie house.
Cary Grant, an up-and-coming actor in the mid-1930's, fortuitously teamed with the more established Irene Dunne for the first of three fruitful pairings in this archetypal 1937 screwball comedy directed with finesse by Leo McCarey.
What's odd, then, is that Jerry spends the first half of the film trying to win Lucy back--when *he* was the one who hadn't trusted her in the first place.
Charming, debonair, gleeful, playful, mischievous, vulnerable, hurt: every emotion that Grant so skilfully and mesmerisingly displays through his career is available here, possibly for the first time in one irresistible package.
I first saw the trailer for THE BOOK OF CALEB on the Cinemassacre.com website.
The trailer had me sold from the first mention of the fabled "upper decker," so I paid for the digital download and checked it out.
Irene Dunne and Cary Grant star (in the first of 3 pictures together) as a divorcing couple who really love one another, but they're just so darned sophisticated!
The chemistry is just wonderful between Grant and Dunne, and the supporting cast is first rate.
It's sort of a first draft of 'My Favorite Wife' (remade as 'Move Over Darling') and has all the patented screwball-romantic comedy-French farce elements of the 'Palm Beach Story' but in a less sophisticated form.
Dean Martin plays the villain for the first time, but doesn't add any dimension to his role.
Dean Martin for the first and only time in his career played a villain, a town boss named Alex Flood who still hasn't gotten control of the stagecoach line Jean Simmons runs.
At first you won't expect such light-hearted comedy from the country of Bergman.
(Because of a fluke, It didn't stop the 2 minute "preview" after the first 2 minutes of the film. )
For example, when the "kopps" accidentally blow up the previously mentioned snack bar, Benny's first reaction is "Oh sh*t!
Her evil owner, Regina(whose character is not quite as evil as that of Dean Jones in the first film), wants to sell the puppies, but Emily, Ted, and Ryce are determined to take on the responsibility of taking care of them.
Like the first, this one is guaranteed to get to you in a good way, but still lacks some of the greatness of it.
Just as good as the first.
If you liked the first one, you will like this one.
The mom is the first to know, and says to keep it from the dad, but that night the dad finds out after hearing barking the basement.
I think the first 2 are way better than the other sequels.
I'm glad the judge turned down Regina's claim for the dog because she really didn't deserve Missy in the first place.
BEETHOVEN'S 2ND, in my opinion, is even cuter than the first BEETHOVEN.
I laughed really hard when George (Charles Grodin) first discovered the puppies in the basement of his house and said, "Oh, no!"
I think it is much better than the first and until i saw the 3-5th movie on IMDb i didn't know they existed.
Beethovens 2nd is a pretty good sequel, not as good as the first as far structure wise, but it comes pretty close for me.Its fun, entertaining, and somewhat funny.Also it actually follows up the first one in a good way.It was very new and fresh in a way, and some what believable, that really the first one and second one capture in a right way.It was good to see the return of the original cast members, and to add in some new characters like Regina( who was a cool villain).It was really funny at times, especially at some points from Bonnie Hunt( who's character I love).I didn't care much for the ending, and some points it was a little too out there and unbelievable, and the dogs annoyed me at some points, as did some characters.Well, overall if you liked the first one you'll like this, and in fact this is probably the last good one sequel in the series.
The family has already had an adventure by saving the dog from the first film.
I've seen it at least 5 or 6 times and it was enjoyable the first and last time I saw it.
In my case top-billed Danielle Darrieux - still acting in her ninety first year - was all the inducement I needed to get it up at the box office and the fact that Thomas has made another competent film is a bonus.
(AND they got in first.)
This film from first time writer/director Jonathan Teplitzky is an ambitious venture and one that succeeds very well.
At one point one character says "We've already had our first fight," which hadn't happened yet, and he leaves with a bag he hadn't brought over.
I know I'm not supposed to refer to another voter's comments, but I totally agree with someone who wrote that they saw this film again immediately after their first viewing.
From the initial meetings to the scared first steps, the initial sex to the first words the next day, the progression of knowing nothing to seeing the unfolding of a relationship not yet defined and blossoming.
I mean at first I thought this was about war and terrorism, but its not, its more about the story.
Its a thriller that you want to see to the end, and it got me on that, once I got past the first 15-20mins, I was interested to see what ends up in the story.
The acting by a large cast both known & little known actors are all first rate.
also cast are Spanish,Mexican actors Eduardo Noriega & Edgar Ramirez & are as expected just first rate.
Which helps you go through the first 10 to 20 minutes of the movie.
I know i should have read reviews first.
We watch the first POV from that of the news crew -- however, it is real not a point of view of any specific person, we just follow the action of certain people -- when the story reaches a certain point we quickly rewind to the next POV (kinda) from the same time (which time-code on the screen becomes part of the films laughable points) the first began.
The first good point about this movie is the suspense.
For the first two thirds of the movie you can really see the story from different perspectives.
While this may be interesting at first, the constant rewinding sequences become boring and redundant by the third time.
This choice makes the first 60 minutes of the movie totally irrelevant.
I understand the concept of multiple viewpoints on the proceedings, as well as the rewinding to show us those differences, however, if you are going to do it, only show us what we missed the first time.
We know the person did it the first time, gloss over it and get to what we DON'T know.
I saw the first trailer for this film in June 07 and it only came out yesterday at the end of February 08.
Within the first 5 minutes easily, I was so engrossed that I couldn't look away.
When a film with such a reasonable premise is butchered and ultimately ends up dying an ignoble death, my first question was where was the strong hand of the director?
Sigourney Weaver plays a TV producer who is a witness as she's producing the live coverage and for a minute I thought we didn't see her vantage point but her's was the first one we watched.
When I was in my first year at university, I remember that one of my courses was entitled reading comprehension and for my exams, the topic of this course was based on a conversation between a man and a woman who talked about this widely talked about society phenomenon that is children adoption in Southern Asia.
This is one of those movies in which I would have LOVED to have sat with a paying audience as they watched this thing unfold before them when it first came out.
I first caught the film on TV decades ago and, while I didn't clearly remember the specifics of the plot (of which there's very little) until I caught it on TV again last night, I vividly remembered the corpses skulking about the screen.
I sat through the "Shanks" somewhat flabbergasted that this was the best that Marcel Marceau's first starring role and William Castle's last directing effort could yield.
Due to his background with puppets, Shanks proves to be very adept at controlling the movement of his first animals (a dead frog, and later a rooster).
Shanks has all but been hounded out of his own home by his cruel relatives, and he realises that desperate measures are needed to avoid going back there...and so the professor becomes the first human subject for re-animation.
But it is appropriate for her character, a set-to-mature-at-any-moment young woman deficient in some necessary growth hormones needed to push her over the edge (that when triggered by a first kiss could ultimately be her ... undoing) and seems trapped in young adolescence.
The acting is first rate, especially by Aoi Miyazaki, the movie really revolves around her even is she isn't the main protagonist.
At first, I must admit I felt a bit cheated (it is quite a common trick often used in Asian cinema, especially in Korean movies).
The first thing they do is crush the spies that the vizier had set to watching their moves, against a rock as they start on the pursuit, an appropriately delightful moment of evil indulgence.
Overall, highly recommended for young (but not very young) children and for adults who were kids when it first came out and want to recapture some nostalgic vibes.
Though not as good as the first Sinbad movie, The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad, I still enjoyed watching this one.
Watch this as a "fun" romp....as remembering when families watched shows together (..or in my case my dad mumbling under his breath about how the game was due on and he had to sit through this 'crap' first!
I had no idea what this movie was, or what it was about when I first picked it up, but I found myself sucked into it quite quickly.
At first glance, it's a fairly stock-standard romantic comedy about an adult class in Korea being taught english by Cathy (Australian Angela Kelly) for various reasons (business, family, overseas trips), but as you see more there are a few things that set this film apart from its competition.
Elvis also has problems of his own, because his interest in learning English is to better communicate with his long-lost sister, who was given up for adoption in America due to his poor family finances many years before...  You can totally tell that this film is the first, and probably the only one of its kind in South Korea, highlighting the recent English craze, where adults want to learn English to better improve their business English when it comes to international business, and students learning English through expensive English academies so that they could either study abroad/or live domestically and enter top-notch universities.
The first fifty times something silly happened to the couple was relatively funny.
And, it's not that Goldie Hawn is equally inept either; her work has been consistently good, if not great, ever since I first saw her in TV's Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In of the 1960s.
If you want a true comparison the the original was bland, this piece is something else I watched it when it first came out on video and I was with my family and friends , we all laughed and enjoyed it.
Parillaud is compelling, as at first, she almost seems unaware of her identity as a woman.
I thought the first one was a little strained but this version is RIGHT ON THE MONEY!
The film has a great cast, the writing was not upheld to the original quality of the first film which I think was just better and less silly than this film.
Neil Simon wouldn't write another screenplay for this version (he said that he couldn't improve on the first), and I'm surprised that after this cinematic fiasco he wouldn't sue for defamation of humor!
This is director Lee Chang-Dong's first film (of three) and the third that I've seen after his well-made films Peppermint Candy and Oasis.
It seems at first Makdong is going to let this slide, but when the three men get off the train, the young former soldier follows and cracks one of the three on back of the head with an award he received from the army.
Good for a first film though, and Lee Chang-Dong is definitely a director to keep an eye out for.
The first two parts had more too say.
The first part was really the one which had it in it and think they though that people will see this one because of it.
This movie is not as terrible as the third one, but not as good as the second, not to mention the first.
Species is one of those franchises that has gone down the toilet very steeply as of recently and I am happy to say that although #4 is nowhere near as good as the first film was it is night and day better then Species 3.
I liked the first one.
This movie had almost nothing to do with the first three.
The idea's not bad, but after the first chase scene in the streets of Mexico the movie shifts to a series of dimly-lit night sequences which make it hard to even understand what's going on.
The first Species movie was awesome, the second was a big disappointment, the third was surprisingly decent, but this is even worse than the second...somehow.
After the first half hour, I must admit I thought this movie would actually be as good as the third.
The reason for this getting a 3 and not a 1, is the first half hour of the movie, and the not-so-terrible acting.
The cast of the movie was fine the only one I thought helped was the guy from the first Species movie as the motel manager who was indeed the original one.
After watching the first 15 minutes i sat the player to double time, and i sure didn't regret it.
This was one of the first ever Karate films ive seen and i got it from a video shop about 8 years ago.
This is one of Hwang Jang Lee's first movies and it was pretty good at that.
The first half is standard kung fu.
This movie was the first karate/kung-fu movie that i had seen and still today i watch it definately a classic, the Silver Fox is one cool dude anyway good action tons of fights good plot and the usual dubbing but overall 10/10.
(Some of the best you'll ever see)   The Secret Rivals is a fantastic first effort for Seasonal Films and is one of the best independent martial arts films ever made.
I think if you go see this movie and check all your expectations and disbelief at the door you will have the fantastic movie experience of being whisked away to another world... the reason we see movies in the first place, right?
This movie could be the first major Chinese film to compete with Hollywood films.
Half the fights are so loaded with creativity it makes fighting movies look like something you've seen for the first time.
If the story about Sing really happens, bum shall be some 20 years older than he first showed up when Sing was a small kid.
Let me give the pros first.
Upon first viewing the trailer, I thought we would have another Kung Pow: Enter The Fist on our hands but, boy, was I wrong.
"Devil's Prey" (2001) is the first movie to show the brutal reality of devil worship and virgin sacrifice-dull, boring, and stupid.
The movie is never boring as we see a group of seven twenty-somethings first at a party who then get drugged and attempted to be captured and murdered by a group of loony satanics; there's a twist in the tail here as two of the young twenty-something "friends" are in fact part of the satanic group drafted in to capture the others.
I would say for making a movie during the writer's strike, on a very limited budget, this film managed to satisfy the crowd that I sat in when I first viewed it.
When they turn up to the funeral they confront the four brothers that their father raised after he left his first family behind.
This is the first film to show us not only a convincing portrayal of one of these family feuds, but showing us how they start; often by human beings who are hot-headed and overly defensive, potential bad-seeds which can take the whole family down with them, and in a poor society that allows such aggression to ferment and be propelled forward onto another family.
He kept the movie for me and I was the first one to remove the shrink wrap on it.
Thank god it was only 107 minutes and I was counting each one of them after the first 15.
If the idea was to cast Hooda to do the young "Malik from Company" or a similar character like that, let me be the first to tell you that he isn't even one-tenth as effective as Ajay Devgan was.
He promotes these movies like crazy with his name on the banner bigger than the movie itself and cashes out in the first week of its premier.
I agree in most part with the first review especially when comparing it to other movies from the RGV production house.
I was very keen in wanting to watch this Rgv movie as soon as I had seen the first look of it in 2005.
I remember the first time I saw it, I wasn't entirely sure that it had really just happened!
A slightly inferior companion piece to the stunningly brilliant "Porky in Wackyland", the first two minutes of this cartoon are fairly standard (though good) Warner Bros pre-WW II animation fare.
All of this happens within the first minute and a half.
I'll admit, Porky isn't my favorite Looney Tunes character, and 4 1/2 minutes of the camel freaking out got to be a bit excessive for my taste - at first it was amusing, but then it started to drag and seemed like it wasn't going anywhere.
But I was amused by the first 1 1/2 minutes, and I did like the camel's Highland Fling.
For instance, in the very first scene we see a couple of the locals, dressed in Mid-East garb, waking up, beginning to chant and then - wham!
While the story gets a promising start it bogs down a bit after the first 30 minutes, the story gets just too unfocused also the casting could have been better, Sophia Loren is far from convincing and McGoohan is certainly not at his best, if Hough would not have tried to get more audience by starring a lot of big names like Loren and Montague and just have hired other actors who could played the characters more convincingly this could have been a better film.  
At first you think that the movie is about getting the stolen German gold stock back.
So why should you watch this movie in the first place?
I enjoyed Election Night the first time I saw it and laughed out loud at times.
When the friend says on off-hand racist remark, the first man confronts him instead of sitting silently.
While almost impossible to believe, the first man then realizes that the election is being held and he forgot to vote--and runs to the polls before they close.
(possible spoilers) This was the first time that the events at Wounded Knee were depicted on film (at least, as far as I know).
If DANCES WITH WOLVES would ever have a sequel, I would imagine it would pick up where the first film left off and end at Wounded Knee.
We first see Reno when he is playing cards in a saloon and winning big.
He then rides back to the beach where he first encountered Maria and finds her pottering around the surf.
Ok this movie was interesting slow at first but then picked up of course I had a hard time even looking away from the screen because of Nancy Mckeon being the main character even crazy she looks cute :o) The movie is about a woman who seems normal then starts to hear voices she has schizophrenia.
This happened in a very similar way to the raid portrayed in the first part of the film.
But despite these flaws I can remember seeing this film from my childhood where it retains a soft spot and watched it again for the first time in something like 30 years.
The reality of it was all too real for me, as I knew first hand the sub-zero temperatures and high gale winds that were present at the time of this accident.
Akim Tamiroff as Welles' gypsy friend is rather good, but Nancy Guild in the dual role of Marie Antoinette and Lorenza, the woman who Cagliostro first rescues, then manipulates, is not outstanding.
Cagliostro was a brilliant montebank, alchemist,poseur and rascal of the first order.
I remember a couple of years ago when IFC or Sundance was running this film on an endless loop.At first I avoided it like the plague because I'd heard so many negative things like "it's boring" Or "all they do is talk"--but then I watched it anyway and saw that the great Wallace Shawn was one of the actors.How can I not watch a movie with him in it?And the other guy-I forget his name-was the evil bishop in Ladyhawke!
When I first saw My Dinner with Andre, I didn't like it.
It was Andre who gave Wally his first big break on Broadway by directing a play that he wrote.
At first you don't know what to make of the movie "My Dinner with Andre".
It's when both Andre and Wally begin to exchange opinions later in the movie, Andre did most of the talking during the first half, that the two make contact with each other and draw the audience into their conversation.
Which is as of a piece with Andre's conversation, to me, a lot of which went over my head tonight (I saw the movie for the first time just 10 minutes ago) and yet left me terribly moved -- possibly like Wally Shawn's character.
He did not need to ask too many questions, since Andre dominates the first half of the dinner conversation, hardly allowing Wally in.
Andre states that he feels the world is becoming more and more upsetting and that just operating out of habit is not really living, and many of his experiences have made him feel, for the first time, what it means to be truly alive.
At first, being only 22, I was weary about renting it because it was released before I was even born, and thought that the movie could possibly be out-dated.
The introduction also perfectly sets up the situation we are going to find ourselves in for the next two hours; it shows Wallace going about his normal, mundane activities, expressing discontent with his life and how he has to see his old friend Andre for the first time in years.
Some viewers may find it pretentious at first viewing, because it does deal with a lot of hard thinking topics and at times it can alienate the viewer by going slightly overboard with how it presents its ideas but most viewers should be able to relate to a conversation similar to this at one at some point in their lives, just maybe in a different way.
The first part is Andre recounting his professional burn-out and his subsequent travels to Poland, the Sahara, England, and Tibet to look for meaning in his life.
The impression is that, at first, this will be an awkward dinner.
What makes it so captivating is that you feel like you're right there with Shawn and Gregory - at first we're more like Shawn, just listening and somewhat curious about what has been going on with this other guy.
Gregory's tactics to get at this might seem far-off at first - his descriptions of his time in Tibet and Poland, for example, seems silly, but it does lead somewhere for the audience, and it opens up Shawn into the dialog.
The first 1 hour and 25 minutes are completely pointless, and after that, the movie gets more interesting.
These are questions that were obviously answered by acting first and questioning the action afterwards.
We might have some sympathy for Harold Dunlap at first, but then we realize he's dead serious about turning Mike into a corpse...and whom can Mike go to for help?
Basically, except for the first ten minutes of the film, he is stuck in bed or in his wheelchair.
Among the first soft-porn I ever saw was the made for TV "Emmanuelle" series starring Krista Allen.
It would have seemed more intimate if he had at first became enraged with jealousy.
I saw it for the first time at the Philadelphia Film Festival in February 2005, and have seen it about five times since then.
because Hans Weingartner is a consummate and devilishly clever storyteller and after the first few sequences you will forget where you are, and you won't be able to take your eyes off the screen!
This movie was the first German movie that i had ever seen but i must say, that it was worth the $8.50 i paid for my ticket.I have only studied German for 3 years and i thought that i should try and see at least 1 German movie before i travel to Germany in December.The German wasn't very difficult to understand it was just some of the slang that tripped me up a bit.Some of my friends said that it was definitely the best German movie that they had ever seen.the educators was well worth going to and praise must go to the wonderful actors/actresses especially Daniel bruhl.after seeing this movie i cant wait to see any new movies with Daniel bruhl.this movie is definitely worth seeing and i now know how good German movies really are.
The characters are so ridiculous that I first thought it was a comedy.
The tycoon defends himself, saying he works 14 hour days: at first he wanted to be able to provide security and good education for his children, now he thinks buying new things makes people happy.
The first half of the film has a breathless New Wave feel, and I'm sure it's not a coincidence that one character is named "Jule" as the "Jules et Jim" triangle is a driving plot point.
This is a film that musters some good suspense and adrenalin rushes at first, but starts losing them as the kidnapping wears on because it all begins to seem more about politics and the talk than about the action, though wondering how it's going to end is still what's going to keep you watching.
The development of the Hardenberg character was also very interesting: at first, he is a very rich top manager, also a rather pathetic figure, but then, as he gets in touch with his own idealistic past, he shows much strength and wisdom.
Die Fetten Jahre sind vorbei (The Edukators) is the first German film in competition at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival since Wim Wender's In weiter Ferne, so nah!
At first it seemed to me this movie was the continuation of Good Bye Lenin (probably because of Daniel in Berlin?)
I have to issue a few words of warning first:  Don't see this movie after you have just enjoyed a really good Hollywood-production (as I did).
Because if you do you may at first be put off a little bit by the quality of this digital productions that does not quite come up to 35mm-standards.
The film's most horrifying moment is its very first: A man (Charles Russell) stabs a woman on a railroad siding and dumps her body like a sack of meal on the observation platform as the train pulls out.
Michele Pfiefer is normally watchable, but this has to be her first role where I couldn't bear to look.
I'll interview the first girl willing to talk to me.
I'll wave goodbye to the first girl in Richmond who talked to me, and feel good - knowing that I could have slept with her if that's what I wanted.
As one who has lived and worked in Thailand I can tell you that any documentary that does not include a LONG HARDlook at the role of the Police, the Politicians, and the King is leaving out the primary motivation for Thai prostitution in the first place.
Isn't this Kenneth Guertin's first feature, or at least the first one registered on IMDB?
For a first time writer he tells his story economically and clearly.
"The Incorporated" is a very strong first endeavor.
I dusted off the cover and for the first time in my life gazed upon those words: 'The Incorporated.'
This is the first of the series I've played, except for a minimal portion of the second one.
Heroes is probably the first game which contains a system in strategy you might not have seen before.
When we know the author of the original stories is white, the film shows perfectly well how the American society, after slavery and after Â up to the 1850s Â banning the Blacks from all training into reading and writing, from all speaking their original languages and even from all affiliation to any religion, rushes head first into over-Christianizing the Blacks with no cautious slowing down and with all calculated speeding up they could master after the Secession War, both south and north, though for different reasons.
But the real interest is the large presence of Negro spirituals in the film, one of the very first films entirely centered on Black music, though in 1936 we must not forget we are after Â and within Â the triumph of the radio that enabled Black music and jazz to find a wide audience, to embed its existence and force into the widest Black and white audience it had ever had, just as it enabled F. D. Roosevelt to dominate the political arena for twelve years or so.
In reviewing African-Americans on film in chronological order for Black History Month, we're now at 1936 with the first all-black production for a major studio since Hallelujah!
i first saw this movie in the mid 80's as referred by a co worker, and i scoured the TV listings for about a year until i found it, was not available locally on /through video, i thought this movie was fantastic, remember the time frame when it was made.
I first saw this film as a small child and it made a great impression on me---the nearness of God, the effects of our actions, like ripples in a pond.
(Much like the villages in the first three FRANKENSTEIN films) Moses is a modern-day "trickster" who gives Pharaoh's top magician a run for his money.
Highlights include the first scenes in Heaven and just about anything with Rex Ingram.
I first saw "The Green Pastures" quite by accident as a 13 year-old while visiting grandparents in Detroit, Michigan many, many years ago...I never forgot it.
I remember asking my mom about the movie when I first saw it and always remembered her response..."how do you think the little black children in the movie pictured God and others in the Bible?"
It wasn't the first time SjÃ¶strÃ¶m had used the wild and unpredictable nature as an illustrator or commentator, but this time the scenery and the acting was in the same level of quality.
This movie was the follow-up to SjÃ¶strÃ¶m's 1917 breakthrough feature, TERJE VIGEN, which first gained him international attention.
It is a truism that Victor Sjostrom's films dramatise the conflict between nature and society, but his treatment is less simplistic than might be first apparent.
I don't know why Wes Craven, didn't Direct this, but without Freddy's creator, it simply insults the original with its attempts to break the boundary's set out by Wes Craven in the first movie.
Freddy is still a good character, although more laughable than Scary in this outing, he was humorous in the first movie, but not at the expense of the Horror.
We see lots of the same images as in the first one, but what we don't see is any of the sense of style, menace, or suspense that was used in the original.
As much as I could complain about the first film though I would have to say that at least it wasn't Freddy's Revenge, quite possibly the worst sequel in history.
I was under the impression that Freddy was out for revenge in the first film, and was just plain murderizing people for no reason in this one.
**I don't know where to begin with this horrid harpy of a sequel that started a trend for the horror movie genre.How about the very idea of this film freddy is defeated in the first but in this time frame, new line was desperate for money and it shows.they thought why not make a sequel to the awesome movie we put out in 84.WE can make a completely illogical plot, stupid characters,the worst sequel in the franchise,bad acting from all the actors other then Robert Englund.This movie is probably best known for having the highest body count in the series.Usually that is a good thing in the original the deaths were unique and stylise.In this one they are just unoriginal in the first freddy would like write a cool message in you in this one you just get stabbed, or even worse that very brokeback scene with freddy in the shower whipping some dude.The plot sucks freddies trying to get reborn into the world by a whinny little kid, and only his neighbours love can save him?And it's got all kinds of bad special effects Wes Craven was probably ashamed of like that exploding bird,weird dog face things,the freddy coming through the kid seen,a better villain for this movie would have been that stupid school bus.It's got an unclimactic show off in the boiler room which set up part 3 which is a great movie.In conclusion if you buy the box set throw this out and part 5,6, and with 4 I don't care .Just stick with 1 3 and 7.
A Nightmare On Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge begins with the Walsh Family, who has just moved into the old Thompson house, where Freddy Kruger did his dirty deeds in the first film.
The first flaw, and it is a big one, is the main character.
This movie breaks a lot of the rules of the first film, to the point where it would be hard to watch them back-to-back.
Definitely worth watching, just don't expect it to be near as good as the first Nightmare movie.
Its not as good as the first but most movies aren't.
The acting is decent and the plot is good, but where this shines is the fact that its so unpredictable and the idea that freddy is inside jessie confused me at first but then grew on me and i became to feel sorry for the poor kid.
There's less suspense than the first one, its almost non existent but still this is a godd movie, if you wanna see a bad movie watch Mortal Kombat Annihilation, that was bad!
The first movie was INCREDIBLE, probably the best in the series because it didn't need special effects or anything high-tech it just was naturally frightening.
Throughout the film you feel that it is just a mixture of plot lines just thrown together in the editing room without a thought to a normal narrative such as the first film.
The film is hard to follow and strays heavily from the first film which is not the way a sequel should go but then again we are talking about the horror genre here.
The acting is poor and you really feel that Mark Patton was badly miscast in some way or another and i really never bought his whole descent in to Freddy's clutches which i did in the first film.
The writing too is just mind boggling in terms of how the guy even managed to get his trash on the screen in the first place, the dialogue is cheap and cheesy which is what we expect in the horror genre but just not to this bad extent.
The first of the "Freddy" films I actually saw was part 3, which is still the best in my opinion.
At least in the first movie Nancy was all down for trying to do something about Freddy killing everyone around her.
My next target is the first movie, which I still haven't seen.
The movie takes place five years after the events of the first film.
None of the cast from the first film return.
It was obvious right from the start that none of the several sequels would ever live up to the original and this first attempt immediately confirms so.
At least in this first sequel, Robert Englund doesn't constantly fire off unfunny and embarrassing one-liners.
The first sequel of a film like this A Nightmare on Elm Street is probably the most difficult task, especially if you change directors.
It has to be in the line of the first film and yet change a few things to make it nothing but a repeat.
Both are victimized by the gay sports teacher on the football field a couple of times and in the end the boy, Jesse, will come to ask for help from his friend, Grady, and the first reaction will be nearly openly gay even if denied in some side remark, and Freddy will kill Grady through, from inside the body of Jesse : if that is not a repressed homosexual desire, what is ?
He is an old pedophile and after having recaptured some existence through the dream of a girl in the first film, and having thus gotten a couple of boys in his bag through the desire of the girl for these boys, now he moves directly to the main target of his desire : he wants to possess a boy from inside, he is a gay pedophile and Jesse, to defend his sanity in this invasion, will have to react against this gayness that is imposed onto him and kill the boys and men Freddy desires.
In no way is this sequel lower and less intense than the first episode.
Then the evaluation of that reference is a question of date to know who used it first and who is a copycat or an imitator, who can anyway also be a developer.
I honestly liked Nightmare On Elm Street 2, i think it was the appropriate sequel to the first one.It had that 80's aspect that for me somehow made it more enjoyable.It was so simple in a way because they were not trying to yet make Freddy Krueger a Dream Master, or a Psycho Dream dude who was psychologically ill and all this is just making the series into a confusing wreck.Here we have a simple plot that tries to explain some stuff, but not to much.I like all the references to the first one, i basically look for that in all sequels, i guess it makes me feel cool to say,"Oh i saw that happen, i actually saw what happened".Ill admit at times it was cheesy, and there were some really unnecessary parts to it, but i liked the film.Overall you might be one of many who hates this movie, but give it a chance if your a fan of the first one or a Freddy fan than you will give this film its props for that.
Aside from the first film this is the only other from the series that I still like.
In this film his remains pretty much as he was in the first.
It reverses the first one - instead of having a teenage girl in jeopardy, we have a bisexual male, and this factor is exploited by Freddy.
When Jesse (Mark Patton) first spies Freddy lurking in the back yard and then the basement being a prime example.
The first Nightmare On Elm Street is one of my favorite horror movies.It had an original plot and was very entertaining.Now this is the first of the many sequels that followed it.Sure its not as good as the first and its the second worst one in the series(in my opinion).But its still an entertaining and good 1980's slasher flick.The cast is different from the first film and neither of the actors or actresses from this film return for any of the sequels.In this film, a family moves into the house that Nancy lived in during the first film.Freddy possesses the teenager who lives in the house and makes him do his killings for him.With the help of his girlfriend, he must stop Freddy.Though the sequels are known for their comedy, this film wasn't meant to be a comedy.Yet there are a few laugh out loud scenes in it.Nightmare On Elm Street 2 is an alright sequel that slasher film fans should enjoy.
Plot = 5 years after the events of the first movie, a new teen and his family move into the same house where the events occurred and before long Jesse starts getting haunted by Freddy but this time Freddy wants something else other than blood.
The first of the Elm Street sequels is a bit different than the other films of the series, but it's not nearly as bad as some critics say.
At first I got the feeling that I had seen all of this before and I hate that.
(spoilers..within)  My first of kukunoor and a great experience.
May be I did miss Ishaan's reactions when I watched the movie for the first time.
3 Walls: 7 out of 10: My first reaction was that Indian prisons are really nice.
This is my first real Bollywood film and since there are no musical numbers or dancing or romance I am under the impression that the film isn't typical.
From the very first frames 3 Deewarein grips you and won't let go.
The first time i heard about the movie , my reaction was i have to see this one.
The first scene when Chandrika (Juhi) meets the 3 convicts was unbelievable .
Check her out in two scenes: The first when she gently threatens the hell out of her abusive husband and the other when she tells Ishaan (Naseer's character) that she may be in love with him.
We don't know if we're seeing the first incident, the second, or the hundredth.
I recently saw this film for the first time since seeing it many years ago.
I know first time seeing it on the screen and it looked to be a huge drama, action-thriller or something in the beginning, and then suddenly the most unexpected thing happens.
I think the first time I saw this movie was when it first made the cable circuit, I think I was seven or eight at the time.
When I first heard of this movie I thought it was goingto be an awesome time-traveling movie with lots off dogfighting featuring WW2 Japanese planes on American jet action!But do I get that?
Forget it because this came first, nor does it submit to cheese/silliness in what could've been a nonsensical premise.
I have enjoyed this movie ever since I first saw it in 1980.
I first saw this movie at a drive-in (remember those?!?!
Watch the first couple of minutes when Sheen is greeted by his employer's lackey and the last minutes when he debarks from the Nimitz.
Being my first time to watch Rhames in a lead role, I was impressed.
I hated it at first and then until i really watched it i fell in love with it.
At first, Joe doesn't like the kids at all, but slowly begins to develop a friendship between them.
At first, Joe sees this as a chore and the kids as nothing but a bunch of losers.
All is so real, so well acted, that the first time you are seeing the movie, you really think all is true.
At first, I was slightly surprised.
I was quite excited to see this movie as it would be the first of the Dogma95 series to play in my town.
He is repulsive at first and gradually he grows on you as you realise he is not dangerous.
Arguably the best of the films adhering to the Dogma 95 Manifesto, and the first to be shot on film rather than video, MIFUNE'S LAST SONG is a genuinely enjoyable film.
I can assure you that you'll have to get used to the way of filming at first.
They all shine because of the writing, first and foremost, and because of the Dogma rules, second.
One can immediately understand that the director Soren K. Jacobson was excited and felt the artist, allowing himself the opportunity to touch base with why we make films in the first place, art.
I think it's a first film and if so, it's pretty impressive.
I saw in IMDb that this is the first feature of the unknown director Martin Murphy, and I really expect to see his next works.
I must admit that, at first, I found lost things to be quite ridiculous.
I don't know if you have seen Bodysnatchers -another Australian film- but this one's first 20 minutes will make you forget about this country's good examples.
The first time I watched this haunting Australian Indie flick it just happened to be an accident.
When the first clues were given I thought: "well, I've seen this beforeÂ it's another "scary movie" with a predictable endÂ" And in a certain way it is, because the main topic of the plot it's very predictable and the viewer who pays a little attention to some details soon will understand that something strange happened in the past with these guysÂ But when the plot is being reveled, it doesn't give you all the complete answersÂ There are some little details that remain unclear even after the movie ends, and I appreciate this I must say!
At first I only kept watching because there was nothing else on, and it looked a little slow for my tastes.
Anyway.......LOST THINGS seems like a first feature by a new Australian film maker who just might go on to better things.
This one does, first go.
Viewers might be readily assisted by first seeing classics like THE INNOCENTS and DEAD OF NIGHT to get a sense of the eerie outdoor chills this neat low budget thriller has to offer.
At first sight, "Lost Things" appears to be just another Hollywood-wannabe horror film with Australian accents, but there is more here than first meets the eye.
But the last season can't wipe away what this show did in the first ones.
Simon's character may have been changed from a plump prostitute to a petite laundress (this was the 1940s, after all), but the first half, based on the story that inspired Stagecoach, is still a remarkably effective adaptation that segues comfortably into the second story, linking them both by a battle of wills with the titular bored Prussian officer who wants the population to submit to his whims purely as a mark of obsequiousness.
I watched Two-Lane Blacktop last night for the first time and all I can say is "Wow".
The first time I did see it was back in the 80s and it still holds that special ingredient to make me come back for more.
The first time I saw this movie was at an "art house" kind of theater, and I literally thought the projector had broken, so abrupt was the ending.
The first to get to Washington D.C. wins the other's car.
The first rock song about racing, Chuck Berry's "Maybelline," is also heard at one point.
The existential humor is easy to miss on the first viewing.
While this Genre is alluring and enticing, this film really takes the cats pajamas and rams them head first into a brick wall (along with anyone who actually has the nerve or Sherlock Homes ability to find it!)
People don't realize this is the first all digital shot Hi def film ever.My overtly mysterious and sexually taut appearance as the lead hit man is paid off with a stunt I did myself for this one, my violent death sequence from street to cafÃ©.
Nor does it really matter that this was the first film shot with the HD cameras that would be used in films like Sin City.
Amazing, I must have seen it in repeats - but I thought I saw it in first run.
Within the first 30 minutes they could have shown her with a brother and cut out most of the rest of the family that was at the Sader dinner.
The whole part when she first went back in time was completely different...the only part that was right was that Fayge(Leah) and Shmule were getting married.
Upon this realization, Kevin learns that her presence is unneeded despite being amiably tolerated (at best) by everyone else, especially Esther, who spends much of the first half of the film using Kevin as her pawn to convince David to get over Gillian.
Finally, there's Gillian who appears as an apparition just to remind us of how un-over her David really is and that "Rachel comes first,".
Further (and most predictable) resolution occurs during the final 10 minutes when David decides to get over Gillian, move in the Paul and Esther, and start putting Rachel first.
At first, one may think this to be the usual run-of-the mill feel good movie; against foster parents, depicting the dysfunctional family in America.
This was one of the first films we watched, and it was so amazing.
I watched "Down with Love" first and that was a really good movie.
When I watched it the first time, I had to stop it and come back to it later in the day because it was so intense.
The first time I saw Kristen Bell was in the Emmy winning TV-show The Shield.
I first saw this movie on the Lifetime Television network after hearing some good reviews and seeing previews.
I have to add as a Canadian (one who recently immigrated here from the US) that I can never live down, or understand, the need for films like this one, shot in Victoria, BC has to be set in America- one of the first scenes shows a USPS letter box and one Russian cat maligns "these American" security systems.
Unless this is the first movie you've ever seen -- you'd find more entertainment value chewing an old dog bone than you would from watching this coughed up furball they laughingly call a comedy.
Then, a few years later, when technology's improved and many other movies can do the same thing but make it look more realistic, that first movie will be forgotten if there isn't a great movie behind all the effects.
Saw it again on TV this week it wasn't as funny as the first time and probably would be even less funnier the third time.
Brown reprises her role from the first Halloweentown, with Debbie Reynolds playing her grandmother.
While the plot of both movies is pure fantasy, the second movie adds more characters to the mythology of Halloweentown, and builds on the foundation of the first movie by reviving the villain in a new guise, and shows both the naive nature of the teenage Marnie - and of her vulnerable mother.
Sophie has a much greater role in this movie than the first, and is a real charmer.
The acting was just as good as the first one.
The character development from the first one to the sequel was VERY well done.
I'm really not sure how I wound up watching this one; After all, I despised the first movie.
It was just... different than the first.
I think this is the best movie ever cause when i first saw halloweentown i totally loved it and then when i saw halloweentown 2:Kalabar's Revenge i totally loved it too.
and if you haven't seen the first halloweentown then you probably won't understand halloweentown 2:Kalabar's Revenge.
Brown has really improved since the first one.
In the first one she seemed very one dimensional and didn't show a lot of emotion, in the second and third she has more character and showed better emotion.
It was a very good continuation of what I can understand, even though I've never seen the first one and this was my first time watching the second one.
This movie is also funny and a lot more action than the first one.
Just like the first, this little movie is still just as cute, and remains as a great piece of entertainment for children, even if it is straight-to-TV material.
There's a lot less "scary images" than the first, and a lot more mystery to intrigue your 11-year-old child.
That was really boring and not as special as the first one.
When the first two came to TV, I taped them and had a neighbour copy them onto a few more VCR tapes for other kids I knew.
The costumes, sets and colour are first rate, as is Max Steiner's stately score.
The first minister Robert Douglas is planning a move against the Queen who he sees as his main obstacle for total power in the kingdom.
The biggest problem is director Karlson who was responsible for the inept first Matt Helm film, "The Silencers".
Interestingly for a Matt Helm movie, however, Linka is a rare woman in Matt's orbit who is the recipient, rather than initiator, of the first display of interest.
Office fool Charley at first gets the tricks played on him with mixed humorous results, then he turns the tricks on others only to have them backfire.
One of the best gags is the very first one, when the office boy puts tacks in all the chairs and everyone sits simultaneously --and then jumps up simultaneously.
In what at first at least appears to be a bad rip-off of the SAW movies, which weren't that great to start with, we find four women in the situation of being forced together with no memories and a lot of unpleasantness ahead of them.
This movie is the first one I have ever seen (and believe me, I have seen a lot) to do any sort of justice for the plight of our martyrs.
The first man on the team to lose it is Maxwell McKinder, Zach Gilfrod, who was sent out by Pollack to check out the oil drilling site.
first of all lets look at the bad reviews, well to begin with there are no ghost moose's.
The first of them, a man, strips naked and walks off into the unending snow fields, after muttering about "something out there" and positing some kind of sour gas (hydrogen sulfide) seeping out of the ground.
For the first hour he also does a good job keeping the threat obscured and dealing with our fear of the unknown.
A group of people located at a work station in the artic are the first to bear witness to the end of the world.
With first Wendigo and now this, he should be on everyone's cinematic radar- having demonstrated a unique voice, a refusal to do things the way others do them and delivering two absolute masterpieces in a row.
Director does a cracking job of building up a sense of tension, isolation and paranoia in the first half of the film.
Assuming you've managed to stay awake past the first 45 minutes we have some of the characters going slowly mad while ghostly sheep or something run around on the edge of their vision and random shots of environmental disasters are scattered across the screen.
It's the memory of those far superior movies that make this one watchable at first.
Watch the first half of the movie, turn it off and leave the rest to your imagination...
The Lost Princess is Mr. Pace's first feature length film (he previously directed the short film The Tale of El Gusano)and he has given viewers a work that will keep them on the edges of their seats.
Most people cannot wait to see The Lost Princess again after the first viewing!
I have seen first time student films of better quality and production value than this.
I was more moved by "Gasman" than I was with "Ratcatcher" (her first feature length which is a must see for true film connoisseurs) for this reason.
_Gasman_ moves directly from the first piece of _Short Deaths_, with the distant father and Lynne Ramsay Jr. again taking centre screen.
i watched the film last night for the first time and i was was impressed by it.
The first two-thirds of "The Prisoner of Zenda" establishes the setting, situation, and characters, while the last third of this lavish costumer delivers thrills and chills, especially a swordfight between Colman and Fairbanks.
The Masquerader being the first, is an Englishman come to the mythical Balkan kingdom of Zenda for a little fishing R&R.
Since this is the version I first saw, it's very hard to imagine anyone else in the lead roles, let alone in the smallest bit roles.
Anthony Hopes's classic tale turned into a classic adventure film with Ronald Coleman as the King and his commoner cousin who must masquerade as the king when he's first drugged into unconsciousness so he can't be crowned and later when the king is kidnapped.
I first saw "La Femme Nikita" nearly ten years ago, and it still manages to be my absolute favourite.
He is considered a legendary master today and there are two completely different shots I want you to look for: the first is halfway through the story when Colman and Carroll arrive at the ball and the camera starts with them being announced and coming through a doorway.
When the film was first screened for a preview audience it went over only OK and Selznick realized the beginning was too long and since LOST HORIZON another Colman film made that year had it's beginning taken away to speed up the story, that's what he did to PRISONER OF ZENDA, chop off the prologue and epilogue.
My advice is to try the original first--as overall it's a little bit better.
It may have been the first major novel I read.
This was one of his first productions as an Independent producer, In choosing Anthony Hope's novel, he made a very wise choice.
David Niven (this may have been his first major role) as a younger aide.He showed much promise of things to come.
I like Coleman and Carroll in their leading roles as well as C A. Smith and Niven as the co conspirators   Raymond Massey looks like he is uncomfortable with his lines and would rather be doing Hamlet Nevertheless this is the best version and it still has legs and looks more Gothic than the MGM Vehicle which is saturated in colors and may cause headaches after the first reel  C Pope
The cast is first rate, especially because the male leads-Ronald Colman, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., and David Niven-are so handsome and talented, mainly Doug.
In the 1880s Prince Alexander of Battenberg seemed set to become first Prince or King of Bulgaria.
Several of the main characters from the first novel are killed, and one of them shows a less likable side to his personality than in the first story.
As for Zapt's protÃ©gÃ©, Captain von Tarlenheim, given the camera's fondness for the handsome young star, it will come as no surprise to learn that this role was reputedly David Niven's first acting breakthrough.
I watched this movie for the first time last night and was completely blown away.
Normally it would become boring in the length with all the switching those two between; at first they are toghether, they brake up, they come back together again, they brake up again... but it isn`t boring at all.
At first, we think this is a gentle tale of a lonely little girl.
At first I didn't know what to expect from this film.
If you like Wallace Shawn, sit down for the first half of the film and enjoy a few moments.
My very first reaction when I found out that Angelica Panganiban was to star and given the plot I thought that she was miscast due to her age.
i actually thought the film was far more ambitious than truth or dare and had a depth missing in first documentary.
So now she lives in this big house all by herself (with a strange long-haired cat the girls call Snowball) and when the girls arrive, things at first seem idyllic, but then change as the girls start to meet with odd fates, one by one.
I saw this when i was 10 and i liked the movie.now as a adult i get the more adult humour.the cast list is as big as any all star cast.and most were at the height of there careers.the Stunts are first rate.if this was made now it would be fake cgi,instead of death defying stunt work.
As I recently prepared to watch the film for the first time as an adult, I was a bit concerned that it wouldn't stand up to the high acclaim I had awarded it as a kid...particularly after noting the poor rating it has here on IMDb.
Burt Reynolds, Hal Needham and crew capitalized on the success of the first two Bandit movies, threw in some hot babes along with recognizable stars for a blast of a film.
This was my very first glimpse of Jackie Chan on the big screen, too, as it was for many Americans.
There are two ways to get a huge number of A-list faces on the big screen and where the first is usually a biblical or wartime epic, the other is a grand concept comedy such as Cannonball run.
Hal Needham's picture was the first to use the outtakes in the end credits but sometimes its difficult to distinguish a blooper from the craziness that had gone before.
This movie was about a bunch of people who wanted to race in the Cannonball Run a Race that went from New York to California and the first one to stamp there card wins the prize.
So JJ can think first they go riding in an airplane, landing the in the middle of town in order to get beer.
The first part of The Cannonball movies offers some mindless fun, just like its sequel.A bunch of crazy people participate in the Cannonball run throughout the nation.J.J.
Upon first viewing I laughed out loud, and I still do, so many times I have watched it now!
The Cannonball Run was Fawcett's first major successful film after leaving Charlie's Angels in 1977.
Before "Cannonball Run" they made the first two "Smokey and the Bandit" pictures, and afterwards they made "Stroker Ace" and "Cannonball Run II".
Jackie Chan makes his first appearance in a American movie with this film and both Hal Needham and writer Brock Yates have cameos.
I first saw the American broadcast premiere of the first of the two GITS:SAC series quite by accident, at about halfway through the third episode.
Nominally each of the two TV seasons has its own principal story arc; the first season features the way the world is, the second features someone who would very much like it different.
I first saw the movie and I liked it, not that much, but it was entertaining (I haven't read the manga, so I couldn't enjoy the movie like others did).
The first episodes were pretty good so I continued watching them and... by the time I was half way through, I couldn't stop watching them.
As this was made for television the Major keeps her clothes on far more than in the film, she does however wear a rather revealing costume in the first series.
I watched the entire series 1 and 2 whilst I was supposed to finish my thesis - nagging deadlines, raging teachers and what not could not dissuade me from watching this first, then finish my Master's degree - one has to set priorities!
Both title tracks are sung by Origa, and by Jove, are those song 'hooks': even if you donlt care for anime or watching TV anyhow, these tracks glue you to the screen form the first second you hear them.
Everything you love about the first two films is here with Motoko and the gang facing new threats in a world that's almost a mirror image of our present-day society.
Not too many anime series have that kind of depth and replay value which is why I'm not a huge fan of anime in the first place; this series grew on me and I'll be looking forward to seeing more of this highly engrossing cyberpunk universe that our heroes dwell in for years to come.
The series seems to be more "all in a days work" themed than the cerebral current of the first film.
The first half of the film moves along nicely with warm characters and fairly hot action - but definitely with good taste.
The director Jane Weinstock shows a tight and sensitive direction in her first feature, and I expect to see another work of this promising professional.
The Wrong End of Time is a fantastic instalment in which one of our central protagonists encounters her father in a 1940's naval station - coincidentally where the time barrier stands in 1970's England - and with the first appearance of Commander Traynor - a character so crucial to the overall story.
Passing through, they are spirited at first to World War Two, then to a scientific base at the South Pole in the year 1990, followed by a parallel universe where global warming has turned England into a sub-tropical paradise, and finally to the 1960's.
Memorable moments include Simon and Liz's first encounter with the time barrier ( which makes an eerie buzzing sound ), the naval base overrun by Nazis out to steal a top secret laser, Liz finding her dead father preserved in ice, Dr.Edith Joynton ( Peggy-Thorpe-Bates ) aging to death in mere minutes, the room where people are held in suspended animation while dressed in Elisabethan clothes, the aged Traynor emerging from a secret room to sabotage The Master Plan, and the sight of planets in the night sky ( later copied by the 'Dr.Who' episode 'The Stolen Earth' ).
The animation is first rate and the story line will leave you laughing.
This is the first of the three Gilbert and Sullivan operettas produced by the Australian Essgee company.
Choregoraphy - especially with the police in the second act was first class.
I first saw this show live with the same cast as in the movie (With the exception of the Soprano who played Mabel) in Adelaide, South Australia, for my 16th birthday.
Just saw this for the first time (thank you Sky Arts!)
Toni Lamond, the first woman to ever appear on Australian television, is a very sad, yet funny (!
I first saw this movie about five years after a miserable divorce.
When our heroine goes on her first mission she meets her team.
I liked the first movie.
Having watched the mildly amusing antics of the first Topper movie and vaguely remembering an enjoyment of the Leo G. Carroll television series, I was unprepared for how terrible this episode of the long-running ghost story was.
This Mrs. Topper is not the same actress as stared in the first Topper Movie and is not as good but is adequate.
The first Mrs Topper had a killer voice and comedic timing so weird she could not be duplicated.
I don't think this movie holds up well over time, and it certainly wasn't as good as the first two movies.
The first two movies sparkled, and could stand alone on their own merits, and as part of a series.
Having thoroughly enjoyed the first two Toppers, I expected a laugh riot in this one.
There Ann will be seeing her very ill father for the first time in many years, as she was raised in France.
She did not carry the same personality over from the first film.
Even the humor comes faster than in the first two Topper's.
She was also a topnotch comedienne as she shows in this outing when she somewhat assumes the role played by Constance Bennett in the first two outings.
The man behind them, Roy Seawright, had also been in charge of the special effects for the first two Topper's.
The pair that later directed her in "So Long at the Fair" must have known of "Uncle Silas" when they opened their film with a similar wondrous closeup to our first encounter with her here.
In any case, her first appearance, as depicted with her malignant face peering through a rain lashed window pane, is as startling an entrance as one could hope for.
I first saw "The Shepherd of the Hills" outdoor drama when we visited Branson for the first time, in the late 1970's.
You will fall in Lav with Eklavya as soon as you take your first step out of the theater.
Herbert J. Yates of Republic Pictures must have gotten a tidy sum from Paramount for the use of his number one star for his first technicolor feature film.
Shepherd of the Hills was the first film in which John Wayne worked with director Henry Hathaway.
In fact Hathaway had directed the first outdoor technicolor film in the same Ozark area for Paramount five years earlier in The Trail of the Lonesome Pine.
All of the stars of the movie gave first rate performances in it, and for Wayne it was the first big follow-up to his overnight success in STAGECOACH.
The sequence of chopping off the bells tied to a flying dove's feet is at first seems little cheesy but sometime later helps you understand how unique his talent is.
Two reasons why this movie is a good reason to watch: the first is the visuals.
It had an excellent blend of emotional drama & thriller; the most emotional scene was when Eklavya met Saif Ali Khan for the first time.
first time ever i have liked an Indian movie and i am confused to decide whether which character in the movie was played well.
Watch him interact with Sharmila Tagore in the very first scene and with Jackie subsequently to know the range of this gifted actor.
Remember his first film, a documentary called An Encounter with Faces, was nominated for an Oscar (I don't think many people even know this fact).
Why the director should succumb to pleasing the audiences in the last 5 minutes of the film, when he has defiantly stood against it in first 100 - I just don't understand.
It's always fun making it to the first screening of a new film on the very day it opens.
This time, the film I lined up to watch at its first screening in town is "Eklavya Â The Royal Bodyguard".
But first visit Vegas and work hard enough to earn a 6 figure annual income.
Well if I told you then it would take all the fun out of the movie ;) The musical score in this movie treats you to a John Williams type experience as if you are listening to the Indian Jones theme for the first time.
Betty Field at maybe her best performance at movies pictures; John Wayne at his first film in color after the grandiose The Stagecoach; Harry Carey in the Priest; Beulah Bondi at one of her characteristic works playing an embittered woman; the very used by master John Ford, War Bond.
I was able to guess the ending within the first half hour.
I think the movies might work better if you haven't read the books first.
The first two adaptations (Angels Fall and Montana Sky) were disappointing for someone who read the books.
At first it may seem a bit confusing and blurry but once you get into it, you really get into it.
Marjorie Main seeing for the first time in her life.
And John Wayne moving from bewildered and embittered young man with a curse on him, to a man in love who can't express his feeling because of the curse, and finally coming to terms with his real, inner self for the first time in his life.
It's a real treat to see in the modern times the film as good as "Candyman".When I first saw this movie about six years ago it scared the hell out of me.It's a shame that most of the modern horror movies can't scare me like "Candyman" did.The mysterious killer Candyman is really frightening with his very deep voice that sends chills down your spine(Tony Todd-you are great!
Xander Berkeley, who came to fame recently with a role in the first two series' of 24 rounds off the cast, which is under the direction of Bernard Rose.
This is John Wayne's first color film and my only complaint is that the cinematographer failed to pick up the unique almost purple color of his eyes!
In fact, I have to do an essay on a foreign film and chose to do this one ... problem is - I can't find too much info about it ... but, I feel that this film is great for first-time foreign movie-goers as they seem a bit hesitant at first when faced with watching a foreign movie - especially students ... because of "The Assassin" I feel that the comparison between the 2 movies will help other countries gain a greater understanding for foreign movies... it's a must see!
While it contains plenty of frightening shocks and gore, that is only the suurface level, and the focus for watching it the first time.
After the first time, pay careful attention to the dialogue and the interactions between Helen and the Candyman.
The Candyman is not what he first appears to be.
Forget what the pointless sequels lead you to believe, for in the first movie, as well as the original story "The Forbidden" by Clive Barker, the Candyman is an incarnation of the faith of those who tell stories about him.
So, watch it first for the shocks, but watch it again for the deeper story buried within.
Later Candyman kills her friend Bernadette, and Helen is accused of first degree murder and arrested, while she unsuccessfully tries to prove that Candyman is the real killer.
I was only about six or seven when I first heard the terrifying "Bloody Mary" legend, which was similar to the Candyman legend.
The first scene of the movie presents in a nutshell the experience that the viewer is going to have, an experience so common (regarding urban legends) yet so distant.
The first was the considerably dreary little Italian-made "The Last Man on Earth (1964)" starring the always charismatic Vincent Price.
Heston passed away the day before I sat watching this film for the first time for 25 years.
The Omega Man is the second film version of Richard Matheson'snovel I am Legend, the first being a low budget Vincent Price vehicle.
Whereas the first version was true to the book, Boris Sagal's version is simply loosely based on the novel.
Visually the film is very well made: In the first 9 minutes we just watch Neville driving through LA and as a prime example of showing vs. telling without any dialogue we begin to understand what has happened so that the following flashback really is unnecessary and relatively crude for such a well made and well written film.
this is the second filmed version of Richard Matheson's novel,I am Legend,the first being The Last Man on Earth,starring Vincent price,and the third bearing the same title as the novel and,starring Will Smith.i really enjoyed the first version,and pretty much hated the third version.this version is,much closer to the third version,in terms of my opinion of it.i found a lot of this movie lame,lacking in any real excitement.the acting was pretty poor(though Heston wasn't too bad).i also felt the movie was a bit too talky at times,and there is no real air of mystery to the story.having said that,there was one good thing about it.this one had a plot,(as slow as it was)which i felt the third one didn't.it was just this side of boring,for the most part,occasionally slipping over into the area of boredom.i was able to get through it.but i wouldn't care if i never saw it again.it just really didn't anything for me.my vote for The Omega Man is a 3/10
Being a Charlton Heston fan (as a result of the first two PLANET OF THE APES films), I found myself first in line the Wednesday THE OMEGA MAN opened.
My brothers and I loved this movie the first time we saw it at the drive-in theater in Commack, Long Island, NY.
Keith Cooke (whom I first spotted in "China O'Brien 2", where he stole the show from Cynthia Rothrock and Richard Norton), is an impressive kicker; Gary Daniels is an excellent opponent; and the cast is obviously full of real fighters.
As a child I always liked the music, particularly the "surprise party" theme that plays when the villains make their first appearance.
Well, probably not, but certainly the most influential on my life back in the mid 70s when I first caught it on British television.
This was actually the first movie I've seen where she did not play an obnoxious b*tch, so that was a new experience.
The abundance of man-ass is hilarious, but if you're homophobic, this might at first turn you off, but later we get to see Tina CotÃ©'s nipples, so there's something for both men and women in this movie, cyborgs or not.
The fact that he literally has the screen to himself for the first half hour allows him to do things he never did in his "epic star" mode.
The apocalyptic world that makes the first half so captivating is destroyed by the second half's plot device.
"Omega Man" is discussed in the first scene of indie-film classic "Slacker."
The odd thing was that the first half hour was actually pretty good.
Oh yea, did I mention a bunch of inmates are trapped with a super hot little Latina cop babe with a white tank-top who's having her first day in training at a prison, and they aren't even remotely suggesting raping her or anything other than dragging up her past to suggest she doesn't have what it takes to "command" them or be in charge.
It's Ginny's first night & she's placed in the low security wing where they keep the none violent & mentally unbalance prisoners, a new prisoner named Velku (Vaz Andreas) turns out to be a Romanian shapeshifter who can transform into a huge hairy monster thing.
Shapeshifter is one of those awful horror films where nothing works, it's one of those films where after the first twenty odd minutes you just sit there waiting & hoping it will finish.
Her best dialog and acting came within the first 15 minutes of the movie.
At first I thought it was a horror film about friends and divorces.
For several reasons:the first being the acting and casting.
I think GitS: Innocence did it this way first.
The first half of the movie was light hearted and touches on subjects that we deal with on the surface.
but more in the end when black lets white been taken by the cops its really starts showing the symbolic meaning of them representing yin and yang, the first example i can give is white talking about that both lost most of there screws but he keeping them all.
State of mind, I'll never forget the first time I saw this movie.
i first saw this in 1992 and was amazed how this series captured what can happen in real life.
Found this film quite unbelievable because of the fact that so many men seemed to be attracted to Greer Garson,(Irene Forsyte) first met a very rich man named Soames Forsyte, (Errol Flynn) and Soames falls immediately in love with Irene and he keeps asking Irene to marry him and after many years of trying, Irene decided to say yes to marriage, however, she told him she does not love him.
THAT FORSYTE WOMAN is based on THE FORSYTE SAGA's first novel, THE MAN OF PROPERTY (with a bit of the second novel IN CHANCERY thrown in).
Also, as the 1960s version was going through the first six novels in 26 hour episodes, characters were given a chance to develop.
But, considering what a cold fish Soames is, I could certainly understand her jumping at the first chance for passion.
Garson is Irene, a beautiful but poverty-stricken woman who marries Soames Forsyte (Flynn), admitting from the first that she does not love him.
Hopefully, this will be the first in a series of films.
I watched it for the first time with some friends that knew nothing of Nero Wolfe and we all enjoyed it.
I am so glad they succeeded in merging the first three books into one movies and make it believable that everything takes place after Waterloo.
the french having honour i would never have thought it after the first lot.man singing at the end was so cool it brought so many memoires from the last episode when they were at waterloo.long live sharpe the french couldn't kill neither will any one else.
He first portrayed Richard Sharpe in 1992, unknown in Hollywood, and only a star in England.
The first ten minutes of which, are the best moments in the movie(and no it is never explained how they can fly, leap, fight as they do, so much so it's easy to forget how vulnerable as children they are, which is used to get effect).
and the cast is first rate.
This is of course unavoidable, partly because the cast are all ten years older but also because the first Sharpe film skipped over the Indian books and had Sharpe obtaining his field commission in Spain rather than in India.
We all loved the first night of the 3-day Mini series the lost room.
I really liked it, but I only saw the first & second nights.
The first hour of it was kinda not interesting for me.
Akin to a cyberpunk movie where you can read its multiple layers, Tekkonkinkreet is first and foremost a visual spectacle, hands down, and doesn't fail in providing a Wow factor with its presentation.
If you missed it the first time; don't pass it by a second.
As with so many mini series the first two episodes are better than the 'conclusion' which really only sets possible future episodes up.
I had the benefit of catching a repeat of the first few episodes back to back, and I am hooked beyond belief.
At first, it appears to be an adventure that is random for the sake of being random.
You have to only guess what is coming next, and when it comes, something else is brought into the fold which skews or distorts what you first believed.
Saw this movie in November 2008 for the first time.
"Rags to Riches" the first filly in 100 years to win the "Belmont Stakes" in 2007 is pregnant by "Giants Causeway" the real life colt of "Mariah's Storm" the horse who is the inspiration for "Dreamer".
Truth be told I have always been a fan of Dakota Fanning's films (Asides The Cat In The Hat, bad film) so I was flicking through the T.V channels and saw this and at first I wasn't really bothered about watching it but as I was bogged down by an awful flu I thought "Why not" I really liked it!
I fell in-love with this movie from beginning to end,the first time i watched it i closed my eyes in the beginning when i saw the horse "Sonador" fall,i cried through this whole movie and at the same time,had a wonderful smile on my face..Dakota fanning is just wonderful, all of my favorite actors in this movie, i wish it could have been longer and shown more of "Sonador's" recovery etc,,but the last 10minutes,the last part of the race i could feel the uplifting experience of "Sonador"across the finishing line,a baby could watch this it is just that compatible for families.this movie deserves an academy..so needless to say whenever it comes on,and i have also taped it, i have to watch it again and again.just to see the bad guys in it,if there are such things in this,loose...I fell in-love with the sheik when he spoke to Dakota about her horse winning,i would have loved to have seen them all sitting together tho at the races.the sheik the cranes and the wonderful Spanish horsey handler..it did my heart so good to see the Prince,stand up and acknowledge "Cale" and "sonador" in the winners circle...thanks for letting me express these feelings..god bless to all.
One of the first scenes: A band of street musicians, are setting up their trade now forbidden by the army, in a truck, near the local graveyard in outer-Turkey.
When her plans are foiled, Nikita attempts suicide, but Bob has left the first chamber in his gun empty.
This is the first scene in the movie I actually enjoyed.
Everyone in the theater clapped and cheered when Cale's horse Sonador, crossed the finish line in first place at the Breeder's Cup.
My wife started crying within the first 15 minutes and she didn't stop until we walked out of the theater!!!
I was thinking it might have some connection to the Cannonball Run movies when I first saw it come on, but it doesn't.
Among the race's contestants are David Carradine as stolid, tight-lipped, nerves-of-pure-brass ex-con champ Coy "Cannonball" Buckman, future "Hill Street Blues" regular Veronica Hammel as Buckman's loyal, fretful, karate-chopping police lady gal pal, Archie Hahn as Buckman's trustworthy, but feeble-minded mechanic Zippo, a gloriously crazed Bill McKinney as Buckman's chortling, maniacal, pistol-packing nutso rival Cade Redman (note the disconcertingly similar first and last names, a chilling blurring of the fine line between good and evil), Robert Carradine and the beauteous Belinda Balaski as a sweet, starry-eyed California surfer couple, a hilariously goofy Gerrit Graham as a pathetic no-talent aspiring country-and-western singer/songwriter, Mary Woronov in customary venomous b**chy and aggressive sexually ambiguous full-throttle nasty mode, Stanley Clay as a jive-talking hipster soul bro, and a repellently arrogant James Keach as a stuck-up, condescending German driver who meets a fiery untimely end.
I first heard about on "Entertainment Tonight" ahead of times.
Beynelmilel Amsterdam has a large Turkish population and this was my first Turkish movie of life.
This is the first directoral debut for Muharrem Gulmez.
Just a trivia ÂThere were 9 Turkish ladies who had come to see this movie and I think this was also the first movie of my life when I was the only male in the audience.
It is very odd to hear him speak english...especially when he never really learned it in the first place!
Bronson fans (like me) will note this is the second of his 'samurai connection'westerns...Magnificent Seven being the first...though the debate will probably never be resolved as to which was the better performance.
The first two segments take elements from various Bukowski novels, poems, and stories and makes them blend together.
The first segment of this film is a bit like a "coming of age" story that's probably a bit racier than most of its type, but then it morphs into Harry as a teenager, with hideous acne and wanting to stay away from others because of his horrible complexion.
The central character is Harry Voss, who we first meet as a young kid who is learning about sex from his friend, with the aide of a few loose women.
The third and final chapter sees the once bright young boy as a drunken waster who cuts a stark contrast to the boy we saw in both the first and second chapters of the film.
The first segment is the lightest of the three, but still packs a punch as we watch the subject discovering sex and eventually getting acquainted with his hand.
Rather effective three part tribute to Charles Bukowsi ( even if the first part is based on the semi autobiographical tale by his author of choice, Joe Fante).
Since then I've decided that I'll try to see all his other movies as well and this "Crazy Love" is the first step into the right direction.
The first period is situated in the 1950's, when Harry Vos is still a young kid.
In my opinion this movie was a bit of a slow starter and the first part (the 1950's) didn't always do it for me.
The first act is set in 1955 and follows Harry when he's twelve years old.
He is struck by his first notions of true love when he sees a dream-like film in cinema, only to be helped out of his dream by a more mature friend who claims the only reason people get married is to get laid.
In the first act the film starts of a bit slowly with some awkward moments.
We see his hero, Harry Voss, first as a romantic young boy of 12, then as an acne ridden teenager, lost in unrequited love, and finally as a drink sodden drop out, for whom no act is too dreadful to contemplate...with terrible and yet deeply moving consequences.
Starting with a harrowing depiction of the death of an African American soldier (and friend to Quinn Taylor) in the first Gulf War and all the way until the last bullet is fired, Reflex Action is the action/drama that won't let you rest.
The final point is also a first point of new cycle.
I did not know what to think at first.
The first thing that catches the viewer's attention is that Izo doesn't kill the children.
This seems strange at first because he kills nearly everyone he comes in contact with.
When you first watch Izo, you really wander who's who and what is happening.
Chronologicly, the movie is also hard to get at first.
When he kills his first victim he ask him, are you so brutal because you are human or human because you are brutal?
This confuses me -- though I definitely didn't grasp everything upon the first viewing of this, I was still instantly amazed at what Miike has set up here: A journey through one man's tortured soul.
Nikita Taylor is not a good girl.She's a heroin addict who participates in robbing the pharmacy.It ends up badly and she's the only survivor.She's sentenced for life for shooting a policeman.But one day she finds out Nikita no longer exists and she has to work as an assassin.Things get more complicated when she falls in love with a cashier.Nikita is an action thriller directed by Luc Besson.In 1993 John Badham made an English version called Point of No Return with Bridget Fobda in the lead.In the French version Anne Parillaud does a great job as Nikita.Jean-Hugues Anglade is terrific as her boyfriend Marco.TchÃ©ky Karyo is brilliant as Bob.Jeanne Moreau is wonderful as Amande.Jean Reno is fantastic as Victor the cleaner.We all remember his outstanding performance also as a cleaner in Leon (1994), a Luc Besson masterpiece.The restaurant sequence looks quite awesome.She has to make her first assassination on her birthday.And the job she does with Victor, and he wastes all those bullets on those men and gets shot.I wish Luc Besson could come up with stuff like this some day again.Nikita is a great representative of the action genre.
To be blunt, the production value in the first hour is hideous, but it gets a little better as the film goes on.
"Izo" starts where the first film ended.
But he finds himself alive again, at first not understanding that he has taken on a demonic existence because his soul cannot rest and he must descend through the layers of hell in full consciousness.
Following his motto from the first film, "Divine punishment", he sets out to take revenge on the world and on the gods for getting him into this whole mess.
After owning this film for nearly a year, I finally found the opportunity to watch it without my girlfriend being in the same room with me (She couldn't get past Kazuki Tomokawa's first ballad).
I found the movie a bit confounding at first... but it definitely makes more sense after a second and third viewing.
There will no doubt be differing opinions as to what the characters represent, but you better make up your mind during the first hour of film.
The first of Saura's great dance movies.
When I first saw the film on a visit to Madrid 1986 it blew my mind completely and after 20 years I'm still in love with this wonderful film.
The trilogy by Carlos Saura which consists of Bodas de Sangre, Carmen and El Amor Brujo get 10/10 from me but this film was the first I saw and that's why it's special.
The first girl then decides that she made a mistake so she tries to get back with the boy.
The boy finds himself pulled between his first love and the new girl (because she is cute and good natured).
Even worse, all the digital trickery of the first few episodes completely disappears.
Throw in some complications with the Crown Prince's original love (who spurns him at first, leading to this marriage) as well as the return of the conniving exiled former Crown Princess and Royal Prince and you have courtly battles for power as well as the development of a tangled web of relationships.
For the first 75% of this film, I wasn't particularly interested in the film.
In 1995 when I first encountered this movie I also desperately wanted to believe every last bit of nonsense hurled at the viewer like a face full of compressed cheeze.
Also, the film copies "Freaks" by having the horror elements confined to the last ten minutes or so, only problem is this time around the first seventy aren't even remotely compelling.
This script acknowledges the first only.
How do you do a work so incredible on your first work?
I first saw this movie late at night on TBS.
The acting responses he gave were great and at first I thought he couldn't speak English cause he doesen't say a word till he goes to the diner for coffee, waiting for the telephone.
It's based on a true story that is about a missionary who has to go to Tonga for 3years to preach the gospel.Tonga is a small Island and first he experiences a huge shock of culture.
According to his church elders he must first finish his missionary role before he can marry his true love.
It's interesting though that it sheds light on the Mormon doctrine, rites and such, as well as the inner church bureaucracy.It is a very good effort, starting a bit shy, not saying anything about the religious aspect, then less and less shy until it really becomes very enlightening on these matters.This is not my first Mormon film, I saw another one, more interesting, "The princess and the Marine", about an Arabian princess being saved by a Mormon GI-Joe from her native country.I liked it very much.
For those who are familiar with LDS missions, this should be no problem, but for those viewers who have not been exposed to the process of a Mormon mission, the first 15 or 20 minutes may seem a bit confusing.
My father is Tongan and my mother is Samoan (the first island Elder Groberg landed at the beginning of his journey).
The scene of the first funeral brought back memories for me as it illustrated exactly how these kind people handle the departing of a loved one.
Between the years 1933 and 1945 one man changed our world because he believed in something that seemed stupid at first.
Since the first time I laid my eyes on the cover of Penguin version's "Maurice", I grew obsessed with those nostalgic black & white and autochrome photographs, which this documentary contains a lot.
They may just bury the memories, but they shouldn't regret --- judging from their facial expression while they were recalling their love at first sights and my imagination of a certain hilarious party in a certain club on a certain street in the night of the 1920's Berlin of chaos and liberation.
However, a previous comment incorrectly stated that this was the first film on this subject in 67 years.
When I first found this film at my local video store I thought it must have been a retitled version of one of the Lenzi or Deodato cannibal films as I had never heard of it before.
Stopping first with a tribe that has had contact with the modern world, they then move on to find an undiscovered group.
It also marked the first of Howard's associations with Tom Hanks.
But we have to take in mind that this was not a serious romance and it was the first of many romantic comedies that would gradually take over film.
The very first girl I fell in love with looked vaguely like her, back 22 years ago.
If you were a kid like I was when this film first came out.
This was an early film in the career of Tom Hanks, one of his first successful movies.
From Tom's latest foray into dramatic excellence (Captain Miller) to his first big smash, er "Splash".
ps2:This is the first time I see Eugene Levy in the role of the bad guy.
but i will say that Lucy's plots were not exactly original either, and being that both shows were on at the same time, it's difficult to say who came first (if it even matters).
the thing is everyone has seen Lucy for years and just assumes she did it all first.
But Lucy was there first and got the deserved credit.
The first names of these characters were switched for the film).
So then he was "Gator" Mark Anthony , which are his birth first and middle names.
It was clearly Gator's reckless regard for his own well being that put him in the limelight in the first place.
At first I was sad and really felt the depression when sweet little Porky's heart is broken.
He walks off her front porch only to first turn around and kiss a plate with her name written on it that is displayed by her front door.
Here in his first movie the flow is at the forefront, in later movies it achieves a balance with the plot, finally taking second place in his later works.
This is Peter Weir's first feature film and a fantastic comment on small town culture in Australia.
This is an Aussie black comedy from the 70's and its also one of Peter Weirs first films.
Terry Camilleri's performance is very good for his first acting experience!
But unlike the main contenders of that ilk such as Rocky Horror, you can't tell from the first fifteen minutes which camp you are going to fall into.
Weir's first film is hardly a milestone in the history of cinema.
Peter Weir's first feature is a kooky, low-budgeted flick that I saw quite awhile back, but I did not remember too much about it, other than the devilishly looking sliver Volkswagen covered with spikes.
The first fifteen minutes immediately kicks into overdrive with everything happening at once.
Peter Weir's first film and, looking back to when I originally saw this on general release, this could be described as my first exploitation movie.
The mayor who at first seems protective and halfway decent turns out to be the 'fascist' for whom this whole enterprise is run.
After first watching this movie, I wasn't too impressed.
It features strong performances from Michael and Mark Polish as the Falls brothers (Michael also directed, and the brothers together wrote the screenplay) and a marvellous performance by Michele Hicks, in her first major role, as Penny.
He does a great job in this role, that I think is one of his first.
This film was on my mind for days and I think it was the first thing I brought up in conversations.
This also was the first film I saw Benicio del Torro in...and I think he is fabulous!
This film is still haunting me, even long after watching it for the first time.
Not like being underwater or anything like that but more like kissing the love of your life or holding your own child in your arms for the first time.
The Polish brothers have created something truly remarkable here, and Michele Hicks, in her first film performance, is amazingly stunning and talented.
Call me prejudiced, which I am (and thank goodness, this wonderful film cured me of some of those symptoms), but at first, the idea of watching a movie about a girl and a pair of Siamese twins was not that appealing.
Both of Wynorski's sequels are completely unrelated to the first Sorority House Massacre, rendering that film obsolete for either understanding the inconsequential plot or enjoying the scatterbrained characters and their extremely toned bodies.
Even the first fight scene with Orville is choreographed in an identical fashion (the knife to the guts is in the same place, as is the strangulation by handy extension cord).
The same girl manages to take a shower first again (Melissa Moore), her spontaneous undressing moderated by remarkably silly saxophone riffs.
if you want to see plenty of hot chicks showering Goofy violence and the overall awesomeness of Orville check this movie out i first saw it on USA network years ago and have been wanting more Orville ever since Check it out!!
It may be the best of the trilogy, downplaying the derivative slasher element that defined the first two films and instead taking an exuberant action-horror-comedy slant (the title, in case it wasn't obvious, is an obvious spoof of Die Hard).
When I was five, I first saw the documentary "Bugs Bunny Superstar" and my parents made me a tape of it; unfortunately, we accidentally taped over the end.
I thought at first it was funny, hilarious, and enthralling.
I first thought she really wanted the money.
I am 34 years old and I watched this movie for the first time today with my two boys.
It was the first movie in years to actually get my eyes cloudy and all the other things a grown man "shouldn't feel".
I just saw this movie for the first time on cable and absolutely loved it!
Hallie Kate Eisenberg is just as adorable as always and does a wonderful job in her first movie part.
Even if you're a little skeptical at first, try it out.
2008 update: We recently watched it again, and it was almost as fresh as the first viewing.
Andrew first asks to be made to look like a human, so is given a human-looking covering, which then has him looking like Robin Williams.
Seeing Robin Williams in a robotic role such as this,gave a point of view on the world even though he did not realize it in the first place.
When I first saw it a few years back I admit that I didn't like it much, it seemed rather stupid to think that a robot could 'become' human, but on viewing it again years later, I can safely say that I missed the whole point of this film.
This film shows Andrew's aim to become human, and follows his life from when he first became the 'machine' of the Martin family, to when he finally fell in love with their youngest daughters grand child, and becomes human to die beside her on their death beds.
Robin Williams gives his usual first rate performance, along with Sam Neil and Embeth Davidtz.
I saw it for the first time in ages today and its still as touching as the first time I saw it a few years ago.
In fact I remember it being shown on a plane I was on the year it came out and I watched the first 5 minutes on a screen with poor picture and sound and remember thinking it was just cheesy family comedy which just plays for humor and nothing else.
When I first saw it a few years later when there was nothing else on I was completely blown away by it.
Embeth Davidtz as his leading lady matches his skills at every turn, and Sam Neill turns in one his best performances as the man who first recognized the irreplaceable uniqueness of his mistuned android.
Bicentennial Man is first rate science fiction Â without physical conflict, without wars, without new ways to incinerate each other.
At first "Bicentennial Man" looks to be about a futuristic family who buys an android robot that is supposed to do housework and serve them.
Farrah Fawcett was the first to jump ship.
I was 7 when Charlie's Angels first aired, little did I think that 30 years later, I would still be talking about the Angels.
Parillaud doesn't have much dialogue in the first act.
Perhaps it is due to her lack of dialogue that I find the first half of the picture far superior to the second half.
In the opening sequence of the first season no one knew where the Angels went to the police academy.
After only 23 episodes, Farrah left the show at the end of the first season.
To help give it an added boost, the Angels were sent to Hawaii for the first six episodes.
The first season was by far the best.
I am enormously devoted to this show, which was inarguably a lot of fun for its first two seasons.
Bolstered by Jill's kid sister, Kris (Cheryl Ladd) and then others, Charlie's Angels never again climbed to the heights of sheer madness of its first season.
The Swede (Franco Nero) agrees to sell guns to guerrilla general Gen. Mongo but first they have to break into a safe in order for him to get paid and only the professor (Fernando Rey) knows the combination.
I can still remember the first time I saw it as a child in a summer time cinema in my town and not only it left a mark in my subconsciousness about the kind of films I was watching at that time, but the music never left my memory and easily comes back without me ask for it.
The first third of the film is perhaps a little slow and episodic, but does successfully reveal the characters of Peterson and Vasco to the viewer (with fantastic character play by Nero and Milian respectively).
What I couldn't really follow was the point of the first five minutes of the movie.
As for Stanwyck according to a biography about her, she was involved with Capra because of her abusive and jealous first husband Frank Fay who literally terrorized her on the set of his film.
Lulu alone and almost homeless has Bob's baby, Roberta, whom she at first refuses to see in the maternity ward because the child reminds her of him.
Now, there's some things in this film that seem a little nonsensical or odd to me - Lulu is first seen as a sort of librarian/spinster type - but quickly changes into a smartly dressed, attractive lady when she leaves on her trip, and never changes back (the original plot element abandoned).
The wife, described as an "invalid" who Menjou is forced to stay with and care for, is first introduced using a cane (just barely) - but she is at all times seen as completely strong and capable (hardly an invalid).
The first two shots (mid chest height) surely kill this man, the fact that Lulu goes ahead and empties the pistol into him to requisite clicks on empty chambers with that look of utter contempt only Stanwyck could display exposes the wounded Lulu in bitter truth.
Their first meeting at a cruise to Havana, with Menjou so drunk that he ends in a wrong cabin (number 66 instead of 99) where Stanwyck, bored and happy to encounter somebody, is one of many moments where Capra's talent is evident.
The first, and one of the funniest, comedies I've ever seen.
So perhaps with some imagination you can call this movie the first ever made spoof and it certainly is the first ever done comical subject at the Thomas Edison's Black Maria Studios.
I saw this movie at the theatre and everyone (about 25 people) walked out within the first half hour.
Being too coy and the satire fails as a justification for the subject of the satire in the first place.
If the characters were important enough to recap at the end, then they were important enough to explain in the first place.
Seemingly as time has passed and the situation has evolved to crazier proportions, XB and Garvey have resorted to more drastic tactics in order to "get their attention first."
Nice photography, a plot that has a good rhythm and tempo, engaging characters that are well acted and clever film devices (for one, the conflict regarding her smoking that set up the plot complication in the first place).
Jean Delannoy stands as one of the best (if not simply the best)Simenon adapters.In the short space of two years he made two gems ,while the nouvelle vague was insulting him ,and these two gems should not be missed:"Maigret tend un piÃ¨ge" and "Maigret et l'affaire Saint-Fiacre" (1959),both absorbing,both featuring a top-notch cast,both packing a real wallop.The first one is an urban psychological thriller,the second one takes place in the country,in the castle of old aristocrats.
"Maigret tend un piÃ¨ge" is at first sight a serial killer story ,but Simenon is too subtle a writer to be content with that.And I'm sure that Jean Delannoy had seen Julien Duvivier's sensational film noir "voici le temps des assassins "(1956):not only he casts Jean Gabin as Maigret,Gabin who was the hero of Duvivier's movie,but he also uses Lucienne Bogaert ,who was his ex-wife in the same movie.Bogaert portrayed a drug addict abominable criminal in 1956;in Delannoy's film,she is an over possessive mother,proud of his son who could have been a sculptor,a painter,an artist,a genius,had they not thwarted his outstanding gifts.
They've been making porn for so long that the idea of a straight boy in prison falling head over heels in love with the first guy he meets makes sense.
GEFANGEN (LOCKED UP) is a testy little German film that dares to push the envelope of NR rating, and given the concept of the story and the background of the writer/director JÃ¶rg Andreas making his first legitimate (ie non-porn) movie, it succeeds despite some technical shortcomings.
The setting is a prison somewhere in Germany and the story begins with the handcuffed young credit card fraud 'criminal' Dennis (Marcel Schlutt) encountering his first entry into a prison.
The first order of social control is usually the family.
asks one doubting thomas who worked with Robbie, the original, one-and-only first wife.
For some reason, when this film was first shown, there were segments which portrayed the poisoning of Marie's mother- and that she initially lived in a trailer.
One's first inclination as to what the title character's choice shall be proves to be a disquieting revelation of what little we've experienced in our lives.
Someone once saw it for the first time, and commented, "I didn't think I would like it, especially because it was such a downer at times.
At first the atmosphere is relatively light, one of love, friendship and fun.
During the first half the action can be too slow, and Stingo, as played by Peter MacNichol, seems a fairly weak figure.
... Let's get the basics out of the way, first.
I suppose the tension bubbling under the surface does provide a comedic highlight; as Marco lies dreamily on the bed and coos to his supposedly 'docile' mate that he didn't know what he'd come across when he first met her - cut to our heroine assembling a gun in the bathroom...
The first part of the film shows the west and the war with the Indians with excellent battle scenes and great color.
I first saw this film a few years ago.
The first time I saw "In the Company of Men" on 08 April 2000, I was really disturbed with this movie, which has been recently elected the number 28 in the ranking of the best fifty independent movies promoted by a cinema magazine.
Neil LaBute has given us his first in a very long line of challenging, yet beautiful, cinema.
The first man is named Chad (played by Aaron Eckhart).
When I first heard about this movie my main motivation for seeing it was related to the controversy that surrounded it.
On the surface, the film, expertly written by Neil Labute in his first feature effort, seems to be a cruel tale of misogyny.
The first climax makes the movie a success, the second makes the film great--only then do we see Labute's true intent.
A few months ago, I saw "Strange Fruit" for the first time.
It was a sorry excuse for cinema with no surprises and no excuse to be made in the first place.
I liked the premise of making fun of reality shows but in turn, the movie gave us less cinema and drama than most reality shows in the first place.
Sanoe Lake makes her first on screen appearance since "Blue Crush", though one might wonder why she bothered, as she gets nothing to do.
I did not expect much of this movie at first knowing it wasn't john woo who directed it, but after just the first 5 min i was totally into the movie and had forgotten who directed the movie, because it was equally great, and i couldn't ask for more  get this movie!
One of the funniest things was something I didn't even notice the first three times I saw it...What you ask?
sorry- but this is my story:   When I first saw this ground-breaking film- truly outstanding among the early documentaries- (possibly the first depiction) of: lesbian (hidden) history & culture, I enjoyed it immensely, but I had difficulty understanding any speech in the film, because I am deaf- I rely on captions!
Shohei Imamura, the film's cunning, subtle, and seemingly offbeat director, fashions the opening murder with what is in the first nanosecond of reaction aggravating and promptly recognized as a brilliant little effect.
Aside from that, why did all the actors in the first few minutes of the film look like low budget 70's porn stars?
If only they had killed off the two garbage characters early in the story, or just not had them in the first place, I can see a potentially good movie there.
Why they would do this is never explained, but I guess every movie has to have a bad guy, and the Chinese were in the news in 1972 with Nixon visiting them for the first time.
The first part is a genuine attempt at a low budget science fiction narrative with a message (albeit derived & unoriginal) in the nature of Ikarie XB1.
All right, first thing I have to get off my chest is that I don't understand exactly what the Chinese are supposed to get out of destroying the entire Earth with their doomsday machine.
But I'll give it a 3, for the sake of the first segment, which, if the movie had continued as strongly, would have been made it a decent flick.
The first atrocity made by director Prince, whom should know better, was casting Elizabeth Taylor in the part originated by Glynnis Johns.
(It didn't help, of course, that A Little Night Music was his first film.)
I remember when I first saw this in a movie theater.
Starring the ever great Jason Robards as Howard Hughes, this little gem was one of Jonathon Demme's first films, and one of his best.
Mary Steenburgen is also perfect in what must have been one of her first films.
I saw this film back in 1980/81 when it was first released and liked it a lot then.
Mary Steenburgen won a Supporting Oscar as Dummar's first wife, a dreamer like Melvin who is far less satisfied with struggling and who just wants to amount to something (but to Melvin, the struggles are the best part).
Mary Steenburgen won as Oscar as Melvin's kooky first wife.
This work, directed horrendously by Leo McCarey, was a sorry thing when it was first released during the McCarthy-Witch Hunt period.
Not true: This movie is a disaster from the first scene.
My first biggest complaint was with Helen Hayes.
The third, dark-haired child, however (Robert Walker), never tossed a pigskin in his life (the first clue), but in compensation boasts `more degrees than a thermometer.'
But on the surface, Walker's derelictions are not any liaisons he may pursue in Rock Creek Park after midnight but his abandonment first of his faith then of patriotism.
I've been forced to watch this so many times that I know it inside and out, and I've hated it from the very first time I saw it!
But I remember when I first viewed this really peculiar glop, at the tender age of about 10, only a year or two after it had premiered, I was unimpressed even then.
I saw L'il Abner for the first time in over 30 years and to me it's an outstanding movie musical based on the Broadway show and Al Capp's comic strip.
I first knew about this (apart from Leslie Halliwellâs Film Guide) via its poster in a bulky scrapbook of my fatherâs containing adverts from the time such films were released in Malta.
Daisy mae was one of my first screen sweethearts.
I first saw this movie when it came out and thought it marvelous.
Yogi Bear was first a segment on The Huckleberry Hound Show and then Yogi got promoted to his own show and Hokey Wolf took Yogi's place on The Huckleberry Hound Show.
I remember that before Snagglepuss got his own show he first guest starred on some other Hanna-Barbera cartoons like Quick Draw McGraw and Snooper and Blabber.
As I missed the first few minutes of the film, I have no way of knowing this - but if no rape is involved, this would be a major plot flaw.
Lesser-known (and under-appreciated) Flynn shines as her character offers first romance, then rock-solid strength to Jody as well as light touches of humor throughout the film.
This is, for the first half, a great relationship movie if you can ever catch it on cable or some other medium.
Valerie Bertinelli is surprisingly good as a woman who falls in love with another woman, for the first time, and doesn't have the usual stereotypical reaction to it--freaking out.
I've just finished seeing this movie for the first time on TV.
The first thing the viewer encounters in this bizarre tale of family loyalty and love lost, is the grim cityscape of the anonymous city where everything happens.
This was one of my first "Disney Midquel" experiences, the very first being the Fox and the Hound 2.
The thing about the first 'Bambi' was that there was very little dialogue, letting the drama (or humour or whatever) in the animation speak for itself.
And finally, the fact that 'Bambi II' is set _during_ the first film doesn't do anything to help the drama, as we know that Bambi must survive any danger he faces, which is more than a little cheapening.
And hey, toddlers will probably pay attention to this one much longer than the first.
In the sequel, there are five or six funny bits in the first fifteen minutes alone.
When I first set out to try and use film to help me with learning French, it was a completely uncharted territory except for one title I had heard of previously: La Femme Nikita.
"Bambi II" is about the long unexplored gap of the first "Bambi", covering the events between his mother's death and his growing up to adulthood.
Fortunately, Bambi will find some support from his friends, Thumper (Brendon Baerg) and Flower (Nicky Jones), but he'll also have to meet his soon-to-be rival, the mean deer Ronno (Anthony Ghannam), for the first time.
Brian Pimental (one of the writers of the 90s classics "Beauty and the Beast" and "Aladdin") takes his first chance as director giving life to this story and he doesn't disappoint.
Most of the current direct-to-video sequels by Disney have distinguish themselves for a considerably lower quality in the art department, but "Bambi II" is truly an exception, as it seems that the animators really tried to stay true to the first film's style (although of course, there were some modernizations), as even some backgrounds were reused to keep the same art direction.
Without modern slang or self-referential phrases, the cast gives an effective (and welcomed) sense of continuity between this film and the first "Bambi".
The use of a couple of pop ballads may prove damaging on the long road, as while the songs are really good, they take away that atemporal characteristic the first film had and will definitely make the movie outdated a lot sooner than expected.
The sequel answered the questions I didn't know to ask as a kid about the first movie.
The Last of Mrs. Cheyney was first presented on Broadway as a play by Frederick Lonsdale in the 1925-1926 season and it ran 385 performances with Ina Claire in the lead.
We find her first working her wiles on shipboard with Frank Morgan, playing the usual befuddled Frank Morgan part.
The animation is superb, and you can tell there was a huge amount of effort into making the scenery as great as the first one.
This sequel returns all the original characters from the first one and they all play off each other nicely.
However, although "Bambi 2" is quite better and more "logical" than most Disney sequels, it suffers from the same "syndrome" of the rest of Disney sequels: it doesn't fit well on the first one's story.
I'm sure everyone can remember the first time they saw Bambi, I'm also sure that most of you have cried while watching Bambi, it's one of Disney's most touching films.
Disney didn't try to use all the same old jokes and funny lines from the first movie.
I'm an 18 year old guy, and I watched Bambi for the first time when I was 3 years old and I still remember how sad I felt when his mom died.
I would definitely advice others to get this movie, even if you have not seen the first one.
lol) Even if it is very child like in manor, I felt just as touched by it as I was by the first one.
When I first saw that they were making a new Bambi movie, I was really torn.
That was one of the most wonderful things about the first movie ...even more than sixty years after it's release, the songs were so well written that they sound just as good now as they did then.
It is pretty racy for a movie first shown on TV and not in theaters.
Hell, look how rough Stanley Kubrick's first two features were.
When I first heard of this film sometime around 1986 I was employed as a plumber, so I of course I had to see it.
Crawford is a sophisticated and glamorous woman we first meet on board ship as she's maneuvering and flirting her way into the company of a society crowd.
I believe this is the best war drama around concerning WWII naval action--and was the first major sea battle of WWII.
As it is not one of the more wider known parts of World War Two, it makes the first half tense and exciting.
In the first weeks of the Second World War, German crack pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee, captained by Hans Langsdorff, inflicts heavy damage on British merchant shipping.
This meticulous film re-enacts the first major sea battle of World War II, the dramatic engagement between the German pocket battleship "Graf Spee" and three smaller British cruisers off the coast of South America, and it's equally dramatic aftermath.
His relentless hyperbole jars with the steadfast British understatement that dominated the first half of the action.
He's right, and the first part of the movie is a brutal sea battle between the Graf Spee, which has 11-inch guns and hits harder, farther and faster than anything the British have, and HMS Exeter, HMNZS Achilles and HMS Ajax.
After first working to insure Langsdorff is given no more time to affect repairs, the British realize that there is a chance that at least one British ship, a heavy cruiser, could arrive in time for battle.
It has a first rate cast led by Crawford (who was capable of comedy but opted for dramatic intense roles like Mildred Pierce).
Vinnie Jones does end up getting a bit more coverage than it first looks like he will, but he's still missing for quite a bit of it and certainly doesn't feel like the main player in it all.
Well first off, I would just like to say that Vinny Jones does not deserve all of the harsh comments directed at this film (well let's face it he's not the sharpest tool in the box is he?
This was my very first and last reactions to this flop of a production.
We've got the ugly American and her driver, a despicable b---h she is, an idiot he; the pretty American and her pal, nothing more than kill fodder; the egghead archaeologist and college student, first she hates, him then she loves him, then she accidentally stabs him with a sharp stick; last we have the hunter, a character who's motives are pretty much a mystery, a one-dimensional cardboard cutout played by Vinnie Jones.
How should i say it ?......if u survive the first minutes of the film ,which for a movie start are horrible, then u would waste 90 minutes of your life.
The first season was truly the best, but I will admit when the show changed its title to Lobo and the characters moved to Atlanta Georgia to be country cops in the big city, that sucked, but I still watched them.
(This is akin to watching Wiley Coyote purchasing Acme products to catch Roadrunner- LOL) In the first season Lobo and the usual gang of crooked outlying county Sheriffs were kings in the fiefdoms of their counties.
And the first season theme song -- sung by Frankie Laine -- was fantastic.
The film was screened alongside another South Korean film, a magnificent one, Oldboy, at Cannes, marking the first time that two films from the country were in the competition simultaneously.
It's also the first film to unite Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi.
In the face of all of this, the awful truth alluded to in the first over-voice is - omigod - an abortion when the leading lady was twelve years old.
Both Karloff and Lugosi were old enough to have vivid memories of the first world war, and Lugosi in particular shows a dramatic range that would surprise most 1931 "Dracula" fans.
I first learned of her from this movie, and am very glad I did.
Some of the directors do use the benefit of 100 years of hindsight to expand upon those first films.
The first, and arguably in terms of their dual performances, best teaming of Horror legends Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi is this almost bizarre Edgar G. Ulmer directed piece.
This film was made to celebrate one-hundred years of the first camera used by the Lumiere Brothers.
The reason he gives at first is that he doesn't want married couple put in danger but even when they are he just plays along.
And again back to the acting: look at how Bela reacts to the cat or how is servant looks when he first falls.
To back this up, we see the first man she saw having sex, the student Frank, reflected endlessly in a mirrored bathroom after his bout with his insatiable companion, the sexually voracious student Sue.
This time, instead of seeing that Fry's coming to the future was not entirely as it appeared in the first episode, ("The Why of Fry" season 4) we get to see another aspect of his life that was left behind--his faithful dog Seymour.
It was the first western directed by Rudolph Matte.
It is the kind of love and warmth he has never known and, for the first time in his life, begins to question his motives.
All the ingredients are there: from the good-badman's colorful nickname to his first glimpse of the pretty woman who sets him on the straight and narrow trail to the mutual admiration that eventually develops between the protagonist and his adversary.
Hart's films were the first westerns which explored adult themes (not to be confused with the later formulaic Saturday matinÃ©e fare) and are certainly worth a look.
The film was the first directorial effort of cinematographer Rudolph MatÃ© and it shows.
You ain't the kind that'll draw first, or shoot a man in the back."
Along with childhood friend he takes a job for local gangster "Putty Nose" things go wrong on their first job however when the police turn up and kill another of the gang.
As their first boss has fled they start working for Paddy Ryan who has seen the money making opportunities that the prohibition of alcohol have brought.
It was the first worldwide box office hit for Cagney (age 31) and forever cast him in the public eye as a "tough guy," an image he was unable to shed despite numerous roles chosen especially to counter that image, including his Oscar-winning role in Yankee Doodle Dandy.
At first it all seemed quite fake (his accent, behavior etc.)
This was Mr. Cagney's first "starring" role; and he is great throughout.
Although Mr. Woods is directed to wipe his hand with his sleeve when he first appears, it looks like the boys' roles are mixed up with the adult men -- Mr. Coghlan Jr. (a fine performance, by the way) resembles Woods more than Cagney; and, Mr. Darro more closely resembles Cagney.
Mr. George Bernard Shaw's famous play of the same social debate was filmed at least twice; the first being as its own, original title of PYGMALIAN (Gabriel Pascal Prod./MGM, 1938).
This led to the famous scene in which Tom Powers first purchased, and then shot the horse that had fatally thrown Nathan while riding the Bridle Path in Lincoln Park.
NOTE: * As I said, Canaryville is one subject that I know first hand.
"The Black Cat" (supposedly based on a story by Edgar Allan Poe) was the first and arguably the best of the seven Karloff/Lugosi collaborations.
This adult content surprised me, especially for a 1931 action movie, and one of the first talkies.
Tom Powers (Jimmy Cagney) is first introduced as a young boy, hanging around with his pal Matt Doyle (Edward Woods), being whupped for stealing by his policeman father.
On their first big job, a friend of Tom's and Matt's, Loopy Louie, is shot by the cops and we see the wake in Louie's parlor, with a matronly immigrant mother moaning, "He was always a good boy."
When Cagney is being fitted for his first suit, he tugs at his waist and tells the guy to leave plenty of room in their.
"The Public Enemy" was perhaps one of the first mob films that followed the rise and fall of a gangster and showed not only the implication of his actions on himself but on his family as well.
The first ten minutes of the film in which we are shown a glimpse into the characters' childhood are jerky at best and feel as if much of it was left on the cutting room floor.
It is also of great historical importance because it is the first movie that paired Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff, the two most venerated iconic figures of the horror genre.
In "The Public Enemy" we find probably the first instances of the beautiful stylish cinematography and clever camera-work that will become the trade-mark of later gangster and noir movies.
After the promising first minutes of the movie which look like they where trying to build a serious profile behind the killings, the movie drifts to a simple and disgusting presentation of violence.
My first surprise came when the audience was addressed by a festival employee who told us that although the movie was German, the dialogue was English.
But there isn't all bad news, the creature design and the CGI effects are very well done for a low budget movie, if you ask me RICHARD HATCH is a major sell out, first this then the remake of BATTLESTAR GALACTICA which true fans will say is Galactica in name alone.
Okay, I simply had to see this since I saw it's "sequel" first (about two years ago), UNSEEN EVIL 2 (aka ALIEN 3000), and I immensely enjoyed it because it was truly one of the worst movies I had seen in a very long time.
When a teenage girl is found hanged in an attic, the police first think of suicide.
), Mario Adorf as the policeman who finds the first body and also discovers that his own teenage daughter was once a âvictimâ of these perverts, the afore-mentioned Fabrizi and Hollywood veteran Farley Granger in a smallish role as the first victimâs father.
In one ridiculous scene, Joan, in her first color film, wears light black face that makes her look like Dorothy Dandridge!
The first of the two scenes comes when Jenny attempts some everyday tasks as a blind person--she tries to set the clock, as I mentioned earlier, and she also tries to make a phone call.
When she "sang" her first number "Follow Me" I broke out laughing!
At first she is resistant to his music and dislikes him because he is not intimidated by her.
Unfortunately; the Commies have had the same idea, and when activated; both computers meet in the electronic ethers, and it's love at first byte.
Whenever someone talks about Universal classic horror films, two names always tend to show up in the course of the conversation: Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff, two very different yet still similar persons who in 1931 shared the privilege of becoming the first monsters of the sound era in two enormously influential films.
Of course, what truly makes this film attractive is the chance to see Lugosi and Karloff together for the first time, and the two icons do not disappoint.
I saw the movie first before reading the book which encouraged me on to read the the original Jones book as well as the sequel, The Fall of Colossus which is just a little more out there.
Considering the age of this movie AND the fact that I saw it when it first aired (okay, so I'm dating myself), it remains one of the most compelling computer-related films I've ever seen.
The ending is not your traditional Hollywood ending either; I strongly suspect they were planning a sequel (The book this is based on was the first of a trilogy).
I first saw it 1977 on Jamaican television.
I have not seen this movie in 30 years, but I remember every scene as if it were yesterday, and the deep feelings that I had when I first saw it lingers on as well.
I have recently watched Colossus for the first time in many years and find it still a classic for sci-fi purists.
So commissioning a project of this type would be ludicrous and far from plausible in the first place.
The first words of Colossus says it best 'There is another system'.
The reasons behind this apparent lack of interest were probably related to how costly and laborious was the process of hand-coloring frame by frame, as while his first hand-colored movie was done in 1897 ("L'Hallucination De l'Alchimiste"), he wouldn't attempt to make another one until 1903, when the hand-colored movies done by Edison's Studios became to be as popular as his films.
The first scene in the movie is shot on a nice spring day that creates the atmosphere (for those who don't know) that it's going to be a nice movie.
I watched it for the first time when i was 10 and the whole way through me and my friend laughed so hard we were crying!
At first she get's into shock over the tragedy of losing her brother and being attacked by creatures who appear to be not to be alive at all.
With so many people from the first film being involved with the remake it's easy to just label it as an "update".
Most people hated this remake, when it first came out (even i hated it).
This is done VERY unconvincingly, first of all.
Well, there goes the intelligent ending to the first film.
OK, it's fine that the timid, catatonic girl from the first one, took charge of her situation for once.
Barbara in the first movie was little more than a basket case.
There are some cute visual and verbal references to the first film and the gore has been upped drastically (though not as much as it could have been).
I found this a little slow but that's because I've seen the first multiple times in the past.
The first one made staying upstairs a viable option.
Although the groundbreaking nature of the original will always remain, Savini's Dead is a without doubt a classic Zombie flick and in my opinion a perfect first chapter in the Romero Dead series.
There were three layers to this portrayal: The first layer of course was the murder itself, and one of the things that makes this interesting is that although we don't know the identity of the killer, we know he is a German general.
Well, it if doesn't, go watch TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN or SCHINDLER'S LIST, or TAZA SON OF COCHISE, or THE PENTHOUSE or DUCK YOU SUCKER ....or even KING'S ROW - or God forbid - BOLERO) which did prove to the world that Bo Derek looked exactly like John Derek's first two wives in face and body - Ursula Andres & Linda Evans, but I'm straying from the film, sorry.
In my former working days at New York State Crime Victims Board, I got to learn first hand about the importance the police attach to murdered prostitutes.
One of the scenes that has always stood out in my mind since first watching this film is the one near the end when Lugosi ties up Karloff.
On her twenty third birthday Bob, her handler, takes her out of the training facility for the first time.
I saw this film when it was first released and with its all-star cast, the lines were a block long at the 41st Street Sheridan Theater on Miami Beach.
3) A series of apparently random prostitute killings across Europe (first in Warsaw) that appears to be linked to one of three leading German Generals: General Kallenberg (Donald Pleasance), Seydlitz-Gabler (Charles Gray), and Tanz (Peter O'Toole).
The first time I watched this film, I was a teenager and I recall that I left the movie theater very impressed.
Danglard takes Mistress 1 (Lola de Castro, played by Maria Felix) slumming to a dive, where he sees "Nini," (FranÃ§oise Arnoul) with her boyfriend and first lover, Paulo the baker, and discovers that she is a spirited dancer.
The first of them, "Complainte de la Butte," which also provides the base of most of the film's musical score, is simply one of the most gorgeous songs ever written, and Renoir himself wrote it.
Maria Felix, with that amazon's body, is imposing as the egotistical Lola, Danglard's first lover.
When i first heard that this film is similar to "Nocnoj dozor" i was disappointed (when i finished watching "Nocnoj dozor" i was really very mad, because i didn't like it), but when i watched "Tureckii gambit" i understood that only thing similar in these two films is special effects (sure special effect were nice in "Nocnoj dozor" but surely not the plot").
As a Background, this is the first time, we have seen Mani Rathnam write and direct a movie, that involves the conflict of terrorism and more of a global movie (concerning India) rather than Tamil Nadu.
When I first saw this movie, I was moved in tears by the story, direction and music.
When Edgar G. Ulmer's "The Black Cat" was released in 1934, it was the first film to feature famed Universal horror actors Bela Lugosi ("Dracula") and Boris Karloff ("Frankenstein") in the same film together, which may explain part of its continually fueled cult popularity today.
It is still as disturbing as it was in 1934, with its villain not only creepy but literally evil, right down to Boris Karloff's eerie first appearance.
Seen it ages ago ,still the memories stay as fresh as seen the first time.
This is the first movie of what was to become director Mani Ratnam's "political trilogy" ("Bombay" and "Dil Se" being the movies to follow).
While he presents himself as a hardline nazi believer at first, we later see that the horrors of war affect him deeply in an unexpected moment and the final scenes of the movie have a very bitter lesson in store for him.
I saw the film when it was first released, and although I was rather young at the time, the story stayed with me for decades.
first there's young barzini who is required to enjoy freudian self employment.
This is one of those movies that keep you watching despite a sloppy screenplay - why, for God's sake, does Korvo (Jose Ferrer) first attempt to gain control of Ann Sutton's (Gener Tierney) mind in the middle of a cocktail party albeit in an empty room into which anyone could have wandered and why, when Tierney discovers the body of Ferrer's ex lover, do two guys turn up from nowhere and call the police.
When we first meet Ann, she's getting arrested by a store detective in a department store after attempting to steal an expensive piece of jewelry.
At first Ann believes Korvo is trying to blackmail her but he persuades her that he really wants to be her 'therapist'.
At first, he charges $50 for hypnotism sessions which appear to be helping Ann with her insomnia.
I almost turned this movie off during the first 10 minutes.
One of the first things that struck me about Whirlpool is how good an actress Gene Tierney actually was.
Perhaps influenced by the wave of films during the period that utilized the growing field of hypnotherapy the picture might have seemed a bit fresher when it was first released.
For instance, see Gene at the police station, first dizzy at her voids of memory, thereafter bravely facing and ill-using her husband, who thinks her to be an adulteress (another great job by Sutton!
With this kind of co-operation, why was there ever a war in the first place?
But Besson is smart; he crafts the first hour like a kind of 'Taming of the Shrew' saga (or 'Taming of a Shrill Bad-ass'), filled with juicy, dark humor ranging from the ultra-violent (pencil in the hand anyone?)
This isn't to say there are a few minor liabilities, if only from my perspective: the music is usually effective in that early electronic-techno beat style for a modern thriller, yet sometimes it's also a cross between a soft-core porn and Weather channel muzak; the ending felt abrupt, or at least on a first viewing (albeit it's hard to top the scene at the ambassador's HQ); and, as a minor criticism, what happened to showing how Nikita learns how to smile?
It's also my first for the Monogram entries, of which this one is the second.
In the first five minutes of "Dinosaur," Disney tries to impress us by showing everything they can do with their computer generated effects.
And let's face it, that's the only reason we saw this movie in the first place (at least those of us without kids).
Hopefully, in the next couple of years, studios will use the technology of "Dinosaur" to make quality movies that we'll enjoy after the first five minutes.
It is literally photo-realistic, making it the first live-action quality film to have completely computer-generated actors.
As far as adults are concerned, the first 20 minutes is pretty amazing from a visual point of view.
So go see the first 20 min, then leave and catch another movie that will challenge your brain a little (like Road Trip!)
I had to see this film twice because the audience was so disruptive the first time.
I saw this movie for the first time at the recommendation of a friend.
It's a cute movie, perfect for a first date.  
Despite what you read about the animation getting old after the first sequence, it never lets down.
There is some sort of feeling you get while watching this movie either for the first time or for the fourth time.
I think this film is underrated and if people do not like this first time, or rate my comment not useful, then I think that they're DEFINITELY missing an important detail of this lovely film!
I was impressed by the trailer and when I finally saw "Dinosaur" first time, I liked some parts, but overall I found the movie a little mediocre.
The first act, which shows Aladar's arrival at the lemurs, is actually portrayed in a different, more detailed way than Tarzan's arrival at the apes, which is refreshing to see.
I first saw this movie in first grade not long after it came out on home video, and so my teacher brought it in and our class decided to watch it.
Bogie is fabulous as always (although he does hold his arms a bit like a primate when he walks), Leslie Howard is playing the watery romantic that Leslie Howard does best, Bette Davis's face actually doesn't frighten me for once (no offense Bette Davis fans, she's a great actress, but I first saw her in "The Nanny" and that is how I will always remember her).
He may have been the screens first truly mean and scary gangster.
This doesn't stop the drama from unfolding, however, nor the talk about wealth and power, first with old man at the bar and then when an upper-class couple who got stranded in a sandstorm come in and also get in on the conversation.
He speaks his poignant lines with conviction... Bette Davis shows her dreamy side and this film, and it's just as compelling as her bitchy aspect... and Bogart, well, this is the first film in which he really IS "Bogart".
The first half--is kinda slow and talky, w/ Foran, Davis and Howard trading jobes, dreams and stereotypical commentary back and forth 'til you really are just hoping someone comes by and pushes Howard out the door.
This was Bogart's first "starring role," if you want to call it, as some have.
The film has two unusual aspects, the first being the surprising treatment of the black characters.
Humphrey Bogart, in his first good movie role, is appropriately menacing; he looks remarkably like John Dillinger, and shows even at this stage of his career much of the charm and charisma that later propelled him to superstardom.
Robert Sherwood's The Petrified Forest had a run in 1935 on Broadway for the first half of that year.
For Bogart it was a return to bigger acclaim than he had gotten in his first trip to Hollywood in the early Thirties.
The first third of the movie involves the two of them and I have to say that in the mouths of players less skilled than these two, Robert Sherwood's dialog would have sounded like so much romantic drivel.
The best context to look at "The Petrified Forest" is through the context of the first great disaster of the 20th Century: World War I (or, as it was known then, "The Great War").
Leslie Howard and Bette Davis make a wonderful pair, and both give fine performances; which makes the potentially talky twenty minute scene where they first get acquainted actually completely captivating.
At first watch I wasn't completely satisfied with the ending (which I will not reveal) but after thinking about it I came to the decision that it really fit the story well after all, and is actually very poetic.
The action begins when the couples meet for the first time.
And why do you want it in the first place?
It seems as if the musical cues that lead up to these big moments (like when Paul first attacks Ron) lead up to nothing because the tension is lost when important events happen.
The story is hung up on an afterwards "confession" that the woman of the first couple does to a stranger (Peter) who picks her up at the start of the movie as she is seen hitch-hiking along a deserted road in the middle of nowhere.
This show is enjoyable even if this is the first time you've seen it.
He made his debut as the Time Lord in the closing moments of 'The Parting Of The Ways', then appeared in a short sketch for 'Children In Need' in November, but his first full episode was this special, the first Christmas 'Who' since 1965's 'The Feast Of Steven' with William Hartnell.
'Torchwood', the mysterious organisation set up to conquer alien threats using alien technology, is mentioned here for the first time.
Here we see David Tennant for the first time as the tenth doctor( excluding the thirty seconds at the end of the parting of the ways).
We also hear what I think are is the first reference to Torchwood.
It is true that Fred did indeed have a drinking problem for which he was fired but evidence shows that much of this was due to the immense strain he was under rather than a wilful character defect.It could be said that he was the worlds first commercial aerial navigator.
The first sign that Lover's Prayer was going to be a loser was when I realized that the people who were supposed to be Russian were speaking with British accents.
The first season was offbeat, quirky and unique.
The writing seemed uneven and flat, and where the first series made you care about the characters, the second leaves you feeling rather unsympathetic.
Also involved is Elmer (done for the first time by Mel Blanc instead of Arthur Q. Bryan) and the Mama Bear from Chuck Jones' Three Bears cartoons.
Only note of warning: if it's your first time with Cassavetes start with something else like Faces or Woman Under the Influence.
This is my first Cassavetes film (as a director) and I red all the reviews warning people not to start with this one, but I must say that I'm quite satisfied that I did.
To be honest, I disliked the film when I first saw it.
This director's first film is a stunning accomplishment.
I first saw this movie after renting it years ago.
- It certainly isn't the first Cassavetes movie that someone should see, but it is worth watching every once in awhile.
At first, I was very impressed with the way the plot in this movie progressed, and how the story was presented.
In terms of blood I know first hand that he would have been completely DRENCHED in blood, even if they did stop the bleeding, which they didn't, and which is hard to do with a gunshot wound to the stomach, without operating.
I get what Cassavetes was going for here, I do, but he does it to such a cloying extreme that I ended up going numb within the first fifteen minutes.
Actor and good friend Ben Gazzara at first turned down Cassavettes in taking the part of the doomed Cosmo Vitelli but when he was told by Cassavettes that it in fact was really about himself he did it as a favor to him.
Twisting these figures into a puppetshow of storytelling and leaving you saying "What The" by the end of your first viewing.
I'm still unsettled from having watched this for the first time.
the things that were definite drawbacks and did Not make sense were more mundane; the cops have a very laissez-faire attitude towards their guns(and even More annoying,each time it's an obvious Portent Of Doom :P ),those dippy cops also missed a handful of important and somewhat obvious clues at first glance(even second and third glance).
The music was good, and I'd say some of it was a poor copy of the dramatic classical music in "Old Boy," but this movie was made first, so maybe it was the inspiring predecessor.
The whole film lumbers and creaks and when finally it gets to its first surprise ending, believe me it is not a surprise, it's pretence and over use of slow motion is irritating rather than dramatic.
It really tells you something: never trust your first impression!
Unfortunately, this film, in my opinion, and after my first viewing, has more flaws and holes than real merits in it.
I have no idea why none of the Hollywood studios have yet given this film a theatrical release, but like the equally brilliant Japanese horror film RING, I'm guessing it's because they are first planning an American remake...so before that dark day comes, experience for yourself the film that I consider the Best Movie of 1999 (besting even The Matrix), and one of the Top 5 Horror/Thrillers of the decade!
I watched "Ordeal by Innocence" for the first time last night on PBS.
But overall, I did enjoy the movie for Geraldine McEwan as Miss Marple, and the more fun and light-hearted first half.
But soon after watching the first episode, excitement turned quickly to disappointment and boredom.
Jeremy Pevin and Sherilyn Fenn are a dynamic screen couple, which is apparent from their first scenes.
Their understated performances are accompanied by some first rate support from JoBeth Williams and Alex Rocco.
The first scenes at the parade are brilliant, though.
The show hasn't even been on for years, I just signed up for IMDb so I can check out movies etc and yet still here I am, years later, coming to this page, one of the first ten pages I visited after I signed up for this service just to complain about how awful this show was.
It confuses me just trying to figure out how something this bad was even allowed on television in the first place.
I fell in love with this film from the moment I first saw a brief clip of it on an entertainment program.
At first I was drawn to the action elements (being young and somewhat immature in my dramatic tastes), but I was blown away by the romance and character interplay.
Serra's soundtracks were the first that I bought for instrumental music, rather than for pop songs used in the film.
But no, this is a real show, with stand-up from Elvira Kurt as stale as that joke about her comically foreign mother thinking her daughter's Lebanese she told for the first decade of her career.
After all these years and now having teen-age daughters myself, I haven't forgotten the impact that a first major crush can have on your life.
I was 13 in 1979 when I first saw this movie and it really made an impression on me.
I loved this movie when I first saw it on TV in 1979 (at age 11) and it remains a favorite.
I taped it the first time I could.
I remember watching this television movie when it first came out back in '79 starring sexy Rexy (Rex Smith)and Denise Miller (later of "Archie Bunker's Place").
I was soon captivated by this sweet and tender movie, reliving the agony and ecstasy of first love) and it made an impression that has haunted my heart strings ever since.
I saw this movie when it first came out, and was obsessed with it.
I hadn't seen the movie in about 20 years when I found it on Amazon, and the first time I replayed it...I STILL knew all the songs.
But there is always a place in my heart for my first love Michael Skye (Rex Smith).
Young love .......... first love.
It is a movie that takes you back to your first love.
I can't imagine the 13-year old girls of today not watching this movie, and not feeling like I did when I saw it for the first time.
I first seen this film in the early 80's and i loved it, its a real tearjerker and any chick flick fans out there will surely enjoy this film, i never get bored watching this film, but get the box of tissue's at the ready :)  Rex plays the part of a 17 year old guitar instructor named Michael and a 13 year old girl named Jessie falls for him, she manages to get his attention and they fall in love, he thinks she's 16 years old as thats what she told him, but you'll have to watch the movie for yourself to see what happens when Michael finds out Jessie's real age, a highly recommended film.
This is the first truly awful episodes of Star Trek--even worse than the "Charlie X" episode!!
I would not see them until I was in my 30's so it's possible that not having seen them first as a child has made me less open to liking the, or it may be that they are just bad episodes; for me, I don't think I'm reaching too far by labeling them bad.
The 'good' greatly outnumbered the 'bad' in the first season of 'Star Trek,' in terms of episode quality.
I'm glad I showed her this one first.
The first one was a true masterpiece.
Now "Snoopy Come Home" is not as good as the first movie, but it is memorable not because it completes the feeling of the Peanuts world as the first movie did, but because it's arguably the most saddening.
I recently watched this movie for the first time in a long time and I soon realized why I've avoided it for so long.
First of all, this is the first "Peanuts" production that didn't have Charlie Brown in the title.
The story had none of the wit of the strip, the specials or the first movie.
And even the animation didn't seem as bold or striking as it was in the first movie, with fewer bold choices like the "Beethoven" montage from that movie.
You probably think Im just getting old, but I still love the early specials and the first movie and I still love reading classic strips.
I recently saw this movie for the first time.
I was expecting it to be alot like "A Boy Named Charlie Brown" (1969) the first Peanuts feature.
Suddenly, he receives a letter from Lila, his first owner, who tells him she is in the hospital and wants him to visit her.
A shocked and obviously upset Snoopy packs up, calls for Woodstock (Who makes his first appearance in the animated continued here) and heads off to meet up with her, leaving a very confused Charlie Brown holding Lila's letter.
This was the first Peanuts project that did not features a score by the brilliant Vince Guaraldi.
When I first saw this movie I was like 3 or 4 years, and I thought of it as one of the greatest adventures in the world.
Unlike the first movie, here both Peppermint Patty and Woodstock appear, although Marcie is still missing.
I first saw this film as a boy in my early tens, and even when I watch it now it has lost none of its ability to endear and -- in particular -- choke.
There's enough fun though, as Woodstock's first appearance in the Peanuts series is well placed and delivered, with as many vaudevillian expressions as Snoopy.
There is a delightful song sung by Shelby Flint in the film....she would later sing another in the first rate animated film, The Rescuers.
The religious twist caught me completely by surprise and once I got into the first few minutes of this movie I was hooked.
The emotional undercurrent at first seems subtle and subdued, but has a constant underlying intensity that is unavoidable and finally sweeps you away with it.
If you only heard about Lelouch but never saw any of his films, "Ladies and Gentlemen" would be a better first film than this one as this one is possibly very confusing... but a masterpiece nonetheless.
And this is one of the first games I ever played on the Playstation One.
The first of the game has you be a small Dinosaur and you take on Dinosaurs bigger then you.
The way in which she is 'colonised' by first Fowler and then the American (Pyle in the novel, but not named in this film) is a comment on the way in which the foreign landscape is depicted and also on how the country has been colonised.
"The Benders" is definitely the most effectively unsettling episode of the first season because, let's face it, there's nothing scarier than flesh and blood human beings.
This is the first episode where Sam & Dean face human villains instead of supernatural monsters.
One of the first shows where the brothers go against humans instead of the supernatural.
I am in love with this film...when i was younger (18 or so) I saw this movie for the first time late night on a "premium" cable channel and loved it...it was adventurous and foreign.
I have not seen the first one yet but am eager to...the 3 DVD set on amazon looks great.
When I first started watching it sort of reminded me of Wag The Dog, which takes place in the United States and has Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman in it.
One reason why the film wasn't so popular is that just a few years earlier, the first Emmannuelle film, based on a supposedly true book by Ammanuelle Arson, was released with much hoopla - and seen by many people, most of whom did not particularly like it, myself included.
And is absolutely sweet and seductive, lush and lovely - everything that the first Emmanuelle movie was supposed to be but wasn't.
If this had been released first, everyone would have been delighted.
She first carefully touches the spellbound creatures imitated human face in a gently, respectful and hopeful way.
The first one was better.
This first movie "Mimic" already wasn't a brilliant movie but it was about as good as its concept allowed it to be.
It's not like the concept of this movie is any less silly than that of the first movie but at least the first movie still somewhat worked out, since it was a fine, formulaic though fine, crafted simple piece of horror.
At least it does a decent job at re-creating the same dark atmosphere as within the first movie.
I remember that the first "Mimic" movie was quite fake looking in parts but I believe that also has to do with Guillermo del Toro's own unique style.
While not as pervasive as in the first movie, the f/x seem really high quality, and definitely don't give you that dreadful 'cheap' feeling.
Bruno Campos is absolutely awful as he tries to transplant (lamely) his character from Jesse, but Alix Koromzay (the female heroine) who comes back from the first Mimic to provide an appearance of continuity does a pretty good job carrying the movie on her own.
Here she carries the movie and does a decent job of taking her 10 minutes of screen time in the first film and giving her more here.
No creative people return and yet the style and tone are very reminscent of the first film.
The plot is mostly rehash of the first movie with a group of people trapped in a confined space with human sized mutant cockroaches.
Of course, the style and look of the first film were mostly borrowed from Species and the Alien series (particularly Alien 3) so this one follows suit.
This time, an undeveloped plot about the military (basically replacing the CDC of the first film) is introduced but not fleshed out.
This almost seemed more like an unused idea for the first film rather than a seperate plot line of it's own.
While the first "Emmanuelle", filmed by Just Jaeckin, is somehow dark, and murky, Emmanuelle 2 is bright, and filled with life, and with genuine eroticism.
It was not expected, because the first Emmanuelle simply did not possess this level of quality.
I also recommend seeing the original first; it is not as good as this one, however it is still a very good, and important film, as that is the one that started it all.
She is much more interesting than Mira Sorvino, who wasn't bad in the first movie.
But usually my first judgment is right, at least at the time, and so an 8 it is on this viewing.
A large part of the reason why is that Mimic 2 is completely different in tone than the first Mimic.
Although Remy is a returning character (she had a very minor role in the first film), there's no reason that you need to watch the original before this one, unless you just want more background on the superbugs.
Okay, first off to really appreciate this episode you need to be a huge 'Supernatural' fan, or more specifically a Sam Winchester fan as nearly the entire episode centers around him.
Like "Emmanuelle, "Joys of a woman" wallows in pseudo-philosophy while displaying a lot of aroused women seeking satisfactionÂ The setting is Hong Kong, where Emmanuelle is taken through the high-life of the aristocratÂ   In Jack Jaeckin's first film, Emmanuelle was sexually reserved, and came out as she discovered her hidden sexualityÂ In the sequel, she explores further into the erotic domainÂespecially other womenÂin trying to find the perfect loverÂ   The characters are not real, but ethereal, dream-like creatures floating through lifeÂ This quality actually works quite well as Sylvia Kristel encounters other womenÂ The eroticism is soft and sensualÂ When she confronts a man, however, there is a feeling only of performanceÂ It's much more sharply refreshing and keenÂ The male lovers never seem to be as compassionate or as feeling as the women, nor are their characters as developedÂ   The photography is quite rich and luxuriant, and has captured a postcard view of modern Hong KongÂ
The viewers who are enthralled by this love story in the first half are astonished to see the twist of the second half.
I watched and the first half was pointless but at least the second half was a little better with the Twists.
The movie begins with Aamir Khan trying to win over kajol..The first 90 minutes was so bad..i thought i would die..I think i had a good idea of what it would have felt, if they hung me upside down with a bee up my ass..the first 90 minutes was so very bad.
The next 90 minutes were worse than the first 90.. i never imagined that could be possible but it was... i ceased to exist as an individual after that movie and now roam the roads of New York like a homeless bum..
For the first 2 minutes I thought that its a spoof on Karan Johar movies.
I liked first 3-4 instances of Shayari.
The only good number is within the first hour and not when I needed it the most.
The movie starts out on a fun note and has the quintessential love at first "sight" scenes.
I believe the director's previous movie 'Hum Tum' was better and sorry but I have to say 'Fanaa' was tad little better than his first film.
The sher- shayari bit in the first half is really good maybe coz of the way Aamir says it .
AS for the movie well the first half was Normal AND Believable but the second half got a bit abnormal for me.
the first half scenes between them are well HANDELLED.
I don't know how some people thought the first 90 minutes was horrible and the rest even more so!
I found the first half extremely entertaining and the second half was a pleasure to watch just for the sheer pleasure of watching two very high class actors perform as they never have.
The first half of the movie could have been made better though.
In addition, this is Kajol's first film after a self-imposed hiatus, while Aamir Khan, paired with her here for the first time, is also seen infrequently on screen due to his reputed fastidiousness in choosing movie projects.
The storyÂas much as I can divulge in a reviewÂstarts off in fairly formulaic boy-meets-girl fashion: Zooni Ali Beg (Kajol), a beautiful blind Kashmiri young woman, comes to the big city (New Delhi, in this case) for the very first time, after having lived a sheltered, happy life in a pristine little town in Kashmir.
The schoolteacher first laid eyes on Tina in her flat, bawling her eyes out after an animated conversation on the phone.
If Tina wasn't distracted by her relationship problems, she'd be more cognizant to Melanie's orchestration of their first meeting, and be leery about her ensuing intrusiveness and sense of entitlement to discuss the boyfriend as if they were longtime intimates.
I discovered this film by accident at my local blockbuster store.At first as another viewer had mentioned found it difficult to get used to the camera format at first.
Fortunately I watched it on my own first, and decided that she would probably find it very disturbing because of the realities depicted, but frustrating because of the inability of the young teacher to do what was necessary to help herself.
The first few minutes of the film, i couldn't get over the 30fps video hand-held format.
However, everything else just fell flat...face first on to the concrete.
Wouldn't they have used radar to know of it's existence in the first place?
Fearless leader, who suspects the health inspector is from the CIA, which is obviously your first choice when thinking about groups of really mean guys Sub Captain, who lets any old health inspector aboard his nuclear attack vessel, without making that phone call to check up on them, first.
I wasn't old enough to see her shows the first time but I remember the infamous blue boiled eggs and the green mashed potatoes as well as other equally hideous food.
Betraying none of the talent he would become famous for (and, let's be fair, this was his first film), Jones lays out the story in a straightforward, no-frills manner.
The chief point of interest here is as the very first cartoon which Chuck Jones directed.
The first derailment is positively the real thing.
I saw it first twenty years ago, and it haunted me ever since; I try to watch it once every couple of years.
I could understand it if it was a first film for these guys - it's as if a director put a gun to the actors' heads, threw up the script and gave them one reading and on to the next scene.
Jones is in his first major movie of his career and performed well.
Her first night, the guard on duty forces himself on her and she accidentally kills him in self-defense.
Jones in particular, in his very first substantial film role, ignites the screen as a weary, cynical, born criminal (I have to like his line "I was born dead").
Watch just the pilot was a shocking experience because: this was the first time in my life couldn't watch more than the first 5 minutes of movie or Tv show.
The most funny thing is: the lesson finally was learned and the other TV movies were so good as the first movies.
"September Affair" was a film that stayed in our mind when we first watched it a long time ago.
In some ways at first he appears to the kids to be just like his character in Monte Walsh, a rugged individualist who lives by his own code.
He has to be that to appeal to the kids in the first place.
For example, when Cooper and co. first meet Mary Brian, the train she is on keeps chugging along, keeping some constant movement in the shot.
From the first silent version of the story that Cecil B. DeMille directed until a 2000 made for television film that starred Bill Pullman as the cowboy who's only known by the state he originally hails from, this is the story that set the standard for the western novel that has come down to this day.
"The Virginian" is one of the first well-known western "talkies."
This movie is considered to be one of the very first westerns to represent the classic elements of the western genre, and its influence on later westerns is quite clear.
The first question that crosses your mind is, how does Madhuri raise the funds to put up this spectacular event the set design in the penultimate song is marvelous?
"The first opening shot sets the tone of the movieÂ its about dance, music, art and also it is about happiness, love, culture, goodness in human beings.
If you apply the first 15 min formula (word courtesy my friend, raj), you know that this movie rocks!
It grips you from the first scene till the last scene.
This is MD's first movie role since Devdas (2002) and it is worth a watch just to see the India's beauty on screen again.
When I first saw the promos, I thought it will be a desperate attempt of a veteran (Madhuri Dixit) to make it back.
This is my first viewing so I can't start by saying it's a favorite, but with Joseph Cotten in the romantic lead and Joan Fontaine with all her charm and understanding, you really can't be far wrong to expect the best in a love story.
From the time Madhuri received the call and has the first meeting with Ahshaye, the rest of movie is entirely predictable.
The first thing my dad did when the credits were done rolling (do stay through the end of the credits because they don't tie up a storyline until then), was to pat me on the back and say thank you for pushing him to come see Aaja Nachle because he hadn't seen such a good film in a long time.
This was my first experience of early John Waters movies and I found it pretty quality.
Multiple Maniacs is the first real example of what this John Waters guy is all about, rubbing you the wrong way.
Lately, that boyfriend of hers, Mr. David has been a real pain in the ass, and today, he just might get it, that is, if he doesn't get her first.
Multiple Maniacs was Waters' first film that wasn't silent, as well as his last black & white.
My first Waters movie was Pink Flamingos, which I adore.
After the first 10-15 minutes characters seem to have disassociated themselves from the original plot of the film, and it becomes some sort of a deranged soap opera.
Divine stars as a brunette for the first time in Waters' first sound film.
Unfortunately, most of the humor is pretty dated and the very low, low budget might turn off most viewers (if they were not repulsed by the first twenty minutes).
Ever since I saw this movie when it first came out, I have loved it.
When I first watched "Milk Money", I initailly squirmed when V and Tom were talking.
Thought at first this film was going to be a slow boring film about a sister and her brother having problems.
I have seen the movie for the first time back in 1995.
To be honest, this is one of the movies I thoroughly enjoyed when I first watched it.
The first half of the film is absolutely hilarious and is packed with moments that will bring a smile to everybody's face.
Life is great for both siblings at first.
The songs, which were disappointing on first listen, fit into the film so well that I will cry every time I hear them.
I wept like a small child and even felt compelled to write this review, my first.
When I first saw "Kal Ho Naa Ho", I was surprised by the extremely modern way that was used to illustrate the film.
The first part of the film was very nice, funny and entertaining.
The film is interesting and flows well, and then suddenly from nowhere comes Aman (Shahrukh), a happy-go-lucky guy who seems to have no problems in life, but he does want to solve the problems in Naina's family when he meets the rather complicated girl, whom he falls in love with the first moment he sees her.
Also the characters' introductions aren't so "filmy" as in the first two .
Naina resents him at first but cannot help falling in love with him .
The first half is laced with witty humour and the second half is tinged with sadness .
Luc Besson's direction is refreshing whilst the cinematography is simply stunning, particuarly the scene in the hotel where Nikita gets her first assignment.
Naina hates him at first sight, but can't help being overwhelmed by Aman's charm.
To Karan for coming up with the film, trusting Nikhil and making it happen, and to Nikhil for a first-class job in his first direction... And the music is wonderful...Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy definitely establishing themselves further in Bollywoodland.
Seriously, i'm really sensitive so no surprise but i reckon this film was the first film that actually made me cry that much.
I was very disappointed with the music when it was first released.
I know KHNH is a good movie when I first read the premise, but I don't realize that this is a very good movie.
For the first time in his life (cue the music).
Ferris wheels seem to me to be emblematic of youth, innocence, first dates, first kisses, all of course from previous cinematic treatments of them, and I think one of the film's themes is innocence, the innocence of not knowing, of love, of hoping, of children, of animals, and the inevitable corruption of that innocence.
The review that was first posted for this video strikes one as a bit reactionary and defensive.
METHOD is a fun "film within a film" story about a beautiful, glamorous actress who is trying to make a big comeback with her first leading role in 3 years.
At least that's what we assume when we first meet her.
As for the acting, well Jeremy Sisto was first rate as always.
The movie jumps back and forth between the film and the film-within-the-film and the filming-of-the-film-within-the-film (still in period costume, so you don't know at first), and from reality to hallucination.
I watched this last night for the first time and am left feeling the longing to watch it again tonight which is a sign of how much I liked this film.
I tuned into the first episode of 'Nighty Night' and was bitterly disappointed, but then one of my friends said to me ''Watch the rest of the series, Danny, it does get better''.
I watched the rest of the first series and became even more bored with the show than I had been before.
The second series was a bit hard to stomach at first but was still brilliant.
I recently bought the 2nd series of Nighty Night and re watched the first series.
One has to categorise this show as as satirical comedy, and indeed the first season begins humorously and playfully enough.
The second season even surpasses the first in extremity, if not in humour.
This being the first (and only really) attempt by Chris Carter of a solely SciFi non Horror show, I thought he did a great job and I was excited to see more.
Anyone who doubts this need only sample a few episodes; particularly from the first few seasons.
But all of those shows lost their touch after the first season, especially Lost and Prison Break which i refuse to watch because the companies took 2 genius ideas and butchered them by making more than one season.
James Gandolfini is one of my favourite actors and i feel that his acting is absolutely stunning in every episode, after i heard that HBO wanted Ray Liotta to play Tony i felt that it would've been the better choice, however after watching the first few episodes, i knew that HBO had done a great job in casting James as Tony.
I implore everyone to watch this show because believe me, you'll be hooked from the very first episode, i was and i have even gotten a few friends who had firstly refused to watch the show, hooked on it.
After you've watched the first season, you'll inevitably agree with me when i once again say that this show dominates Television, and no T.V show current or future will ever upstage the marvel that is The Sopranos.
Van Zandt (from the E-Street Band) plays his first and only role as Tony's best friend, and is quite convincing and latching.
I've only watched the first series on DVD, but would summarise The Sopranos as a Shakespearean plot with a Tarantino-like script.
I defy anybody to sit down and watch the very first episode of Season 1, and not want to continue with the series.
The first two seasons were extraordinary.
But 6 and particularly 6b were beautiful permutations on the themes developed in the more muscular first three seasons.
Melfi's discomfort over the psychiatric study and its references to the sociopath's self-deluding sentimentality for pets and animals goes back to the first episodes of the series, say, with Tony's panic attack over the ducks leaving his pool and resonates with Phil's "wave bye-bye" line to his grandchildren before the coup de grace of the final episode (not to get into Chase's dark humour).
It doesn't matter how many times you watch an episode, you can find something you missed the first five times.
Its hard to think of another series that boasts so much intelligence, sublime writing or first rate performances.
I was captivated from the very first frame of the movie... it just draws you in and won't let go.
I liked it the first time I saw it.
It is the first one that shows the cruel reality in Africa and Asia.
Personally, I feel for the extras exploited in the film, and I support any viewer who stopped watching within the first hour.
This movie has power, from the first scene of the camp in Ethiopia.
Perhaps one of the very first films in the age of DVD to find its audience following a poor theatrical run, "Dark City" is the follow-up to director Alex Proyas' other stylistic achievement, the graphic-novel adaptation, "The Crow."
The Glass House was recommended to me by a friend when I first saw it.
Your first thought in seeing this movie is probably, 'Wow, how similar this is to The Matrix.'
Bumstead and Emma seem distant at first because they are only just introduced to those lives when we first see them.
In fact the very first thing that happens in this film is that the narrator tells you what I just told you.
You can't help but wonder if it might have served to achieve a better sense of mystery if they hadn't thought to lay that on you in the first 30 seconds, but the film manages to be quite suspenseful all the same.
Ever since I first saw the first Crow film with Brandon Lee, I've been an avid fan of Alex Proyas' film making and Dark City is another amazing example of his cinematic expertise.
Even to this day, six years after seeing it for the first time, I can't get over the freshness, originality, and overall boldness of Alex Proyas' visionary masterpiece.
This whole concept suggests two things, the first being that humanity has the ability to adapt and thrive in a new environment and the other is that as an individual, humans have the ability to shape their world to their own desire once they are fully aware of themselves and their desires.
Not only was Dark City first, it also handles the subject much better and more adult than Matrix.
Most of it comes from the fact that this movie first ran near 3 hours.
The topic is about a man who loses his past and first finds himself in a bath tub, doesn^t know about himself and his life, but he has one ability that no one has, he can be alive when the evil forces stops the time and reshapes the world according to their own demand.
Despite(and maybe because of) Matrix sky high hype right now, my thoughts drift back to this overlooked classic...but a little on Neo and gang first below...
That alone ought to be worth the watching, just so when she wins her Oscar you can say you saw her first great role.
If you're looking for a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat from the first moment, Air Force One is it.
"Air Force One" is a thriller that involves Russian terrorist Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman) and his gang of criminals hijacking the first plane along with the president's wife and child and his staff.
"Air Force One" is an action picture so full of excitement that it had me on the edge of my seat when I first saw it on the big screen back in 1997.
And when we first see the plane from the inside, it looks as if were on a tour of the actual Air Force One itself and it's fascinating.
That terrorists could blow the cockpit door open, using some sort of plastic explosive, detonating it by firing a pistol at it (hitting it on the first shot, no less!
The very first thing they would do is check the reporter's credentials and publication/broadcast record.
To right the wrong that the first president Bush did when he kept Saddam Hussein in power after the Gulf War?
At first everything seems great...until the siblings soon discover that all that glitters isn't gold... Credit is due where credit is due the cast does a superb job.
The first few minutes were actually kinda nauseating the way the picture shot.
The first shot we get of them is two ordinary monitor lizards, blown up to dinosaur size by photographic legerdemain, and they're tearing each other to pieces, literally.
I first remember seeing 'The Land Unknown' as a kid.
At first I thought was just going to be a quirky comedy about resentful temps, I was wrong.
Finally Randy snaps, but first he provides his fellow workers in the office environment with a moment of inspiration.
I'm Doug Van Doren, the writer and producer of this movie and I just checked in with some of the user comments and votes for the first time in a while.
That said, we just landed another film because of it (the entire purpose of making it in the first place) and HBO, the biggest cable movie network on the planet, liked it enough to fork over a good chunk of money to buy it, not bad considering they only buy a handful of shorts every year.
These wonderful people are families first and their sexuality, while it is important does not define them exclusively.
This was the first of its kind and Rosie and her wife Kelli and Gregg put together an experience for not only gay families but gay friendly families that will be in our memories for ever.
We were very blessed to be on the first cruise ever of its kind like this and have enjoyed each year after that on this cruise.
This documentary gave gay families voices for the first time.
i first saw this film in 1989 when i was 8. i enjoyed it immensely and having taped it off TV i would watch it on a regular basis.
You know right from the start that there is something dreadfully suspicious and exceedingly bizarre about the Glass couple, but you can never be too sure exactly what at first (that's the purpose of a thriller, to throw you a few hints and let your quick assumptions guide you into all the wrong paths so that you're--hopefully--pleasantly surprised when the real perpetrator and his motives are revealed).
It's hard to sympathize for a character like that at first.
He's the first to really realize how special Herbie is.
This first Love Bug movie had a good cast of supporting players who were finding the Disney Studio their employer of last resort.
The writing is bad, the editing and continuity (especially in the first 10 minutes of the movie) are shockingly poor...really amateur stuff.
They help beginning filmakers create their first films.
This has been one of my top five favorite movies since the first time I saw it.
This should be the first hint.
The film takes, it seems at first, its sweet time in shaping itself up; but it is merely a way to draw you into the story, making you a part of it.
The film opened to immediate critical acclaim during it's first week of release, however when a negative reviewer opted to focus on the treatment of Willy's character, it called into question whether the story was sympathizing with the Nazi cause.
It was interesting to me that the first time one gets a view of the entire open sea is right after it's revealed that Mrs. Higley's (Heather Angel) baby is dead.
I was pleasantly surprised that the agenda is first to have compelling characters in interesting situations, and the whole "microcosm in a lifeboat" clichÃ©s are kept to an absolute minimum.
A better, richer film than when I first viewed it close to 20 years ago.
One of my favorite films, Hitchock does his usual great job, and to see at last stage great TALLULAH BANKHEAD in her first and only noteworthy role how can you miss !!!
My favorite scene in Lifeboat is when Hodiak who represents the left on the boat is trying to rouse the rest to just toss Walter Slezak to the sharks when he first arrives, asks Lee for his opinion as he's a member of the party.
Even today more than sixty years after it was first made, Lifeboat is still a great cinematic achievement from Alfred Hitchcock.
In the first scene we are shown astounding destruction at sea from a capsized ship until the camera pans over to a lifeboat where the lone, well-coiffured, mink-draped, all made-up Tallulah is sitting, cross-legged, smoking a cigarette.
John Hodiak (very handsome) is her enemy (at first), while Walter Slezak, Hume Cronin, William Bendix and the others ably support.
The rest of the film can be summed up with the phrase, "I never killed anyone who didn't try to kill me first".
This was one of his first starring roles.
He benefited greatly from the direction of the veteran director Raoul Walsh who managed to expose his real talent for the first time.
The film is set in World War IIÂ An Allied ship was sunk by a German U-boat and a mixed bunch of survivors got away in the lifeboatÂ The enemy submarine was also sunk by the explosion and its Nazi commander joined the survivors in their lifeboatÂ   At first they were prepared to throw him overboard Â but it was his skill which saved their little craft and gradually, while the allies were torn by dissension, selfishness, divided aims and views, his single-minded strength of purpose and his disciplined abilities took commandÂ Unknown to the others, he was stealing their rations to keep up his strength, and directing them towards a rendez-vous with a German supply shipÂ  Tallulah Bankhead, incidentally, dominated the acting of the whole fine cast except possibly Walter Slezak, as the NaziÂ As the woman journalist, keeping close to her material possessions, and only emotionally more friendly, she gave a performance with the power and the pain of a thirty feet salt waveÂ  It is ironic that the film's propaganda message, which I believe weakened and over-simplified it, was widely misunderstood at the timeÂ Hitchcock intended to show at that stage of the war that the democracies should settle their differences and unite forces against the common enemy, who was disciplined, strong, and knew just where he was goingÂ Instead, a lot of people attacked the film for showing the strongest character as the Nazi!
this could have been an excellent film, but is missing key films in the history of queer cinema - first of all it skips all non-American films only paying mention to a few, but never covering them.
Now be prepared the first 30 minutes of this movie sort of takes you through a maze... a long elaborate set up that sets everything in motion that happens in the movie... which at first is confusing but on repeat viewings you will see how perfect it works for the movie.
I wonder how most people react to the ending especially back when the movie first came out... and what the sorta mood was as people got up out of their seats and left the theater.
From the first time I saw this in the first-run theaters, I thought this movie would garner at the very LEAST some editing awards.
Bob Hoskins takes total and utter control and the man IS Harold Shand within the first moment you see him.
As the first two members of his gang are assassinated he asks himself who could make him and his associates a target: a legitimate question in the circumstances, but the emotional burst with which Hoskins delivers the sentiment suggests less a rational question and more a little child screaming that "IT'S NOT FAIR!".
In the event yes, because rather than going into hiding (like Michael Corleone in the first Godfather) Shand's feathers get ruffled even more and, the irony apparently lost on him, he kills two IRA agents for real and is tracked down and captured within minutes.
I've got to be honest and say that first seeing this in 1983 I was shocked by the clever twist of making the IRA as the bad guys but having watched the movie a few more times over the years the radical idea of having the provos muscling in on the London underworld isn't as clever a plot as I first thought and once you know who's been putting the pressure on Harold Shand and his corporation the story becomes a little threadbare after multiple viewings .
The basic plot of "The Long Good Friday" is perhaps the film's only real weak point.In it's favour,it is certainly unusual but often somewhat over-complicated (several viewings may be needed to properly connect all it's threads) and a little far-fetched;the fact it is set around Easter (Ireland has had some very important events occurring around this holiday period throughout it's long history) may be intended irony.But in the midst of the considerable quality around it,these are modest complaints.John McKenzie's direction (what a shame his subsequent work has been much lower profile) is very well-judged,being either fast,exciting,subtle or reflective when the situation demands it,serving the thoughtful,literate,clever,often droll script by Barrie Keeffe.The characters are not the familiar stereotypes you'd expect in such gangster dramas,and performers like Bryan Marshall,Alan King and Eddie Constantine (in a rare English-speaking part) are given slightly more depth to roles that could have been mere ciphers.Helen Mirren is first class as Harold's mistress,one of the most interesting gangster's molls ever put on screen,but the entire film is dominated by the career defining performance of Bob Hoskins.His searing,commanding presence as Shand is outstanding,carrying conviction in every moment.Hoskins' portrayal is arguably the most anti of anti-heroes in cinematic history.Harold Shand thinks himself as a businessman and no longer a criminal with the 1980's about to loom,with apparent peace with rival gangs for a decade further emphasising this point.But with the uncontrollable mayhem taking place around him threatening his legitimate credentials,Harold is more than prepared to dish out some extremely brutal (if not sado-masochistic) treatment to find those responsible so the lucrative deal can go forward,making cynical,hypocritical remarks about the decline of various neighbourhoods along the way.
Maybe you need to have seen the first five episodes in this series?
Though maybe there is a subtle different from the first try to the final approval.
To hear Bruce Springsteen say he first heard Chuck Berry via the music of the Stones makes me feel ancient.
I was thirteen when I first heard Chuck Berry on a car radio in 1955 jamming out "Maybelline," the first true rock song I had ever heard.
When Chuck recorded this in 1956, it represented, to my knowledge, the first rock 'n' roll protest song, several years before Bob Dylan would turn the rock world around with his protest-oriented music.
I just happened to catch this for the third or fourth time, and first time with my wife, on Universal HD today.
Hackford won an Academy Award in the short film category with the first project he ever did.
I got this as part of a 2-disc set, which I bought primarily to get a hold of Wolstencroft's first feature, "Bloodlust".
And then, there are the moments when you are supposed to laugh probably to ease the tension that was never there in the first place.
Just like the first movie under this name that was made,"EATING OUT" this is merely a sequel to the kind of insipid superficial gay movie that gives the gay community a bad name.
The total polar opposite of first class writing/directing.
Even more than the first.
This sequel is very much that, all the while pushing the envelope so much further than the first chapter, Eating Out .
Be warned this time its full of much more shocking and crazy situations, yet guaranteed more laughs than the first, so in fewer words if you liked the first you will love this one even more.
On an exciting note this is the first ever American gay movie sequel.
This film probably has two more laughs than the first film, Eating Out, which means it has exactly TWO laughs.
What I remember is some really bad acting -- just like in the first film.
The awful, awful director of the first film, Q Allan Brocka, even appears as an extra in this one in the scene with the nude male model.
Why on earth would someone expect anything less from a film title 'Eating Out' in the first place?
I was one of many that despite the reviews and comments LOVED the first movie.
Rebekah Kochan (Tiffani) has done a body transformation since the first installment.
She looked good in the first one, she looks amazing in this one.
I think it easily matches up to the first Eating Out, though they are very different films.
I kinda liked the first movie, if only for its premise and craziness, but the first movie had too many awkward moments (especially the piano scene).
Even characters I hated the first time around were more appealing in this one.
The first issue to tackle is the presentation of Lowell Bergman, former producer at 60 Minutes, as the white knight of the story.
But first off, this movie is so interesting that it didn't seem much longer than the typical 90 minute flick.
The first part of the movie plays like a spy thriller, as it focuses on the threats made against Wigand and family to silence him, and the pressure this puts on his family life as we literally see the man begin to crumble under the pressure.
At first, I was actually--prematurely, at that--deeming this destined to be a stop-gap film in Mann's career.
Mann's narrative and subject matter is so layered and sparse with an unrecognizable plot at first glance, it could have properly faired well as a mini-series, similar to that of "State of Play."
There is little action in here but a ton of tension in the first hour of this long (158 min.)
So, that's the first reason for you to watch this movie.
If an academic ever gave this its due as the first instance of meta, or at least an example of intertextuality, it would have more respect.
Hard to abide the realism of this striking movie...  Not the blood and the excess violence but the pure reality of - how anybody do something like that to other- caused some of the audience leave the movie in the first half.
Its not like the ball dropped on January first in 1980 and everyone across the world immediately stripped down and had a nudist party to burn all there 70's cloths and and any other belonging they may have acquired over the past 10 years.
This gem of a movie slipped under the radar screen of the movie goer's consciousness when it was first released, but it will live on forever in the DVD collections of those who truly cherish good film-making.
I just "discovered" Freaks and Geeks and I gotta admit that at first it took me some time to get into it because I was kind of expecting a more broad, punchline based comedy but the more episodes I watched, the more I started to really dig this show AND to love the characters and I really mean LOVE!
While it was canceled by NBC after its first run, it also happens to be, in my opinion, one of the finest shows that they have ever committed to the small screen.
Furthermore, while being a comedy series, it doesn't hesitate to explore the drama present in the characters' lives and draws very real characters, who may seem like archetypes at first, but end up being a lot more than you might think.
After watching the first six episodes, I found it was pretty good, but the humour doesn't quite work for me.
Until I decided this little (only in ratings) wonder deserved the distinction of becoming the first program I'd praise to the skies.
I checked the chronological filter in reverse to find out just who was the very first soul to write here about "Freaks and Geeks".
For my first review of a TV show, why not pick one of the finest programs of the 90s?
Yes, there are similarities, and anyone who remembers watching Heroes when it first aired will notice them.
I couldn't stop slapping my knee while I read it the first time.
For instance, Matt Gilmore and I (my co-worker in this mess) were promised, at first, in pre-production meetings (the early ones), that our FX budget would be quite decent.
Sean Penn has seldom been so youthfully exuberant and amiable playing a young working-class man about to go off to war, finding love for the first time with a sweet lass he presumes is wealthy ("a Gatsby girl").
The not-so-fun part is simply trying to figure how what is happening in the first place.
The plots were always watchable and interesting, with occasional but excellent humor, and the acting was first rate.
Apparently their work together on this series made McGavin and Reynolds lifelong enemies and poor Burt was replaced by Noah Berry (Rockford's dad and Davy Crockett's sidekick) after the first season.
The river pirates that made $20,000 stealing his merchandise the first time are planning to stage another robbery, in spite of Ben Frazer's precautions (Debra Paget).
If you watch the first three minutes and feel like pushing the 'stop'-button, do it.
After watching it for 10 minutes the first thought of pressing the "STOP" button on the remote was triggered.
But being a big SCI-FI buff and not wanting to jump to conclusions after the first minutes of viewing I decided to show mercy and watched it to the end, thinking it might become better as it went along.
And with todays CGI, and an industry first from VICON, there are only good things destined for this show.
First of all, this is the first Antonio Banderas film I've ever seen.
(Uh, this is my first time posting a review for a film, so I hope you forgive me for not writing an exceptional one.)
Rock was 28 when he made this film for Universal and for the first time he was given first billing in a film.
Like the first reviewer here said, this is a mess of a movie.
The first two thirds of the movie deliver old fashioned, 80's-style horror goods with decent character development, a nice history lesson as to why Jimmy Bones is so hacked-off, and some juicy gore.
Also the pun of having two token white kids getting killed in the first minute, the cheesy red colour of the blood, the totally unfitting comic relief of 2 talking heads and all skanky girls in the movie being played by white chicks makes this an absolutely excellent movie!
that's the first reason to watch it.
I've read the other comment referring to Snoop Doggs'horror film, Bones....When this first came out it was my favourite horror film but I watched it that many times that it lost its' lustre.
All through the movie the blood was any color but the color of blood, I have to wonder if that was supposed to have paid homage to the days when the censorship laws prohibited film makers using blood colored blood, it does in its own way add a kind of sick humor to Bones and there was plenty of dark humor to go around in the first place, really there are parts that are quite funny.
This movie in no way is horrible, but its not actually a movie in the first place.
Will Chris cheat on Stewart with the first pair of pants that walks by or will he actually -- heavens to Betsy!
And while the acting is terrible, truly terrible, the writing and direction are first rate.
I first saw this in the theater with my dad, at the age of 13, when it was first released - he was a huge fan of classic movies and usually suffered through the stuff he took me to.
The acting is static and makes you feel like you are watching the first performance of several understudys.
I seem to recall that when I first came out in the early 70's, gym bunnies were few and far between in the gay male community.
This was the first of the series that I have seen, having nothing else to do this afternoon and having seen most everything else in theatres that I wanted to see.
SPOILERS HEREIN  The first segment, entitled "L.T.R," chronicles the relationship of two young twenty something boys (emphatically "boys") who meet and "fall in love."
The victim is approached by a young man who arrives on the scene and does what he can to comfort the victim first by wiping the blood from the boy's face, giving him his jeans, and later his letterman's jacket.
Although the boy who rescues the victim at first tells him that he left the scene before the attack began, he later admits that he stood and watched while the attackers stripped the boy naked from the waist down and allegedly violates him with a stick.
I thought Gus was suitably sleazy, and Daniel was a decent guy with his true qualities not evident at first.
The first story is called "L.T.R."
There doesn't seem to be any connection between the two (I miss the first episode, so I don't know if they have mentioned the connection, but from the 2nd episode to the 6th, there is nothing mentioning the connection between the 2 "story")
After having enjoyed the first two episodes of "Kingpin," I was a bit disappointed in the third installment of the series, although it had its moments, the canine shootings not being among them.
The first episode alone was hilarious --a wacko cousin of the Kingpin doesn't like it when Kingpin's wife shoots her mouth off, so he plans to tear off her blouse and whip her!
It's a movie directed by Robert J. Flaherty, who was best known for his documentaries and his most famous and first movie "Nanook of the North", which wasn't even a real documentary.
The score by Virgil Thomson deserved its Pulitzer Prize for music in 1949; it receives a first class performance here by the Philadelphia Orchestra under Eugene Ormandy.
It took forever to come out first of all, it was filmed when my friends brother, who just graduated, was a freshman there, and it just came out in 2006, and the quality is pretty bad.
When i first saw this movie i thought it was going to suck.
Nothing happens: at the end, it feels like it was just a feature-length first episode of a mini-series.
I suppose some kind of Lord of the Flies metaphor is implied by the boy-savage who menaces the leads in the first third, but without connecting this to WHY civilisation has ended and WHY people are reacting the way they are, the message goes nowhere.
As others have said, from the first scene on, the main character can't seem to stand and spend most of his time crawling around whining.
The first 40 minutes are set in a collapsed train tunnel where the survivors try to come to terms with their situation, both in the tunnel and in their heads.
What happened is not clear at least at first, but it was big and powerful and not over.
The first the film occasionally moves into clichÃ© a couple of times, as in the crazed soldiers who hook up with our heroes.
The narrative is so gummy, at first I couldn't figure out if the building was also used as a hotel, or if Leigh's character was planning on living there full-time.
I saw this film first soon after it came to cable and before I knew much about Jennifer Jason-Leigh or had come to appreciate the power this amazing young actress can exude in the careful and often understated nuances she brings to her craft.
If you watch this film and are not challenged by its thought provoking message, you need to watch it again because you did not pay attention the first time.
After my somewhat lackluster experience with the first One Armed Swordsman movie, I was very happy to find that the sequel far out shined the original movie.
I was eight years old when I first saw this movie on the big screen in 1942.
It was my first color movie and the scenes with the giant octopus gave me nightmares for a long time after.
I had seen the first film in this series, as well as the David Chiang movie "The New One-Armed Swordsman", and I wasn't particularly thrilled by either one, to be honest.
Continuing where the first movie left off, we see Fang Gang leading a life of a farmer, without a care of JiangHu politics.
It is basically The Road Warrior (1981) to the first film's Mad Max (1979), pumping up the action quotient ten fold and rarely slowing down from beginning to end.
In the first half an hour alone countless unsympathetic characters are introduced, some of whom proceed to perform random and inexplicable actions throughout.
If you want to see an extraordinarily disturbing film, this would be one of my first suggestions.
This was the first time David Lynch shot live-action footage.
Lynch's first film is a bizarre, revolting and terrifying account of a bedridden young girl apparently being tortured by the alphabet.
It's not the first time they have put Goddard last.
Caught this movie on the Encore channel for the first time, and was very moved.
Although I first saw this film when I was probably six years old, it has stuck with me as an inspiration, and set a standard that very few movies live up to.
Also this was probably the first time I saw John Cusak in anything (although still my favorite film of his is "Better Off Dead").
I barely feel qualified to write a comment on this forgotten Disney live-action film from the mid-1980s, since I've only seen it once, and that was back when it first came out.
But I do remember liking it, and it's probably worth a re-watch for those who saw it back in the day, and a first watch for those who've never seen it.
From the first feature film in Hollywood, THE SQUAW MAN (1914) to his last production, THE BUCCANEER (1958) he represented HollyWoods commercial success.
We fall into that second group seeing our first DeMille film circa 1957 THE TEN COMMANDMENTS (1956).
This is a very dark family film that lacks all of the standard, corny Disney clichÃ©s (aside from the animal friend, but here he doesn't talk... and he isn't particularly nice at first).
At first, rejecting the job offer, he steps out into the Chicago streets.
When Natty jumps her first train, she is help and befriended by Harry(John Cusack), who is also riding the rails.
Cusack in his first major dramatic role after being extremely good in The Sure Thing, shows for the first time that he is not just a comedic actor, but has dramatic prowess as well.
Her characterization draws us into the story from the first moments of this film to the last.
This is the first time I've seen Jerry get all this physical abuse, at least for the first three minutes of the cartoon.
Why he chose to live inside a pool table in a pool hall in the first place is puzzling.
Whatever, he starts taking a pounding the first time a billiard ball goes into a pocket and winds up crashing on top of his little bed.
This testosterone-driven movie is my all time favourite, and as it was the first gangster movie I ever saw, it was a perfect introduction.
He is very convincing as Ness, and De Palma does a great job at showing his early rejection, his first triumphs, and his ultimate success.
It also could have been the first gangster film i ever saw.
At first, he just did not speak with the authority of a tough Chicago cop out to get Al Capone and the racketeers from the Prohibition Age in Chicago.
You can tell within the first ten minutes of the movie that the score is going to ruin the movie.
Another is the first meeting between Andy Garcia and Sean Connery, in which the latter decides to recruit Garcia's Italian character in spite of racial feuding (Connery's supposed to be Irish), and instead because he likes his mouthy, bold attitude.
It is not based on the 1957 book with the same title authored by Elliot Ness and Oscar Fraley or the 1959 TV series starring the late Robert Stack as Ness which followed the book a little bit in its first season.
Movie fans can enjoy this film at the level of entertainment alone and not worry about the bad history but for one problem where the first defect also intrudes on the acting.
The way the little mousy guy kept referring to his tax problems... we all know that's how they brought him down, but they gave that away in the first 20 minutes!
Connery does a great job as Malone, the aging, guilt-ridden cop who becomes Ness's mentor (though his death scene is a bit overdone, I must admit I actually cried the first time I saw it!).
The bureau responded by sending Ness (Kevin Costner) an accountant, Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith), who first had the idea of going after Capone for income tax evasion.
REAP THE WILD WIND, at first sight, does not quite seem as understandable as the others.
This is stuff that I learned to avoid in my first creative writing class.
Mostly, the show's creators tried to cram too much of a plot into the first episode.
The plot was pretty interesting, and they set up a lot of potential story lines from the first episode.
Sure, they all look cute, but their expressionless, bobble-head deliveries look like first year high-school drama.
When the grown A.C. first comes into the show, looking like a California beach dude, I was like "Oh No....This is going to be some Dawson's Creek, contrived teenage drama..." But actually, A.C. shows some depth in his character to make it interesting (although all the characters are pretty simple).
This was her second film for DeMille [the first being NORTHWEST MOUNTED POLICE] but not her last [ahead she was to play opposite Gary Cooper in UNCONQUERED].
I would certainly be one of the first in the water to buy it on iTunes.
The ending is somewhat diverting but once again this is a movie that has a great first act and nothing but sheer boredom after.
This pilot reminded me a lot of Smallville's first episode and the excitement it created in me.
Although the story line may have been lame at first.
But only the appearance of the Italian famous dramatic actress ANITA SAGNOTTI LAURENZI illuminate with her wonderful characterization and suggestion the scene.Her wonderful and deep voice remember the sweet time in Viterbo , were she is born , as she accepted the first declaration of love in old Greek.
Then I wanted to take comfort in the fact this production stars the almighty B-movie legend John Saxon, but he's only in it during the first EIGHT minutes and then he has his neck wrenched around 180 degrees!
At least the film manages to limp through with a decent finale; though once you've sat through the first eighty five minutes of the film, it could be the best ending of all time and most people would be unlikely to care.
I know I have passed it by on many occasions and written it off at first glance as just one more lame formula sitcom.
The first season is far more immune to this flaw, yet the later ones are the one I'm referring to right now.
Flora Robson's one great actress, her talents allowing her to play a slum mother and Queen Elizabeth the first.
Carroll is best, Renaldo is fun, and Yakima Cannutt's stunt work is first rate.
The first of the many serials based on the Zorro character released by Republic during the 30s and 40s.
I first saw this serial on TV in the 1950s in New York.
It was my first exposure to the "anachronistic westerns" that republic pictures produced at that time.
You'll need it for scenes with lines such as, "...that was our first encounter with disco mutants.
Wanted, Dead or Alive was most folks first exposure to a screen legend.
This is a truly hilarious film, with a wonderful script and first rate gag lines, with plenty of opportunities for laughing out loud.
This scenario is given to you in the first fifteen minutes of the movie, and it's off to the races in this delightful comedy.
If it's not, it's sure one of the first and has inspired countless sitcom episodes.
This same philosophy stands me in good stead when watching what at first appraisal is a religious film, be it for the cinema or for TV.
This is the first time I review a movie on IMDb and I am taking the time, as I said before, to spare someone the torture.
About the only enjoyment I got out of the first two-thirds of this movie came from the fact that I was a History Major in College.
The first part gives the impression of being pedantic and somewhat patronizing.
I sat through the first 45 minutes of this film thinking "my goodness, if the pacing were any slower I might lapse into a coma".
Unfortunately he has never again done something as good as Aniki Bobo, his first real film, and now that he's at the "reverting back to a child" age he probably never will, still he deserves respect.
The whole first part of the film sounds like a bad documentary from an educational channel: we could have read a guide-book, instead.
It must have been the first time she'd have seen the finished film.
At first viewing, the films seems like a mixture of luxuriously long shots of ships and waves, stilted conversations between wooden actors, random scenes with strange editing, and almost no musical score.
When we first meet Rosa Maria, a university professor, who is embarking on a long trip to Bombay to join her husband for a vacation, we watch her on board with her daughter, Maria Joana, a beautiful child with an inquisitive mind.
Writer/director Albert Pyun's first foray into post-nuke sci-fi/action cinema remains to this very day his single most novel and idiosyncratic entry in that sub-genre.
Its mostly Hatton stalking through the night for the first half while the police, played with less than all seriousness try to catch him.
Earlier on during this Halloween Horror challenge, I had watched HOUSE OF HORRORS (1946) which was basically a precursor to this one Â similarly dealing with a hulking criminal with a penchant for back-breaking dubbed "The Creeper" (actually first seen in the Sherlock Holmes mystery THE PEARL OF DEATH [1944]!).
During the 30s and 40s he was mainly seen in small roles, often as hulks, due to his large body size and the fact the he had contracted acromegaly after being gassed during the first world war.
One of the problems with the film for first time viewers is the way that the tone changes from a pretty light hearted beginning to a much darker conclusion.
I read the first review (on IMDb) for this movie and its really bad.
Its up there with the first Friday movie.
Don't let it turn you off in the first few mins or you'll miss out.
He's in only like the first part of the movie then sprinkled here and there till the end?
Yes, this treatment of the different class systems seems rather trite at first, but the complexities of the characters are mapped through until the sombre end, which is a refreshing change from the feel-good nonsense made by Disney et al.
The acting was pretty decent and there were plenty of laughs (again it's not slapstick stoner humor) Also keeping in mind that Chong usually directed their films, Cheech did a good job first time out.
The first person they meet is a revolutionary rebel by the name of Miles Archer (Lisa Blount, who I also remember from another of my favorite guilty-pleasure 80s flicks, "Nightflyers", as well as "Blind Fury" and "Prince of Darkness").
As expected, the movie is a comedic satire for most of the first hour, but then suddenly turns serious in the last 20 minutes.
I first saw this film on one of those boring rainy days where you end up sitting in front of the TV channel surfing.
I belong to the first category: 2 kids growing up in a nuke shelter with a large collection of detective novels deciding to be the post apocalyptic worlds first dicks, The Atomic Dicks!
I highly request reading the book first, before seeing the movie!
For those who enjoyed the book first, this film seems strangely wrong.
I was thrilled when I saw that the book had been made into a movie, for the first time since it was written, over 50 years before.
So Rose pursues one of the Americans, Cassandra deals with first love, spurning one suitor while secretly pining for another.
Not to mention that when I saw the movie Monster, that won Charlize Theron her Oscar, I was more interested in learning about Aileen Wuornos, one of the country's first female serial killers.
There was only proof that the first killing was a possible self defense, but the rest were just out of blind robbery.
Broomfield's style, first practised on South African white supremacist Eugene Terreblanche, is based on turning up, turning on the camera and letting people damn themselves.
I haven't seen Monster but I did watch Nick's original, so go out and watch that first, then sit back and be shocked, horrified, touched etc.. at this final chapter in the life of someone who did not deserve the life she had.
The film happens to be the second teaming of popular Italian brawling duo Terence Hill and Bud Spencer (the first â GOD FORGIVESâ¦I DONâT [1967] â was actually a prequel to this!)
The first half of this film is pretty standard, but the second half involving Drake is where the film really distinguishes itself, imo.
Btw, this is their second appearance together, the first being GOD FORGIVES, I DON'T from the year before.
Since the billionaire is angry with these two consultants, he drills through the first's chest and electrocutes the second into a Blood Doll.
The theme of publicly executing undesirables, by the way, bears amazing resemblance to the brutal regime of Mao Tse-tung, which was at it's heyday when this episode first aired.
It's Burgess Meredith, seemingly cowering at first and then realizing that if his life is to have worth, he needs to make a final statement.
In his spare time Virgil has also created horrible little killer dolls to do his bidding, first George Warbeck (Nicholas Worth) & Mercy Shaw (Jodie Coady) are taken care off then Virgil turns his attentions to Harrison Yulin (Warren Draper) & his scheming wife Moira (Debra Mayer) who just happens to be a dominatrix... Has Virgil met his match at last?
In the early 1980s, a young actress made her first appearances in television and films with an unforgettably quirky presence -- vulnerable and seductive all at once.
For the remainder of 1982, the bad girl image more or less stuck: she gave Robin Williams' Garp his first sexual experience as flighty Cushie in "The World According to Garp" and she played the flirty younger sister of Tommy Lee Jones' girlfriend in the made-for-TV film "The Executioner's Song."
In 1987, Jenny was offered her first star turn in Kathryn Bigelow's "Near Dark."
Virginia searches for Brand's second novel, "I, Madman," after finishing the first, which involved a demonic creature who takes its revenge on its creator.
I was hesitant to watch this movie based solely on the first ten minutes because it was so cheesy, but after a while I eased into it and found that this movie was so bad and so cheesy, it was good.
I first saw this movie a year after it came out, it was 1989, i was 14, and i have never been so scared in my life, I've just watched it again, and while its still scary i am now 32.
The first kill is a cracker and sadly the later ones aren't as good, but they still just about work in the context.
Written by David Chaskin, whose credits also include the first "Nightmare on Elm Street" sequel.
I first saw this episode when it was originally aired in 1961 and have since collected it on LaserDisc.
On the downside, the film runs out of steam after the first two thirds, delivering a disappointing final act that does not live up to everything that came before it.
Its main thread is an interweaving of extensive interview segments with several sets of ardently religious parents, including former House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt and his wife, those of a young man from a long line of Lutheran pastors, and the parents of the first openly gay bishop, and the son of an endearing old church-going couple, on the subject of their personal experiences raising gay children, and we see the perspectives on those stories through interviews with those children, now grown.
Karslake says that when he first came out to his parents he said that his dad used to call his answering machine and leave Bible verses on the machine.
It's the twenty first century, man.
If wishes could come true, then everyone would watch this film with an open mind if only to find out if afterward, they were still willing to throw the first stone of "righteousness".
I didn't know what to expect at first from this movie.
And Gene Robinson, who made international news by becoming the first openly gay bishop.
This short, which I must confess has two characters I find very unappealing, starts out marvelously for about the first 90 seconds, but the action quickly turns almost entirely to a series of setups for a running gag which is repeated (to varying degrees of effectiveness) so often that it starts to get tedious.
The movie just sort of ends, a common trait amongst low budget 1970's American produced horror that should not have been made in the first place.
After a very promising first fifteen minutes, including a very decent and gory kill scene, this movie unfortunately what follows is a laughable mess that doesn't know if it wants to be a slasher movie, a mystery, or a cops-chase-bad guy who has nothing to do with the plot- flick!
The first act must end at the bedroom scene where Ashley/Pres forgets he came up the steps to cane his lady.
It starts off OK with the first killing of a couple, albeit a cheaply staged one.
With dreadful production values, acting to match, several interminably dull scenes of inane dialogue between the law and a variety of viable suspects, some equally inane chit-chat from the stupid couples who visit the drive-in (they keep on coming, despite the presence of a maniac), a totally incongruous scene where a machete wielding loon is pursued through a warehouse by the cops, an ending that fails to resolve matters (preferring instead to rely on the old 'the killer might be amongst you' gimmick), and very little in the way of gore after the first few minutes, Drive In Massacre will test the patience of even the most avid fan of grade-Z horror.
The first and most important thing to say about DRIVE-IN MASSACRE is that it is, in fact, a very poorly done movie.
At first, it seems like the killer only targets young couples who are prematurely pregnant.
Saddly, his role here was his first and last.
Naushaus, also appearing here in his only film role, was the embodiment of the anal-retentive schmuck we all endured at our first summer job.
They do not see that they have nothing to offer in terms of innovation, because their perspective lacks the stipulation that someone in entertainment, or any kind of story-telling capacity, should have to have anything to offer in the first place.
That play on words comes out of Megadeth's first album title.
I was into it from the great opening sequence where a young boy puts on his monster makeup and joins his friends in making their first creature epic in the backyard, with their little film cameras.
The first Mark Borchardt is filming a movie called Scare Me, a horror story about an author battling evil.
These are the first set of words that are uttered in Christopher Garetano's documentary Horror Business.
Cult movie critic Joe Bob Briggs offers his three rules of film-making which are hilarious, Troma king Lloyd Kaufman stops by and "Fangoria" editor Tony Timpone gives his insight on the state of horror today versus when he first started at "Fangoria".
He even opens his film with every young filmmaker's first experience Â making a horror movie with their siblings or friends in their backyard with dad's movie camera.
As engaging as always, Mark actually seems to have lost his drive after this previous film Coven in the late 90's and we get to watch him regain it with his first feature Scare Me.
This is a must for all fans of the show, and it explains how Bernard met Penny for the first time.
At first blush I thought "Stardom" had the appearance of a film worth watching with sufficient talent on its roster to ensure some kind of entertainment.
Blaine de Castillon(Frank Lanangella) has his desires set on her, and pounces at the first opportunity , to woo and wed his pretty prize.
I just saw "Jezebel" for the first time on DVD.
at first i thought that it can't be that bad, just that the start is just lame, and later on the movie will be funny,,,, but hey, my mistake...it even got worse !!
In the first 15 minutes of the movie, I was starting to wonder about where James Lew was going with this show, and if he could pull it off successfully.
In fact, each time I watch this movie I repeat that scene several times, for the fact that laughing so hard I miss things, and because of how hilarious it is in the first place.
Let me clarify, the first 20 minutes that I forced down were absolutely horrible.
His travails are recorded by first time documentary maker, ever enthusiastic fan Ronald Mack (Maurice Patten).
Crumb's work is morbid, satirical, drug-inspired, occasionally racist (for a purpose), ultra-sexual (the Fritz the Cat adaptation film of his work was the first X-rated animated feature), and funny in most respects.
The first time I saw Crumb the movie, I suppose I was a tad too young to grip what was going on.
But something I didn't pick up on the first viewing was all the emotion this documentary delivered.
Robert Crumb emerges as a man who isn't as strange as he first appears.
A few minutes in, my first impressions of Robert were he was a quirky cartoonist.
And, yet, I first saw this movie at a theater in Baltimore where the lobby was chock full of Crumb comic picture cards, mugs, etc.
The fact is the first thing discussed in the film is what motivates Crumb's art, what is he trying to express.
I first found out about R. Crumb through "Fritz The Cat" even though he was opposed to the movie (which I must say I thoroughly enjoyed!)
When I first saw this film at an art house in L.A.
Robert Morley (as Louis XVI) elicits more sympathy, due to an almost oafish, but sensitive, portrayal; he is impressive, in his first feature film.
Davis's Julie has a remarkably blind spot about how far womens rights have gone in the age of Millard Fillmore, for it is only four years since the first womens suffrage conference was held in New York State.
William Wyler does do a first rate job of directing - as in what is an early highpoint of the film: Pres teaching Davis' Julie a lesson by humiliating her at the "Nimbus" ball for wearing a scarlet dress.
This is my first film with Norma Shearer and it's probably going to be my last.
To this horrible accusation, the former queen, "the Widow Capet" or simply "Antoinette Capet" replied with the genuine royal dignity, "If I have not replied it is because Nature itself refuses to respond to such a charge laid against a mother..."   I did not like Sophia Coppola's boring horror in pink but I truly enjoyed the older film which was released on DVD for the first time on October 10, 2006.
Norma Shearer is very convincing playing a naÃ¯ve average young woman in a beginning of the movie and she makes you forget that she was 20 years older than Antoinette in the first scenes.
The first half -- before the entre act, that is -- is a kind of late 18th-century soap opera.
I first saw this excellent and powerful story on television sometime in the late 50's or early 60's, and had not seen it since until I caught it on television more than 40 years later.
She got the first call on properties at MGM with the exception of Greta Garbo.
Historical accuracy  The film's script is based (in part) on Stefan Zweig's groundbreaking biography of the Queen, "Marie Antoinette, Portrait of an Ordinary Woman", which tried to create the first accurate, adult, factual but Freudian-inspired narrative of the Queen's life by using documents and correspondence that had long been overlooked or suppressed.
The book was the first to reveal Louis XVI's mechanical sexual problems, which prevented his consummating the marriage during its first seven years (until a slight surgical intervention) and explained in turn the Queen's extravagant spendthrift personality, in Freudian terms, as extreme sexual frustration.
Norma Shearer  Norma Shearer is an unjustly forgotten star of the first magnitude.
You first start the movie with Marie Antoinette finding out she is to be married to Louis the XVI, then during the film so much goes on that you sort of have a hard time keeping up with how much time has past in her life, until finally you get to the crucial part in the film where her and her husband are to be executed.
Years in planning and preproduction, "Marie Antoinette" was Norma Shearer's first film after Irving Thalberg's death: little expense was spared in making the "First Lady of MGM"'s return to the screen a royal one in every sense.
But it is, first and foremost, Shearer's film and she is superb.
During their first kiss, she held on so long the kiss had to be edited down.
She is soon disillusioned at her first meeting with the timid, uninspiring Louis who proves to be an inattentive husband, frigid in his relations with his young beautiful wife... Louis lacks self-confidence and is completely dominated by his grandfather, King Louis XV...
Most directors make the viewer wait at least twenty minutes before hitting them with their first jolt of adrenalin-rushing excitement, but Winner can't wait that long, so within the first ten minutes we see Kersey's wife and daughter attacked and raped in their own apartment by three drugged-out hooligans.
At first he just puts some rolled-up quarters in a sock and carries it with him as insurance, at one point fighting off an attempted mugging - but after a lengthy trip to Tucson where he makes friends with a client who turns out to be a gun collector, he decides to arm himself seriously, and a one man (and five movie) war on crime begins...
It does get a bit more disturbing as it goes along, and we see Kersey acting first, deliberately getting himself into situations where he might be in danger, and then blowing people away before they even have a chance to go at him.
This movie is even better than when it first came out in 1974.
One night while walking, a junkie tries to rob him, and becomes Bronson's first vigilante kill.
One year later, when a violent outbreak of Yellow Fever plagues the south for the first time in 22 years, Fonda returns home again; but it will be an unpleasant shock for the headstrong and vengeful Davis.
The first signs of him knowing what's around him on the streets at night (and one of the funnier bits of the film's bleakness) is when he takes a sock full of quarters to use on the hoodlums.
It is not an easy transition to make by any means--after his first kill, he breaks down and vomits the moment he reaches home.
Followed by 4 script-free episodes the first episode had inspired millions worldwide.
One night back home in New York City taking a stroll in the park with the gun on him Kersey is accosted by a local junkie who pulls a handgun on him but Kersey draws first and shoots and kills him.
Sick at first over what he did, killed a human being, Kersey like a wild beast from the jungle tasting blood for the fist time begins to roam the streets of New York at night for prey.
He was given a .32 pistol as a going away present by a gun-loving millionaire...   Back in New York, Bronson carries one night his gift, and kills the first mugger who was molesting him...
The first one was the hardest!
At first he just stumbles into traps set up by muggers or happens on a crime taking place; later on the other hand it's clear that he's actually inviting attacks by making himself a target.
The acting is great and for me this is the first time I think I learned something about normal Japanese everyday life through a movie.
At first, it just seems like he's the victim of some bad luck.
Her first (problematic) husband disappears during the war; she gets a rich and handsome second husband who's only shortcoming seems to be that he's not truly attentive to her sons from her first marriage.
So it's a perfect ending for Elizabeth--her unattractive, preachy first husband is now permanently out of the way and she can look forward to a more satisfying marriage with the handsome and agreeable Lawrence.
I cannot name the magic phenomena which appears to surround it.I first saw it on British TV about four years ago when it first made its impression upon me since which time I have been drawn to it like a magnet for some unexplainable reason.
2) Catherine O'Hara: Her insanity is set in stone almost from the first time we hear her speak.
The directing is lazy, the plot at first glance seems interesting enough but Scorsese does his best to bring it down and ends up with a stretched, repetitive, sequence of encounters with various deadbeats, and lowlife losers, which we are apparently supposed to show some interest in.
The pace seems deceptively slow on the first screening, but on repeated viewings it becomes clear that not a moment nor line is wasted, and that every little action links to something yet to occur or something that has already passed.
William Wyler directs this first rate costume drama and Ms. Bette Davis picks up her second Academy Award playing an Antebellum Dixie vixen that goes a little too far to make her fiance(Henry Fonda)jealous.
It starts off slowly, nothing of much interest occurs in the first 20 minutes of the film.
The first time I watched it, I'd never heard of the thing but was quite willing to gamble 10 minutes of my valuable time..an hour later I was hooked!
I have to mention writing which is absolutely brilliant, considering that it was the first work by Joseph Minion.
After their first work together on After Hours, Scorsese and Ballhause would make The Color of Money (1986), The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), Goodfellas (1990), Gangs of New York (2002), and The Departed (2006).
I saw this when this first came out about 19 (!)
Our film deals with a mild-mannered Manhattan office worker taking a late night trip to the Soho district to meet up with a beautiful woman he first encountered earlier in the evening.
After Hours may not be for all tastes, but this critic first saw it back in junior high and never forgot what a treasure it is.
I do not know how many times I have seen this movie along my life, maybe ten times, but it still attracts me and now I have just seen it for the first time on DVD.
This brings up my first observation, though, on Scorcese: his stunning and beautiful camera work.
You like him from the very first scene and you follow his adventures with excitement and dread.
Unfortunately, the experiment goes awry, and Eddie suddenly develops a square afro, takes to wearing ankle boots, and sneaks out at night... and one of his first victims is an ugly white woman with a really bad hair-do and bad taste in pink nighties.
When i first started watching it I was under the impression it was about 70 minutes.
The first one who dies is a male nurse that would verbally assault him for going to Vietnam and wouldn't give him ice cream.
One of the first things you'll notice on the DVD is that the print is really, really bad--though it does get a bit better later.
Using sets from the original 1931 "Frankenstein," as well as similar art direction, "Blackenstein" was a movie that tried hard to be legitimate, and the first half of the film rises above typical exploitation schlock.
The improvement from Donnie's first two films is right on the screen.
It takes a while for Ira to get to the bottom of what's been going on between Birdwell and the Whitings but with the help of screwy pseudo-philosophical Margo, who turns out to be a lot smarter then Ira at first thought, he puts all the pieces together.
I saw this film when it first came out nearly 30 years ago, and then watched it again recently.
This becomes extremely frustrating when the first time is revealed to have been a dream sequence, and the scene is repeated.
Why not in the first three minutes?
These movies don't even appeal to a crowd that has actually had sex without pies, bananas, or wannabe barbie dolls with no acting skill (beg pardon to those of you whose first times really were like this, you have my sympathy).
This was Bette Davis's first film with director William Wyler who she admired above all other directors.
Unlike Davis's first Oscar for Dangerous which she said was a consolation for not winning for Of Human Bondage, this one she was proud of.
I am not pleased to say this, but so far, this is the first movie ever that I was completely unable to finish.
I read through all the comments and realized that this will be about the first negative comment submitted about Godzilla 2000.
For the first time ever, I'd get to see Godzilla on the big screen.
It's always hard to figure out where the movie exists in the Godzilla canon (there are basically four eras: The first two movies, the movies after that up until the initial series ended in 1975, then the revivial in the eighties that began with Godzilla 1985 and ended with Godzilla Vs. Destroyah, and now this film), but it seems to begin another era of G-films, with no apparent links to any of the other ones, other than the original movie Gojira.
***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** The first Godzilla movie in the third movie series, whereas GODZILLA VS. DESTOROYAH, the previous entry, aptly ended the second series.
I was neither bothered by the orange-colored Radioactive Heat Beam (most fans are used to blue), nor Godzilla's green tone (this is the first time Toho made Godzilla officially green, whereas he had an ambiguous green-gray tone).
For the first time, Godzilla was played by former JAC stuntman Tsutomu Kitagawa (a veteran of Toei's Sentai Series), who just started out in the Toho Monster genre (he played King Ghidorah in MOTHRA 3).
The Millennian, Toho's first CGI monster, is a really bizarre creation, and Orga reminds me of GINO (the intention) as if over-mutated by comic-book artist Todd McFarlane!
This is his second FX direction job (his first was MOTHRA 3).
Takehiro Murata, no stranger to Godzilla films (he appeared in 1992's GODZILLA VS. MOTHRA and 1995's GODZILLA VS. DESTOROYAH), takes his first lead Godzilla film role as Yuuji Shinoda, who runs GPN (Godzilla Prediction Network) with his little daughter Io (Mayu Suzuki), and wants to study Godzilla to discover the secrets to life.
There is also a bit of dead zone where godzilla isn't around between godzilla's first encounter the flying saucer and the final battle, but it is not to bad.
"Godzilla 2000," actually completed in 1999 (and was released during the summer of 2000 in America), was the first Toho-backed kaiju-eiga film to receive a major theatrical distribution in the U.S. since 1985.
The previous generation (the first two movies at least) had really beautiful and thoughtful effects that put you into wonder about how they were achieved.
This was maybe the first movie dealing with the Victorian period that I saw and wasn't an utter drag.
Taking an actual 1855 robbery (probably the first really great theft committed on a train - of gold bullion needed in for the Crimean War), Crichton examined the existence of the very rich and privileged and the very, very poor in the slums.
It was nearly certain that 1903's "The Great Train Robbery," popularly known as the first movie, would be remade in some form at some point.
Prolific novelist and erstwhile doctor Crichton, in his first directorial effort, exercises firm control in bringing his own novel to the screen, seeming to know exactly what he wants to say & how to say it.
Each of the four keys are stored separately so finding them & copying them is the first thing Edward & his men need to do, then the hard work really starts...
The First Great Train Robbery wasn't the first by any means but definitely still stands as a great heist film that has eye catching period detail, a good solid plot & a great cast.
Based on the movie's director Michael Criton's book about the real life events surrounding the world's first train robbery on May 15, 1855, where thousands of dollars worth of gold was stolen.
The first thing you'll notice is the costumes worn by everybody on screen.
The first half of the film is Connery and Sutherland investigating the location of each key, its owner, and a possible weakness in the keys' owner.
Their first target is Mr Edgar Trent, head of the bank entrusted with the dispatch of the gold.
This is how the first segment of the film is organized, through the investigation and acquisition of each key which is duplicated care of Sutherland.
In fact the first part of the plan which took about a year in preparation was to get duplicates of four keys that unlock the safe on the train where the bullion is transported.
Wow, this is a wonderfully-filmed movie that especially looked good since it was one of the first DVDs I purchased a decade ago.
As my first viewing from the newly released Warner Film Noir Volume 4 boxset, I found it an unmitigated success, there's also a hilarious and very entertaining commentary from Noir luminaries Eddie Muller and James Ellroy, although the latters barking like a dog does grate just a little
The movie replays the same plot over from the first candy-man movie, minus any real horror or suspense, while D'Errico prances about in very tight clothes, panties, and tank tops made for infants.
This was my first time seeing Donna D'Errico, and it was painless.
I liked the first one.the second was poor and not helped by the narration by a DJ.This is far worse with a very low budget,a terrible script.and for a horror film minus scares chills and thrills.The acting is bad and the movie is just rubbish.1 out of 10
The first thirty minutes seem like nothing more than a cheesy soft-porn movie which is regrettably the best thing I can really say about this movie in terms of storyline.
If only the movie had not tried to continue from the first sequel with such a senseless premise and had decided whether it were a horror or a soft porn film then maybe something good could have been created.
I have not seen the first sequel and I have no intention whatsoever to even think about renting it.
I was quite disappointed watching this movie because in no way does it live up to the first one.
I love the first two Candyman movies, they were creepy, scary and they had a plot.
The first two "Candyman" films were interesting, well paced horror films.
The first two films in the series Â Candyman and Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh Â were creepy, well-acted and sublimely scary.
The most offensive aspect of the film, though, is its storyline, recycled from bits and pieces of the first two films to the point of idiocy.
while i actually liked the first two Candyman movies,i didn't' like this third and(so far Final)installment.i found it boring and repetitive and i didn't like the story very much.there's a lot of filler here,which suggests to me that the filmmakers didn't have enough of a story for a complete movie.i also wasn't too impressed with the acting.there was a lot of overwrought theatrics.as well,there were some things in this movie that did not fit with the previous movies,basically throwing out certain aspects of the lore.maybe i'm just imagining things,but this is my opinion on things.finally,this movie has none of the style of the second movie.adding it all up,this third installment in the series is much lower in quality on all counts.my vote for Candyman 3:Day of the dead is a 3/10
'Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers', 'A Nightmare On Elm Street 2', 'Childs Play 3', and 'Candyman 3' all have something in common.If you're thinking that they're all sequels, you are right, but there's something else.All of these movies are examples of underrated sequels.I liked all of these movies and I don't care what other people have to say about them.I thought that 'Candyman 3: Day of the Dead' was a pretty decent horror movie with another groundbreaking performance by Tony Todd.Nobody will ever play a better Candyman than him.That's a fact that we horror fans should know.I haven't seen the 2nd movie yet, but I do have to say that the first and the third were pretty good.Maybe the third wasn't as good as the first, but I still found it to be a good movie.After you're finished reading my review, I want you to go to a mirror and say Candyman 5 times.If he shows up and tries to kill you, then it serves you right for thinking that this movie was totally pointless.If the Candyman franchise wants to be really popular, then there needs to be a 4th installment.Let's hope that Tony Todd is willing to play Candyman again.
"Day of the Dead", the 3rd of the Candyman movies, is really just the first two movies put together.
It opens well,but it rapidly descends into the worst Candyman film of the series.The first and foremost problem is that it is just not scary at all,ever.It's pretty gory here and there (much like it's predecessors) but at no point does it ever jolt you or put any sense of dread into you.Another thing is that the performances are absolutely rubbish.D,Errico is okay in the lead role,even though she kept reminding me of Midlands glamour model Jakki Degg (she looks about ten years younger than she actually is,too),but Todd,as the Candyman,is here unable to liven up the proceedings,just robotically churns out his lines much less effectively than in his last two outings as the titular monster and even appears slightly bored,like he popped a valium or two before filming began.The supporting cast are what really weigh the film down,the most witless,inept bunch of hopeless nobodies who'd probably have trouble getting work in a daytime TV show (except maybe the one who played Caroline's mum!)
This is the first 10 minutes of the film, then the remaining 90 minutes is all talking,(low key), It does get more dramatic towards the end.
The first frantic scenes, the paranoia throughout, the looks the characters exchange, it feels right.
At the conclusion, you may feel a bit disappointed, but you can help wipe that away by recalling the first 15 min of the film - that alone makes the movie more than average fare.
I think the first thing that should be noted is that the film differs greatly from McEwan's excellent page turner.
One that is actually hard to sell to potential first time viewers.
This passage of the film, roughly the first half, was rivetingly significant to me.
Jed, who has tried to have Joe look at the dead man, is a man who, at first, seems harmless, but he will reappear again in the story.
Well this is the first time I felt compelled to comment on any films here.
The first scene is very promising, after that is one mistake after another.
The first highly unusual aspect is that it begins as a quirky "art-house drama" from which emerges a surreal, tragic event in the opening, and which gradually transforms into a thriller ala Brian De Palma, all while keeping one foot firmly planted in the art-house drama arena.
It was the first time that I've watched a Ida Lupino film, but it will not be the last.
If you take this little gem for what it is: A low budget film by a first time director, with a volunteer cast & crew filmed on location at Celebration II (a Star Wars convention), it's a masterpiece.
This is a first class musical.
Ms. Pilgrim is assigned to Boston where she is the first woman employed by a solid old firm that only employs male personnel.
The plot followed a much-used noir formula: the man whose past comes back to haunt him â as an ex-con (Gene Nelson) is forced by three fugitives (including Bronson and Ted de Corsia), after deliberately compromising his parole and threatening his wife, into first harboring them and then take part in their proposed bank robbery (by which time theyâve enrolled other dangerous elements to their fold, notably a typically-nutty Timothy Carey).
Its the first time in a young person's life when they can get out into the real world and see what lies in wait for them.
Steve Buscimi completes the primary cast as Seymour, a jazz/blues geek who Enid takes on as her first mission once she graduates, finding in him a sort of spiritual corollary.
The first act consists of Enid and Rebecca observing and critiquing the world around them.
It's both hilarious (really one of the funniest films I've ever seen - Enid's yard sale, her first day of work at a movie theater, just to name a couple of favourite scenes, crack me up every time) and moving, with a bittersweet feel to it that's underlined by David Kitay's musical theme.
The first time I saw this movie I f***ing went insane!
I saw it on the first day of school that year, so it started me off pumped.
The first half of the movie, though, was one of the funniest, darkest setups I have ever seen.
These two are somewhat similar to the central villains in the first Star Wars trilogy - Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine, although it is doubtful that either of these legendary movie villains would have tolerated the many failures that Zoltar endured.
Add the revealing Locke-centered flashbacks, which begin with a brilliant misdirection about his "disability" and contain the biggest shock since the bus scene from "Not In Portland", and you have the best of the first 13 Season 3 episodes, along with "Flashes Before Your Eyes".
All the time I was watching I didn't recognise the Holmes I saw on the screen, indeed, for the first ten minutes, I assumed Holmes was some other man to further the story along, until Watson followed him and called him by name.
From the first few minutes of conversation it was already evident that this was not the friendship that Holmes and Watson should have.
The last 25 minutes or so woke me up and got me re-interested with the slight twists, turns, and wows but the first 90+ was a pretty big Yawn Question Mark Yawn.
Not suitable for a first date, but definitely a movie you should see with someone with whom you can talk openly afterwards.
But the execution is what raises the bar here, particularly in the first third when the police bring in all the usual suspects.
It certainly takes some of the shine off Kubrick's subsequent The Killing Â it certainly got there first in terms of its look, and it's probably no accident that Kubrick hired two of the cast for his own caper movie.
The film does briefly give into sentimentality at the end Â though very, very begrudgingly Â and it's never quite as good as that powerhouse first third, but it's certainly a sharp punch below the belt to the cop movie that you won't forget in a hurry.
Secondly, Although it is over 60 years since the horrors were first brought to the attention of the world, there are millions who were not born or know nothing or very little about how the human race can be, and still are, so cruel and evil against its fellow man.
But, first husband Welles really didn't die -- he was only badly wounded.
Such a scary, harrowing movie moment... Mira Sorvino was a joy, and be prepared, you won't recognize her at first.
When I saw the first few minutes of this film, and those horrible buildings and the piles of ash that were still there when I visited, it brought everything back, but told a story I didn't know much about.
I watched the 'Grey Zone' some months before I left, and yes to echo some I found the acting somewhat overdone in places and the first bit of the movie rather confusing.
The confusion you might feel in the first part of the film is what you *should* feel.
For the first third of the film, the script is obtuse, confusing, and disconnecting -- as it should be, considering that we may as well be taking the point of view of someone who just arrived on a train and entered the gates of hell.
The first leader replies, something to the effect that, after what he has seen and done, he does not want to live!
This is one of the many instances* (it may have been the first one, in fact) where they play Franz Liszt's inimitable "Hungarian Rhapsody #2".
When I first watched this cartoon short ages ago, I was amazed by the film itself.
In particular of note was when the two lesbian lovers first discovered themselves.
For those who say the film is not well shot, i thought it was beautifully shot, the first kiss was magical, not because of the kiss, but because of the location.
Cap is thawed out, and his first objective will be to stop the Red Skull?
Cap must stop him before it is too late, and at the same time, he must come to grips with the fact that he is in a strange new world and everything he has ever known in gone forever, and that if it hadn't been for him failing to defeat Skull the first time, many people would still be alive.
The Red Skull's make up in the first half of the film is breath taking, and Scott Paulin (with a great assist from the script) gives more character depth to the Red Skull than I've ever seen in the comics.
He is a ill prepared looser who gets his butt kicked in his first ever fight.
The problem is they apparently ran out of money after the first scene.
Dude, my advice is if you're going to make a movie about a comic book hero please read it first.
The General was one of the first silent movies that I was ever able to sit though long enough to fully appreciate the medium.
KEVIN: After much talk of the genius of Buster Keaton and his seminal masterpiece, we finally convinced our parents to watch The General with us, on the condition that they must be sucked in within the first 30 minutes.
Many of the best gags in the film are in the first half hour, including the bits with the planks of wood, and Keaton's gut-busting deadpan double take to yet another bizarre mishap, which had all of us laughing.
The Andrews Raiders were the first people Abe Lincoln awarded with the Congressional Metal of Honor.
It came out the same year as the first major talkie, which certainly scared the bejesus out of Keaton.
Overall: 8/10 and a great first film for anyone who wants to broaden their horizons by watching films made in the "pre-talkies" era.
I remember when I first saw this movie.
The plot and story are simple, but exist more than to just help the comedy move along--except at the end when the first story was accomplished.
The first one comes right at the beginning, when we see Johnny being followed by two kids and a woman, in a line much like a train.
After my first viewing, it instantly became one of my favorites.
When Lesney did it famous series of "Models of Yesteryear" the first locomotive that was included in that series of collectible toys was "The General".
Johnny eventually is the only person who tries to retake "the General" from the raiders, and the film has actually two chases in it - first Andrews and his men stealing the train, and then Keaton sneaking into Northern lines with Mack and retaking it.
He was Mike "Turkey Strut" Donlin, a frequent member (and starring player) of the old New York Giants under John McGraw and Christy Matthewson in the first two decades of the 20th Century.
His first certainty was that the production had to be "so authentic it hurts."
Even today, people who have heard it acclaimed as one of the greatest movies of all time are sometimes puzzled or disappointed by it on first viewing.
The hero-worshippers are ready to follow, but Johnnie lets them out first, then closes the door on them.
Taking a shortcut he manages to be the first in line.
I am embarrassed to admit that I am 23 and this is the first time I've seen this film, however now that I have I will be certain to go out and purchase any Buster Keaton film I can get my hands on.
Personally, I think it's one of the first films to push the envelope of movies Â it goes for action, romance, and humor, and it pulls all of those elements together into a terrific movie.
Even if you never seen it first time its still an enjoyable watch, but just remember it was shot on a 70's TV show budget (a UK one at that) so its not a major production.
When people talk about it and you mention that you were there they tend to look at you like you are lying, at first they just don't believe it, you really do, sometime's, have to prove it.
's entry in the CinemaScope Bible race...  Lana was cast as Samarra, the lightly-clad temptress who incited history's first juvenile delinquent to leave homeÂ   The film was based on the Biblical story of the prodigal son as told by St. Luke in Chapter XV of his gospelsÂ There, in fewer than 300 words is the bare suggestion of a youth who "wasted his substance in riotous living," later to return, repentant to farm and fatherÂ   The screenplay portrayed the prodigal as Micah (Edmond Purdom), the model son of a Hebrew patriarch named Eli (Walter Hampden).
There are a lot of preconceived notions about "drug dramas," but this film should be seen first and foremost as a human drama.
Full of affectation and the embodiment of conceit, not surprising of a first film, especially considering that Gunnerson was the writer, director, editor, and composer.
Sure it has a few clichÃ©d set pieces and a few moments of wooden acting, but after the first 30 minutes or so it pans out to be a nicely put together movie.
I had the privilege of viewing ARC, and the first thing that came to mind was that the trailer did not do this movie justice.
Taking the starring role, Peter Facinelli (The Big Kahuna, Scorpion King, Fastlane) delivered a first rate performance the former police officer turned drug addict, Paris Pritchert.
This is the first time I have ever commented on a film at IMDb.com... and let me tell you... God Damn Amazing.
This is your first feature film and you stole the show.
On the eve of the opening of his first gallery show, a photographer remembers that special summer that he spent with his somewhat older cousin, the feelings that were awakened, and the unexpected turn of events behind his "best" photo.
And then everything changes in an instant -- an instant captured by the young photographer's first photograph.
I first saw Explorers when I was 6, not long after the movie came out and still remains a film that can be watched again.
Explorers was the first film he made after Gremlins, but it failed to strike a chord with audiences.
The first half dwells on the three lads gradually coming together, and combining their skills for the common goal of exploring space.
Like the kids themselves at first it seems strange and disappointing that the mysterious of the universe turn out to be a couple of TV junkies, but afterwards they/you realise what good time was had.
Loved it when I first saw it.
When I first watched this movie, me, a cousin and an uncle who was our age, were a sort of trio!
For me it was the first time I saw Ethan Hawke play as young as that age (15).
Still despite this it does have a good first half and the message in the third act is interesting even if it's hidden under bad joke and horrible dialog.
The first half of this movie is fantastic, especially when they decide to build a ship to put into the force field they've managed to create.
Still the first half is great fun.
Watched it again on it's first run on VHS and now I own the DVD.
I have a soft spot in my heart for this underrated Joe Dante pic, though I'm the first to admit it has more than a few problems.
There's an overwhelming sense of child-like wonder during the first half (and again at the finale), but the scenes in the alien ship are dreadfully out of place and hinder the movie's power.
The humor comes from strange places, and truly lands in bizarro world during the last act, but it captured my imagination seamlessly when I first saw it at the age of eleven.
They then take their device for a rather humorous test drive, but near the end of their first run something seems to take control of their ship...they avoid disaster and then another dream shows them how to make a device that seems to provide air.
According to the video box, it was the first full-length American-made film, but that is debatable--as several films have made that claim and exactly what constitutes "full-length" is pretty vague.
USELESS FACTS: Look for Sheri Moon Zombie as Daisy Rain, the first victim; The writers of Toolbox Murders, Jace Anderson and Adam Gierash (who played handyman Ned), were later chosen by none other than Dario Argento to write the screenplay for the long-awaited third installment in the three Mothers trilogy, the recently announced Mater Lachrymarum.
She plays Daisy Rain, a would be actress who plays what I call the Janet Leigh character: remember the very first time you saw PSYCHO and then boom the whole story dynamic shifted?
The last third of the film is an improvement over the lethargic first two thirds, but the movie ends refusing to explain itself.
As is clear from the first frame onward, Tobe Hooper's stylish update of "Toolbox" is determined to take the material in a supernatural direction, and for the most part, is successful.
But after hearing the dieing screams of her neighbour, she begins to realise that the complex has more to its history than first meets the eye.
I first seen Tarzan Finds a Son when I was quite young and have seen it several times since.
As well as Johnny Weissmuller as Tarzan and Maureen O'Sullivan as Jane, the cast also features Johnny Sheffeld in his first role as Boy, British actor Ian Hunter and Henry Stephenson.
Aimed at the matinÃ©e crowd, this particular instalment features none of the graphic nastiness or raciness that can be found in the first two Tarzan films (the obligatory native killing at the end of the filmÂvia a huge skull-cracking deviceÂis brief and non-explicit); instead, we get mild peril as Boy is attacked by pipe-cleaner tarantulas and a back-projected rhino, comic relief courtesy of Cheetah the chimp, and a lot of fun interplay between Tarzan and his 'son', the best scene being an impressively shot moment of underwater horseplay.
If there are any draw backs to the film it would come in two places, first the basic structure of some one coming into the jungle to find some one, Boy here, Jane in the previous two films, was clichÃ© almost from the get go.
At first Tarzan becomes jealous of Jane's full attention towards the child, but in time becomes fond of him also, and being the "father," names him Boy.
What is it about the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan films that seem to be as entertaining today as they were when first released.
Quietly beautiful Dorothy Wilson first started work as a "secretary to the stars".
This film, at first glance, seems like it is going to be a light piece of college romantic fluff, with all the college kids drooling over each other and the guys trying to convince the girls to "drop some of their morals".
The first date scene was at its best, also.
The Bergen (Norway) Cinema director in 1995 had the sense - at the time when this ghastly film was first (and never again!)
Anyone who can sit through that without yawning 5 or 6 times or more may have a chance to sit through the first one or two sections of DIS without getting fidgety.
jumps into the sack, first thing with Paul - whether or not that's so, it's none of our business.
Linda was instrumental in bringing about a change in the way supermarkets treated vegetarians and she got them to stock suitable goods for the first time.
I just saw the movie for the second time yesterday and I liked it even more than I did the first time.
Phantom Raiders was the second (the first being 1939 Nick Carter - Master Detective) and the last film directed by Jacques Tourneur about the adventures of a popular detective Nick Carter whose character was created still in the end of the 19th century and who served as a protagonist of several films before this one during the silent era.
Soon they discover that a nightclub owner Al Taurez is involved, but very soon our heroes discover to their disappointment that he's a bit tougher then appears to be at first sight.
The movie sounded interesting when it first came out but somehow I missed seeing it when it came out and, years later when it came to television was really looking forward to seeing it.
Also, some of the camera angles were interesting at first, but as the plot and the overall content of the film left much to be desired, the angles began to really get on my nerves after a while.
"Autumn Born" marked Dorothy Stratten's first movie role in a career that would only last about a year, until her untimely death at age 20 in 1980.
Odd to term a 1995 film as an 'older movie', but SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT was rather dismissed in its initial release as a bit of fluff: looking at the film now reveals a tight little message movie garnished with a fine writer (Callie Khouri - 'Thelma and Louise', 'Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood'), and first class director (Lasse HallstrÃ¶m - 'Casanova', 'An Unfinished Life', 'The Shipping News', 'Chocolat', 'The Cider House Rules', 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' etc), and a cast that has not only grown in importance from the time of this film but has also become acknowledged as the creme of the cinema.
Surprisingly Rowlands wasn't that good at first--way too muted but she eventually got better and is wonderful in a scene in which she tells off Duvall.
Directed by first time feature helmer Patricia Riggen, the movie follows both mother and son characters in separate threads, having been separated for many years, but keeping in touch through weekly Sunday telephone calls from public phone booths both sides.
I would highly recommend Under The Same Moon aka La Misma Luna, at first I was not sure whether this movie would be a movie I would watch but after watching it, I had a different perspective.
A hit at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival, first time director Patricia Riggen's Under The Same Moon or La Misma Luna (in Spanish) is that rare film that's about real people dealing with life's issues that resonate in today's hectic and cruel world.
At first, he wants nothing to do with him as he, too, is in the states illegally, but then becomes a father figure, realizing the chiquito needs all the help he can get.
I went to a local independent film theater not knowing what to except to see my first independent film.
There is a character named Enrique that you first think what has he got to do with anything but before long you realize he is so important to the overall feel of the film and reminds us that we are all tied to each other in some way.
This is the first movie I saw in a long time that I could not guess what was going to happen next.
A mother gets up before the sun rises on Los Angeles to take the first of many buses to get to the first of her two housecleaning jobs.
Vera Farmiga (playing 'Fiona') and Nick Stahl (bringing 'Isaac' to life) get two endlessly interesting characters thrown their way by first timer Carlos Brooks, and they know what to do with the material.
Isaac is the first person to see Fiona make her 'debut' in public in a wheelchair.
At first, microphone in hand, he wants the story.
In the first, Astaire is hauled to the foot of a staircase and goes into a spasm of twists, turns, and impossibly rapid taps, his arms flailing about as he twists and turns like a crazed marionette, managing to shake hands with someone in the process.
Folks of my generation might remember that the song got a second life as a doo-wop ballad during the first phase of rock and roll.
Meanwhile, Vinnie soon tires of his new life and resorts to crime - first little things, such as marking down prices on meat in the local grocery store - which results in the best single line in the entire film, when a perky employee greets Vinnie.
His response is a four-letter-word that isn't nearly as (c)rude as it seems it would be at first.
At first she and Barney hate each other.
It's their first film together since "Parenthood."
Which is why I don't understand its small impact when it first arrived in theaters.
The first half of the story was much better than the second half.
The first time I saw it, I had checked it out from the local library and almost didn't return it, due to separation anxiety.
Woody Allen was still in his first phase as a director, not having gone into his Igmar Bergmann period yet.
It's clear his first marriage to Nancy has been a failure.
One of the most remarkable things in PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM is how it becomes the first Woody Allen story to incorporate fantasy as a part of reality in a way that doesn't seem gimmicky.
That's where we first see him almost hypnotized watching the final scene of the 1942 Bogart/Bergman classic Casablanca.
A little slow at first, but once I got into this movie I really enjoyed it.
This was my first Woody Allen movie, and I thought he was funny for the most part.
If you love old movies, or great comedy, or Woody Allen and Diane Keaton in their early prime, then PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM will still deliver the goods 30+ years after its first release.
Working with Keaton clearly inspired him, both comically and dramatically, and this, their first film together, already shows the on screen chemistry that flourished throughout the 1970s.
Keaton is a terrific foil for Allen, both platonically and as it turns out, otherwise, while Tony Roberts as her husband (this being his first of many Allen films, too) makes for a wry straight man with his constant phone calls and his appearances in some fun fantasy send-ups, the best of them in Italian.
Directed not by Allen but by Herbert Ross, it represents the noteworthy first pairing of Allen and Diane Keaton, and the combination of their unerring chemistry and Allen's clever, often hilarious script makes for great viewing after all these years.
Beyond Allen, Keaton shows the first signs of her unmatched comic prowess as Linda, though for the most part, she is called upon to be the conflicted leading lady.
I remember the week I saw Casablanca and Play it Again Sam for the first time.
Woody is absolutely lovable, I almost choked when watching this movie while I was eating because of uncontrolled laughters, especially the scenes of his first date after the divorce.
A warmly funny, enormously likable film, it contains some absolutely hilarious moments (watch for his first blind date and the scene where he follows - and overdoes - the advice that Bogart's ghost gave him to tell Diane Keaton how beautiful she is).
This film also features the first screen pairing of Allen and Diane Keaton, who would, of course, go on to make Allen's masterpiece 'Annie Hall', along with Tony Roberts, who also co-stars here.
When two lethal accidents are caused by seemly harmless insects on a location where estate agents are building a new housing complex, it simply looks like a bizarre coincidence at first.
Unless you're scared of mass numbers of insects (on a TV show) and you like to watch 40 minutes of the most boring investigations of 'Supernatural' so far, then you should give this episode a shot, otherwise feel free to say that the first season had only 21 episodes like i said.
Pretending to be interested in buying a house for their poor, aging father they meet the housing project's head-honcho, who is also the first resident of Oasis Plains.
When a realtor is killed by Spiders in her steam shower, Sam & Dean begin to suspect that there "Willard" type figure is controlling the bugs and their first suspect is Matt.
Also, I like the realtors trying to sell Sam & Dean the house, first assuming that they are a couple and then that they need the house for their "elderly" father.
Also featured are skinny dipping (from Terry Congie who co-starred with Costner in his first film, SIZZLE BEACH USA), a bloody stabbing, a head mashed in a car hood, a magician, a fat lesbian, a cello player and a visible boom mike.
Ramillo is Â¨dumpedÂ¨ onto this island as an exile, but we don't know anything at first about why he's an exile or where he's being exiled from.
This one is Katt's first and it's better than all the rest.
I've heard some of the jokes in other videos, but this first video is his best.
I know I can relate to others when I state that I thought this show was absolutely terrible when it first came out.
The show is hilarious from the start of the first episode till the end of the last.
I am a fan of Family Guy, at least for the first 3 1/2 seasons.
For my first comment on IMDb, i'd like to thank and congratulate the webmasters: this is one of my very favorite places on the internet!
is that because i'm bored after all that hours watching the first and the second season?
They really suck, the first movie was so disappointing and bad, but in the second movie, "The beast with a billion backs" was actually quite good.
The writers of the show admitted that the first movie was terrible and said that they are still finding the right way to do futurama movies (1 movie, 4 episodes) and they have succeeded.
The Simpsons came first, and in its brilliance captured the loyalty of millions upon millions of fans.
A great thing about Futurama is it can go some places where The Simpsons could never touch, seeing as the writers have the whole universe at their disposal, for example we see in the first episode as Fry familiarizes himself with the future.
It has that zany "Simpsons" style of humor.To understand the characters and where the series takes place you should catch first the opening episode called: "Space Pilot 3000", which introduces you to the story.
From the first episode Futurama has you hooked, and you don't get unhooked until the final episode.
This is the first review I've ever written so here it goes.
For example the first known astronauts are the honeymooners because of the line "bang zoom straight to the moon" and the first people on the moon were the "Whalers on the moon."
Hope this kind of helped, but if you skipped all these explanations and came to the bottom I heavily suggest watching this show and start at the first first two episodes of season one and then have fun with the rest (5 season total, 4 volumes of DVD's).
Futurama is probably my favourite Western animation, I first watched it because it was "from the creator of The Simpsons" and found myself preferring it.
The first episode deals with his being frozen in a cryogenic capsule for a thousand years, in the background through the window we see the changing of New York, which has become New New York, and remains the central setting for the series after this episode.
It's geared to kids in the age range of 4-8 and not adults - although I thought it was cute the first time I watched.
At that age, I had digested a lot of bad movies and television (like the Small Wonder sitcom... any sitcom... and movies like Plan 9 and Howard The Duck) but watching this movie was the first time that I had ever pressed the fast-forward button on my VCR because what I was watching was so bad and I wanted it to end.
In one of his first film roles James Stewart as the beleaguered boyfriend of Jean Harlow is wonderful, patient and kind.
this is one very well done film.i wouldn't say it is a comedy,but it certainly is a romance/drama.either way.it's very well written,with snappy dialogue,and great acting by all concerned.there are some real acting heavyweights of the time here.Clark Gable is the headliner,and it's no wonder he was a star.the guy oozes screen presence and charisma even on the small scree.Jean Harlow,called the the ultimate and first true sex symbol sex symbol by some(but also a very talented actress)lends great supporting talent.Myrna Loy(Nora Charles from the Thin Man series of movies,co starring William Powell)is also excellent.James Stewart shows glimmers of his greatness,in a fairly small role,only his fourth credited feature film appearance.there are so many other great supporting players in the cast too numerous to mention.when you have talent like this together,it's hard to have bad film.for me,Wife vs Secretary is a strong 8/10
The film somewhat succeeds in the first respect but fumbles its way through the second.
Let's look at the good first.
The interotron is a screen, similar to a TelePrompTer, that allows the interviewee to look directly into the camera, allowing for a more genuine first person feel to the film.
Astaire-Rogers fans may be disappointed to find them dance only twice in the film together, the first well after the half-hour mark in an informal but energetic tap routine and the second near the end in their standard formal wear.
Also he points out things that you may have missed on first viewing.
The sparkling "I'll Be Hard to Handle" is first introduced by Ginger singing in a mock foreign accent, then she and Fred execute a joyous tap dance that is part of a rehearsal.
Well Soldier Kelly is out and back working as a detective (we have to use our imagination to figure out how)for the first 10 minutes at least.
This one had more and better action then the first 2, and better acting and plot.
There was better characters, not to mention more then in the first.
this was obviously done on a bigger budget then the first one, and I think they tried harder to make this then they did in the inferior predicessors.
Maybe for the first few minutes.
The first half of this film, involving scientists in a Reagan-ear Star Wars Nuclear space station, is intriguing and suspenseful.
Let's get it out of the way first thing: The critics of the 80s like Leonard Maltin and Siskel/Ebert who sadistically maligned DEF-CON 4 as a wretched exercise in scum & sleaze were WRONG.
Much of the population has been wiped out, but those who remain are either savage mutant cannibals (who are first seen carving meat slices off of a severed leg) or unbelievably sadistic punks who imprison innocent people in a slave camp and are led by a fascist Hitler clone (Kenneth King).
the first section of this film on the station is genuinely effective.
And I didn't buy the hanging scene at all, there is no way the kilted survivalist wouldn't have stepped forward and saved his own life at the first opportunity.
I saw this film when it first came out and the disappointment of my memory holds up today.
To be honest, the first half of the movie is totally missable and rather confusing.
But, as the "secrets" of the film were revealed in the first few minutes (duh--it was pretty obvious that young Maureen O'Hara had walked into a nest of vipers), there was no suspense or mystery at all.
I first saw this film when I was nine years old and it scared me to death.
We have to watch them again these old films, these first talkies, to ,be able to appreciate what modern films have to offer but also what we have lost along the way, a lot more than we may think, and particularly the magic of black and white illusion.
The picture is a costume drama with action,suspense,romance,adventures,tension and formidable interpretation.It's a romantic story with exciting images narrated with amazing agility and swiftly,thus murders,storms,shipwrecks,escapes,pursuits..The film along with Â¨Walzes from ViennaÂ¨(1934)and Â¨Under CapricornÂ¨(1949) is one from trio Hitchcock's epoch tale.And is the first of Daphne of Maurier adaptations along with Â¨RebecaÂ¨and Â¨The birdsÂ¨.
Dunne's first two songs aren't bad but you have the rest.
The first of the these two movies is JAMAICA INN.
Emlyn Williams also plays a delightfully sinister and menacing character -- I mistook him at first for Robert Newton (being prejudiced by the latter's subsequent typecasting).
But it was the first of three attempts he made to do a historic film.
It was his first attempt to do a story from novelist Daphne Du Maurier.
This would also be part of the reason for JAMAICA INN's low rating - the following year Hitch would do Du Maurier's REBECCA, as his first Hollywood film, his first film with David Selznick, and it would be his only film to win the Oscar as best picture.
JAMAICA INN would also be the first of two films that Hitch made with Charles Laughton.
So my first viewing was in a lovely old cinema with a perfect print and a big audience.
Laughton's real-life discovery Maureen O'Hara has her first major movie role here, and she's posed prettily and is amusingly irate throughout.
There's no two ways about his wickedness, he's a perfect cad - just catch the way he sizes up Maureen O'Hara's character when she first makes her appearance at his home.
Maureen O'Hara is also amazing in an unusual role in 1939 of a strong woman in her first lead role.
But you only have to watch the cutting in the opening scene of the first shipwreck to know that this is certainly the same man who gave us the shower scene in Psycho.
One little known historical fact that was left out is that Truman's first official act upon becoming President after F.D.R.
I envy anyone seeing this for the first time; I was young when I first saw it and was quite entertained, but couldn't get the most out of it.
I first saw it as a 7 year old in the early 50s and, although unable at the time to appreciate its full qualities, I remained strangely moved by it and have been haunted by it ever since.
To an average first-time viewer, the first hour of this film can drag.
I found that to be the case on my first viewing, but the more I watch this, the better the story seems to have gotten for some reason.
(1949) and "The Third Man" (1949) are the first two films that come to mind.
(2) Orson Welles' first appearance on screen is a real dandy.
And who can forget the first close-up of Welles with the light from an apartment room above splashing onto his face; one of the great entrances in movie history (Lime gives his old friend a smile that only Welles could give).
I was hooked from the first battle scene.
Added bonus: Jarrod Barkley from Big Valley in his first role (he looks exactly the same 20 years earlier).
And for the first 2/3, things are fine, especially since director Davis and writer Kelly add a twist on the "murder" that's smart and surprising.
When I first watched this movie, I thought of it as a "remake" of Dial M for Murder.
When I first viewed this movie I thought it was ok, but when we bought the video it began to grow on me.
Unfortunately, from the first minutes of the movie onward, it becomes quickly self-evident that the movie is a pretentious and failed attempt at trying to be a smart comedy.
I had to go to great lengths to first obtain a PAL copy from France that has no English subtitles, download a subtitle file online, and then use 3 different programs to rip the DVD, process the video and add subtitles, and then burn it to a DVD I could watch on my TV.
Also strikingly different from other movies of the sort is how many cultures are explored, from first world countries to developing nations.
Burt Lancaster plays a major during the Vietnam war when he was actually 65 years old and his age is impressed upon you in the first scene as he scrambles through the wire.
The ensemble cast felt like a stereotypical war movie cast, but the lighter dialogue in the first half of the film starts to give way to the seriousness of the situation.
This is the absolute best movie about the first five years (1959-1964) of the American involvement in Viet Nam ever made.
Just like watching a letterbox film on television, after the first five minutes, my mind settled into the tempo and pacing and I really did enjoy the story.
I first read about this in Fred Olen Ray's fantastic "The New Poverty Row", so when I saw it for $5 at Grimsby Giant Tiger, I scarfed it up.
When the film first came out it was a smash-hit, and it is easy to see why.
If this is the first action movie you have ever seen then you *might* love it, otherwise it should be avoided at all cost.
It was the first movie I ever saw in an aeroplane, on a flight to Detroit to visit relatives for Christmas.
Indeed, I'm struggling to see what attracted Woo to the project in the first place unless he was straining at the leash to work with a resurgent Travolta.
Hard Target came first... but this is the film designed for the big audience, fronted by Travolta.
Elizabeth has a son from her first husband and then a second from Lawrence.
It just so happens that Elizabeth's first husband is not killed and has been severally wounded and finally returns to America with a little girl named Margaret Ludwig, (Natalie Wood).
At first I thought it was over the top, but I really liked the soundtrack(by Hans Zimmer, one of my favorite composers), and as I watched it more for the soundtrack, the over all experience of the movie grew on me.
Usually I'm the first person to label this sort of movie.
I'm not drawing a parallel between the  two--at all!--but people who have seen 'Neon Genesis Evangelion'  will recall how by the end of the first episode you had no idea what  was going on, right alongside the principle character.
This movie  has a similar feel--It's unsettling at first, but ultimately presents  itself as a curiously wonderful juxtaposition of warmth and  coldness; interrelation and alienation.
Enlightenment Guaranteed may seem funny at first but in fact it's very serious and explicitly Buddhist, since it involves two German brothers and their adventures in getting into and out of Japan's Monzen Buddhist monastery.
At first this seems comical, but it quickly becomes a serious crisis.
I first saw "C'est arrivÃ© prÃ¨s de chez-vous"(Man bites dog) about ten years ago and I was amazed by the whole thing.The darkest humor ever,sick violent scenes,and of course,the Man himself.Poelvoorde plays a violent maniac but he's funny and charismatic at the same time.Fast forward to 2005:I realised there was a new movie with that guy that I've never seen in another film.I didn't know that much about Claude Francois,but I had to see Poelvoorde in another role.Here he plays Bernard FrÃ©dÃ©ric,an ex-imitator of Cloclo.He stopped his "career" in show-business when his wife,VÃ©ro, gave an ultimatum.So now he has a boring job,9 to 5, a son, a "normal" life.
To fully live his passion and his admiration for him, he organized provincial tours in which he sang with female dancers "Cloclo"'s most popular songs, flanked by his associate Couscous who assured the first parts of his shows, dressed as Michel Polnareff's double.
Apparently realizing that the first 45 minutes of the film are unbelievably boring, someone decided to try to compensate for it with excessive female nudity in the latter 45 minutes.
My first introduction to anything of this ilk, is the exceptionally well-written "Open Season" a paperback released in the 1970s upon which a film starring Peter Fonda was made.
The first part takes up most of the film, in gripping intensity (and yes, no porn at all) it builds an incredible tension - and then we get a maybe oversimplified, but ultimately satisfying solution.
Seemed to be trying to make a point continuously that was gotten the first time around, but it's a small quibble.
But anyway: this movie spoils itself in the very first minutes and show a hunter killing a deer, oops, a naked woman.
The opening with the title names put on shades drawn throughout the opening title sequence had me at once, and then actor Charley Grapewin, Uncle Henry from The Wizard of Oz and Inspector Queen from the Ellery Queen movie series, comes on and chews up so much scenery with his cantankerous old codger bit that you end up loving his character from the first moment you see him.
Whyte asks the two woman to confront each other, but the first Doris is found murdered in her room.
Whyte and Dean send for the police in order to find out who the first woman was and who had her killed, and Doris (the second and real one) must be able to survive until midnight when she gets her inheritance.
When the first young woman is found dead in her bedroom, a classic murder mystery ensues.
I have trouble seeing what Hildy saw in him during their first marriage and that's as it should be.
Director Howard Hawks' adaptation of The Front Page was the first time that lines were written specifically to be overlapped and Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell grab hold of those lines and never let go.
Hawks overcomes what could have been stagey picture- since it is based on a play, and feels it at times with its main set at the newspaper office- with what is first a true intuition to how to tell the story without getting in the way of a good conversation; sometimes going in three directions!
The love scenes are handle with a tender naivety which was real, The Kiss shared between Mike and Paige Moore in the film was Mike's first ever kiss.
Of course it helps when one of your two main characters has an ambiguous first name like Hildy.
One of the first films from the 40s and a highlight of the decade.
There are two really good "inside" jokes in the script: The first is where Walter Burns (Grant) is describing Hildy's fiancee and says that "he looks like that guy in the movies -- Bellamy," Well, it WAS Ralph Bellamy playing that part!
It has long been one of my favorite films and deserves to be watched over and over again -- just for all the dialogue and great acting that may have gone by so fast you missed it the first time.
The first crow dealt with the color black.
It's better done than the first one, because the first one had to be sown together a la Frankenstein when the lead actor really did die.
It's also better because it recycles footage from the first two.
It's also cruel to a step beyond the first two--Brandon Lee grieved, Vincent Perez went masochist, but William Atherton smiles like a killer clown.
I first saw this movie back in 1989 with some friends of mine, we were in the habit of going to the video store and TRYING to find a movie none of us had seen.
The background strains of music as Orson Welles first recognizes Claudette Colbert haunts me still.
If you liked the first two Crow movies, you will not like this.
i absolutely adored the first film.
The setting is taken someplace else and the elements felt like it was from the first Crow movie.
There simply was no deep meaning in this film, it seems they spent so much time perfecting the CGI effects, stunts and constant similarities to the first film that they forgot the plot Â the actual purpose of the crow.
Okay granted they're pretty straight reruns of the first movie with different casts, but they look and feel great, and the overall standard of material is pretty high.
Unfortunately, this movie doesn't quite focus on the poetry and melancholic views that the first one showed and maybe the second one showed as well.
This movie also isn't as dark as the first two were.
In a way she has a little bit of resemblance to Shelly in the first Crow.
Still, I'll recommend this one anyway even if it doesn't make up to the first crow, but it does make up to the second one.
And unlike the first movie, this one has no feelings.
I bought this movie after enjoying the first two, and knowing that the movies would have nothing in common.
After the first 2 movies, the fans of "The Crow" saga made enough money to put this and the second terrible sequel together.
I don't know who is this director phenomena, but I think he never saw anything about James O Barrs' comic or the first movie.
I LOVED the first movie, amazing.
This third film takes the plot of the first film, bastardizes it, and tries to regurgitate it in this insanely stupid film.
The first part of the plot is pretty common (a guy being set up for his girlfriend's murder) but the next is typical Crow-Corvis(Mabius) comes back from the dead to revenge both deaths.
The first was good.
I cannot at all understand how anyone thinks this even compares to the first Crow movie, or even City of Angels(which was bad).
First, in all honesty, any "Crow" movie that doesn't come out as a straight-up remake of the first one is going to get the same response.
I cannot remember much about it other than "Sarrah is grown up and moved to L.A." I only remember this because I didn't care for "Sarrah" in the first movie.
None of which came close to the originality or quality of the first film, and each new product punched a new hole into the original film.
The movie wasn't dark enough and I didn't feel the same vengeance from this character as I did with the first two films.
I saw this first years ago, when I was kid, around the time it came out.
This film rips off the original film even more than the first sequel!
Remember the first movie where each villain was clearly distinct from the next?
A total rehash of the first two movies.
They've totally misread what made the first film so incredible.
No disrespect intended to the majority of Crow fans (I myself am one) who think that the first film and Brandon Lee's performance in it was unbeatable and way better than this film and Eric Mabius' performance.
But I must disagree, and I'll also ask if all those Crow 1 / Brandon Lee fans would be so adamant that the first film and that actor were the best thing since sliced bread if Brandon hadn't tragically died at such young age.
I don't know why Dunst's name appears first, but that's an annoyance I will happily look past.
The first time was because Mabius' friend distracted her before losing his own life, and the second time was because her gun only had one bullet in it.
But I can only wonder how the first mediocre film and the crap-filled sequel could've been improved if Alex Corvis had been around to tear off zombie heads in those two RE films.
To find that man, Alex will first seek out the four men who falsely accused him on the witness stand which led to his death via electric chair.
That might turn some away who like the dark, noirish vision of the first two.
Let me tell you, it's a lot better than City of Angels, which (in my opinion) just didn't capture the feel of the first Crow film.
The violence is of course bloody/gory, but this time it actually feels justified like the first time with Eric.
It's a better follow-up to the first film.
Sorry to make yet another comparison to the first film, but what made the first film stand-out is that the villains had depth and each one was unique.
The director of that movie is a villager living in KÃ¼tahya(Turkey)and I'm living in the same city with him.this is his first movie and he recorded that movie with 10.000 USA dollars.
My first exposure to the Hardy Boys came courtesy of this serial from the Mickey Mouse Club.
The film is based on the very first of the Franklin K. Dixon novels which came out in the Roaring Twenties, The Tower Treasure.
Disney's "The Hardy Boys": "The Mystery of the Applegate Treasure" (1956) is based on Franklin W. Dixon's (aka Edward Stratemeyer) "The Tower Treasure"- the first of many "Hardy Boys" books.
It was the first of two "Hardy Boy" serials produced by Disney for its "Mickey Mouse Club" show; which was broadcast from 5PM-6PM each weekday.
I recently watched this anime for the first time and initially wasn't sure what to make of it; I'd heard that is was a horror story but the animation style and opening episodes gave little suggestion of what was to come apart from the short pre-credit sequence in the first episode.
I said good but this show is amazing...  After watching the first episode most people will discard it as a kids show, personally, I wouldn't let my kids anyway near this show, although I like horror movies and shows it's really rare for me to feel horror myself, this show though, did it like no other.
With the first episode it kinda make you think this is gonna be your typical cute funny anime.
First few episode of each arc are done average to near horrible (Personal Experience: I almost decided to stop watching the series after half way through the first episode,,,thank god I didn't!).
This show is the first horror anime I've ever actually enjoyed (granted, I haven't seen that many), It's fun trying to figure out what exactly is going on in the town.
Higurashi was first brought into the world in the form several PC games, with the covers designed to look quite disarming so any person would think that this series was harmless.
You'll be pulled, dragged, and unwillingly shoved into a head-spinning mystery that you wished never surfaced in the first place, fighting for your life against people you trusted, and digging through graves and lies in order to survive.
It's basically about Cam trying to get his money up by selling weed at first, but his connect, Gordo, gets him to push that white.
If you're into this kind of cheap fun, go for it, but see belly first.
After mucking about for the first hour, confusing all but those who either have an obsessive love of Cam'ron or this film genre, you find out he has a girlfriend (he didn't really have a love interest for the first half of the film) so he drops his pants and does the "look at my ass while I pretend to have sex" love scene that was reminiscent of DMX's scene in "Belly".
The boy, Sean, on first reflection appears very droll but on further consideration is actually quite complex - and this is probably due more to the plot than the character.
The first, really glaring problem is the opening that has a very incomplete and poorly-explained history of how the Khmer Rouge came to power.
It was very evident that this was the first time many of them had questioned themselves on what they had done.
Without this valuable background information, which the documentary does not provide, the viewers may be lost at first.
Don't get me wrong, the first Star Wars film is a masterpiece for many reasons, but none of them are the clunky dialogue in the script.
I had been looking forward to seeing his first major picture, and it really was great.
After the first half hour I was mesmerized like I had been sucked into another world.
This meant that while he would later draw on Ben Hur for the Star Wars saga, he first achieved success here drawing on his earlier childhood.
George 'Strike Me Down' Lucas directs his first feature feelim here and gathers together a cast of unknowns who would go on to remain unknowns, with the possible exception of Harry 'Son' Ford.
It was quite a success for George 'Akbar' Lucas, earning him a lovely first pile of money and an Academy Award nomination.
Richard Dreyfuss provides the intelligence, Ron Howard the aloof personality, Paul LeMat the muscle, and Charles Martin Smith the comic relief as the four main players in director George Lucas' first major breakthrough in movies before his adventure with the 'Star Wars' films began in 1977.
The first time I saw this film, I was utterly taken with it.
Or is it that I was so much closer to the ages of the characters when I saw it the first time.
I can't recall the first time I saw this movie.
She was fooled by idiot Cruise the first time, now she is fooled by a 10 year old.
A very intelligent and believable film that only seems to get better with repeated viewings, and after seeing it for the first time, you will want to see it again.
At first I didn't believe such a gem could exist.
Quite dramatic and brutal in the first part, warm and funny in the second.
I'd like to have know the very moment Gary first picked up that needle, the day he and Fran split and more about Fat Kurt's past.
The Corner deserves a DVD release & I'll be the first in line to buy it.
Usually, when people think of the drug problem in America they first think of the big cities.
This series is a great American tragedy and crime story combined, a fit companion to "The Godfather" and "Grapes of Wrath," combining the gritty crime story of the first with the deadly grind of veritÃ© poverty from the latter to produce an engrossing synecdoche of our culture at the end of the century.
I wasn't interested in it for the first few minutes, and then I saw Shyamalan's name come up on the credits as writer and director.
Just comparing the characters here to the first two Potter films, where IMHO the kids are relatively flat, you'll see some genuine emotions ranging from sadness to satisfaction to fear to uncertainty but most of all a sense of doubt in something almost everyone else seems to take for granted.
I see Josh's search for God, not as a doubt of his faith, but as the first search for the meaning of the faith he saw in his Grandfather.
Joshua's mission includes his discovery of life around him and for the first time he notices the wherefore's and why's of his family, friends and life in general.
Don't give up on this movie just because the first five minutes are a little dull.
I have to admit, at the end of the movie I was at first disappointed.
For his first film, M. Night Shyamalan, leaves much to be desired in this film.
At first she is very skeptical like every normal human being would be about a silly claim like that but after the boy begins to mention some things that only the real husband of the woman would know she begins to believe him and fall in love with him which causes problems for everyone around her   -the first time I saw this I really hated it.
When we first meet Kidman's character she is a seemingly happy women that has put the past behind her and is enjoying her life for the most part, but once the boy comes into her life we see how it begins to affect her and how a rational woman can go insane.
This was the first film written and directed by M. Night Shyalaman, who would go on to make a film called "The Sixth Sense" a few years later.
Viewers may have difficulty recognizing Kidman at first because she has a hair style completely different than that which makes her such a vivacious actress.
That's all that was supposed to be here in the first place, right?
The women and children do get the bravest roles and even if, like the lady of the manor or the daffy post office assistant, they are a bit hopeless at first they rally magnificently.
There are some very significant and subtle moments; the first active resister is the Christian minister, the British serviceman rallies the village defence is a sailor, the dreadful night ends and daylight breaks through just at the point when the villagers learn the outside world is on the way to help, the villagers are prepared to wreck their own beautiful and historic mansion house without a moment's hesitation in the fight to beat the Germans.
This is England and the people who are only too willing to lay down their lives "for the sake of the children", they, in principle of the first world war poem, died for England, and freedom.
When the villagers start to fight back we get to see some hero's, none more so than the lady at the manor house who to save the children throws herself onto a grenade, I remember seeing this scene for the first time and being very moved by it, and every time I watch it again it has the same effect.
The most frustrating feature of this film is that it promises a memorable journey within the first ten minutes and then ignores it, ignore us it cheated us.
Sure it was great for the first few remakes but in every movie you lead the audience to believe someone will actually survive and you kill them off like 10 seconds before the credits?
He's even more evil and bigamist than the first.
In fairness, I loved the first TCM and even Part 2.
Already this clichÃ© has been used to death (pardon the pun) in movies of the same genre, but this was one of the first (The original was released in 1974), ,with a number of sequels (one even starring Viggo Mortensen), and remakes (one starring Jessical Biel recently, produced by Michael Bay).
There are supporting characters who join in the fray, but ultimately, it's still focused on one of the first two couples who have their opportunity to make or break with our killers on the loose.
When I first heard they were making it, I wanted to vomit in my mouth.
This film gives a hilarious and gory history to the members of the Hewitt family which we were introduced to in the first film.
So here's the wrap-up: The good: Better gore, better use of the chainsaw by Leatherface, nice cinematography, nice story which underlays the first one.
'cos basically, the golden rule of a sequel to any horror is that it should be scarier/gorier/bloodier than the first one.
Though there were some nice gore scenes, it wasn't enough to surpass the first one.
There are, perhaps, more salient comments to be written, in addition to the first review of this film, shown above, but it would be for a completely knowledgeable person in the field of psychology to write them.
Also they have not shown anything happening in the outside world even though policeman in first scene is killed and these 4 friends disappears.
From how the family ended up the way they were, to how Leatherface gets his first chainsaw, The Beginning wastes no time cutting through another franchise.
Jablonsky's reprisal of Leatherface's theme is especially moving when he puts on the face of one of his victims, wearing the human mask (the "leather face") for the first time Â the score crescendos in a slow ascent of triumph, yet tinged with the horror relevant in that triumph.
Don't watch the movie if you're looking for anything different from the first re-make of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the one made in 2003.
The plot was almost the exact same thing as the first movie.
I would like it be stated first that I really hated the last two Texas Chainsaw movies.
I still like the first three chainsaws better but this was a step up to the old days.
R. Lee Ermy brought something new to his performance in this that I felt was vastly lacking in his first attempt and that was a caring of the series.
Andrew Byrinasli or however you spell it, is cool now because he is the first person ever to play Leatherface twice now, go Andrew.
Especially a Texas chainsaw massacre flick but this movie answers so many questions from the first one and really makes it look like this movie should come first.
It took a little getting used to because although it was a lot like the first one it was very different.
I won't spoil it for ya but this one makes the first one look like a Teletubbies Christmas Special!
The first act of the film is by far made the least amount of sense and just seemed like filler to get to the gory stuff and chainsaw scenes.
Shortly after the terrifying, recognizable psycho Leatherface commits his first murders, a cross story involving an encounter with some nasty bikers throws the doomed teenagers flipping across the road in a surprisingly brutal accident.
Texas Chainsaw Massacre:The Beginning is a fantastic slasher film that brings us back to the classic era of 1970's slashers.I loved this chainsaw film simply because it answers all the whys and provides you with leatherface's history.Definitely gorier than the previous film and far more cringe inducing.This is first non cheesy slasher i've seen in ages which is a very nice change for me personally.
This well to do family, who is at odds, first believing, then seeing what it has gone to Anna.
That's all done within the first 20 minutes...then it's just a virtual redo on the original with four likable 20-somethings being captured and tortured by Leatherface and his family.
All of the art work is first rate and much more impressive than in the earlier Disney shorts from '33 and onward.
There are movies I've loved the first time, then thought on the second time around, hmmm, maybe not as good as I first thought - State of Grace, Fight Club, for instance.
There are movies I hated the first time, and hated just as much the second - Lost in Translation and In the Cut come to mind.
There are movies that I hated at first, but later came to think were quite good, e.g.
And there are movies that were magnificent the first time, and even more magnificent the second.
The first half of this movie is a crime mystery.
This was Al Pacino's first box office success of the 1980s.
From the IMDb trivia section: "The apprehension of criminals by arranging a "Meet the Yankees" breakfast was based on an actual event"), has two parts, the first one is the one I liked better and the second is just about a love relationship, the whole thing with the murders is sort of just a pretext.
Sea of Love is an entertaining film with a first part that is simply that, a fast-paced entertainment and a second part that, like I said, is predictable, with a sexy Barkin and with really bad scenes (for instance take the supermarket supposedly very sexy scene, very bad music is what stands out in that part!).
Now, I have seen only De Palma's Scarface and Sea of Love (just yesterday I saw it for the very first time), I think Pacino is just f****** great as Tony Montana and just good as Frank Keller, never really great, he entertains just like the film itself and certainly this performance is extremely far to be one of his best (from the IMDb biography of Pacino: "It marked the second phase of Pacino's career, being the first to feature his now famous dark, owl eyes and hoarse, gravelly voice").
Actually the first version of the song "Sea of Love" that I ever listened was the version of the great Tom Waits (my favourite).
The original version, by Phil Phillips, was first released in 1959 and Tom Waits' version in 1989 on the soundtrack of this film.
But I listened Waits' version for the very first time just a couple or so years ago on Waits' latest album, the 2006 "Orphans: Brawlers, Bawlers & Bastards" and just this year thanks to my mother (she loves that song as much as I love Waits' version) I listened, finally, the extremely famous original (and she listened the version of Tom Waits and she was like "what is this?
But in fact he is not the killer really but the real prey of the killer who isÂ the woman, at first they thought, the police, and they are wrong of course.
The first hour shapes up like a mystery thriller Â a 'whodunit', for want of a better expression Â but the second hour focuses more on the sexual paranoia between Pacino and Barkin.
Some of my friends thought this is one of those films that is great the first time you see it, but diminishes after that because the heavy suspense questions have been answered.
I will not say nothing to any of you who haven't seen the film I will let you enjoy the surprise like I did the first time I saw Sea of Love.
We find out in the first few minutes that its the name of the song the killer was playing when the first murder of the film occured.
I first saw this film at a theater in New York's East Village and found myself hooked within the first 5 minutes!
I watched meanwhile returning from a night out - a bit drunk to be honest-, and found at the beginning amusing it's use of pyrotechnic camera tricks at first, but in a few minutes becomes just plain annoying replacing ideas and emotions with cheap gimmicks, besides the script reeks stupidity and Mexican high-class prejudices ( especially in the central characters.
No one should miss Welles' performance, or Natalie Wood's first turn on screen.
Do Bigha Zameen won the first ever Filmfare award.
Well, not really, but this is the first movie ever to do that.
So it's refreshing to see this movie, (the first one in Dutch history who has a predominant Maroccan cast), that deals with these much discussed, heavy topics and much more in a remarkable light tone.
(Most Maroccan girls in the Netherlands are living a double life: timid and traditional at home, sexy and modern when they are outside their parents radar-range)  * End spoilers *  In many respects this movie is a first.
It's the first movie that deals with Maroccan-Dutch prejudices.
And the first movie with so many Maroccan lead players.
The first one concerns Michi, a girl working at a plant store in Tokyo.
When i discovered an American re-make was coming out, my first reaction was, "you can't re-make perfection."
At first it seemed as if the story was about the ghost world overflowing and their medium of escaping is the Internet.
I have to admit that when I first saw this film I did not expect it to be what it is.
From his first fight with Gordon, to the soul splitting 'death of SAM', he was brilliant.
I won't be watching A Game For Vultures again and, if you value your time, I'd suggest that you shouldn't even bother with it in the first place!
The public obsession first began proper when the Cannon Film Group released the Sho Kosugi outing, Enter the Ninja in 1984.
In the first part of this "movie" comprised of episodes 9 and 10 from the 1980's action series, "The Master," that dynamic ninja duo of Max Keller (Timothy Van Patten) and John Peter McAllister (Lee Van Cleef), find themselves in a pickle as McAllister, aka The Master, is framed for attempted murder of an old war buddy of his, now an intelligence officer.
But it is best to watch the other installments first, so you can appreciate the evolution the characters go through, especially Max Keller's as The Master's pupil.
I recommend renting it first.
This was not Murphy's first film, so perhaps this explains his above average performance and seeming comfort on camera.
I quite loved this film when I first saw it as a 22 year old at the Fox theater in Fullerton, Calif.
During the first World War the American hero out of that conflict, Alvin C. York of Tennessee, had to wait until the outbreak of the second World War for his biographical film to be made.
A lot of the fame and glory Murphy won was due to luck and opportunity and he would have been the first to admit it.
When watching it for the first time, I thought it was made in the late 1960's or early 1970's.
Or at least don't see this until you've seen every other Fellini movie first.
I hate to think of anyone seeing this as their first Fellini movie because it would definitely turn them off all his other films!  
The first time around, it's one of the most confusing, annoying things ever, but it makes perfect sense the second time around.
It is, first of all, Snaporaz who, like Guido in 8 1/2 (in both Marcello Mastroianni) copes with the madness of the world that surrounds him and tries to figure out his inner self.
I got Rainbow Six a couple of years ago for a cheap price.I didn't really like this game.Rainbow Six is a fairly overrated game in my opinion.Its hard.I had this game for years and I am still stuck on the second level.The first level was pretty fun and had a fair amount of action.The graphics were great for 1998.However this game I thought was pretty hard and overrated.If you see Rainbow Six for a very cheap price buy it but by cheap I mean under $9.99.I have not played the other Tom Clancy games.
i remember when i first played this game years ago.
Contrary to how it appears on IMDb I saw the film in its correct order and enjoyed this, the first half, more than the second half because it was not as gritty nor as fundamentally sad.
I found this first part of Che most interesting and I saw glimpses of the national divide that would play, in my opinion, such a major role in part two.
Soderbergh's choices of camera angles, perspective, lighting and all the cinematic aspects give you a permanent first person angle in the action that is so involving that you actually die with Che in the end of the second movie...
The first movie feels like it had probably an hour or so of footage that was cut off, abbreviated.
So one thing that disturbs me about the first part is that it feels like just an introduction to the Bolivian Diaries, and that it by itself could have resulted in a 2 part movie, since there is actually more happening surrounding the Cuban revolution than in the failed Bolivian attempt.
All in all, this movie is a work of art, playing like a symphony (a bit fractured in the first part though), immersive from the first minute to the last.
I always say that I can tell whether a movie is going to be great or bad just by watching the first 5 mins.
The film "Che" starts with Che Guevera on the verge of addressing the UN on the afternoon of December 11, 1964 in his first official trip to the USA as a Representative of the Cuban Government.
In this first part of his "Che", he combines all the forms and styles he has tried when shooting and the result is undoubtedly his most ambitious project, but is it his best?
It's a smart move to have each of the both part of this epic start out with geographical maps of first Cuba, and then South America.
We're introduced with a dining scene where doctor Ernesto "Che" Guevara first met Fidel Castro.
This may have been the first game where I could FEEL a directors presence, and it Enchanted me.
The first part of Soderbergh's biopic is essentially an old fashioned war movie.
We first see Che being introduced to Fidel Castro in Mexico and being invited to join the planned invasion of Cuba.
Mainly two facets, Benicio del Toro did simply a remarkable work, we see Ernesto Guevara in Mexico and certainly Fidel Castro, chronologically that is the first part of the film, the beginning in Mexico City.
Certainly we see how Che was, many people wanted to join him, the ones who knew how to read and how to write came first, the other ones while not in combat must learn.
Che will be in La Habana for the very first time.
Here the first very positive fact for me was that the film is in Spanish, in short it is a piece of work and I can't wait to see more Soderbergh starting with Che Part Two!
And yet here is the first controversy.
How did he even manage to get the funding for a film about a communist revolutionary in the first place?
This is not the first time Che's story has been turned into a movie.
The 2004 film, The Motorcycle Diaries, examines the formation of Guevara's early politicization, and Â But Soderberg's film (with Benicio Del Toro in the lead role as Che Guevara), is the first to try and tell the whole story of Guevara's involvement in the Cuban revolution, and his subsequent attempt to spread the revolution to Boliva, where he was eventually caught and killed in October 1967.
The first film draws extensively on the Guevara's own writings, especially his memoir "Reminiscences of the Cuban Revolutionary War".
Telling about the years from his fateful first encounter with the Castro brothers in Mexico to the end of the revolution, The Argentine helps show how a young doctor became a Comandante respected and loved by a nation that was not even his.
The story follows Che from his first meeting with Castro, to the climactic battle in Santa Clara, where Batista's army makes its last stand against the revolutionaries.
As a whole, Che's first half is an unassuming picture.
At first glance, it isn't anything remotely special, and probably won't provide viewers with any degree of resonance if they are not interested in the man and his people's struggle beforehand, yet the same can be said for a number of similar features.
You're likely are likely to find the first serving of Soderbergh's four-and-a-half-hour, two part political epic a little confusing.
As an avid Che fan and reader of his books and biographies, there is little doubt in my mind that this monumental work will stand as the first piece in the definitive two part screen portrait of one the twentieth century's most iconic, yet largely uncharted, political figures.
In the first of the two Che films (this London Film Festival screening I attended showed both The Argentine and Guerrilla back to back with an intermission) we get all we might expect from a Soderbergh film.
The second part was to have been the original film and was written first and, I think, shot first.
There is a third part, a kind of celebratory black and white interval made up of Che's speech at the United Nations in 1964 and interviews with him at that time, but that is inter-cut in the first segment.
The first part also has Fidel and is considerably more upbeat, leading as it does to the victory in Santa Clara in 1959 that led to the fall of the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista in Cuba.
"The Mercenary" was Corbucci's first Mexican revolutionary western that he would follow up with "Companeros" starring Franco Nero as a Swedish arms dealer, Tomas Milian as the Mexican peasant, and Jack Palance as the villain.
At that point, Corbucci and his multitude of writersÂamong them Franco Solinas of "A Bullet for the General" and VincenzoniÂflash back to the first meeting between our heroes who later become fast friends.
From there we are introduced to Franco Nero's character Sergei Kowalski; a Polish gunslinger, only out to better himself; and, it has to be said, is a little hard to understand at first.
Crucially there is greater subtlety and tautness, a good example being in the first scene at the mine where we cut from Tony Musante realising the gang boss's pistol is within reach straight to the scene in which he and his comrades are holding up the mine owners.
Anyhow, away from my pointless ramble "The Mercenary" which is first I've seen of any Corbucci's films was an exciting gung-ho spaghetti western that doesn't let up on the violence and colourful characters.
Last week, I came across a sale of Italian DVDs of several Spaghetti Westerns; I managed to purchase 4 of them and, being one of 2 I hadn't watched before, this ended up as the first I checked out.
It's another buddy western with a Nordic (blond) and a Mexican guy where the first is cool and intelligent and the other hot tempered and rather low witted.
It had the unfortunate luck of following VII, which was the first title in the series to be created in a 3D style on the Playstation.
As most Japanese produced films of this kind, this one has gone through pixel censorship, meaning it doesn't show all the really nasty stuff which is really why you'd like to see this film in the first place.
During the first 15 minutes of so I was dying for subtitles.
It was the first movie that really made me cry.
I downloaded the end because I still havent got there yet im at the first battle for the 4th disc.
The first sex-horror film!claimed the tagline.Well for that matter,Murnau's "Nosferatu" came first.Claude Mulot's script is thin,mean and lacks humor and substance.A poor man's "les yeux sans visage" indeed.But it manages to retain some -minor - interest.The castle where a lady who was disfigured in a fire (Duperrey) is waiting for a doctor who will give her back her beauty;but this man's methods -blackmailed by the lady's husband - are illegal to say the least for he needs warm young flesh,well you know the score.We never see the lady's horrible face ,only her eyes -like Rosemary's baby- ,and there's a lot of camera taking first-person point of view.Two sinisters dwarfs appear now and then .Claude Mulot sometimes manages to create a dreamlike atmosphere,but once again,his script is really half-backed.
Also, I expected it to be much trashier Â considering the dubious epithet "the first sex-horror film" that's attached to it; there is a reasonable amount of nudity here, but this is generally tastefully presented.
The dwarf manservants seen here may be something of a genre requisite, but they're actually well-integrated into the plot Â their rape/murder of a captive girl (an intended, but obviously unwilling, face donor) and subsequent beating by their disfigured mistress seemed a gratuitous digression at first, but it does help set up the film's wild and completely unexpected final act!
The first real film from a director who went on to do a lot of interesting work in the 1970's and 80's before his tragic death by drowning in 1986.
I downloaded the end because I still have not got there yet im at the first battle for the 4th disc.
However, I was completely engrossed with this film from the first beautifully shot scene to the last.
I first saw it when it was released in 1976 and, at the time, I played little league (well, the Canadian equivalent).
What made this movie so groundbreaking when I first saw it in the summer of 1976 was that kids were portrayed as they really were instead of as the innocent, sometimes mischievous cherubs that most movies presented.
At the very beginning the Bears give up 20 runs in the first and forfeit.
I just watched this film for the first time in many years (thanks TCM), and it's still very funny.
For many of us growing up 30 years ago when "The Bad News Bears" first came out, this is the film that peeled back the suburban sheen of middle-class American life and used that anchor of conformity, Little League Baseball, to lay it all bare: the false values, the fear of mediocrity, coming to grips with the hard truths of life.
When the team tries to quit after getting pasted by the Yankees in their first game, 26-0, Buttermaker delivers a line that resonates, like so much in this movie, down through the years: "This quitting thing, it's a hard habit to break once you start."
We won our share of games and he always made it a priority that everyone played, and that the game was first and foremost, fun.
THE BAD NEWS BEARS was the first film that tackled this problem of bad sportsmanship and enshrining winning within what should be the purest form of baseball.
Subsequently the Councilman even drops supporting the team when it loses it's first game by a score of 26 to 0.
But their unhappiness at their first defeat is too much.
He does this first by actually training the team, so they start cohering together (and start actually playing the game correctly).
I enjoyed watching The Bad News Bears.At first though I didn't want anything to do with it.Seeing as how I'm not really into sports movies, I didn't feel like watching this at all, but I was forced by my friend, who has good taste, and he loved it, so I decided to give it at least 1 viewing.Well, I have to say when the movie started up, I was already dreading it.It just seemed to me to be very boring and plain, and I just kept getting more and more aggravated as the movie continued on.Suddenly, it's like the whole thing changed around.I started getting a bit more entertained, and it sort of changed up from how other sports movies are.I still didn't get what I wanted from The Bad News Bears, but in all fairness this was a really good and original movie, that wasn't as bad as I was thinking it to be.I especially liked the outcome of this movie, for it was very cool, and if you give it a chance like I did, I'm sure you will too.
LOL, I know I stole that line from I love the 70's, but I just thought it was so true and that was my exact thought from the first minute I started watching The Bad News Bears.
But he just wants to get paid and get the job over with, but when their first game comes along, the kids get creamed 26-0, Buttermaker is pressured to drop the team out of the league, but instead teaches the kids how to play and recruits a couple of new kids, a girl who's mother he used to date, and a rebel without a cause.
I remember first seeing it at a drive-in when I was ten, shortly after my own little league season had finished.
Vic Morrow gives a frighteningly good performance as the out-to-win-no-matter-what coach of the opposing team who was never happy with the fact that the Bears were allowed to play in the first place.
I had first played this game in the year 2000 and i thought then, what a great game, now, almost 7 years on i still think it is one of the best RPG games.
At first she had parts in a couple of Bing Crosby movies - "College Humor" (1932) and "Too Much Harmony" (1933), then it was uncredited parts for Liberty Films "Two Heads On a Pillow" (1934) and "Let's Be Ritzy"(1934).
When I was maybe thirteen or so I lent this too a friend and he lost the third disc so for a long time I was replaying the first two discs or just crushing Ultimecia as best I could in the finale of the game.
-sigh- Well, after the first disk, you're left with a cheap plot.
But to punish these actions, you must first equip your faithful GF to any of the characters.
By following the landmark first gay marriages of Massachusettes during which amendments were immediately being proposed to ban the practice, the film "Saving Marriage" literally takes the audience on a roller-coaster of emotions as politicians and people who want their equal rights battle it out in the legislative halls.
Most people outside of Massachusetts (and probably a good number inside as well) don't have any idea how this whole issue of same-sex marriage came about in the first place, so this film does a great job of showing the time-line of events, and how the courts play a role, and the legislatures play a role.
When the Commonwealth of Massachusetts became the first state to recognize gay marriage, a constitutional amendment suddenly is presented to take that right away.
By seeing the first gay marriages in Massachusetts during which the amendments were proposed to shoot down and ban the practice, we are taken on a tour of emotions as both politicians and "little people" fought out the battle for equal rights in the New England legislature.
At first, I was interested in seeing this film since it was named after a series of prints by Hogarth.
A big German guy is shown at first as an underground fighter.
At first, it looked really interesting.
I caught part of this movie by accident when it first came out.
It's a must-see for every movie-goers especially for the first thirty minutes, I would say, because everyone who was involved in the 1979 classic "Alien" give their point of view (and H.R.
Also, there is some actors from the first three movies who appear to say their impression about all kinds of things.
The documentary "Alien: Evolution" follows the history and production of the wildly successful (well, in the 70's and 80's, anyway) "Alien" franchise, and offers quite a bit of amusing and interesting information about the making of the first film, and, to a lesser extent, the sequels made in later years.
Giger, who compares the alien suit design in Alien 3 to a piece of excrement, and Lance Henriksen talking about how the third film destroyed all the work that was put into the first two entries, it sheds a whole new perspective on what it was like for the cast and crew to experience these films.
It is understandable that Fox would want to cut these offending bits (seeing as how they cut an hour of candid footage of David Fincher out of the Alien 3 Special Edition documentaries), so they recut the film and had it focus on the first movie instead.
Jack Elam is great as the nervous, almost spastic first victim.
Lee Van Cleef, in one of his first film roles, is perfect as a slimy womanizing punk.
old when i bought and finished this game, and its my first FF game ever played.
This was the first time I had seen Payne in a "serious" role, and I was not disappointed.
"Kansas City" is, I believe, the first and clearly the best of a number of "Confidential" films made during the mid-fifties.
I liked this film but I got spoiled with the first 20-30 minutes.
He is only able to hang on and locate his first clue with an assist from an old friend who understands what he is going through.
This documentary could be seen as the first definitive look into the broad world of metal and it certainly does travel throughout the whole (well, most of) spectrum of metal.
A little more editing and such would have made this a better release but considering that this is the first real such documentary mass-released on this sort of thing.
And playing behind it all is Metallica's Master of Puppets, first the quiet intro - leading into the various movements while the sun glints through the knotted mass of arms.
There are plenty of great songs and bands alluded to that a metal/hard rock fan would know and love such as Blue Cheer (truly the first band to make the sound), Rush, Diamond Head, Venom, and others.
And just days after viewing the disappointingly cursory "American Hardcore", "Metal: A Headbanger's Journey" throws down a challenge in its first scenes when a frazzled youth with a microphone makes sure to add that "punkÂdoes not belong in this world".
He features erudite interviews with the subculture's leading and most influential personalities and accomplishes his first goal by juxtaposing their reasoned, informed views on metal with the irrational fear that advocacy groups have waged battles over.
The first time I played this game, I was totally blown away.
Not only does it take place in a world we can believe and understand (a somewhat futuristic world that is fairly peaceful but still militarized), but it features characters we can feel akin to, for the first real time in the FF Series.
After her husband John's death in the first world war, Elizabeth (Colbert) finds out she's pregnant.
When "Dr. Kessler" (Welles), a scientist working with her husband, first appears at their home, Elizabeth doesn't realize it's John, who never returned to the U.S. because of his crippling, debilitating war wounds.
Her scene as she comes downstairs and sees Dr. Kessler for the first time is wonderful.
Handsome Long, who would find success in television, makes a good impression in his first film.
The first few seconds into the film, when the all familiar intro of Number of the Beast began, with the clips of metal-heads on screen, I shivered, the hairs on the back of my neck standing up.
Opening with the age-old question of what was the first heavy metal song before launching into a metal head's history of the genre this fascinating documentary is a must.
- Rinoa Heartilly - the princess of the Timber Owls, an anti-government orginazation who calls for the Seeds for help, who at first had a brief fling with Balamb Garden bully, Seifer Almasy, but soon falls helplessly in love with Seifer's arch rival, Squall.
"Final Fantasy VIII" is the first FF game I ever played, but on the other hand, it's very easy to.
A head banger's journey starts off by examining Metal's roots, the long debate in regards to who was the first Metal band ever.
I knew it was going to be great when I got my first glimpse of the big chart of metal bands that correctly put KISS far away from the actual musicians.
We missed the first hour of this 4-foot slog (thankfully)and then giggled through the rest of this abysmal Antipodean crap.
The similarities between the two series are quite obvious: first of all, in both series.
One has to wonder why they spent those first 3 weeks building those wonderful living quarters instead of a raft which they could have used to get OFF the island, but hey, then the movie couldn't have lasted as long as it did.
The first game I played was FFVI (which was, what, III in Japan?)
It may be notable for the first appearance of Donald Duck (in a supporting role) but the rest of it is mainly annoying.
Donald Duck had been mentionened as an idea since 1931 but this was his first actual appearance.I was introduced to the character mainly by the comicbooks and at a lesser extents by some great shorts as "Commando Duck".Donald is obviously the most interesting character in this short.According to comics continuity he was 14 years old.Not bad for a teen-ager.But this short introduces as to his voice actor"Clarence"Ducky"Nash.Why should Donald's speaking be almost incomprehensible?I usualy hate hearing it.Since his name is Donald a slight Scottish accent would be more acceptable.A nice short but Clarence ruins it for me.I greately preferred Scrooge's voice in Ducktales.
I had never knew that this Silly Symphony was Donald Duck's first theatrical appearance as well as for his voice-artist Clarence "Ducky" Nash too; and besides, I love Donald Duck, along with Mickey Mouse, his canine pal Pluto (which is unusual, because I am a cat-lover) and Chip n' Dale.
This is an excellent example of early Disney and the first appearance of Donald Duck.
In this one, it's the musical version of the moral fable "The Wise Little Hen" with Florence Gil voicing the one who asks Donald and his friend Peter Pig (Pinto Colvig) for help in first planting the corn and then harvesting them.
This film is also an important milestone as it marks the first appearance of Donald Duck, it remains one of his best films.
I first read the novel by Jackie Collins and I thought what a fantastic book, not Shakespeare obviously, but definitely a page turner.
Shes trying to write a script and turns to a 20 something hunk writer, who we see for the first time naked, save for a conveniently draped bed sheet.
Doesn't anyone in movies walk down streets, or go over to someone's house without calling first.
At first I wasn't sure this movie was going to be much.
Having just watched this early '90s suspense thriller about computer hackers (I think) for the first time, I was partially confused about some scenes though overall, I was a little entertained by some of the comedy elements that were sprinkled throughout.
At first the plot centers around the Sneakers or hackers using their skill along with their bugging and stake-out equipment to acquire the black box from the young professor.
It was Mary McDonnell's appearance that finally brought me to my senses - I remembered that she was also pretty hot the first time around!
I saw the film when it first came out as a grad student in math, and yes, the math in the film is absurd.
I have already worn out my first vhs tape and bought another one.
The best things about the first season is the A) excellent guest stars including Gianni Garko, Orso Maria Guerrini, Giancarlo Prete, Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, Joan Collins, Judy Geeson, etc.
Unresolved endings and dark story lines were the trademark of the first season while the second series succumbed to safer familiar territory.
I was in 10th grade when Space 1999 was first released and being a science major I became an instant fan.
I watched each episode of the first season religiously and remember it among the most fond times of my life.
I still remember being all psyched up for the first episode of the second season.
All it took was the new intro for me to instantly become discouraged (which was really horrible compared to the dramatic and well scored intro of the first season).
As for those that say it was boring, like all first seasons the show was developing a direction and was positioned for a killer second season (before they butchered it without giving it a chance to grow that is).
Although I remember too many things that left me scratching my head, even from the superior first season - why did the command centre have exterior windows that could be opened when the Moon was given an atmosphere?
With all of the Eagles that crashed or were otherwise disabled, how did they always seem to be able to get another one aloft, and how were they fast enough, given the scramble of Alan Carter to keep up with the Moon when it first left Earth's orbit, to reach the base again when outside the gravity of the orb.
The local TV station aired the first season Fridays at 7 pm, the same time slot that it had used for Star Trek a decade earlier.
After I had enjoyed most of the first Beverly Hills Cop movie I had high hopes for this one as well.
They do share scenes but there are only lame suggestive remarks from Murphy and Nielsen's character is so devoid of humour that you have a nagging suspicion that she was only cast as some sort of deal with Stallone (Nielsen's hubby at the time), since he was to star in the first movie.
The first series rivalled '2001: A Space Odyssey' in terms of grandeur and spectacle.
American producer ( and the man who assassinated 'Star Trek' ) Fred Freiburger was brought in first as a head writer, then as producer.
I could go on & on about this show, as others have, but I don't need to cover old ground--those of us who saw this show as youngsters when it first came out, well... it was an amazing & hypnotic thing.
The first Season provided us with some excellent episodes, and some excellent performances from the series leads - Martin Landau, Barbara Bain and Barry Morse.
Unfortunately the first season didn't really take off, but a surprisingly generous I.T.C backing allowed a Second Season to be made.
But this was the first show I ever followed, in my memory, week after week without fail, and so I love it to bits, even with all of its faults.
I have never understood why any movie would have its most interesting character killed off in the first fifteen minutes.
Sure it had its promising moments too; there was an Alien and the first Terminator in there, but this was the decade of the macho, gun-totting, mulleted male.
Written and directed by people who should've known better, "Doctors' Wives" was considered pretty heavy stuff in its day (the first time it ran on network TV, there was a "parental discretion" warning preceding the movie), but its 'raciness' is now rather quaint.
Hours later she's shot dead, while caught in the act with the first of her conquests.
This movie is the first one by Cem Yilmaz, unquestionably the most popular and funniest stand-up comedian.
In his first serious on-screen job, Cem Yilmaz seems surprisingly able in his portrayal of Altan, and demonstrates that he can really act.
I half-enjoyed the first 10-15 minutes solely due the nice photography and colourful 60s England, but this quickly wore off, leaving me to yawn like a walrus at the rest.
I don't suppose that I would have liked it when it first came out because it would have been bunched in with all of the other `rock' musicals of it's time, trying to compete for the `young' in-crowd.
Now, when first hearing about it, and possibly even sitting through it, one word that may or may not come to mind is pathetic, or possibly desperate, maybe even typical.
CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST 2: THE BEGINNING, the title I saw this under, is actually less a sequel to the first film than an almost scene-for-scene remake of it.
The framework is about the same as in the first film, with the footage being intercut with people at a TV station viewing it all.
Say what you will but this is an enjoyable ride just don't expect the same feeling you may have gotten the first time you saw a film like this.
If this is your first shot at the genre you will find it much easier to locate Cannibal Ferox, Cannibal Holocaust (with a beautiful new release by grindhouse), or even Jungle Holocaust.
I first saw this movie at age 8 and still love it and keep it in my personal video collection.
Think back to the first movie when he pretended to be gay in order to get into the hotel buffet.
I think it's because the other pieces are minor or (like Wilson) full of other interesting small matters - like the business of the use of fingerprints to settle the mysteries of the plot (a first in 1894).
At first glance it wouldn't seem possible that Samuel Langhorne Clemens of Hannibal, Missouri could write a classic tale about medieval England.
This film also marks Flynn's first film with Alan Hale who appeared in eleven films with Errol.
The first half of the movie focuses on this guy shooting up, and hanging out with half-naked men.
I rented Jackhammer Massacre, after hearing the first half was good.
Now this first gore scene was possibly the third best effect in the movie.
The only slightly OK parts from this movie are the first jackhammer smash, a scene that suggests that Jack shoves his weapon up his lesbian sister's girlfriend's crack, which had no visual shot of this, but the idea was funny as hell.
Like in the beginning when he kills his first victim, and his face gets smashed in with the jackhammer...oh my.
The first summed up what Beverly Hills was like in the early 80's but this one shows us the world indulgent Americans live in when they have more money than they can spend.
Instead, he awoke, picked up a jackhammer and drilled the first's face in.
After the first scene, we go back in time to sort of show how Jack got to that point.
Then it goes to the first scene, and we watch that again.
Don't get too excited: there are only three girls, and one of them stays clothed, but the female nudity is within the first twenty minutes, so there's time to watch it and shut it off, which is probably your best bet if you're looking for a nipple shot.
The first slasher movie in memory to blame its killer's antics on drugs...for a while, it even works too (with some nasty & gory special effects).
I have been a Golgo-13 fan ever since I first played "Top Secret Episode: Golgo-13" for the 8-bit NES back in the fall of 1988.
Many action fans really loved this movie, as well as fans of the first Beverly Hills Cop film.
One of the reasons why Beverly Hills Cop 2 is such a great sequel is because of the return of the stars from the first film.
While not as funny as the first film, Beverly Hills Cop 2 has a nice balanced blend of action and comedy.
To sum up, I strongly recommend this film to those who loved the first movie.
It follows very closely to the first film, and has an 80's feel to it just like the first movie.
Golgo 13 is one of the most interesting anime movies, if you can get past the first half hour.
That part of the movie is just to set up that Golgo is the ultimate assassine but the film makers already did that with the first look at Golgo.
This was one of the first anime movies I had ever seen.
I first saw it on an untranslated VHS tape in 1986 and I've been a staunch supporter ever since, sharing it with as many people as I can convince to give it a chance despite its reputation as a bomb.
And no I don't think that will ruin anything for the first time viewer...
The acting in the first 2/3 of this movie.
Unfortunately that was only true for the first bit of this movie.
Has the boring and embarrassing third one destroyed all that was memorable about the first two?
The characters have even had a chance to grow from the first film.
In the first one he was a shy, unassuming, wet behind the ears cop.
He does just as many little "skits" in BHC2 as the first and most of them are hilarious.
The movie could have opted to wrap neatly with the first Twist, or could have taken any number of juvenile turns, blaming spirits from an Indian Burial Ground, or any of the lesser characters (who all sported damaging secrets), but the writers led us on a merrier, more interesting goose chase.
Okay, so this was not as explosive as the first "Beverly Hills Cop" movie, but it still had enough energy to succeed.
The first shows a story that wasn't there and in the end pulls a rabbit out of the hat(easy!).
and two, since first watching it, I've seen a lot more films in the rubber reality genre, and Identity is nowhere near as mind-bending as many other examples.
The main standout in the first reel is the use of Tarantino-like "multiple viewpoint" shots, where we see the same span of time from one character's point of view, then another, then another.
Most of them are lying to each other in some way when they first meet, and even some of the ones who know each other already are also lying to each other.
Being that this is the second film in the trilogy, one would expect "Beverly Hills Cop II" to either be a step up or a step down from the first film.
They are stolen by her maid and her boyfriend, and both Powell and Rainer try to be the first to recover them.
Teaming up with his colleagues from the first film, Axel goes "deep undercover" to bring the perps to justice though not without indulging the viewer with a glorified view of Eighties California.
And as much as I loved the music in the first movie, the music in this soundtrack is even better!
Well...other than the fact that Bronson Pinchot (who stole the show in the first and third movies as the hilarious Serge) doesn't make an appearance.
Also keep in mind it was time just after aggression of US against Yugoslavia and time of victories of federal forces in the second Chechen war - everyone still remembered the humiliation of the first war as well as all previous decade .
Well, as promised in first part, Russian folk hero Danila goes to USA to revenge a friend and give "kirdyk"(apocalypse) to America.
In the first movie, Axel goes in deep of finding his friend's killer.
A little more exciting than the first, although I prefer Part one for the music score.
In the first movie Bagrov's contempt of the "dark-skinned" people was evident in one small episode, in this one he really gets going at - what's the word?
It was the first film in decade with such big patriotic value.
Balabanov shows a talent here for screenplay that has no false pretenses, the same as he did in the first film.
Hong Kong's first fully-fledged computer-animated movie is, for the most part, a treat.
At first I thought, "what did I get myself into?".
Yes, yes I understand it is the first ever computer generated kung-fu movie out of Hong Kong, but it was awful.
Dragonblade is first and foremost an animated children's feature, produced on a shoestring budget - particularly compared to the sackfuls of money thrown at the likes of Shrek.
Which once again starred Kay Parker,in a smaller, less meatier role, although she still played the same character as in the first.
This film also introduces for the first time comedy genius Chris Rock.
This was my first viewing of the film and in my humble opinion Ty Power was terrific as a dramatic actor.
When we first met him, as he assisted in others floating away from the wreckage, we can see that he is going to be a force in this film, and it isn't until he is pushed that we see the full potential of his character.
The excitement of the crew turned to a wicked shade of turnip at the first signs of possible safety.
As a partial sop his characters had less pleasant sides - his character in PRINCE OF FOXES is a willing tool of Cesare Borgia (Orson Welles) for the first half of the movie.
Constructed in a much flashier and faster-paced visual style than the first film, the song still remains the same as Foley tries to keep his job in Detroit while solving crimes for the Beverly Hills cops.
I saw this film when it first came out and I loved it then and still do so I'm pleased to have finally bought it on DVD.
At the time of its release Beverly Hills Cop was the highest grossing comedy of all time, so it works out perfectly that its first sequel would be directed and produced by the juggernaut Hollywood crowd-pleasers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer (and directed by none less than Tony Scott).
Everyone is friends now after the events of the first movie.
It's true that some of the jokes and situations are a little too unoriginal, even only in the first sequel, such as Foley's remarkable ability to come up with crazy stories on the spot (although the best one is where he pretends to be a gay prostitute to get into a ritzy club and harass the bad guy) and his loud-mouthed streams profanity.
I've loved this film since I first saw it.
I loved this movie, both the first and second time I saw it.
and "But first Ted i'll shoot you, you little b@#!ÂÂ£" both directed at a teddy bear make this a very funny and enjoyable movie.
We sat there staring in disbelief like rabbits staring into an oncoming cars headlights, instead trusting our instincts and turning it off after the first 5 minutes.
I first watched The Killing Edge back in the mid 1990's when I found it on the bargain-price rental shelf at our local video shop.
The first of RKO Pictures very short-lived Hildegarde Withers series.
In this, the first of the series, Miss Oliver discovers a very dead body floating in the penguin pool in the New York City Aquarium.
The first of three films for Oliver as novelist Stuart Palmer's fiftyish caustic, snoopy schoolteacher Miss Withers, the movie was a major hit in 1932 and one can see why even today, the duologue is hilarious, the setting quite novel, and the cast is fine, especially Oliver and James Gleason who have such a superb team chemistry together is near tragic they only made three films together (Oliver left RKO-Radio Pictures in 1935 and the studio unwisely decided to carry on the series with different actresses much to moviegoers - and author Stuart Palmer's - displeasure.)
Oliver and Gleason work well together and they are blessed with a witty script by Willis Goldbeck as well as some pacey direction from George Archainbaud   This was the first of a series and is a good example of solid studio professionalism from its era
This was the first film in a far too short series.
Viewing the first film, THE PENGUIN POOL MURDER, one can understand why the series immediately took off.
I loved Beverly Hills Cop 2, I hope I do find the third one, I know it doesn't have as good of a rating like the first or the second one, but still I love Eddie Murphy.
Beverly Hills Cop 2 is filled with just as many laughs as the first one and I don't see how anyone could not laugh at least a few times.
I cried during most of the movie the first time I saw it.
A first rate comedy and who-done-it, that led to MURDER AT THE BLACKBOARD and MURDER ON THE HONEYMOON before the two stars went their separate ways.
This is the first of three films that Oliver and Gleason made together as teacher Miss Withers and Inspector Piper.
), while Philo Vance was still at his peak, Charlie Chan had just started his marathon run, and two years before Dashiel Hammett would backtrack to seemingly invent the "comedy mystery" in the first of the THIN MAN series, Stuart Palmer's "Hildegarde Withers" stories were pointing the way to that perfect bantering comedy.
Miss Withers was one of the first screen characters to build on "the little old lady" detectives first introduced by Mary Roberts Rinehart and later to be highly polished - though with fewer comic overtones - in Agatha Christie's Miss Marple tales.
Beautifully acerbic character actress Edna May Oliver first assayed the plum role of Withers in THE PENGUIN POOL MURDER, playing every stereotype of the prim, corseted but observant, spinster school teacher for all they were worth against the background of a solidly plotted mystery and a grand supporting cast headed by perennial mystery fixture James Gleason as the much put-upon Inspector Piper.
From 1855 to 1890, it was the United States' immigration depot before Ellis Island was built, and as such, the first ground in America millions of immigrants set foot on.
If you're going to be in New York, don't miss this increasingly meaningful piece of sculpture - but first see its setting as it looked 70 years earlier in delightful PENGUIN POOL MURDERS!
In attempting to implement the scheme, the two friends must first overcome violent opposition from the owner of a stagecoach line who stands to lose a cross-country mail contract if the plan succeeds, hostile Indians who see the advent of the white man as yet another encroachment to their way of life, and the California businessmen themselves whose interests extend beyond Californian independence.
I first saw this movie when I was eight years old and loved it so much that I immediately went to the library to read up on these historical characters and events.
Best of all, it was here that I saw Rhonda Fleming for the first time.
Though it reassembles most of the cast from the original, including Eddie Murphy in the role that made him a big-screen movie star, all of the other elements that made the first one so enjoyable are gone.
Director Tony Scott seems to be absolutely clueless about what made the first one so popular and fresh -- in other words, the comedy -- and instead focuses on aggressive violence and action.
Paul Valentine is a friend I've known since grade school and this video was the first I'd seen of him since 1974.
I admit that as a Christian I was taken aback at first but the little boy I first met in second grade was there for all too see.
The only reason to watch this is the world's first glimpse of Paul Douglas Valentine.
The first of Jones's short lived Hubie and Bertie series about two frequently cruel and sadistic mice and their tendency to prey on the emotionally frail, 'The Aristo-Cat' reduces the star character's roles to virtual cameos.
Happily, by this stage 'The Aristo-Cat' has already established itself as a must see and, while its eventual disintegration prevents it from entering the annals of the genuinely classic, the cartoon's first half ranks alongside some of the most startling imagery of any Warner cartoon.
This was the first of seven "Hubie and Bertie" cartoons.
Overall, this offers almost nothing in the way of laughs except one quick scene when Claude first meets the bulldog, face-to-face.
It's the same movie all over again, but without the intelligence, humour and charm that made the first film such a winner.
Beverly Hills Cop II is just as funny as the first one but is more visually pleasing.
The first time I saw this movie, I sat there scratching my head, thinking: What am I watching?
Though after the first 20 minutes of the film the pace really slows down.
Eddie Murphy stars in Beverly Hills Cop II.I think the first one was a tad bit better than this, but not by much.I think this is a great sequel.Eddie Murphy is funny as usual and so is Judge Reinhold.It also stars Brigitte Nielson and there is even a small cameo from Chris Rock.The film has Axel Foley returning to solve another murder with the help of his two friends from the first film.I think Beverly Hills Cop II is a good sequel to a good action/comedy film and I recommend it if you enjoyed the first one.
My dad first told about this movie a while ago.
This quintessential eighties style is carried over to the sequel, made three years later, and although part two; like many sequels, never quite manages that same verve as the original film - it still offers a good time, and anyone that enjoyed the first instalment (and who didn't?)
I've got to say that Eddie Murphy's wisecracks were a lot funnier in the first film.
Next the damsel in distress Sapna forcibly grabs a lift from Vicky's younger brother Prem Oberoi (Salman Khan), the theatre buff of Mamaji's group, to reach on time on the first day of her job.
The first half is a breezy comedy.
Then again, a classy animated production is no surprise when you know and have seen the work of either of the Fleischer brothers, Max or Dave, who first became noticed with some extremely clever animated work way back in the silent film era ("Koko The Clown" and "Felix The Cat," as two prime examples).
Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, Ronny Cox, and Paul Reiser all reprise their roles from the first film along with Murphy.
I first went to see Dumb and Dumber, when it came to the cinemas, and brought my entire family along.
From the first moment (when you see Jim Carrey ask a lady about the way) to the final moment (the two dimwits walks away on the freeway), I cried of laughter.
If you can't decide whether or not to watch this film, trust me- just watch the first 30 seconds.
The first half of the film is much better than the second, with the scenes in the guys' apartment really hitting the mark.
Also, the action scene's were decent too, though the chase with the cement truck was'nt as good as the chase in the first with the transport truck.
I did notice that the film lacked the freshness of the first one but still it was fun to watch.
It was too painful, and I felt really bad for the actors who tried to fill the shoes of Jim and Jeff in the first installment.
I first saw this on TBS when they aired it last year and I laughed harder than ever.
I could not stop laughing the first time I saw it, and the tenth time I saw it, and the hundredth time I saw it.
Usually mimes can be a little irksome (maybe not, depends on who's miming and how well the audience can take it), but Alejandro Jodorowksy, in his first attempt at film-making, makes this as experimental as something like Un Chien Andalou yet with an emotional core that can be understood by viewers open to it all.
There's the woman in particular, acted very well (she's the one sprawled out on a couch or other, with black hair, at least I *think* it's her), who responds to the Jodorowsky character at first with disdain, but then noticing his body changes her attitude.
), at first hesitates, and then reluctantly agrees, and so they are off.
When this first came out in 1994, wild horses couldn't drag me to the theater to see it.
Jim Carrey delivers a side-splitting performance as Lloyd, the lovestruck limo driver who first suggested the trip to Aspen ("We got no food, we got no jobs, our pets HEADS ARE FALLIN' OFF!!
Made eleven years before his impressive feature length debut "Fando y Lis" (1968), Jodorowsky's first film "La Cravate" (aka.
It was my first film experience from Switzerland and fortunately it was very good and satisfying.
I have seen many German films (from Germany or Austria) but this film was the first one which made me laugh!
Yet, even so, the world comes first.
In the first third of the movie Vitus is six years old and in the rest he is twelve.
Also present in that first scene are his born-again grandma (Celia Weston) and his gay musical show-biz uncle (Dallas Roberts).
This independent first film by Ratliff uses the conventional sound effects and disintegrating set devices of the horror film in fresh ways.
Seeing the grandfather in the role was excellent- I first saw him as Hitler in the German film Untergang (Downfall) about Hitler's last days.
That would be the first time a bullet "casing" ever caused a mortal wound.
Leaving a good first impression.
Loved the audition scene: "Here comes Peter Easter Bat, Flapping ::wham::" (and he goes face first into a tree).
A second tank is disabled at a greater distance and with no more fanfare than the first.
The first aspect is Erkan Can's wonderful role play.
Saw this on WorldLink TV last night - gripping from the first frame.
Unlike the first film, Black Cat has everything you thought Nikita had (hardcore violence and gritty realism).
Black Cat is directed by Stephen Shin and it stars Jade Leung, in her first feature role.
I stumbled upon this film, and was tempted not to watch it when the first minutes were so quiet.
I found the film, at times quite atmospheric and moody(..mainly the first 45 minutes), but the ending is sh!T.
I saw this show when it first aired and it wasn't as bad as they make out to be.
At first the movie seemed like an excuse for a soft porn movie.
first one is regarding the first 10 minutes or so where the plot is a bit as "all over the place" and might loose the viewer's interest (certenly almost did mine).
just like "usual suspects" makes perfect logical sense( i really respect that first and fore-most in any respectable thriller).
The first 45 minutes of the movie lays the foundation.
The first time, I was involved with doing something else and when I would glance up, I was like oh, okay.
I am so glad it wasn't just me, that the first review I see here - Mermaidbronze - felt the same way I did.
The locations and sets are first rate and the story is compelling.
The non-Hollywood fuzzy camera first put me off, but the initial action fight-chase scene had me wondering what was happening and why.
Now, granted, it was an unfinished version of the film, but it remains the first, and only, movie that I have ever walked out of.
Two different sides then vie for possession of the tube, the first comprised of an archaeologist, a shot-first-and-never-ask-questions cop (Savini, the only "actor" of note in this film), and a "mysterious" (read: boring) vigilante who may or may not be an alien.
The first part of Adama's statement is fair enough.
Yes, I remember when I got my first taste of Battlestar Galactica for the first time back in 1986 when it showed on BBC2 at 6pm.
SAGA OF A STARWORLD: The movie-length series pilot was great, with space battle action, we see for the first and only time the full fleet of Battlestars as they were, lots of Cylons, the traitorous Count Baltar (John Colicos), the planet Carolon and the creepy Ovions.
If like me you are unsure of whether you saw Star Wars or this first, then a mutual fondness of both arises.
When I first watched this show back a couple of years ago, it just caught me like no other had ever done before.
Labelled a shameless Star Wars rip-off, the show exploded on to TV screens in the late 70s, only to peter out in its first season after audiences tired of increasingly lame scripts apparently built around the re-use of expensive effects footage.
A disgruntled Jane Seymour apparently demanded that her character, Serina, be shot dead by a Cylon at the first possible opportunity.
The show was axed at the end of its first season, leaving the storyline unresolved and a generation of kids feeling ripped off.
I'm still not very sure where the moral center of the movie was located, but I think that was Malle's point-- that it's a good idea to question and re-evaluate all taboo subjects to understand why they are taboo in the first place.
---MAJOR SPOILERS---  Anyway, I must say that most of the content, especially the first half, is disturbing because you can see how cruel was the social environment where the girl was living in.
When this film was first released the sequence showing the brothel auctioning the virginity of their new girl to the highest bidder raised a lot of eyebrows, and clearly many in the audiences had not appreciated that this practice used to be commonplace.
We can't escape the fact that our first playoff game was in 1990, 23 years after the team manifested.
The final moment of the movie has Shields, about to become an actual little girl for the first time in her life, having her picture taken by her stepfather.
This was Louis Malle's first American movie and another one - like ZAZIE DANS LE METRO (1960), MURMUR OF THE HEART (1972), LACOMBE LUCIEN (1974), BLACK MOON (1975) and AU REVOIR, LES ENFANTS (1987) - which dealt with the world of children.
However, despite a notable cast (Keith Carradine, Susan Sarandon, Barbara Steele and Gerrit Graham), the film only really comes to life - after a rather wandering first half - when the Lolita-esquire elements of the Brooke Shields character take center stage.
This film was largely shunned when it was first released.
I'd like to point out that this movie is literally based on first hand recollections of a prostitute interviewed in Al Rose's definitive book on the subject: "Storyville", published many years ago.
Although ragtime and jazz are touched on in the movie, Storyville was directly responsible for the likes of young Louis Armstrong--who ran coal from House to House--picking up the street melodies he heard and playing them on a cornet furnished to him--providentially--by the local orphanage, and for Ferdinand "Jelly Roll" Morton, pianist...and pimp...who played in only the best houses and claimed he invented the term "jazz" as applied to music after witnessing first hand all that "jassing-around" he saw in the bordellos of Storyville!
I suppose I'm somewhat biased, but, as someone who worked on the show during it's first season, I found it to be an absolutely abysmal experience.
I first watch the intro (which was cool) then I watch an episode or two.
"Beau Pere" was banned in Ontario when it first came out (the ban has since been lifted).
A step-brother and step-sister can marry, so can two first cousins (now people of the same sex can marry), but not a step-parent and child.
Well, that's what we think, at first.
The first product really worthy of the term "Interactive Movie"
Plus it was one of the first games to take advantage of the real life video technology offered by the CD-ROM's arrival.
"Ballada o soldate" has one of the most poignant sequences of all war movies:when the mother holds only for a few minutes, her dear boy in her arms,it's impossible to hold back your tears .I saw the movie for the first time thirty years ago and I have never forgotten it.Far from politics ,"ballada o soldate" is an universal poem,enhanced by a magnificent grandiose score,which enhances the simple beauty of the pictures,climaxing on a symphony for the finale.
Now, in comparing the shows-someone here wrote that MTM was the first great ensemble comedy.
At first you are terrified of Lou Grant.
I saw the first episode when it first aired in prime time back in September of 1970 when I was nine years old.
At first I wasn't impressed.
I still don't like the first season too much.
OK OK--his wife had left him but still... After the first season though the series picked up speed and just got better and better.
The first film was "The cranes are flying" by Mikhail Kolotozov.
Fox on his first audition, thought he played Alex a little too smart-assish.
Along the way, Alex develops love interests, first in the form of Ellen (played by the actor's future wife, Tracy Pollan) and later, Lauren, a psychology major.
I wanted to like Somewhere in the Night and at first was impressed by the off kilter style of the opening in the WWII field hospital with the heavily bandaged amnesia victim played by John Hodiak, but when it switched to its stateside development I soon realized it was derived from several predecessors and didn't really have a clue where to go itself.
Eight film roles, only one of which (her first) is of any importance.
Getting back to the rivetingly noir, Somewhere in the Night, this movie is not just an actor's heyday (which it is Â you'll probably miss the clever way one of the players signals the plot to the audience in the first 15 minutes, so watch for it on a second view), but a photographer's and set designer's paradise as well.
But it's almost in their class Â an atmospheric and at times archetypal noir, the first directorial effort of Joseph L. Mankiewicz and the first major post-war feature to use the device of amnesia-as-metaphor: How vets survived global cataclysm only to have to construct new lives in a homeland that had, in their absence, turned into alien territory.
Mankiewicz' first go as director comes as a surprise.
And Highmore, who first came to prominence in "Finding Neverland" and then starred as the lead in "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," is one of the most gifted child actors around.
Reluctant at first and fearful of Alyosha, the young couple experiences their first love in several sensitive scenes but it is to be short-lived.
August is a musical genius who would easily put Mozart to shame: he becomes a skilled guitarist within the first hour of exposure to a guitar; he starts composing and notating a symphony immediately after being shown the basic scales; he can play an organ, complete with pedals and stops, on a first try; he is skilled enough to conduct the New York Philharmonic; in the final scene we come to understand he has a certain level of extrasensory perception.
He plays perfectly and invents a new way to play the guitar the first time he touches it???
When he's playing on the bridge his first time out it's so awful, a rhythm part is being played while he has both hands on the upper neck of the guitar???
Then starts playing a very complicated church organ on his first sitting, which takes years to master??
This is the equivalent of speaking perfect French after someone said bonjour to you for the first time.
The first man Lady Snowblood kills is one of the 3 villains she has devoted her life to killing.
So her first kill has no purpose and is totally out of place.
So they find the first of the three and after Lady Snowblood saves his life she kills him herself.
And as Lady Snowblood leaves the building the first villain's daughter appears out of nowhere (how on earth did she know where to find her?)
This is the first time I feel compelled to write so many bad things about a movie.
I don't want to give anything away, in case for some insane reason you want to see it, so I'll only go into the story problems in the first 15 minutes.
It's about a son and his parents who all have to find each other, but my problem was that I couldn't figure out a way they could have gotten so separated in the first place.
He's a good actor and I believe this was the first thing I've seen him in.
Instead of a sappy reunion scene that would've ruined the tone of the movie, they ended it beautifully with the crescendo of the music and just the close-up on August as he sees his parents standing there for the first time.
The first few seasons have been great, and although it has faded a little bit since the start, I will continue to watch this show.
Flash-forward twenty years and Colbert and Brent have two sons, the first one actually Welles', though this is kept secret.
It was her first major role and she handles it with surprising poise and assurance.
Due to its singular style, I would suggest renting first, as it will not be everyone's cup of tea.
Once again, I say, please study the history first, then view the series.
I hugely enjoyed this series when it was first shown in 1981, even watching the contemporary Sunday repeats which were buried away at 10.30pm on BBC2.
When I first viewed the series, in 1985, I thought it had good acting and production value but was a bit cheesy in its portrayal of some of the more seedy aspects of the reputed Borgia family skeletons.
Even the politician/father is more complex than we think at first; although perhaps predictably, because of the career he's chosen, he moves the least of the major characters.
Anthony, for his part, is in it at first for the political effect he can create by outing Henry, but he begins to see there's more to Henry than just the politician's son, and that the cause he was using Henry for is more complicated than he thought.
This was perhaps the first movie in a long time that I was truly disappointed in.
The first movie I got from Netflix that I probably would never watch again.
It isn't necessarily a bad thing that a first time director is working from a script with first time writers; I've seen worse films where a first time director wrote the script.
At first the plot of this movie might seem to move along too slowly, but that is simply to establish the characters and setting of the movie which is something that has to be done to fully appreciate this movie.
Her first victim, Banzo, has a young daughter who prostitutes herself so that he can have booze and medicine for what ails him.
We first meet Anthony as an "out there" Act Up!
Have to say...even cut up as it was the first time I saw it, it was still a 10.
When we first meet Moll, she lives in the house of the Mayor of Colchester, coquettishly flirting with his two sons.
One is her first love, but he passes her to his brother who marries her.
They entire thing stumbles in a gooey fog through second rate (why not use first rate?)
When Red first appears on stage, tossing aside her outfit to reveal a decidedly immodest red costume, I was genuinely taken aback, and then felt somewhat ashamed of myself.
While it isn't quite as funny as SWINGSHIFT, it is the first of its kind and because of that it still is one of the best of the era.
Here is the short (besides her last cartoon Little Rural Riding Hood), that got me to love to the first overtly erotic cartoon character ever created - Red.
The same year as the first of the Lone Wolf series brought another adaption of a manga from the same author.
As a note: the first killing she does is so the Beggar King will get information for her.
There are better cartoons (some even by Avery himself) and there are cartoons that I personally like better, but in terms of what Avery was attempting to do with the form, in terms of what animation was at the time and had been in the past and what its potential was for the future and the impact that Avery had and would have on his artform, this is the first truly successful Avery cartoon on all terms, both Avery's and animation.
Avery blew out the valves, cranked up the engine and blew the doors off on this one for the first (but not last) time here.
Tex Avery's first excursion into animated sexual frenzy is his best, ranking as one of his three greatest cartoons (the other two, in case you're wondering, are "Who Killed Who?," also 1943, and "King-Size Canary," 1947).
"Red Hot Riding Hood" is one of his best and was the first in the "Red" series.
...with the film and the actors at first sight!
The first thing you will notice about the film is that the idea of holding back just doesn't appeal to the director, and therefore the film is very gritty and very, very violent; which is a very good thing in my opinion.
I picked up Jane Austen's book Pride & Prejudice while in high school and I couldn't make myself get past the first chapter... that and the fact that I don't typically like period dramas (they usually aren't done too well), I was hesitant when a friend casually mentioned that it was good, though long.
The moment you start watching the first episode, which is an hour long, you immediately get addicted to watching the whole series.
I tried to read P&P before but couldn't finish the first a couple of pages, under a false impression coming from reading the first quarter of sense and sensibility that the heroine in P&P was also full of vanity and conceit.
The heroine in the first half is very self-conscious but acceptable with witty lines here and there.
In this day and age when most young directors get their first shot, they make some wannabe post-Tarantino gangsta film.
Financially I just don't have a clue what is trying to be accomplished by doing all these (Hell I won't even call it a B-movie because that would be a compliment) D movies in the first place!
EAT in blur, first EATING chomp spurts blood, run after hapless victims to EAT--There's no rudimentary problem solving, no cleverly out-thinking prey!
The acting, dialogue and special effects were so bad that at first I thought I was watching a parody.
The actors read their lines like high school kids auditioning for their first play.
The highlight is a bikini-clad model spending most of the first hour running away after her fellow model got chomped up by Supergator.
At first the movie seems to be playing up its own cheesiness, with lots of babes in bikinis and ridiculous acting.
Those who haven't seen 'Kill Bill' should see this first, and then 'Kill Bill' after.
I first saw this film over a decade ago and recalling from what I saw of it to be an abysmally lame and foul film.
I promised myself I wouldn't compare my first viewing of "Lady Snowblood" too much with Quentin Tarantino's widely acclaimed masterpiece "Kill Bill", but the truth is you simply CAN'T think about anything else as I didn't expect the two films to be this similar.
The first chapter enlightens us about what happened to Yuki's parents and how she was born to complete the vengeance mission her mother started.
It was the 1962 Kurosawa movie "Sanjuro," I believe, that first introduced the "geyser blood" special effect to the world, but 11 years later, Toshiya Fujita's "Lady Snowblood" developed this image to a fine art.
she gets home to find her dad killed and finds that the crazy lady had something do with it so she decides to investigate what is really going on by visiting Silent Hill and also at the same time find out the truth about her "burning" past  -this game is pretty much a sequel to the first game with a lot of the characters from that game appearing in this which makes for a really great story because in it's own confusing way it actually helps the story from the first game make a little bit of sense.
throughout the whole game you think you know who she is but in a second you find that she's a MAJOR character from the first game and the movie now all grown up.
If the first movie went with the first game's plot then I hope that he uses the plot involving the grown up Alessa from this game for the next movie.
I will admit when I first bought it, I was too scared to play it, so I got my friend over and watched him play it.
The monsters, although not as scary as the ones in the first two (some are just hilarious), are designed bautifully.
The story is great as it seems to be a sequel to the first one, and of course Origins fits nicely in there too.
It's about as long as the first one(in general, it takes a bit of inspiration from it... including in a way that I'd have preferred it didn't, but I understand that others did want that; you should definitely try to play the original one before this, you will appreciate it on another level), but the well-done puzzles seem simpler(that, or I'm getting better... and I tend to think it's the former, not the latter; meanwhile, this has the greatest riddle-solving system yet), if there may be about the same amount of them.
The film's cinematographer makes great use of contrast staging the first half of the film in a rural forest setting and the second half in an urban landscape.
And in the first scene, there is a house on fire and these firemen are fighting the fire and trying to rescue people in the house.
Perry's character is no innocent, when he first journeys into the forest (he is an alcoholic and an emotionally abusive husband), the viewer gets the sense that he is unaware of the world in which he lives.
I have to talk about something specific in the short, so let this be my spoiler warning: Any cartoon where Porky Pig sings the first verse of "Barbara Allen" is one my permanent list of favorites.
When I first saw this cartoon, hearing an old tradition song issuing forth in the dulcet tones of Porky Pigs had me rolling on the floor and it still makes me laugh like a loon to this day.
Since the first time I saw this wonderful film on late-night TV, maybe 30 years ago, it has been my sentimental favorite.
But the biggest complaints to voice would be the lack of general thematic focus, and the fact that the majority of the better material in the story is told in the first half and the second, while still good, really doesn't work as compelling stuff.
In the first part of the film, Nicola is exploring Norway, and sends a postcard to his brother back home telling him of his travels and experiences, and in three words, seems to sum up the film perfectly: "Life is beautiful."
I attended the first three hours the next night and the final three hours the following evening.
Someone once said, "After the first part, you're addicted.
At first, I didn't really think La Meglio GioventÃ¹ would be an interesting movie, but having nothing better to do, I watched it.
It was 12 o'clock Wednesday night and I accidentally caught it in the first 5 minutes.
Despite the transvestite, I don't think he's gay (all I saw in the episode was self-loathing, and nowadays they would have simply told us so; the day he first flirts with Mirella, despite his holding back, he seems no less enthralled than Nicola will be later).
I don't know what it was, but banishing from the film's close the first and only character who "got it" seems to doom the whole family, if only in the sense of their not "getting it" about Matteo and Giorgia.
I sat for the second three hours today with people who sat through the first three hours with me yesterday.
Though it encompasses many historic events and nods towards innumerable themes, it is first and foremost about people.
However, this is never done heavy-handedly and all characters are first and foremost human beings who can be appreciated as individuals transcending their backgrounds or political leanings.
High-level military commanders joined forces with the "Hutu power" extremists and quickly killed all the moderate leaders in the first few hours after the assassination, so there was no one left to oppose them as they set in motion a carefully planned genocide.
Being a world leader is more than just getting to be first in line at the feed trough.
Watching the film I was sickened by the first world's apathy toward Africa.
The first half of the film is much better than the second, as A Quiet Place to Kill unfortunately looses a bit of steam once it gets the first part of the plot out of the way.
From their very first meeting, the attraction between them is clearly both spiritual and sexual.
In viewing this film, start looking for the conflict in the very first scenes.
Charles did feel he owed him and he was the first chief minister that he had.
I had high hopes for the movie for about the first 10 minutes -- I really thought I was going to like it a lot.
Another consistency problem was that for the first quarter or so of the movie, the characters were saying and doing somewhat crass things.
I caught this on City TV last night (Feb 16th, 2008) when flipping through the channels, and even though I had missed the first 30 minutes of this film, I was compelled to stop on that channel and watch it!
Now, a new precious jewel of the British cinema comes to film theatres and from my first impression it could be the best film of this year (well, at least until the new Harry Potter comes out).
I saw it for the first time over the week and I have been watching it over and over again.
The stylistic beauty of the first, where the traces of Comedia del'Arte could be observed, was stage beauty of one kind, and the long and winding path to the realistic stage beauty of the second one... made sense.
I saw him for the first time on Broadway, about 10 years ago, in a Stoppard play.
It was love at first sight.
Maria watches his disintegration onstage, and grasps his utter vulnerability for the first time.
The gentle role-switching from "man" to "woman" (in alternate parlance, "top" to "bottom" or "dominant" to "submissive") leads to a passionate confusion in which, if you'll notice, Ned tells Maria (astride him) first that she is the "woman" - "And now?"
At first amused, then devastated by a loss of roles, income and prestige, Ned slides to singing bawdy songs in drag to a somewhat low(er) class clientele in a sink run by a foulmouthed harridan.
And for the first time ever in a movie a king of England is shown cavorting in the royal rack with his mistress while six adorable King Charles Spaniels look on.
He has sex for the first time, impregnates her, and then it completely makes sense that when her son's illness comes back, Alexai's healing powers are gone.
Dorothy Janis, who apparently only made a handful of films in her brief career, is stunningly beautiful and effective as the pagan girl Shoesmith wishes to wed, and Donald Crisp is first rate as Slater, the cad who disguises his lust as an act of Christian charity.
Novarro croons 'Pagan Love Song' (by Nacio Herb Brown & Arthur Freed) to good effect - giving Hollywood one of its first hit tunes - and his fine singing voice would be heard again in forthcoming films.
I grew up in Ireland and I was completely convinced that she was an Irish actress for the first half hour before I realized that this was the amazing Ms. Landsbury.
I was shocked at first how Alexei just disappeared at the hospital after discovering his powers were gone.
Reb Brown's  first appearance might have ended it, or maybe the first papier- mache dinosaur would have brought the ref's arms up.
Man first, there are 2 different moves that Yor, the hero can perform with his stone axe, but guess what..... its one too much :D. Yor perfectly beats dinosaurs, cyborgs from future, etc.
The first third deals with the mysterious Yor stumbling upon a tribal village.
Those are the first words sung at the beginning of this movie!
Our first image is of Yor, looking like Conan's impotent brother walking into the wasteland.
Within the very first few seconds of this, backed by the eighties rock soundtrack you just know that your in for one hell of a (B-Movie) ride!
The first thing that needs to be said about this movie, is something that should, and shall, be said about all Reb Brown movies.
In this, his first and only movie, he quickly befriends the saggy old man, Pac, and a very clean cave woman called Kala.
The first being a cross between a stegosaurus and a triceretops, a tristegoceretops if you will.
the first being you can make absolutely anything out of straw.
The first is Fruit Chan's Dumplings.
The first segment, "Dumplings", released on its own as a full feature length movie, has the most ties to the Western world and 1950s horror: the fear of old age and ultimate mortality.
Dumplings (6.0) Fruit Chan, director of Public Toilet  Both the Oscillator and Mr. VMU were impressed by the shock value in the first installment.
The first story is Fruit Chan's "Dumplings".
Those first opening minutes are awesome!
These are the three films that collectively make ThreeÂExtremes: The first film is Hong Kong director Fruit Chan's Dumplings.
The first, a shockingly gross-out horror film involving foetophagia (pardon me my neologism if there happens to be a real word for said consumption out there), is about all the wonder in blood and gross biological matter you can possibly compress into gut-churning madness.
Well first off i would like to say that this film was a beautiful display of genres.
The acting is superb and directing is first class.
The first story is "Dumplings" by Lilian Lee.
Horrified at first...vampiric insatiability to follow.
The first short, entitled Box, by Takashi Miike, relates the story of a young writer who is having some difficulty distinguishing between her dreams and reality.
Finally, the first short actually, is Dumplings from Fruit Chan.
The first story by Fruit Chan aims at pure controversial shocks, with its plot about an ageing actress who desperately wants to maintain her good looks and young skin and therefore consults the mysterious "Aunt Mei".
Mrs. Li is very pleased with the results at first, but then gets sick after finishing a 'meal' made of the leftovers of an incest baby.
Admittedly, you require a strong stomach to endure the make-up effects in this first episode, but even more disturbing is Chan's use of freaky sounds.
The first story concerns a woman's greed for beauty and the bizarre path she takes to get it.
The first film of the three is 'Dumplings', staring one of People Magazine's "50 Most Beautiful People in the World 1998", Bai Ling and Miriam Chin-Wah Yeung.
I had a lot of problems with this story, first of all there were a collection of open flamed candles behind the director, I'm sure he could have used those to burn through the ribbon joining his hands together, and also there was a number of times were the extra came so close to the director that he could have easily swung for him, instead he just listened to him talk.
Over all I give this film 7 out of 10, manly because of the first two films, they each got you involved with the characters and had a great ending, the third made me drop the score by a couple of marks, if they had 'Dumplings' as there final piece I would have enjoyed this film a lot more, a good thing about the films is the length of them, as some of the times you may not have the time to watch a two hour feature you can choose to just watch one of the stories and turn it off afterwards.
If you can hold your stomach through the first film "Dumplings", you will certainly enjoy one of these stories and won't be disappointed.
I had to watch several parts of each movie over again after I finished the first viewing, because it's pretty hard to figure out what the hell's going on with one viewing.
While the first two movies were about violence in society this one is basically an action movie.
That's one of the Dirty Harry films, one of the first maybe, the third one actually.
The only answer is for sure the political will to defeat them, but the right strategy is not to shoot first but to corner them at all levels and then shoot them down if they don't want to come down all by themselves.
Harry having trouble with the top police brass about his unorthodox methods in law enforcement, shooting first and asking question's later,is hardly amused with Kate.
Harry who at first had little respect for his new partner woman cop Kate Moore later was almost in tears when she was gunned down saving his life, for the second time in the movie, by taking a bullet that was meant for him.
He was the unlucky bank robber in the first movie and pimp in the second.
They first kill the men for a delivery truck, take all the weapons they could use, killing a guard and a cop at the same time.
A rookie female(Tyne Daly) who happens to be slow at first but has a lot of resilience.
Schickel calls it the best scene in the movie, and a first for any Eastwood film.
Tyne Daly makes her first major appearance, and handles it well.
Bradford Dillman in the first of two Dirty Harry movies plays the top cop Captain McKay and he makes it clear to Callahan in no uncertain terms that he doesn't approve of his methods.
At first Harry isn't too pleased with having to break in a new partner but inevitably grows to value her contribution.
But when his partner, Frank DiGiorgio (John Mitchum) goes down on the job during the robbery of a munitions warehouse, Harry is back on the street, but with a new partner, Kate Moore (Daly), one of the first female inspectors in the country.
James Fargo is in the director's chair for this one, and he comports himself well, recapturing all of the attitudes and elements that made the first two `Dirty Harry' films so successful.
The first four, however, more than make up for it-- and that's the magic of the movies.
The third film (and probably the cheapest, as it looks like it) of the series 'The Enforcer' seemed to have that swinging and carefree vibe of the times, with the biting reality and stark realisations (heavily implemented in the first two) taking a backseat for forceful (if crass) humour.
Mitchum was one of the detectives in the SFPD Homicide Squad and had a peripheral role in the first two films.
She's quite the inexperienced klutz at first, something Clint doesn't really need.
Naturally, it's not as powerful and dramatic as the first of the series, because, once again naturally, sequels are difficult to make.
Callahan finds black militants are not his enemies but his allies: when 'Big' Ed Mustapha (Albert Popwell), the black leader, is arrested to boost the Mayor's prestige, Harry actually resigns this time and continues his pursuit of the revolutionaries as a lonerÂ His female aide risks her own job to he1p him and eventually they chase a prime suspect through the seamy 'massage parlor' underworld of the city and kill a leading gang member, who has disguised, herself as a nunÂ And discovering that the Mayor is being held captive on Alcatraz Island, they make for an abandoned fortress for the final shootoutÂ   The film is a step backwards in style and content from the previous twoÂ Harry seems to have reverted to his first incarnation: 'What kind of a department are we running when we're more concerned with the rights of the criminals than of the people we're supposed to be protecting?'
You may laugh at first but trust me, these guys will freak you out.
Movie moves into high gear when Nick (Cary Grant) sees his first wife as the elevator door closes in the hotel on the way to the honeymoon suite with his bride and he's on the spot to break it to his new bride but then finds out his wife was stranded with a hunk of an anthropologist (Randalf Scott).
I am writing this review because after years of watching this movie and loving every minute of it, every time I watched it, I have just watched 'Move over Darling' for the first time and thought I'd write a review of both and compare them.
For instance, the scene where Nicholas Arden first sees his wife in the hotel lobby and he follows the lift doors closing.
Let me say, first of all, that I am not complaining about this film.
It's all screwball fun and somewhat touching as their romance is rekindled and their children discover their mother for the first time.
It's obvious that the main reason for this film's existence is an attempt to recapture the magic of the first pairing of Cary Grant, Irene Dunne, and Leo McCarey, namely 1937's "The Awful Truth."
When Ellen explains that Stephen was out of commission with a broken leg for the first six months, Nick replies, "That still leaves six and a half years."
Later I found out that he was actually asked to play the James Bond character in the first 1962 Bond movie "Dr. No" but he turned it down because he believed to be too old already at the time to play the character.
Dunne is very funny, posing as a southern friend when she meets Bianca, and also is quite touching when she first sees her children.
I think this movie triggered my first flashback in 25 years.
Of course, she was never dead in the first place but stranded on a desert island with a hunky athlete as her only companion.
After his shipwrecked wife is declared dead and he takes on a new wife, Grant's first wife resurfaces, rescued after seven years on an island.
Dunne and Grant worked well together in another marital comedy, The Awful Truth and they were just as bright in My Favorite Wife as they were in the first film.
...albeit a little slow-paced in the first half.
Cary Grant's facial expression on the elevator when he first sees Dunne after 7 years is so memorable that I can still remember it 35 years after first seeing it.
It's a wonderful show for the Christmas season, and it's even a more wonderful play for amateurs (and especially children) to feel the thrill of being on the stage for the first time.
Painfully slow,amateurish and downright poorly acted first effort from a writer director who's clearly been renting Gaspar Noe/Toshiaki Toyoda style films out at blockbusters a long time.
Normally I'd be the 1st to give a first time writer/director a break, but its a shame we get sham reviewers building films up to be more than they are.
For me I'd of most likely given this film a 4 for a nice first attempt but to balance the way off other ratings its getting a 2.
I do hope you come back soon Gareth, hopefully you could learn one big lesson with this first feature and try make the people in front of the camera feel more comfortable, that way the viewer would feel more comfy and be able to enjoy the film.
As usual the cast and crew have written the first few reviews!
The endless 'thoughtful' silences at least have the decency to let you know the film is going to be boring as hell within the first 10 minutes.
Here is a film that from the first minute grabs you by the scruff of the neck and never lets go.
I first became a fan hen she had her forum on Compuserve and was starting out.
OK, I first saw this video with my b/f, who was a huge Jennifer fan.
Instead of scaring us to death, director Rob Zombie tried to get the audience to empathize with the serials, which the script accomplished perfectly, however lacking the absolute fear the first movie "1000 Corpses" evoked.
Is this film from first time director Rob Zombie a contributor?
I love Rob Zombie's music and was looking forward to this movie when I first heard about it.
More than anything, it feels like a renegade from the direct-to-video bin, where it should have gone in the first place.
At first, you will hate it, then you will like it for how cheesy it is.
Zombie does a good job with making the viewer feel save in the first half of the movie.
The first scene could have been right out of "From Dusk Till Dawn" or one of its countless rip-offs: Two people having a funny conversation and it all ends in a blood bath.
At first sight it looks like a complete mess, but it's a well calculated kick in the stomach!
For a first time producer in Rob Zombie, to make a film like this is just amazing.
I was caught off guard when I viewed this movie for the first time, and was genuinely shocked and scared in some scenes.
I actually liked it at first, it was kind of scary and bizarre enough, but it just became more and more sickening, the evil family in this movie was just absolutely disgusting, which wouldn't have been so bad, but they are almost treated as the heroes of the movie, I get the feeling that Rob Zombie doesn't find their behavior all that reprehensible.
When I first watched TCM I really was unnerved by it, and I found myself thinking about for weeks after.
Zombie might eventually be able to develop his directing into something interesting but first he has to clear the hurdle from music video style and shock to film atmosphere and substance.
In fact, my first viewing of this film was so disappointing that I excessively discouraged other people here to see it.
Rather than to simply ignore the old comment and pretend I never bashed it, I wish to write a new Â more positive Â review, if it were only to convince other people (who also disliked at first) to give it a second change.
Rob Zombie's style is often innovating and so overwhelming that it might look overly hectic at first but, in reality, his dedication towards obscurity and his knowledge on classic cinema is one of the best things that could ever happen to the horror genre.
It was the first time we heard the distinctive opening theme music...of a timpani fanfare.
It was the first time we saw him order...a Scotch and water.
The first time we heard a woman moan: "Oh...Jimmy."
But it was October, 1954, just one year after Ian Fleming's first novel was published.
When I saw this movie for 11 months ago it was the first real time I wanted to kill the director MORE than once.
While 1962's "Dr. No" was the first time James Bond appeared on movie screens, it was actually this 1954 television adaptation that the character was first seen at all.
So what's the verdict on Barry Nelson, the first James Bond?
Any Bond fan should at least try to find this and the average movie goer should do the same, just to see how James Bond's first mission played out.
Incendiary is the first in a string of excellent Michelle Williams' performances, of which the best by far is in Wendy and Lucy.
The first part of the film suggests he would have had a bigger role.
Especially if said reviewers get essential story details wrong, one should be very mistrustful about their supposed skills, and whether they'd actually SEEN the film in the first place.
She plays a stuttering, socially backward young woman living in a dark household where her petty, nagging father (Henry Hull) gloomily inhabits the first floor and her helpless, self-pitying mother (Fay Bainter) occupies the second one.
You really got pulled in to the story.Eric Roberts, Christopher Knight, and Meadow Williams gave first rate performances.
The doctor is played by Fox Harris, from 'Repo Man', and the guy that dies first in this movie was the first to die in another 80's cult classic, "Night of the Comet".
All three were released in the US by Roger Corman's New World Films and make a sort of unofficial Trio -- The first was Norman "Warm & Fuzzy" Warren's deceptively cheesy looking HORROR PLANET (or INSEMINOID) in 1980, then Bob Clark's GALAXY OF TERROR (or MIND WARP: AN INFINITY OF TERROR) in 1981, then Holzman's FORBIDDEN WORLD in 1982.
Having first seen the directors' 12min take on Poe's Fall of the House of Usher, I was looking forward to seeing this one too and wasn't disappointed at all.
Actually, it was Ethel Waters who was the first black woman to star in her own TV series.
Fred Williamson's first appearance on this show was in "Dancer I The Dark", an episode that was written by Hal Kanter the creator and producer ofthis series.
She won the Tony Award in 1962(the first African-American actress to do so),and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress in the 1974 landmark classic "Claudine",which she starred opposite James Earl Jones.
Diahann Carroll is best remembered as being one of the first and foremost television series to featured an black actress to star in her own weekly series where she did not play a domestic worker(Before "Julia",television shows featuring lead characters were usually servants like Louise Beavers in "Beulah",and Amanda Randolph in "Make Room For Daddy").
And the first to star in a non-stereotypical role.
"Julia" was the first to featured a black actress in a positive light during the height of the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War.
However,the show was the first to tackle issues head on for its day and it was handled with style and grace..something that was unheard of and especially when this show premiered in 1968.
Also starring Charles Dance as Sir Henry Carlyle.And Aly Bain as a fiddler,who's murder is the first in a bizarre and frightening line of dark events which draw Doyle and Bell closer together as they try and stop it.
We first encounter Dr. Bell while he is whipping the buttocks of a corpse, prior to firing a bullet into the dead man's chest.
The DVD transfer is first rate.
Considering humor, I should also mention Monpti and Anne Claire's first meeting in the park: "Did I really say that?"
By contrast, only a negligible minority will first see a movie, discover that it is a filmed novel, and therefore read the book.
I was 53 when I saw 'Monpti' for the first time.
NONE of this is talked about, I liked Greta Saachi as Gale Sondergard WHO WAS NOT a major actress, She won here Oscar for her first performance & was in supporting roles ever since, I felt Goldblum was effective as Biberman also a minor writer of films,   as always   jay harris
Biberman first casts his wife in the lead role, then replaces her with Mexican actress Rosaura Revueltas (Angela Molina).
I might add that this was the first filmatisation that I watched and thus my opinion might be a little biased but I think that this film is still on the top shelf in terms of overall quality, a true classic.
The first was a poor silent version.
I am not familiar with Bhen's other roles, but in the final reel she manages to deliver the necessary winning performance that is repressed in the first half of the film.
The performances in the film are all first rate, and the single flashback sequence toward the end of the film (the flashback that explains the motivations for the lead character's actions) is both heartbreaking and horrifying.
At first, the movie seemingly revolves around a young woman who kills mercilessly for justice.
The first thing that struck me about this particular documentary was that it didn't have a lot of the traditional interviews and there was no voice over - instead the filmmakers developed the story through the characters themselves, and what ensues is a unique approach to this form of film-making.
The script by Erik Anjou plays the concept far more like a standard teen slasher (as if we didn't already have enough) rather than trying to develop the demonic phone-line to hell idea as in the first, instead they take the 976-EVIL premise & simply use it to give some supernatural powers to a homicidal maniac who wants to kill lots of dumb & annoying teenagers, yawn.
Director Wynorski still had the nerve to use his real name on the credits when he made this back in '91 instead of hiding under his usual Jay Andrews pseudonym, the film is reasonably well made but it doesn't have any style or the visual look of the first film.
The charm in this is that a bunch of first timers (At least their previous credits don't add up to much) have made a little movie that pretty much works.
The first and last death showcases that perfectly.
Because the context of it doesn't seem to fit the era, but hey there's a first for everything, right?
Let's start first with the story.
Trivia: Although "Psycho" is widely credited with being the first film to feature the actual sound of a stabbing taking place, if memory serves me right, this one might have beaten it to the punch by a year ...
Peter Cushing plays the doctor who needs bodies in this fine adaptation of the Burke and Hare grave robbing case.Donald Pleasance and George Rose are both excellent as the infamous grave robbers.The film is truly atmospheric-full of packed bars,foggy streets and deep shadows-and the performance by Peter Cushing is simply amazing-Cushing is probably one of the most recognizable faces in the horror genre.The film has an eerie cinematic style reminiscent more of films from the 1940's than 1959.The first half of Gilling's story moves extremely slow,but the second half has some gruesome murder scenes.A must-see for fans of British horror!
Still, the escalation of the tragedy is truthfully illustrated with Burke and Hare getting into the body-snatching business coincidentally at first, but quickly specializing in it because of the good cash money and eventually even converting to murder in order to deliver the most 'quality'.
A little story on the first day of spring here in Sweden.
This was Waters' first real studio film-- 13million budget and it really took us where we wanted to go.
This is my first John Waters film and I think I've got a good handle on his style of filmmaking.
Lake, the daughter in search of a boyfriend, is the first to suspect her mother's dark side and Lillard, the son with a love for classic gore horror movies, is interested when he's told his mother may be a killer.
I had a big smile plastered on my face for about the first half-hour, which is the best part of the movie, and while the last half-hour loses some steam, it's still a joy to watch Turner and especially Mink Stole.
Although a little ridiculous at first, any flaws it has are made up for in the way Beverley carries out her murders, my favourite being the guy in the toilets gruesome demise.
Beverly Sutphin at first seems like the perfect mom.
Her first victim is Paul Stubbins, a teacher who makes some unkind remarks about her son at a PTA meeting, and she progresses to her daughter's unfaithful boyfriend, a couple who are rude about Eugene's dental practice and various people who commit minor social gaffes such as failing to rewind rented video tapes (the film predates the coming of DVD), failing to recycle their garbage, and wearing white shoes after Labor day.
The first is an often very witty script, displaying a refreshingly cynical sense of humour, which includes some great lines such as "He killed people, mom- We all have our bad days".
The mores of suburbia have been fair game for satirists ever since the first suburbs were built, and here Waters is sending up the culture of middle-class conformity which all too often attaches to such places.
We don't know how long she's been killing, but the first half of the film follows a week in her life and the various neighbors and acquaintances she dispatches simply because they pi$$ her off.
I saw Serial Mom for the first time as a fairly young kid, and thought it was pretty good.
I've just seen it for the first time as an adult, and it turns out that I'd forgotten just how good this film really is!
So these non-PC (frankly, audience-scaring) ideas had to be 'toned down', to the point where the producers lost the core audience they were shooting for in the first place.
members of the audience will nod in agreement as that is what you want to ask the makers of this movie from the first minute on.
The movie is a bit difficult to follow during the first portion of the movie, but that alone is usually a positive for me as this isn't a movie whose plot is known 10 minutes into the movie.
Bonding first with each other, then eventually with people outside their narrow world, O.C.
Two, at first glance, unconnected stories slowly, but surely merge and form the whole puzzle.
Conclusion, the first hour of the movie is not as intense as the last.
I was slightly worried at first that subtitles were a bit ambitious for hungover Sunday viewing but it was fairly easy to keep up.
The two plot lines seem completely separate at first and they are nicely tied together later in the film.
L'EMPIRE DES LOUPS is another intelligent, intense and very explosive thriller from the author Jean-Christophe GrangÃ© who wrote also the first CRIMSON RIVERS.
has great similarities to the first Crimson Rivers.
Crimson Rivers 2 is not based on a novel of the first movie.
On first viewing, the movie was rated a 5, for some interesting camera work, and movie tone.
Well, this certainly isn't the first film for which I'm way off of the mainstream public opinion as reflected on the Internet Movie Database, and it certainly will not be the last.
I missed the first few minutes of it, however and would love to see it again.
I first saw Mariska's work when she was a kid on "Falcon Crest" and my opinion of her has never changed.
Mr. Jones does a fantastic job of being uncomfortable with his new role as the first African-American president of the United States.
In real life there would have been no investigation in the first place, and certainly no criminal charges.
The first was noticeable, however forgivable.
Chris and Ann began falling in love, as Ann came to terms with her first love, Chris' brother, was killed in the war.
I watched this movie on TCM yesterday for the first time.
I tell ya, there's no obscure 80's movie I'd rather see for the first time flipping through Showtime at 4am than O.C.
It's based on the first novel by Edgar Wallace, prolific British author who spent much time in Africa during the latter 19th and early 20th century.
Though taking place in the Nigeria area, the film was shot on location in the Kenya colony and we learned that the first Kenyan president, Jomo Kenyatta actually was an extra in this film.
KFOR troops suffered first victim in 2001, in an accident shooting, and fact is that KLA has never attacked NATO troops, they were allies.
My tip for directors is: before you shoot a movie, analyze the culture of the people first... On the other hand, KFOR soldiers were not positioned in mountains and rural areas of Kosovo, they were positioned in towns, villages and populated areas.
I think that fortunately spanish cinema is evolving from the obscure era of the "destape" (the first movies that were made after the death of Franco were known like this because most of them were light porn films) and from Almodovar's large shadow.
When the first started out, it was OK. Not that entertaining but not that dark either.
I think hell would have to freeze over first.
Three years ago when I was watching the Cartoon Cartoon Top 5, and first place went to an episode of the Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy named Night of the Living Grim.
The first is how much you can tolerate the potty humor used in the show, and the second is how much you view the characters Billy and Mandy.
It is based on the true and personal story of Run DMC, The Fat Boys, Kurtis Blow, Sheila E, and others breaking out rap music for the first time to the mainstream audiences against convention and against those who would view rap as non-music and a fad.
But seriously the first rap cassette I ever bought was Fat Boys Are Back in 1985 when I was 9.
I put this movie on while doing something else and ended up watching the whole thing standing up(a first for me).
Being that this was his first movie, lucky for him it didn't kill his career.
The embedded flashbacks make it a bit hard to follow the first 10 times you watch it, but make it pleasantly Warhol-esque especially once you know the majority of the lines.
At first he's all shy, and toward the end, he becomes a real bohemian charmer with his poetry and professions of love.
It is my first comment on this page and this movie is actually the reason why i am registered...You will for sure question your life after u watch it.
I watched this film the first time when I was 10 or something, but was falling in love with the film when I was 17.
I've seen this movie a lot of times,in fact,I bought it after I saw it the first time and I'm still always looking for time to watch it again.
And while I'm not an expert on teenage depression, I'd like to think it takes more for a young lad to blow his own head off than simply running into life's first obstacle.
Todd has mostly been an observer throughout this, but the loss of one of the few people who cared about him, and the potential loss of another finally bring him out of his shell, and allow him to take his first stand.
"Think" he seems to be saying, "but first, let me censor this book."
It is inspiring and uplifting for the first hour and 15 minutes or so, before changing stride altogether to a somewhat depressing but remarkable conclusion.
The "Dead Poets Society", and the boys on which Mr. Keating has such a profound impact, include an interesting mix of characters...Neil Perry (the passionate young man at odds with his father's clearly defined expectations for his son's life), Todd Anderson (the classic shy adolescent, through whose eyes we view the unfolding drama), Charlie Dalton (the quintessential rebel), Knox Overstreet (the teen with whom most viewers can identify, deep in the throes of first love), and Richard Cameron (the mindless conformist).
In the beginning, when the young men are first introduced to this idea of sucking the marrow out of life it is applied by the students when its results prove to be fun and joyous.
After seeing it for the 24th time since I first saw it 5 years ago, on my 13th birthday, I can gladly say that this movie went far and beyond the 80s, and the power and inspiration of the message can be felt every day.
I first saw this movie when I was 13, and immediately stamped, crowned and elevated this movie as my all-time favorite.
Much more expansive & elaborate than the first film, Fairbanks shows what he's learned about producing silent swashbucklers in the intervening five years.
After his artsy fantasy "The Thief of Baghdad" freaked everyone out, Doug got back to basics with this sequel to his first swashbuckler, "The Mark of Zorro" -- and concocted a meticulously designed, take-no-chances star vehicle.
Sprightly, only slightly less appealing sequel to Fairbank's first outing as Zorro.
They're on the first floor...and then they hear noises on the floor above...THAT scared me silly.
Quinton Tarantino included this flick in his 2007 LA Grindhouse Film Festival, and the print was not only from his personal collection, but he introduced the movie himself at it's first screening.
His praise followed the lines of the review appearing at the head of this IMDb comments section: this was innovative in 1978 (I saw it first in its test market run, before it got national distribution).
Tarantino asserted the belief that it was the first of the "kids-go-to-the-lake" scare flicks; that it was innovative in its "stories-within-the-story" for the genre; and, that for the dollars, the acting, directing, camera work and special effects are pretty damn good.
a film i first saw in 1979 at the drive in.
"Screams of a Winter Night" was made with student actors attending Northwestern State University in Natchitoches,Louisiana,a college that has since been abandoned,the neglected campus becoming a popular teen hang-out.It consists three genuinely spooky stories told by a young campers in an old cabin.The first one is about 'The Moss Point Man',a Yeti-like creature encountered by a local girl and her boyfriend deep in the woods.The second one is about a mute psychopath in an allegedly haunted hotel with the climax somewhat reminding me "The Blair Witch Project".The third story is about a sexually repressed girl turning psycho after an attempted rape.The strange,howling wind is becoming stronger and stronger...Creepy low-budget gem from late 70's without gore and nudity.It has some great scares and surprising twists.8 out of 10.
The first time I saw this movie, I was a kid and we'd gone to the drive-in.
For instance, how many people would buy a DVD special edition of "Screams of a Winter Night" if they haven't paid 99 cents to rent it first?
As for the stories, yes, that first one is real moldy by today's standards.
This is a movie, that never enjoyed much popularity and is counted as one of Bogart's minor works, however, from the first time i watched it, it offered a certain fascination to me.
Though Rico dies in a fall while trying to escape from testifying, we later see him in a flashback scene recounting how he was present at Mendoza's first "hit" of a cafÃ© owner.
If the first 15 minutes amounts to paranoia run amok, the last amounts to suspense in spades as a cold-eyed killer stalks an unsuspecting girl along crowded city streets.
At the time of writing this i have yet to have it confirmed, but it's thought that this Bretaigne Windust directed picture is the first mainstream picture to deal with the complexities of organised crime?, certainly the dialogue is now common speak (courtesy of Martin Rackin (Riffraff (1947)), but back in 1951 it surely would have raised eyebrows and intrigued the watching public.
It was during these broadcasts that the general public first became aware of some of the jargon used by hired killers and "The Enforcer" is credited as being the first movie to feature the words "contract", "hit" and "fingerman" in this context.
What five-year-old child at any time in the last forty years would be unable to interpret 'contract' and 'hit' when encountered in the context of a thriller/noir/caper/gangster movie yet here, in 1951, both hard-bitten detectives and an Assistant District Attorney are as bemused as Hoosier tourists hearing Urdu for the first time whilst on vacation in the sub-Continent.
THE ENFORCER is criticized in several comments posted on IMDb in part for its portraying cops learning code words such as "hit" and "contract", for the first time.
Mendoza - "This is my first contract.
Although the star of the film in terms of first billed in The Enforcer is Humphrey Bogart, the film's main character is Ted DeCorsia in what is probably his best screen performance.
As chairs began to fly and the gendarmes got busy with the batons we escaped the mayhem and stood and watched it from across the rue unaware that there was another, more constructive, upheaval taking place on the Cote D'azure with the first ever entry from Thailand Â Tears of the Black Tiger.
but first off this is a fantastic visual film with primary colours leaping off the screen with a few nice touches of black and white in the background to add contrast.
This is the first time I think I`ve seen Buddhist wild west gunslingers.
Perhaps it was my being 16 when I first saw the movie and latching onto ti for being different (and funny), but hey, if it ever gets re-released, I will re-buy it.
At first I wasn't sure if this movie was serious or if it was more like a spoof.
The spaghetti Westerns of thirty years ago gave new life to a tired genre - and now we have the first Thai Western, a big improvement on Hollywood's efforts.
Not for all tastes, this was the first Thai film to play in competition at Cannes.
The story combines two different genres into one, the first being a cowboy western, (set in Thailand no less!)
Perhaps the novelty of the first genre type is having Thai folks dress up as cowboys, riding on their steed and somehow, becoming the villains as they plunder and kill.
So the color comes first.
The two best though, are Fai, a classic machine gun and vest bad guy who has the films funniest shot in his first shootout - look out for it, its quite subtle - and Mahesuan, Dum's right-hand man, who has the best evil laugh EVER, using it whenever he gets the chance, also one half of an inspired shootout or two.
His duel in the first half hour is also one of the funniest shots for any film fan.
My spontaneous reaction at the first time ("Citizen Kane meets Casablanca") still holds.
DELICIOUS LITTLE DEVIL is particularly valuable in that it's the first of her silent comedies to rise from the archives and costars the legendary Rudolph Valentino as her beau.
This delightful little comedy is a fascinating glimpse of the first days of the Jazz Age with a never more charming Mae Murray who practically cannot stand still and gives a sweet, amusing performance and then there's the stunningly handsome Valentino, then not yet a star but certainly showing star charisma in spades.
wow.this depiction of the Spanish-American war,and one particular American regiment,took my breath away.there may be some historical liberties taken,but who cares.this TV mini series was outstanding.the battle scenes were something to behold.John Milius directed and co-wrote this movie.he also wrote several episodes of the TV series Rome.the acting her is first rate.Tom Berenger plays Theodore Roosevelt(before he became President)who led the regiment.Sam Elliot plays Capt.Bucky O'Neil,Gary Busey plays Gen.Joseph' Fighting Joe' Wheeler.also in the cast are Illeana Douglas as Edith Roosevelt,and Chris Noth.there are many others in the cast and all are superb.this movie is about 3 hours long,but it doesn't feel like that at all.this is one of the best war movies i have seen.9/10
I watched this in my American History 2 class and I fell asleep after the first ten minutes.
this is an excellent film that most have never heard of because it was made for TV (turner)and never shown in the theater.not much to add except that the film sheds light on the short and little known 1898 Spanish-American war which while trumped up by the media(newspaper publisher William Randolph Hurst played superbly by George Hamilton)catapulted the up until then isolationist united states on to the world stage for the first time and which gave the united states control of Spanish territories around the globe-Cuba,Puerto Rico the Philippines,wake island,Guam and the Marshall islands.and allowing the united states to flex its military might globally for the first time.there are some historical inaccuracies(such as the imperial German army advisor's aiding the Spanish, director john milius also made the turn of the century imperial Germans the bad guys in his 1975 film THE WIND AND THE LION in which Brian Keith played teddy Roosevelt as president during an international incident resolved by his big stick diplomacy-sending the marines.if you liked rough riders see the wind and the lion.
Tom Berenger is wonderful as the one and only TR who adored by his men (reportedly, on the march into the interior from the coast, TR walked with his men, refusing to ride, through the humid, hot forest and always saw to it that "his boys" were taken care of first.
The story in this one is that Dennis Quaid plays the now adult son of Roy Scheider, whom played the police chief in the first two films.
When I first saw the film in the mid 80's on BETAMAX (!!!
At first, I thought this was going to be another killer ape picture, instead it was an very cool knock-off of David Cronenberg's "Rabid", with awesome effects by Carlo Rambaldi.
The first attempt at showcasing the new technology for the Lambert Aircraft Company ends in a nosedive, so with Jerry and Doc Williams (Emmett Vogan) sent off packing, they arrive at their desert cabin to start all over again.
Just like Asylum's version of War Of The Worlds, this film has the following characteristics:  - Poor acting - Bad effects - Continuity errors all over the place - A few 'glowing reviews' that cannot possibly be real - Timed to coincide with the release of a similar big-budget movie  After the first 20 minutes I had to stop watching it, else my foot would have gone through the screen.
)In case your wondering the *cough* "plot" is set at SEA WORLD FLORIDA,not AMITY ISLAND,like in first two and "the revenge".
The survivors--almost totally unhurt, at least at first--try to find the lost cockpit with its radio but soon encounter giant bugs, little dinosaurs and a single monster ape.
If the women are rarely more than eye candy, the men are compelled to wrestle with the various technological & situational challenges that the storyline tosses at them--which they do less well than my friends & I did in first grade when we played in our backyards & argued about what was supposed to happen next.
This one was another in long line of those movies I should stop after the first five minutes.
The first thing I always tell myself before I watch a low-budget Sci-Fi film is: "be prepared: it's bound to be bad to at least some noticeable degree."
The very cute, but amazingly stupid, woman in the torn stewardess uniform is the first one to break through the trees and spot the nearby plane.
The first movie I saw was, "Beast of Bray Road" and I really enjoyed that.
"Bad Day at Black Rock" director John Sturges' first period horse opera, "Escape from Fort Bravo," takes place during American Civil War at a remote cavalry stockade doubling as a Confederate prisoner-of-war camp.
Indeed, this was the first time that Sturges and Surtees paired up.
When we first see his Capt.
Skillfully directed by John Sturges this was his first great success with the western genre.
The first Cinemascope movie "The Robe" was released by Fox at the same time.
There are more memorable gags in this one film than in any other film he made- or perhaps anyone has made since, and it deservedly won him his first Academy Award at the first ceremony in 1929.
PPS--only a few weeks after I first wrote this review, I have seen about 8 more Chaplin movies.
I have recently spent many an hour watching the feature length films of Charlie Chaplin and have grown to appreciate just what a fantastic film maker he truly was.having now watched 'The Circus' for the first time in it's entirety,I believe that it should be ranked amongst his very finest works.
Here he plays his famous tramp character, who is first involved in a hilarious chase sequence with the cops throughout the circus.
I first attempted to watch the film mid-way through last year, but, being terribly ill at the time, and having to wake up relatively early the following morning, I barely got half-way through the Tramp's antics before I had to turn off the DVD and go to sleep.
We first find the Tramp {whom Chaplin liked to call the "little fellow"} at a carnival, completely devoid of money, where a devious pickpocket (Steve Murphy) has stashed his winnings into the Tramp's trouser pocket.
When they first meet, the Tramp scolds the hungered girl for stealing his meagre breakfast, but quickly takes pity on her, and eventually falls in love.
The first thing the struck my is how much better looking the film is, and the second thing that struck me is that, other than the length and thickness of the plot and story, it is remarkably similar to his earlier films.
The Circus  *Spoilers*  This is my first silent film I've ever seen.
Was the ending a result of the problems that Chaplin had in making the film, or a product of his personal problems, or the inevitable ending prefigured from the tramp's first falling in love?
Chaplin was the first of his kind and the greatest comic of cinema.
Some of the direction and camera work mostly during the first half was rather impressive and the performances of Hopkins, who unlike may I never really find to amazing, was very very good.
(though that could be on the director)  The first half of the film was very interesting and moved at a steady pace, and the way Hopkins character played the system was impressive but the last half hour or so dragged IMO and took to long to get to the twist.
What the ADA, Willy Beachum, does not realize is that one of the first responders to the apparent hostage taking and shooting at the Crawford home was detective Robert Nunnally, whose affair with the shooting victim is what drove Crawford to commit the crime in the first place.
Either he's infallible, then he would have wiped his fingerprints off the bullets in Nunally's gun and he would have let his wife live... OR he's not and his whole plan wouldn't have gone as far as it did in the first place.
The first 80 minutes are a wonderful film.
I thought Grindhouse was a hoot but not worth another attendance, being a concatenation of two lousy movies in an amusing fashion, but I'd rather sit through three hours of that movie a second time than watch this one for the first.
In other words, this whole film is complete fantasy and would never happen from the first plot hole to the last.
The first is Ryan Gosling who plays a hot shot Assistant District Attorney on the verge of joining a very lucrative private law firm.
He's only got one case left to handle and, although it looks like a slam dunk on paper, he'll soon find it to be a bit more formidable than he first thought.
The film quite explicitly shows the crime of the film and how it is carried out in the first ten minutes of the movie.
What a year for him- nominated for his first Academy Award for his powerful role in Half Nelson (which was excellent- go see that too) and now puts on another pitch perfect performance in Fracture.
While it might not be possible in real life, it worked magic on the big screen and transformed into an excellent film almost within the first few minutes.
I know that many viewers were very insightful and figured out the twists and the ending within first half of hour or so but I did not and I was impressed by the way the disappearance of the crucial evidence had been handled - very clever.
It was also nice to see him in his final film go full-circle playing a modern equivalent to his break-through role as a bounty hunter in "Wanted:Dead or Alive", which was where I first became a fan of McQueen's.
I love the first Jaws-film.
His first case was bringing in LeVar Burton who was between the two roles that made his career, in Roots as Kunte Kinte and in Star Trek the Next Generation as Geordi LaForge.
This anime has the fault of having a rather... shocking first scene, and this would discourage sensitive people from watching it.
Four generations of special-effects technology have already passed since J3 was made (maybe more... it was first released in theaters almost twenty-years ago), and the viewer simply can't get over its bad chroma-key mini-sub, cheesy 3-D props, et al.
The first time we meet her, she is cold-bloodedly killing soldiers and office workers in what appears to be a strange research facility.
At first the show was 'so bad it's good'.
Psychological problems, tragedy, love, betrayal, and human emotional response to all the above flow from the storyline, making Elfen Lied much more than a first look at the plot may suggest.
At first I wanted to organize a marathon, but in the end, I am glad I chose to see it in 3 separate days, it helps the information sink in.
I didn't know what to expect from Elfen Lied, just by chance I came across the first episode, countless hours later I had watched the entire 13 episodes and the OVA and knew I had just seen something special.
Needless to say without going into too many details there is a lot more to this girl Lucy than first appears as her split personality Nyu is found by a young man and his cousin who take her in.
The first ten minutes of this beautifully portrayed anime is a clear warning message for those with weak stomachs to find their entertainment somewhere else.
However, after the first episode, I found myself captivated to go on.
My sister at age thirteen (I'm fourteen) was absolutely terrified after watching the first episode.
Not just the anger and the suffer, what Lucy/Nyuu has feeld when she was just a child and then from that moment maybe always, but as she has start to live as Nyuu after the accident at the middle of the first episode, she has became close to a real character.
The story seems to be a little bit simple for the first look, but when you get further and further into it, you will find out, that you are really caught, and this great piece of art won't release you, until you watch it all.
It garbs you and pulls you in straight from the first episode and doesn't let go right through to the final thirteenth episode.
I don't care if you arn't really into anime - I really wasn't when I first watched this.
There are times in the first episode that you think my opinion may be wrong, but, sit through it and you just may be more shocked by the final episode than the first.
I saw the first episode of Elfen Lied and thought it looked pretty cool, so I went and bought the rest of the series.
The first episodes aren't brilliant, but this is a series that gets better and better as it progresses, and the last two DVDs are a joy to behold.
From the first episode where, in a dreamlike atmosphere, we see a nude girl with an iron mask on her head escaping a high-security facility and in the process, magically tearing apart a bunch of armed guards, to the very last episode, blood continues to flow (and nudity continues to be shown).
Only the ending is quite usual and poor - but the second part, after the first boring 30-40 minutes, worths the time wasted.
I rented it because the presence of John Malkovich, who makes a funny cameo, and watched very perplexed the first part, really too slow and without new glances on the matter.
Despite repeated warnings from my family and IMDb users to skip this "Jaws" flick, if you even want to really call it that, but I ignored it and figured maybe it's just getting a bad rep because it would be compared to the first and ultimate classic "Jaws".
This is the first time that I see a reference to this legend, and maybe this movie might make some sense to those that are familiar with "La Llorona".
I thought that it was a really good film, and had strange creatures, but what did any normal monster movie person think when they first saw the title...?
My first brief acquaintance with "Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell" came when I watched the trailer.
So how on earth did anyone first answer the question "So, what's this film going to be about?"
You get shlocky trash, you get unknown actors, you get dumb cartoon characterizations shot on the cheap for nickels and dimes--canned and sometimes original linear productions, first act second act third act straight action with a hint of sex ( and little more than a hint ).
He was marvellously played by the charismatic Robert Lindsay, in his first television role since 'Get Some In!'.
It was all very funny, hardly surprising seeing as it was penned by the great John Sullivan ( his first series ).
Well how should I describe this movie... the very first scene of the movie itself sets the background of the movie and tells about the masterpiece we are going to witness in the next 155 minutes....... Have you heard the song "doli me Bithay Ke Kanhar..."......?
Astonishingly, this scratchy print, a remarkable historical document, is the only one in existence, and this is its first theatrical screening (it has been seen at various film festivals previously).
The first half is Apocalypse realized, complete with Biblical notation and everything.
As with the earlier film, Lessons either captures viewers or leaves them confused and bored within the first few minutes.
Jaws 3-D (1983) was not only a sequel to the first two JAWS films, but it was also one of the few movies that took advantage of the rebirth of the 3-D fad that was sweeping Hollywood during the early 80's (see Amityville 3-D and Friday the 13th 3-D).
Why make a 3-D movie in the first place if you're not going to take advantage of it when it's available for the home video market?
This was an amazing TV Show, is is a shame that i couldn't watch it when it was first televised.
Admittingly, the first two films preceeding this have it beat in many areas, but not all!
ok maybe not really but it sure felt like it the first 60 or 70 times i saw it as a kid on cable i loved this movie cause it was so freakin funny i watched it over and over and over again laughing myself hysterical every time and then when i saw it like 15 years later i laughed so hard i broke a rib laughing ok maybe not really but it sure felt like it ya know what i'm sayin
This was made in the eighty's a few years after the second one (not as good as the first, but pretty good), the first two were made in the seventy's and the sound effects and shark effects were worse in this.
The shark made in this looks like a piece of cardboard that floats through the water, they copied the original score from the first jaws film and if it wasn't for a brody descendant and the score this could've been named something else.
Just watch the first two.
I hadn't seen it since it was first released and couldn't remember it that well.
Well, I've reacquainted myself with it and, although I'm genuinely not the one to exploit yiddishisms, my first thought was "Oy!"
My son is five, and he insisted we buy the CDs for the first and second movies.
I think it's better than the first.
But first i'm going to type some words: Excellent, Awesome, Spectacular, Fabulous, Fantastic, the great shimmy-nits!
I enjoyed high school musical 2 it is even better then the first one which sometimes doesn't work and the whole thing nose dives.
I loved it who said you have to be a child/teenager to watch and enjoy, Im 42 and I already cant wait for high school musical 3, its so nice to see young people enjoying life instead of all the hate and violence in society today and they managed to get their first kiss "cheers for them" maybe some young girls will be a bit disappointed with this or wish to be Vanessa or the boys wish to be Zak, ah the young, I was smiling remember my younger days too lol.
the first time i saw it, i thought it was awesome.
It took me a while to realise but i think this movie is better then the first one.
Every scene she was in i was glued to the TV, she did such a good job as sharpay and she looked so beautiful in this movie, in the first one her hair was really thick and that what ruined her style but in this movie her hair was so pretty she just looked hot in every scene she was in.
I didn't like her in the first movie but i thought in this movie her character wasn't so childish.
It was a fabulous lead up to the first highly successful first movie.
I hope they do as good a job as they did for this one and the first one, im sure they will.
In 2006, the first film became a surprise hit, and the sequel is expected to follow along the same lines.
Let me say it right here and now: High School Musical is thousands of times better than the first film, with improvements in every category.
The plot this time around is incredibly different from the first one, and much more structured.
Every song has its own sound and feel that is much more unique than the first one.
It is better than the first film in every way imaginable with better humor and comedic moments, better writing, and much better songs.
I will admit that it wasn't as pulling as the first movie was, but I think the plot was very creative and funny.
People said that the first movie was a "Cheesy remake of Grease," And I disagreed with that.
I enjoyed the first HSM even though I thought I wouldn't since my kids are in college and the Disney Channel is something I rarely watch.
I think this second one is better than the first, and Troy's penguin slide at the beginning made me laugh a little.
There were about 10 songs (including remixes) versus the 9 in the first movie, but the way they were presented made them feel a little smooshed together.
For example, there are 3 full-length songs within the first twenty minutes.
That's when I realized, that many of the songs were not as memorable as they had been in the first movie.
wasn't enjoyed by me any more the second time around than it was the first.
What I liked about the first movie is that everything was fresh.
Though even Sharpay showed some unexpected goodness in the movie, Chad was more-or-less the same self-righteous jerk that he was in the first movie.
The "dumb slave" persona that he had in the first movie was really amusing, but it was also good to see him coming into his own in High School Musical 2 as a more developed and rounded character.
The similarities between it and the first movie aren't really too hard to miss, but I found myself liking them rather than feeling like I was seeing the same film all over again.
In some ways, High School Musical 2 doesn't have the magic of the first.
I understand that a lot of people feel that this wasn't as good as the first movie, but personally I think it's as good, if not better than the first one.
As with the first movie, the singing and dancing are flawless and perfect.
Sure, the first one was good, but it was just simple and dry.
If it were like the first one, of course Troy would have never given into Sharpay's world.
In the first one, you see the relationship between Troy and Gabriella begin.
The movie is more like a musical because in the first film, the majority of the songs were songs that were to be performed.
Following hot on the tails of the monumental success of the first TV film, Highschool Musical 2 manages to out do itself in the newest sequel of the soon to be long franchise of films to come.
That's why it all went wrong with HSM 2, Disney tried so hard not to make it the exact same things as the first movie, that they made it in too something worse.
Don't get me wrong though, it was a good thing that they didn't make it in to the same thing, but the songs were bad and it just doesn't seem to live up to the first movie.
I was a big fan of the first High School Musical.
I know many didn't like the music in this installment at all, but I personally found it better than the first.
Any character development at all (which lets face it, wasn't a lot) that was made in the first movie was completely undermined.
This film was bad - nowhere near as good as the first.
The first opening sequence was good, the song, the dance everything was good until they took it out of the high school and that was when it all went downhill.
The songs weren't as good as the first - instead of fun showtunes they became sloppy balads which were just plain awful.
The only thing in this film that was better than the first was the choreography, it was brilliant.
I found the entire first half of the film unfocused, boring and centered nearly entirely on Ashley Tisdale.
While I didn't like they way they tried to transform Troy into a first class jerk, I did enjoy watching Zac show us a much deeper range of acting skill.
The choreography was promised to be stepped up a lot, but there really wasn't much in the film beyond the first ten minutes and last five minutes.
Of course it sounded like he did in the first movie, (only because they morphed his voice with Andrew Seeley, a very accomplished singer), but then the producer let Zac sing on his own and all the songs were low key because Zac can't hit any good notes.
the story is similar as in the first movie just the other way round.
and the music is even better then in the first movie.
this movie is different then the first one but it has all what made its predecessor so memorable.
Secondly, isn't it wonderfully convenient that they all managed to get pretty good jobs with no previous work experience and that they all managed to secure employment on their first attempt, at the same place, at the same time.
I saw the first High School Musical just after it came out hearing rave reviews and i thought it might be at least interesting.
This of course leads to "What Time Is It," the first musical number of many.
Oh, and this all happens within the first five minutes, ensuring a FUN following 93 minutes.
Troy needs money to help pay for college (though wasn't his family rich in the first movie?
The head of Disney (or the person in charge of this film) reads the first ten pages and throws it down in disgust.
I'm just saying the overall music is better than that of the first one.
Of course the first film was made as a crappy made for television movie.
Okay, so the day the first High School Musical came out I watched a documentary on PBS instead, so I had no idea what horrors were going on at Disney Channel until the next day at school.
Even worse than the first.
Why the first movie's soundtrack was the top-selling CD of last year.
The straight-up theater pop of the first has been replaced with more of a Hip-Hop/ Arena Pop edge.
Disney Channel could have simply done a rehash of the first film, but everyone involved truly did a great job.
But that's part of the fantasy of the first film: making the audition, giving it your all, and gaining the applause and support of your peers.
Still, if this second movie doesn't match up to the first, it's because of moving it away from the dream of Triple Talent Status.
The story never loses focus, is wildly romantic and is the first political film that is so gorgeous to look at--it's painted in lush, primary colors that made my jaw drop open with delight.
I had no interest in seeing Bulworth when it was first released, and only gave it a chance on video since virtually every review I'd read recommended it.
At first it's not well received but then apparently folks decide that they like it, too bad he's put a hit out on himself to end it all though and the guy that arranged all that has a heart attack before he can call off the hit.
The first shock value sequence is truly outrageous, and the films unabashed sense of eagerness only gets more perverse; the film is rated R for appropriate reasons, mostly coming from Bulworth's style of life he becomes involved with.
Since he knows he is going to die soon, he decides to be honest with the public for the very first time in his political career.
A treat for a first time viewer.
Unfortunately, Bickford has had an apparent bad day at the plant and comes home in an angry mood and they have a big fight (apparently their first) and Bickford storms out to get good and drunk.
Repentful the next day, he listens again to Irene's idea and becomes enthusiastic when he sees Eric's formula first hand and they start a business that brings them all fortune within a few years.
The audience does understand why the tycoon married her in the first place.
Well, at least they looked for Lucille Ball at the sound stage where she worked on the first Lucy show in the 50's.
The film signals Brosnan's first post-Bond adventure and it feels very much like Brosnan's Bond himself has retired from British Intelligence, found himself a partner and gone off to a paradise to live out his days.
The first thing is that while the film glamorises theft and stealing, it maintains that air that everything done in this film is 'sexy'.
Only the first 10 minutes and the last twenty minutes were interesting.
I remember when I was a kid saw my first horror movies in the late 70s, this one scared me to death.
jokes that play like the first draft of a "Will and Grace" episode.
After the competent yet totally un-necessary Red Dragon, Ratner's moved on to After the Sunset, which at first glance looks like a high-tech crime caper, but grows into a fairly adult, mature character study, not unlike Tarantino's Jackie Brown.
Max (Pierce Brosnan) knows he can easily clip Napoleon III and make Lloyd look like a jerk againÂ For him, it's more about the challenge and the alibiÂthat's his work of artÂ But he affirms that the two are a couple of retirees trying to enjoy the island lifeÂ   The gorgeous Lola (Salma Hayek) knows that, with Max, they went out at the top of their game, undefeatedÂ They were great togetherÂ But, now, she feels it is the best time to quitÂ For her, now, the challenge is to find joy in simple things, as a life filled with sunsetsÂ   Lloyd was chasing Max for seven yearsÂever since the first Napoleon Diamond went missingÂ That day, he got to the scene, and took a few shots at the getaway carÂ Next day, a bottle of champagne arrives at FBI Headquarters with a note saying, "Aim for the tires next time."
The Cons  Gets boring after the first half and the premise doesn't add up to much.
"Children of the Revolution" gives one a sense of the sometimes tense situation down under in the '50s, which prompts Joan to go to the Soviet Union in the first place.
The first half was promising, providing decent political satire in the form of black humor.
You'll be hooked after the first two minutes of this very original film.
Lana's testimony at Cheryl's trial was seen as a direct parallel to her performance as Constance in the courtroom scene in the movie, and in later years, Crane revealed that her mother's husband prior to her involvement with Stompanato, Lex Barker, was molesting her, another coincidence that did not go unnoticed by Crane when she first saw the movie.
When you consider the definition of soap opera-- "A drama characterized by stock characters and situations, sentimentality, and melodrama"Âplenty of admirable movies come to mind, including Oscar winners from the very first, "Seventh Heaven," through "Rebecca," "The Greatest Show on Earth," and "Kramer versus Kramer" to recent movies like "Chicago" and "Crash."
Certainly, this was not the first movie to present the risquÃ© themes herein; but, due to interesting characters and memorable performances, in a top-notch production, it deserves credit.
"Peyton Place" hooks me from the first scene to the end.
His is the first character to challenge the town's usual way of thinking.
I saw "Peyton Place" for the first time in my late forties as part of a CineClub presentation.
The acting is first rate, especially by DIANE VARSI; HOPE LANGE and LANA TURNER in the lead female roles.
I wonder how I'd react if I saw if for the first time now?
hell the planes aren't any good either, which was the best part of the first two.
The first one was pretty good in a cheesy, '80s way; the second was more or less forgettable (tell the truth, I can't remember one character from it)... but "Aces" - It has everything an action fan could want.
The first set of scenes seems to set the tenor of the movie and is a grand hint that what follows has the potential of being awful.
Cheesy sets, lousy dialogue, poor editing - all worthy of a ninth grade film buff student in his first big homework assignment.
Probably not as heartwarming and memorable as the first film ("Mickey's Once Upon A Christmas"), this one is also fun, entertaining and amusing (perhaps even more amusing than the last one)!
This is computer animated and also unlike the first film, has more stories.
The first story is about Daisy and Minnie dancing on ice and both becoming cross with each other.
I won't comment the technical side of this poorest production but the result is an awful experience that I could not even bring to an end, watching only the first 20 minutes.
I was looking forward to seeing it, especially since this is the first time the "Fab Five" have been computer animated for a movie.
The first half of hour it's great and it's unbelieveble.
Gangs of New York is a revenge tale set around 1863:  The first scene we witness is two gangs meeting in the street to determine who will be in charge of the Five Points.
I think Scorcese has watched other directors use color schemes to make the movie visually stunning, because this is the first movie he has made that has coloring that stands out.
After the first hour of the film, I found myself not connecting with the characters, hence became extremely boring.
Even the special effects in the first movie, filmed 4 years earlier, were better than these ones.
In the first 2 minutes of the fight, there is absolutely no blood on the ground, on the clothes, faces or weapons of the fighters although all of them are wielding knives, axes, swords and so on.
Liam Neeson, who croaks before the end of the first reel, is one lucky bastard.
After the first 20 minutes, of course, anyone not watching the movie in Braille understands perfectly what the one and only dramatic issue is going to be (REVENGE!!)
This was playing at the theater the same time as "The Two Towers"... unfortunately, most of the people in the long line-up went to see "TTT"... they sure missed out, since GONY has more to say in the first 10 minutes than LOTR has to say over 3 hours.
Second reason lead us not only everyday fascism but also (and because of first one) state fascism.
I was in Turkey when the movie was first released however I haven't heard of it until I saw in on DVD, since it possibly was not well advertised due to financial issues but the cast and the plot is really spectacular, and well directed.
He is reluctant to accept this responsibility at first, but a Japanese chick kicks some sense into him and then goes on to teach him how to use his new found skills properly.>
I know sequels are rarely as good as or better than the the first film and often much worse but I really hope I get to see this sequel.
I'd mention them, but I figure anyone who watches a Troma film looking for a profound statement about society shouldn't be watching a Troma film in the first place.
I first watched this film years (2000?)
We get the first instance of the legendary car crash scene and some good fights.
You really ought to see "Toxic Avenger" first, but if you like that one, this is a great follow-up.
in summation, this movie is best summed up in the vernacular of a first grader as follows: crap crappity crap crap CRAP.
That said I did not like the film when I first saw it.
As for the classy Hopkins to be in this picture....well, all I can say is look at his resume: this wasn't the first time he wasn't very discerning about roles to play.
It's not the first time I'm so deeply amazed by the way a film is perceived by others, but gee...
Genre fans will also note that, during the first big set piece, the crew are startled by an unexpected alarm and deviate from their mission to investigate a derelict spacecraft - events which end with a nuclear detonation in space.
Great work of great trio - Marcello Pineyro, Leonardo Sbaraglia and last but not least ( btw first of mine) Eduardo Noriega, who remembering me in some sensitive and hot acting nature of River Phoenix.
It tells a story about two couples , who due to longterm relationships decide to try something new.They go to this therapy, where couples change their partners- polygamia or something.In the first couple the women is sorry for the term but whore in my words.
Fot the man in the second couple and the woman in the first it means nothing, cuz they were closer like characters.
The first couple breaks off after and second one seems to remain together but he film is with open final.
It was the first starring role for Lon McCallister, a young man who made 42 films but only nine after this one, retiring from the screen at 30.
At first he doesn't want to be there but then he makes some friends and eventually gets involved in some kind of chariot horse racing.
I am old enough to have seen this movie first run.
Indeed, the first film naturally had all the classics to choose from, and so director Jack Haley Jr. was able to throw all the very best bits into his film.
Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire, performing together for the first (and only) time since 'Ziegfeld Follies (1946),' light up the screen with their lighthearted theatrics, proving Â at ages 64 and 77, respectively Â that time has done little to dim their talent for entertainment.
This movie corrected two oversights from the first movie: we get to see Cyd Charisse's Singin' In The Rain dance (in the green dress) and Kelly's dance on roller skates from It's Always Fair Weather.
Bobby Van's bunny hop dance was odd and at first I didn't like it.
Second, THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT PART II is an afterthought of a sequel Â they already used their best clips in the first film, so we get the leftovers here.
I really enjoyed That's Entertainment II just as much as the first one.
Ann Miller, Fred and Ginger, Gene Kelly, Bobby Van, Lena Horne, Bob Fosse, Debbie Reynolds, Mickey and Judy, Cyd Charisse and many more are all featured, picking up where the first movie left off, and for lovers of Frank Sinatra, there is a special segment of the movie purely reserved to spotlight his talent, narrated by his long-time friend, Gene Kelly.
It is even more enjoyable than the first, as Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly even entertain us with numerous dance numbers during the films intervals - the last time they were to dance together on screen.
Worth catching but try to see the first one too.
Not a single clip is repeated from the first film in the trilogy, and watching this film really makes you realise just how much talent was all focused in the one studio from the 30s through to the 50s.
There was nothing special about the first film--its only gimmick was the coup it had managed in bringing all these glorious film legends back together to talk about their work.
It makes you want to go out and rent all the others... and still watch it over again just to revel in Astaire and Kelly being onscreen together for the first time since 'The Babbitt and The Bromide' in ZIEGFELD FOLLIES almost three decades ago.
Not quite as good as 'Best In Show' but much better than 'A Mighty Wind' this film is the first he's done that is a straight story instead of a documentary style although he has cleverly woven elements of that in to this film through the actors doing interviews for various television shows and specials.
Rather than viewing For Your Consideration, watch any other of his wonderful movies for the first or hundredth time and spend an enjoyable evening.
For this viewer this mocumentary about a very bad film company churning out a very bad film with a rather pitiful cast of actors falling victim to Internet rumors that an Oscar is in the air works as a funny idea and social comment for about the first half four and then sadly falls apart painfully as it proceeds to its wholly predictable end.
It was the first time I was glad that Christopher Guest's films were so short.
Making his first appearance in a Guest film, Ricky Gervais grabs perhaps the biggest laugh of all with a line that I won't spoil here.
We feel at first as if he may be slow, and perhaps to some extent he is, but in a way that is lost in emotionally charged internalized delusions, a return to the primordial dilemma.
So is his wrecking the Bel-Goodies engagement party, first by his mad ping pong match, and then by his insistence of telling the story of how his life was saved once by an intelligent rattlesnake (not realizing that Mrs. Bel-Goody hates even the mention of snakes).
Burnt Money is a movie that society should be interested in, because it shows how first impressions are almost always incorrect.
As soon as the bus stopped, I made a beeline for the first dvd shop and bought my own copy.
We follow a downtrodden banker as he invests his self esteem in the sport, and first see it treated in a very realistic, everyday way, without dramatic music or camera angles and are allowed to see the inherent ridiculousness of it.
Perhaps first time director Russell DeGrazier will turn into something one day, but it's not going to be on the basis of this movie.
In fact the first two thirds of the film were harsh in a way that could only alienate both heterosexuals and homosexuals.
I heard Tom Six is planning a sequel (this time with lesbians), but after seeing his first, getting the feeling of crawling back into the closet, I hope he reconsiders before he damages gay acceptation even more.
I really loved the sets and the costumes as well, and I believe this is the first time I've taken a line to mention this in a review.
At first.
While for the first 90 minutes it's a film that equates boredom with realism, walking with paranoia and monosyllabic scripting with profundity, for the last couple of reels we get a half-hearted car chase, an impressive car crash (that leads to a moment of utter absurdity as a third viewing of the scene suddenly reveals a previously invisible survivor running across a motorway in plain sight), silly disguises, unarmed combat with a lesbian CIA hitwoman and the obligatory symbolic falling off a building dream scene as it ticks off the genre staples to throw in enough action to put together a decent trailer (certainly a parachute jump and the opening CGi cosmic zoom from the dark side of the Moon to close-up on a ferry with an unfortunately ridiculous sense of scale seem designed more for marketing than narrative purposes).
But mainly because of the excellent cast, with exception of the clichÃ© looking villains who kill a French agent in the strong first minutes of the movie: they look like the stereotype gang members of Pablo Escobar.
It's not often that you come across a film in which, for the first eleven minutes, the only words spoken are: 'On the left!'
Many of the jokes are quite subtle and it's easy for them to slip past you the first time.
There are also the ticker-tape messages scrolling across the bottom of the screen which you tend not to read the first time you watch an episode.
I think there's certainly scope for more, although the stories would probably be more surreal in order to avoid going over too much of the same material from the first series.
Nobody's pretending that they're the first people to have ploughed this particular comic furrow (and actually, neither was Chris Morris: he was very much following in the footsteps of arch prankster Victor Lewis-Smith).
I'm sure the writers of "Broken News" would be the first to acknowledge the debt they owe to such pioneers.
The only thing potentially bad about this production is the spelling of the Costume Designer's first name, Jenifur Jarvis.  
Because the pivotal relationship was eliminated by Wingers exit in the first film, this sequel has no focus.
Where are the original actors there's no jeff Daniels, no Danny DE Vito, the character of patsy was slim and pretty and smart and sophisticated in the first film but now shes replaced by some heavier actress who just acts dumb all the way through.
In the first he seemed to be there a lot but, how can he just never see them again after his wife dies how does that happen.
Returning to her Oscar-winning role as feisty Texan Aurora Greenway, MacLaine can't possibly be expected to have the same chemistry with a new troupe of actors as she had in the first film (we "grew up" with those characters in the course of the picture, and here everyone is dropped on us unceremoniously, with little intros of who's-who).
If he acted the way he acted in the first film, he'd have been Bruno's special friend in the pokey, not to mention deserving the death penalty for being such a....such a....AAAHH I can't even find the right adjective.
An amusing fairy tale was turned into a soap opera by an individual in his/her first week of literacy classes in hopes of obtaining a GED.
Much of the appeal and resonance of the first film was how these characters dealt with life's unpredictable course and how James L. Brooks captured their idiosyncrasies with a refreshing level of honesty for a mainstream film.
Without Emma, Melanie picks up the slack and so do two minor characters from the first film - Emma's best friend Patsy, who has become a wealthy divorcÃ©e constantly competing with Aurora, and Aurora's salt-of-the-earth maid Rosie.
Everything about this movie seems contrived and hopelessly devoid of the real emotion of the first.
I recommend to see this movie before the first ( "Terms of Endearment, if you haven't seen it jet),because it isn't much related to the first.
Naturally, the plot and the whole story starts where the first movie ended, but the atmosphere, the action and the characters are very different.
And when Melanie keeps going back and forth between her relationship, she finally finds peace with Aurora, who she at first despised.
You don't have to have seen the first one to understand it.
True, Debra Winger is missing (but if you saw the first film you'd know why), but I am rating this solely on how well it entertained me.
Shirley Maclaine reprises her role as Aurora and in my view is just as good and sometimes better in this performance then she was in the first movie.
This is 13 years after the first and the storyline is pretty much that amount of time later, maybe a little more because Melanie is pretty much grown up as well.
Now when this movie first came out, no one really saw it.
See this one only if you see Terms of Endearment first.
Although the acting may not be first rate the story line isn't too far from the City of Opar book.
Angel, the Spaniard, wants to go to New York and Nene, his lover, wants to comply, but first they must attend to the assault of a vehicle that brings money to one bank.
College students, Jenny(Kathrine Baumann)and Robert(Peter Hooten)decide to drive up to a certain mountainous spot where their school chum, Michael(Robert Englund, in one his first movie roles), went to live in nature away from the civilized world.
The first forty-five minutes consists of the two traveling north and hiking through the woods.
It's not a horror movie and there are only two brief scenes that could conceivably land it in the genre; the first is a somewhat botched gang rape around a campfire and the other is the "revenge" scene with two guys fighting with hatchets and knives that is cut short before any blood could be spilled when one of the characters decides to do the "sensible" thing...
There's really only one good reason to see this film and it really only applies to heterosexual males with big breast fetishes, and that reason is '70s uber-hottie Kathrine Baumann, who appears here in her only nude scenes (to date), first skinny-dipping with future TV Dr.
What follows next looks like a cigarette ad from Playboy Magazine circa 1973 come to life, with Hooten and Baumann wandering through the woods, climbing a steep gravel slope, encountering a bear, getting into a blueberry fight and generally bringing the film to a grinding halt (and it was only in first gear to begin with).
For the first time ever, I really can't determine the "raison d'Ãªtre" of a film.
This is also the first episode to strongly suggest Cartman's sexual orientation.
If Scorsese really meant that "The Departed" was his first movie with a plot, then it paid off.
I haven't seen it for years but I remember it being funny and smart, and the first show that had divorced women just getting on with things.
'Playing for Time' starring Vanessa Redgrave first aired in 1980 and is based on a true story.
Another reason I liked the movie was that it was the first film even to mention my personal heroine, Mala Zimetbaum, about whom I have written.
At first I was disappointed.
I watched this 30-minute documentary of one of many battles in Italy shortly after having viewed "All Quiet on the Western Front" for the first time.
Some footage of "The Complete Map of the Universe" has been taken from the first two seasons of the TV show: "Est" and some footage from the other two feature films.
I first heard of the word "Est" in a David Bowie song about his brother, "All the Mad men" from "The Man who sold the World" album.
I saw an interview with the director Nick Peterson/Virtual Alien where he said that the only reason he didn't sue the makers of Big Brother was that George Orwell should first have the copyright on the TV show.
The first scene of the movie contained a helicopter, the second one contained Jennifer Hill in a wet t-shirt, and the fourth scene contained Jennifer putting it all out.
I don't recall his name, but he commented that at first you may think the actor playing Dr. Goddard is a bit awkward, but when you realize the horrible lines and situations, and direction he had to deal with, you will also realize he must have the spirit of Brando in him to pull it off half as well as he did!
But nothing happens in this movie for about the first hour, and then there's about twenty minutes of 'horror.'
The worst scenes of the movie are when the granulated sugar avalanche consumes all these little train villages, and the wet t-shirt contest that takes up the first twenty minutes of the movie.
One of the first indications of this movies lack of quality is the obvious use of TOY CARS for the avalanche scene!
The Ice Queen at first shows up as a naked woman, in excellent condition, despite been bury under ice for thousands of years.
Okay, so first things first, the prosthetic make-up provided by Optic Nerve was great (except for the scene where the costume had big gaping holes in the leg, and the skin underneath wasn't blue like the rest of the character).
I first saw this movie 2 weeks ago(today is 25/05/07), and now I've seen it ten times, and own a copy.
From that first fight to the very end, this movie is everything - EVERYTHING - an old-school "Kung-Fu Movie" should be.
This was the first Kungfu movie I ever purchased, as I was drawn to the cover and storyline.
When I first watched it, I was in awe.
Here, worst of all, is the god-awful wrung out slow motion machine gun death of a perfect top-of-his-West-Point-class son, trying to reach Mom who, incidentally, probably drew the enemy fire in the first place with her belted out songs and thudding around the stage.
FOR THE BOYS might just be a "Better Midler" film today, in a period of another middle east war and albeit a more tragic and unpopular one with a far more critical and on going media focus than the first 1991 war.....This exceptionally well made musical drama, made for about $70 million in 1991 and really a protest musical parable, did not reach the intended at the time and the first Iraq war was over before this film had a chance to make an impact.
It's a good film, serious and with excellent music and comedy in the first hour especially.
When the two meet on a World War II USO tour, it's loathing at first sight--but their audiences adore the combination.
During the first UFO tour he arranges Dixie to see her husband again after nearly two years.
The three principals give first rate performances, Middler best in the scene when her son dies, and Caan earlier, when he witnesses the death of a boy soldier in Korea (his first witnessing of such a tragedy in a war).
But the first 45 minutes reminds you how great Midler can be in the right vehicle.
This is my second favorite Bette Midler movie, the first of course being Isn't She Great.
Today I look around and see all these people making their own movies with video cameras and putting them up on websites like youtube and I have to look back at A Polish Vampire in Burbank and realize that this was one of the first 'do it yourself' movies.
He lines up a victim Delores Lane (Lori Sutton) on his first night out but falls in love with her and respects her too much to bite her.
The clever writing and the funny dialogue when the story associates Dupah's first bite which losing ones virginity, like when he is scared to bite someone and says what if my fangs are too small.
It's the story of Dupah, the reluctant vampire as he goes out for his first kill, presented by actors with good timing.
I saw "Distant Drums" for the first time when I was 10 or 11 years old and I recall it was a great film for me.
They put it on On Demand one summer (only the first eight episodes or so) and I'd spend whole afternoons watching them one after the other... but the worst part?
I remember when this show first game on back in 1998 with the Burgerking toys that they had for that month with the Kids Meal back then.
This show premiered on a Sunday night and the first episode was where they let Debbie drive and she put her bubble gum(Debbie was always chewing bubble gum anyone remember that episode where she let one get huge and then it popped on her face and got somewhat in her hair?
I first saw the show in 2001 and even back then, as a kid, I disliked it.
The first time Emily sees Jason is at his grandfather's funeral.
It is somethings that every person should think about, and re-prioritize some things in life that should be first, rather than money, etc... Just a great movie, was very moved by it...
I know it will touch the heart of all who watch it and give hope to everyone out their that a persons heart can really change when love, which is given to us by God because He first loved us, is practiced and felt in our lives.
When a possible 'future' bequest is mentioned Jason's curiosity takes hold long enough to take first class seat (at least he thought it was first class) to Texas to pick up the secret $$$$$$ bequest.
Not only is there no money but he is offered a chance to work for the first time in his life without an inkling of any reward he would actually receive for the work.
First, Jason fails to turn right around and head home as we would expect him to do and then he learns the nature of Grand Daddy's first of many 'gifts.'
The first gift, the gift of work, will set the tone.
After all, Jason's spent countless thousands on her, this is his first ever credit card glitch and she has no real reason to believe he is detached from his great wealth.
I first got this film out of the video store last year because i wanted to see what Drew Fuller was like outside of his role in Charmed.
I saw the first Sunday showing of "The Ultimate Gift" at my local AMC here in Northern Virginia and I enjoyed it immensely.
Perhaps they were trying to "kill" the movie in its first week due to low sales by purposely keeping it off the marquee.
My first thoughts that came to mine after I saw The Ultimate Gift; were great movie.
The first words from my wife were - "one of the best movie we've seen".This was an amazing, life changing movie with values.
It is admirable how these 5 first episodes just build onto each other, essentially telling one long story.
I expected this movie to be something akin to "Charlie's Angels" the first one.
It is an important episode historically as we are introduced to the character of Christian Shephard (unless you count the brief setup in Walkabout), in his first of a long line of seemingly more and more important appearances on the show.
We also have our first science/faith talk between Jack and Locke, although it's less of an argument, and more of Jack doubting Locke's explanation of what's happening to him.
Appropriately enough, island junkie Locke is the first to note the bizarreness of where they are, taking Charlie's "Where are we?"
John Terry nails Christian Shephard's first scene of dialogue in flashbacks, creating a character we just want to see more of instantly, and it turns out we don't have to wait too long.
Terry O'Quinn's first of many mythical monologues is well-delivered and memorable.
I'll take a group in at first light.
But the first half-hour is near hilarious with the usual Skelton mugging and pratfalls, backed up by experts Rags Ragland and Ann Rutherford, along with clever quips galore, so stay tuned.
Skelton disguised himself as the Beavers pitcher and took his place on the mound against these guys and retired the side after hitting the first three batters.
This was my first look at early Red Skelton films (I had only known him through his TV show) and it reminded of some Bob Hope films except this one had more slapstick and action.
From the first to the last generation all we see is a bunch of foolish people doing foolish things!
The guy from the first generation is a sexual maniac soldier that even does a sexual act with a dead pig imagining he's doing it with a fat old ladyÂ The guy of the second generation is a fat (but a really big one!)
We can feel the irony since the first to the last minute of the movie, and its dark humour mixed with some gore scenes makes it a really dark comedy!
By mid-way through the first vomiting scene, these lovely cultured people were excusing themselves from their seats, never to return.
The plot was a little confusing at first but I finally caught on.
Well well after the 2 first Ringu's that i enjoyed soooo much because of the scary screenplays, Ringu 0 brings us a very different prequel with this on, if you expect seeing as much scary scenes as in Ringu 1 and 2, then i hope you will read this first so at least you know that it won't, it is explains about all what you needed to know, with a end you already know but hehe it is a prequel so what else could it have been.
Having seen his first feature Hukkle previously, it is clear that PÃ¡lfi pays great attention to detail, and perhaps places the greatest importance on sound design.
For those who have no clue what the film is about; Taxidermia is the second full length film by Hungarian film-director GyÃ¶rgy PÃ¡lfi (I have not seen his first film Hukkle) and is based on the short stories by Lajos Parti Nagy.
The first story is about MorosgovÃ¡nyi; a horny soldier who works and lives at the farm of his lieutenant.
Watching it caused me to seek out Hukkle (the first feature) and that proves easily that Taxidermia is certainly no fluke, Hungary is surely producing a major talent here.
The first part/story is about a soldier/peasant/whoever who gets erections looking at just about anything.
At first it isn't entirely clear whether he is actually having (gasp!)
It is not at all self-indulgent, although it might seem that at first glance.
The first is a sexually frustrated soldier in the second world war, who dreams sexually of his comrade's wife and kids.
As I was one of the first to leave the theatre, I took it upon myself to stand out the front and watch the expressions on the faces of other patrons as they exited.
GyÃ¶rgy PÃ¡lfi's second feature length movie is Taxidermia, which is about three generation of a family, and all of them has something very peculiar about them: the first one is a horny officer, his son is a very big sport-eater, and his job is very important of him.
So I sat down this afternoon and watched the first one on the tape, FLOOD!
The first 45 minutes of the movie are just too tedious.
And what's even worse: Roddy Mcdowall's character gets introduced during the first scenes (apparantly he's a wealthy tourist on a fishing holiday), and after that, he never re-appears in the movie!
The fight scene was brilliantly staged and despite the fact that this was the first full scale action movie for the 3 lead actress, the girls were impressive.
At first I thought "What the hell is that?"
I was thinking of "A Chorus Line"'s refrain of "Everything was beautiful at the ballet" of girls escaping dysfunctional families even before these hyper-articulate entertainers point out that there are no ballet classes available to them, or any after-school activities for kids not interested in football or basketball so they made the choice to dance with organized groups, first in informal than structured competitions.
I actually had no intentions of seeing this movie when I'd first heard about it.
I may just have to start wearing my clown outfit to the office in tribute, but I guess I should work on my moves first.
When I saw the "Rize" trailers at first I was afraid that this would be yet another movie depicting the African-American experience through slanted and distorted filters ignorance and the media would have "White America" and the rest of the world believe.
"Be Cool" was mentioned to be the first discovery of the dance style.
This is simply not true, as ONE of the first showings of this dance style can be credited to Missy Elliot in her music video "I'm really Hot".
My suggestion: When this movie opens on June 24, stop everything and see it at your first opportunity.
The most recent game I got was Evil Dead Regeneration which was about a week ago.This is the newest game in the Evil Dead series of games which were based on the films.I have never seen the films.This game is not bad.Its pretty fun especially when you have the little midget sidekick named Ssam who you can kick around.He also makes funny comments.At first the game is pretty hard especially when you have hoards of zombies coming at you but after you get Sam it gets easier.This game is a horror/action game with comedy.Bruce Campbell who was ash in the movies is the voice of ash in the game and he has really funny one-liners.So does Sam Ash's half deadite sidekick.The game is about a man who must kill all the zombies.Evil Dead Regeneration is an alright game but I suggest buying it at a cheap price.
OK first things first,this game is not the greatest game ever released.It will never win awards for graphics storyline or gameplay.It's really just another devil may cry clone yet even with all these stacked against the game it's still brilliant.
Alright first off if you have seen and liked any of the movie trilogy these games are a must.
Girl Shy, written by Lloyd and the first film he produced, tells the story of a sweet-natured, stuttering bonehead who can not approach the girls.
It had me from the first title - "In Little Bend three things happen everyday - morning, noon and night".
I found the beginning of this Harold Lloyd vehicle a bit weak (the first person to watch the tape, not a silent film regular, later told me he had given up after ten minutes, and I can understand why), and compared to later films it seems very heavy on the intertitles.
The film was the first to be produced under Lloyd's newly-founded production company, The Harold Lloyd Corporation, but both Fred C. Newmeyer and Sam Taylor {who had previously collaborated to direct the legendary 'Safety Last!
The first half of 'Girl Shy' plays out like a typical silent romantic comedy, with the Harold boarding a train at his hometown of Little Bend to present his completed book to a city publisher.
I had watched this for the first time while I was in Hollywood as part of a TCM marathon of Harold Lloyd films in November 2005 (to coincide with the DVD release of New Line's 7-Disc Set).
And, at the start of this film (unfortunately just the first five minutes) there is an attempt to show hand tinting of the scene.
It is amazing to experience how there is plenty of dignified humor in scenes of match making exercises involving lonely,middle aged Spanish men from farming community and desperate Latino women.By watching this film one can have a first hand idea of why there is dearth of brides in some communities.This is something which is not related to Spain only.
The leading actors Â such as the well-known Chete Lera and the Cuban actress Marylin Torres Â are ably supported by the whole cast, as well as the real local people in the village of Cantalojas Â baptized Santa Eulalia for the film Â in the extreme north-west of the province, and where the film was given its first public showing!
Another aspect of this film that is worthy of comment is that, when the woman who left her husband first appeared, she was wearing a pair of tights with the pattern of the American flag.
But unfortunately for me, my brain could not have sustained worse damage had I repeatedly ran head first into a brick wall.
Out of the gate in the Cocoanuts, the Brothers' first film in 1929, we already have the "Why A Duck?"
Still, they shine in several scenes, most notably when Groucho first meets Grover and proceeds to insult him while simultaneously wooing Margaret Dumont with Romantic poetry.
But there's a great song and dance number when Groucho first enters the store.
Even while they were over at Paramount, where the 4 Brothers made their first 5 films; the young Studio Head planned on how to make the very best bit of madcap Marxian Cinematic Lunacy.
From 1941 to the first post World War II year of 1946, Groucho, Chico and Harpo each operated as solo performers; doing personal appearances, guesting in Radio and even making some movie guest shots.
Virginia O'Brien had me laughing on the floor the first time I heard "Rock-a-bye Baby".
I first saw this movie several years ago when I was really on a role on seeing films starring the Marx Brothers, I loved a lot of those great comedy teams, Abbott and Costello, Martin and Lewis, Laurel and Hardy, and The Three Stooges!
But, when after reading the credits in back of the case I realized it had been written by the same author of the first film (Ringu).
What I didn't expect to watch was a tragic love story of the person we had all feared in the first two film encounters (sadako).
In terms of meatiness, that's far more of a plot than I usually relay, but all of that is presented in the first 10 - 15 minutes of the film.
The scene where we first meet Groucho and Harpo in Groucho's private eye office is hilarious.
But there's a great song and dance number when Groucho first enters the store.
- yes, that's the plot :D The first half of the show is great fun (God save the Quim, Eddie?)
This is a very nice Chinesse movie about two sexy sisters who work as assassins.After an exciting hit in the first scene,they become a target for an army of criminals.In the same time,a police woman starts suspecting them.There is a plot twist in the middle, so your attention will be hold until the end.The action sequences are well-made and sometime pretty bloody.The three leading ladies are good and their relationship is interesting and original(something between rivalry, friendship and sexual attraction).A very enjoyable ride, "So close" definitely worth a view,both from the fans of traditional Assian movies or from those who like western productions.
My first impressions on seeing this series was: "Yes, Penelope Keith is still brilliant, but this series isn't really funny."
Edward G. Robinson, always superb, is fine as always; at first I can't recognize Loretta Young though, while on the other hand, Leslie Fenton doesn't initially strike me as Chinese.
Anyway, I came here today to find out what he's up to now (after running into one of his producers, Kerry Johnston, recently at a restaurant here in Hollywood on La Cienega - who said he was about to begin filming his seventh film at the end of this month in Wyoming - though I suspected she was purposely throwing me off his trail, as she looked at me like I was a stalker), and, remarkably, IMDb only has this, his first time behind the lens, listed.
); but if you by some chance come here and read this first, I'm eight years older now and have thickened my resume substantially, and am ready for my close-up!
After I watched it for the first time, I just sat there, thinking, not feeling blown away, truth be told.
Depending on your taste it is either comical or terrifying; if you go for the first you are in for some hilarious scenes.
With its great animation,mood setting music,close combat edge of the sit plot line,and thrills around every corner,this movie is not for people with weak stomaches!The first time I saw it I was hooked!It blows Dragonball Z right out of the water!If you like great plots,action ,close combat fighting,stuff exploding, then this movie is for you.
The first two minutes or so are very slow, unlike most of the themes, and a little melancholy.
The first cut scene explains why Quatre goes to retrieve the Gundams, and has a rather funny line courtesy of Duo.
Watch the series first or else you won't have a clue about what's going on in the movie.
You'll really have to watch the TV series first though, as I have to admit (like all movies of TV series I should think...), otherwise you'll be sitting there going, 'Whaaaa...?'
I love Spanish movies so I had great expectations from this one and first time directors Corbacho and Cruz did great job in my eyes.
This is my first time posting.
When Bride Wars first came out, the critic Mark Kermode was so confident that it would be on his Top 10 worst movies of 2009 that he declared he would give up movie reviewing if it wasn't (it was).
It was because of circumstances beyond my control that I was dragged in to watch Bride Wars in the first place, and while I can't avoid admitting that I was truly, truly suffering for the first 30 minutes, I would be lying if I said the film is devoid of laughs.
You see, aside from the fact that Bride Wars wants nothing more than to cater to cheap gags and sappy melodrama fit to please the Legally Blonde crowd, there also remains blatant problems in just about everything else that fills the movie's first two acts.
Let's talk about prerequisities first.
Emma and Liv are best friends who have planned every detail of their weddings since they first witnessed a wedding at the Plaza Hotel.
But since there was a time when I first saw Fulci's CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD and just dismissed it as B-movie rubbish (Hey now, don't give me that look -- what did I know back then?
Turns out I was right the first time: It's not very good.
For instance it introduces the Columbo character first into the movie before the murder has even occurred and he starts to investigate before they have even found a body.
The story is a bit predictable and you'll spot the bad guy at first glance but it's all fun.
I saw this movie when it first aired back in 1972 on ABC movie of the week and I'm trying to get a copy of it as I write this.
I think that it is even more than what I expected it to be, because it goes deeper than the first one.
I don't remember when i last laugh this much when i saw a movie (might have been when i saw the first goal movie) there are so many errors in this movie that it's impossible not to laugh at it.
I usually only go to the cinema when I think its a movie that has at least potential of being good, and this is the first time I came out of the cinema confirming I have just watched a lousy movie.
If I were director of he first one I would be very sad.
In the first movie he's got really no accent, he's an American.
At first I thought Lynn was our star, the dark assassin seeking love/redemption.
The first Goal movie brought plenty of cheers to football fans, who celebrated the coming of a decent movie about the beloved Beautiful Game.
With the first movie centered on the domestic football league following Newcastle's season, the sequel brings us to the Spanish La Liga, and firmly the spotlight of matches put on Europe's Champions League games.
And of course with hard nosed coach Rudi Van Der Merwe (Rutger Hauer) at the helm, our new recruit has to prove his worth before being handed some first team duties.
But good friend and ex-Newcastle player Gavin Harris (Alessandro Nivola) is on hand at the club (reference the first movie shall we) to provide Munez some action, especially when Harris is running afoul with Rudi for his lost form.
The football sequences here are rather straightforward, and more of the same we saw in the first movie, save for some spectacular, probably CG-ed movies like the volleys, overhead kicks and diving headers.
What I thought slowed the movie down further, was the injection of Munez's typical stepbrother brat from hell, and mother, who were conspicuously absent in the first movie, then reintroduced here just to amplify the moments that try to touch the heart (like in the first movie with the dad and grandmother), but one without which I feel would not make much of a difference.
), the result is blasphemous as the last time we went head-on with Real, it was in the first knockout round 2 seasons ago where we triumphed 1-0.
Not as polished as the first one with the novelty factor wearing off, but let's judge the series as a whole once the sequel screens.
The first Goal was a great movie that i believe every soccer fan should view.
With my first beliefs this one could not catch up I stand corrected.
All characters are well presented, and the movies plot is not lost throughout as young Munez finds his way as a real first class soccer player.
I was expecting to be grossly disappointed by this sequel, after the first offering which blew me away ((being a Newcastle fan and all)) I was pleasantly surprised however at the ease at which the story flowed between Santiago's time at Newcastle, to his blossoming career at Real Madrid.
I watched the first movie when it released in the cinemas, and although it was highly unrealistic (all the chances he miraculously gets), I thoroughly enjoyed it and thought the movie mixed the highs with the lows believably.
And trust me the third one is going to be bad the first one was not bad, the third one was bad and I truly hope the next one isn't worse than this one.
The 'star' Santiago rejoins his 'wingman' Gavin Harris from the first film in a Top Gun style opportunity to foot it with the best of the best for the #1 club, surrounded by the best players.
As a movie, it is done as good as the first one.
i have to say i loved the first film of the GOAL!
series, the sequel is also very good but not as good as the first.....
This film was really good, but not as good as the first in my opinion, can't wait for the third one to come out!
The first Goal movie was one of my favorite movies of all time.
The fact that this film is one big advert for Adidas,now even in the first film there are a lot of Adidas related stuff,but in this film they push it.
After seeing the first i didn't know when the super subs dream was going to end, but at Real Madrid with superstars surrounding him, i thought i was in for a treat.
In our first outing, we cared about Munez, we cared about those around him, we cared about Newcastle.
To give the first film it's due, it really managed to capture the footballing atmosphere perfectly, and when it slotted fictional characters into the live action, there was a degree of realism about it.
When on the pitch, our first film was filmed at a relatively human speed, yet here we have fast action shots which look absolutely insane.
The acting, the soundtrack (the first featured a rather stunning selection of Oasis tracks for some reason), the concept.
Stick to the first film.
However, last week I happened to stumble upon the first movie while it was shown on TV and I kinda liked it, giving it an IMDb rating of 8 out of 10 stars.
The ending was also as predictable as it gets, with the main character's new club, Real Madrid, winning the Champions League in a similar fashion as his previous club, Newcastle United, qualified for the Champions League in the first movie, coming back from 2-0 down to win the game 3-2 in the final few minutes.
Also, this was the first time I saw Karen Mok (outside of cameos), and she made a great impression.
Not a classic by any means, but at least, in comparison to the first one (Goal!
The game scenes were not as contrived as in the first movie, hardly surprising since some of the clips were straight off real matches.
This added more to a sense of realism, as compared to the first movie when Becker was scene doing all sorts of fantastic things -- corny to a trained eye.
I must say that it was a solid sequel to the first, which I enjoyed thoroughly.
Anyone who liked the first Goal movie should enjoy this.
All the main characters from the first Goal have roles in the sequel as well as cameos by superstars like Zidane, Ronaldo, Raul and Beckham.
SPOILERS and WARNING TO MAJOR MONSTER FANS  I read what this movie was about at the hollywood video store and it sounded like it was going to be one heck of a monster fest.I watch the first 20 minutes of it and I turned it off.I just couldn`t believe it.About a hundred F words,a gang dressed in drag and other very distgusting things.We still havn`t found out what the creature or monster was.We then played the and fast forwarded the this filthy film just to see the monster and it turns out to be a worm!
In the first five minutes alone i got a really bad feeling from it and started fast forward it.
J. Edward Bromberg and Frank Craven also stand out as they hunt down Dracula.This was the first vampire film to use Alucard as an anagram of Dracula.
When I first rented this I looked at the case and thought "Hmm looks descent", hoo boy was I wrong.
After the first five minutes, which possess a quirky, 'so-bad-it's-good' charm, the film (snicker) slides into the territory of endless 'ironic' dialog, exaggerated bloodshed, and sheer, plodding obnoxiousness.
I got off work at 5 pm, walked home (i didn't even have a car at the time), watched the first 20 minutes, ejected the DVD and walked right back to the rental store after walking all the way home, and put it in the drop box.
Bullet holes smoke like a Yosemite Sam cartoon, ricochets throw off bright blue sparks like downed power lines, during a chase scene that should never have happened in the first place everyone seems to be on roller skates (I can just HEAR the smug voice of the writer/producer saying to himself 'oooh, it's art') and idiotic little squealing tire and whoosh effects accompany actor movements from time to time that just leave you shaking your head and trying hard to stop the fingers of one of your hands from pressing the eject button.
This is the first vampire film to show a bat to vampiric man transformation and has good performances even though Lou Chaney Jr. isn't too bad as a vampire as much as he is as The Wolf Man, it's not as excellent as the first one but it's a great sequel.
I've got to admit first off that I much prefer Universal's Frankenstein series to the Dracula one (same goes for Hammer Horror), but this third showing for the count isn't bad at all.
Even by surgeons' standards,Doctor Stone is horrible and arrogant.Disliked by fellow medics in his big city hospital,none of whom will be sorry to see the back of him,he is on his way to L.A. keen to make his first million in Cosmetic Surgery.After taking an illegal route round a traffic jam he runs his vintage Porsche into a picket fence owned by the Judge in a one - ute town down south.Failing to bamboozle them with his big city ways,he ends up in the Judge's courtroom and is sentenced to do community service at the local hospital which is under threat due to the imminent retirement of the town doctor,a wise and experienced old-style MD.The rest is pure Preston Sturges.
It draws you in from the first 5 mins and then keeps you going and yet it is such a simple storyline.
If you didn't see that on the first viewing, try seeing it again.
I thought it was decent fare on the first viewing until I caught the last 50 minutes or so a second time around on cable late one night.
I realized it was much better than it first seemed because, like a performance by a great dancer or skilled actors, it looks too easy to be really excellent, too natural.
For the first offense in the town of Grady, Florida Fox is given community service in the local hospital where crotchety old doctor Barnard Hughes is ready to pack it in.
When I first saw Doc Hollywood, I didn't expect to fall under the spell of this Mayberry of Squash either, but the locals really grow on you.
I didn't really get into this movie until the first car scene, Then things begin to happen and From this moment forward, this movie turns into a pure magical experience you just can't turn away from.
If some of the best actors on your series decide to strike on their own to make movies, they should be allowed to come back to SNL if the "first" movie they make winds up stinking as much as this one did.
I actually saw this movie on a trans-Pacific flight - first thing I thought, when it came on, was that it merely had the same name as the French Taxi movies I love so much.
I wished through the entire film that Jimmy Fallons first crash in the film had been fatal , that way it could have just ended .
From the first minute I tuned to this movie, I knew it was gonna be a lame rip-off of the great French comedy series "Taxi", written by Luc Besson (directors: Gerard Pires and Gerard Krawczyk).
The first couple minutes is not bad, though unconvincing.
For his first movie, he sure made a poor choice.
I'm not kidding when I say that this a remake of the three French films since although the film is mainly a poor remake of the the first film, it lifts sequences from the second and third films.
I first saw Quincy just under ten years ago when they showed it on BBC1 in the afternoons.
My first memory was of the cops fainting when Quincy shows them the autopsy in the credits.
I have enjoyed Quincy for years--both when it first came on TV and in the years following its wide-spread syndication.
I think Quincy was great when it first aired but is reflective of the "Shake 'n Bake" formula of TV in the '70s and early '80s.
In fact, many of the episodes dealt with forensic methods which were just coming into being in the 70's, and for the first time let the audience of the series see these new techniques and research, including the build-up of a skeletal face to what the person could have looked like, looking for evidence of where a person has been by looking at the residue on a person's shoes and other forensic methods we take for granted nowadays.
It is a love relationship born first from fear - the omnipresent death surrounding and threatening everything had succeeded in drowning hate in a lake of numbness - Lise had hardened herself into indifference and Starker's violence stirs something in her.
The first scene that told me that this was going to be a white-knuckle thrill ride is one where a roomful of naked German troops are shown some weird sexually violent scheisse films and then are loosed on a number of nude Jewish women to violate.
Twenty years after he first started out as a totally unknown figure, Spielberg entered the new millennium as one of the most influential figures in history, and continues to make top-notch movies with his winning formula Â Minority Report continues this streak.
How the effect crew for this film was skipped over by the Academy I will never understand, because even two years after I first saw the film many of the visuals remain stuck in my mind.
The first time you'll See this, I can guarantee that you will want to watch it again, because you won't have figured it all out.
When I first watched it I wasn't too sure about the washed out colours used in every scene apart from the few flashbacks it the more of the film I saw the more I thought they suited the tone of the film.
That one was paid by the inventor who then afterward committed himself the very crime exactly the way it was supposed to happen which enabled this second crime to be understood by technicians as a simple echo of the first one that was prevented and to be disregarded.
The first principle is excessive and even wrong.
Bottom line, this is the type of picture to see twice, first to get the feel and presence, and the second to clear up any misunderstandings in the plot (or maybe to avoid Scooby Doo and Windtalkers), since this is indeed one of the best pictures of the year and one of Spielberg's best recent pictures.
His next two films were improvements (there was nowhere to go but up): the first anonymous but not bad ("Amistad"), the second bad but not anonymous ("Saving Private Ryan"), but they were both pompous gestures which appear to have been designed to win still more awards; and it wasn't until eight years after "Schindler's List" that the skilled director of old times re-appeared (with "A.I."
Parents, a note: if your child is under 12 at least I would strongly recommend you watch this film first.
Can he figure them out in time, or will Pre-Crime see its first murder in six years?
Roger Ebert says that this movie "reminds us why we go to the movies in the first place," and I agree with him.
I had never heard of this movie when I first saw it.
first of all, i would like to give this a minus rating but they only allow me a 1 as the lowest.
I saw "Son of Dracula" when it was first released and six times over the following months.
It was not a "B" picture, but had top billing on double features in first, second and third-run movie theaters in my home town.
When I first saw it I believe the second feature was "The Mad Ghoul," starring George Zucco.
OK, I have to admit, I missed the first ten minutes of the program.
The thing is, it was not shown that he had an opportunity to write the first letter on her typewriter, so the typefaces would not have matched.
I tuned in late and missed the first few minutes of the movie where wily Albert Richter (George Sanders) is purported to have committed his evil deed; unfortunately Sanders has always been one of my favourite actors, one of the best ne'er-do-wells (as in The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, Samson and Delilah, and All About Eve), and I wasn't a little old lady in those days but a budding teenager.
There is not a wasted moment in this film, and I particularly liked the first scene with the windy backdrop, adding an air of foreboding to what was unfolding.
One of my favorite parts was the account of the Byzantine emperor's handling of successive waves of peasants and soldiers that arrived at his gate during the first crusade.
The case for the wandering man being Christ is strong if you tend toward those lines of thinking (obviously that's my first leaning): he died for the main character's sins.
I first saw this film during a one year term as festival director for the Golden Film Festival.
Recommended to the fans of the first parts in the series and those who love the Universal films.
And Geraldine Brooks is very good in her first major film role as the bitchy stepdaughter who eventually warms up to Joan.
Louise then almost snaps when she learns Carol and David are seeing one another; her odd behavior becomes even odder, telling lies, imagining she was involved in the death of Dean's first wife, etc.
The film is uneven at time, and the script slightly lacking, but the performances are first rate.
Apparently this plum role was first offered to Bette Davis (who also apparently foolishly turned down the lead in MILDRED PIERCE) but Ms. Davis was about to go on maternity leave.
At first sight he seems an odd choice for this basically urbane character, but he acquits himself very well indeed and gives him a multi-layered personality.
Graham' after the first Mrs. Graham commits suicide.
And then there is a befuddling conversation between Professor Brewster and Professor Laszlo (the vampire expert) as to why Kay fell under Dracula's spell in the first place.
The special effects include a fake bat that gets more screen time than it should, but some of the cooler images include the first ever bat-to-man transformation, as well as a great scene in the swamp, where Dracula's coffin rises to the water's surface, then Dracula himself floats across to the other side where Kay is waiting.
Possessed is about someone who is deprived completely of it, at first by the man with whom she is in love, who loathes her smothering obsession with him and ends the relationship and goes so far as to leave the area, and furthermore by her own self for no reason other than that she is simply following her heart.
Her mind spirals sadly into deterioration with her mania over her unrequited love: She hears voices, hallucinates, and believes her husband's first wife, the invalid, to still be alive.
At first Carol was anything but affectionate to her step-mother Louise feeling that she was having an affair with her father Dean Graham behind her mothers back which lead her to kill herself.
Her first breakdown (at Massey's waterfront mansion) with Heflin might be considered over-the-top 40s style acting (pre-Method), but she delivers it beautifully, her face and expressions a towering display of emotion and angst.
I guess this is one of the first movies that deals with mental illness.
I think the death of Dean Graham's first wife is rushed and a bit muddled.
Matt Dillon is especially good and displays a depth to his acting that had yet to be seen when this was first released.
I expected this movie to bore me within the first five minutes, but I had an afternoon to kill and there was a rerun of a home improvement show I could watch.
Well, this is the first Universal Dracula film that I've watched and it might be a superfluous sequel to the original.
The 'flash' leaving the gun was highly comical at first in an obscure kinda way.
Well, it isn't your typical D movie because poor D ends up fooled without even realizing it...the belle planned beforehand to first have D kill her father, thus inheriting vast estates, then to convince her beau to kill D himself, thus leading an immortal life with him as "undead".
Hopefully the brief notes above will provide sufficient background to help anyone seeing this film who is unaware of its background to enjoy it; but it can never again have as much appeal as it first did for those who were aware of the original story.
Meanwhile she pursues a willing Young, only to first find a number of men who knew her in the past, and then find that Cabot is getting into her hair.
Anyhow, He travels under the alias "Count Alucard" (Dracula spelled backwards) to America to marry a woman who is secretly just trying to gain eternal life so that she can spread it to her real love interest who she was supposed to marry in the first place.
And it's the only one of the Universal classic Dracula films where we actually see the vampires turn into mist, and the first one where we actually SEE Dracula turn into a bat.
I believe RING 0 was a phenomenal film and a brilliant prequel to the first two films RINGU and RINGU 2.
I noticed a different director made it and the actress who played Sadako was not in it apparently so I thought it was a director cashing in on the popularity of the first two films.
At first, RING 0 seemed to throw me off and again; I was worried that it would not be the same style as the previous two movies.
After the first two movies I would sometimes think I saw the shape of Sadako reflected in my TV, or in a corner.
By the way, this is the first film I saw Vilma Santos.
first, the dialogs and conversation flows were downright ridiculous.they were talking so fast as if they were in a hurry.
At first I was a bit skeptic, but man....what great acting!!
This was the first movie to use Alucard as an anagram for Dracula.
It wasn't good the first time around...it's unbearable the second.
I was miffed the first time I saw this film.
I realized that no one I talked to at first had shared his or her lives with anyone for any more than a few years.
Producer Carl Laemmle Jr changed history of horror cinema when he hired director Tod Browning to make the first official adaptation to Bram Stoker's classic novel "Dracula".
"Son of Dracula" takes place decades after the first film, when the Dracula's story is now considered a mere myth.
Robert Siodmak makes great use of his resources and the film rivals the first film in quality and overall composition.
Often forgotten among the many other films in the series (not unusual considering that the first two Frankenstein sequels were masterpieces), "Son of Dracula" is a worthy sequel to Browning's classic and definitely superior to the previous "Dracula's Daughter".
Imagine a film with these two together for the first time!
Now imagine THE WORST film that could possibly be made with these two together for the first time.
The Old West was never really looked right on Bogie and this performance, his first with Stetson and Six-gun, could be seen just as a dry run for his appearance as Whip McCord in the James Cagney vehicle 'The Oklahoma Kid'.
In fact it was the first time Bogart ever appeared on the wrong side of the law and his depiction of a violent, shiftless man with no moral centre shows that he had this kind of role down pat five years before his breakthrough in 'The Petrified Forest'.
The first few scenes take place back east and feature Robert Warwick, so I was thinking "oh no, another of those 'dude goes West' films."
The heavy in the film is played by the young Humphrey Bogart, in what must have been one of his first significant roles, and he is menacing and intense, just as he would be a few years later in PETRIFIED FOREST.
I didn't expect much when I first saw this movie.
It blew me away in my first viewing, and it somehow continues to today.
At first I feared this would have been a action movie disguised as a gangster film, but even that wasn't true.
in the first half of the movie there is an extended sequence about vito genovese's time in italy something that seems completely disconnected from the rest of the plot, no hints are given about his actual connection to luciano and his role in the Gene Giannini hit shown later in the movie.
The concept at first glance can make gay people very angry about airing their "dirty laundry" and rightfully so.
It's been a while since I last saw this film, as a matter of fact, Pelle SvanslÃ¶s is one of the first films I saw as a child.
Still, I cried my our eyes out the first time I saw it.
After the first 10 minutes it become obvious that the entire movie would be nothing but massively overused, immature jokes that were never funny in the first place, along with very poorly written dialogue and the most predictable storyline since a cop eating a donut.
Some of the sight gags were funny, the first time they were used.
I only had to watch the first fifteen minutes ONCE before I was ready to walk out.
I read the book, first, as a kid... and not because I was assigned to read it but because I liked to read.
It wasn't funny the first time, what made Meyers think it would be funny the tenth or fifteenth?
I first saw this Three Stooges short when I bought the Three Stooges Collection Vol.
3, and so this is one of the first ones that I watched on the first disc, and I can say a lot of things in this short film's favor!
"Then seeing it again for the first time in years some time in 1986.This time that I'd first seen it it was also after school & when it was too snowy out to go to my C.C.D.Class.Curly's Skunkskin cap is another interesting & hysterical aspect to give good color to this picture.
The bulk of the story contains classic Three Stooges gags, some of which are good no matter how many times, or in how many films, you seem them: like the grizzly bear wandering into the shed and Curly, at first, thinking it's a warm blanket.
In the first Sylvester/Porky pairing, they move into an abandoned house, which Sylvester discovers is inhabited by killer mice.
This movie isn't worth renting, I rented it when it first came out on DVD what a waste of 4.50 this movie is someones idea of a sick joke.
On first glance, the movie may seem to be pushing at the 'weirdness' card a bit too much.
I couldn't get into the first screening on the Saturday evening as numbers were restricted and the show was full.
This movie is the reason that I first became interested in learning Japanese language and about the culture (and I'm still doing it with the intention of becoming a teacher in Japan).
While the majority of the pacing in the opening half slowly kicks off in first gear, it's not until just after the halfway mark where the tempo gets frenetic and the blood splatter hits the fans.
This would be the first of four chapters of this character.
I first saw an episode of "Little Britain" three years ago and found it a wonderful comedy series; it was farcical, fresh and entertaining.
Merchandise poured out, the DVD sold like hotcakes, and it seemed like "Little Britain" had firmly sealed its place up there as a classic TV series; it probably won't be something like "Herman's Head" or "A Sharp Intake of Breath" that fades into obscurity after it gets shown first time round (as a matter of fact, how many know what actually happened in these things?
It just seemed to have suffered from repetition, which I have begun to suspect occurred due to the powers at the BBC (it should be noted that Series One was made for the experimental channel BBC Three originally, so along with the fact that it was new, that could be why the first few episodes were strong).
It's definitely worth watching, but try and see the first series if you want the best of this comedy.
When this show first appeared, it seemed to be genuinely making an attempt to be fresh, interesting and relevant to modern Britain but it quickly became apparent that it is, in fact nothing more than an 1/2 hour Carry on film, only with less subtlety and innovation.
I had heard so much hype about it that when I finally saw the first episode, I expected to be laughing to the point of tears.
I remember being rather excited about this show when the railers first appeared, even rushing out of the room whenever they came on as to not spoil the clips through over-saturation.
This all seemed painfully ironic when after five minutes of the first episode I saw the same sketch, in a marginally different location, then another, and another.
On my first view of Little Britain it didn't strike me as something that was hilariously funny.
They manage to capture all demographics of audience with their mix of slapstick humour with more subtle comedy traits that audiences might not pick up on the first viewing.
Little Britain is a timeless classic - if you don't like it at first, give it another go.
Not nearly as funny as the first two and to be honest everything was a bit samey ans stail at this point.
Examples: Dame Sally Markham was funny at first, but finding more ways for her to pad out her romance novels starts to get a little boring.
Lou and Andy are also funny at first, but after a while I get tired of the 3 minute set-up for him to predictably change his mind about what he wants.
The first time you watch Little Britain, you will be laughing so hard and will keep on laughing for the next half hour.
What Little Britain failed to do though was to actually create new jokes, instead favouring the use of the jokes from the first episode all the way through to the 2nd series, and 3rd if there is one.
In conclusion, great comedy at first, but due to same jokes being used over and over again, becomes in overwhelmingly bored.
I saw this series when it first premiered in 2003, and I really liked it!
The first 5 minutes, and the last 10 minutes were okay.
I was so involved in just the story the first time I forgot how beautiful the musical score was.
During last year's visit to the Hong Kong International Film Festival, it gave me an opportunity to take in first hand and provide for some exposure to Chinese films, specifically those that were made in China.
And it's no surprise that I fell in love with director Xiao Jiang's first film, which is one with such a compelling story and fine acting, I would think one would likely have a heart of stone not to like it for some reason.
Electric Shadows is such a charming film that you'd find it hard to believe it's actually a first film, balancing drama, comedy and tragedy even with great aplomb, although there were some series of coincidences in the events and characters that you'll find it easy to ignore for the whole movie to work.
I first heard about this much earlier adaptation of the book around that time, but it took me seven years to finally get around to watching it, even though I had been intending to watch it for quite a while by the time I did.
The ranch owner's son is Curley, a belligerent young man who hates Lennie from the moment he first sees him, and has a lonely wife named Mae, whom he tends to neglect, but doesn't want any other men to have anything to do with her, being the jealous type.
This first ever film adaptation of a John Steinbeck story is not perfect, but overall, it's still very good, and very faithful to the book.
Her achievement is all the more surprising because the movie--her first, and filmed, it would appear, on an awfully small budget--starts out simply and charmingly then quietly builds until it reaches a conclusion that ties everything together without a whiff of heavy-handed melodrama or overkill.
Dabing enters the story, at first a bully for Ling Ling but after a while they become best friends.
Both things do not really matter, but show how hard it is to make the right choices, especially when you direct a film for the first time.
After having seen one hour I was still waiting for my first laugh...
This is the first movie Adam Sandler has made since Punch Drunk Love.
Stienbeck's classic is given it's first big screen adaption and Lon Chaney Jr gives the best performance of his career.
This movie was one of the funniest films in the first three years of the century.
Within the first thirty minutes, I observed twelve people walk out of the theater; I managed to hold out for almost an hour.
As the movie progressed, I kept imagining the scene where actors were reviewing this lame script for the first time and could not help but wonder, "What were they thinking?"
The first is when Candy's dog is put down.
There's something else about Kilpatrick - did you notice that after every one of his bloody encounters (that first one with Schoolboy was the worst), he appears in the next scene with a clean set of duds.
I can remember the first time I saw this movie on television, maybe 30 years ago.
Last night I watched the movie again on Turner Classic Movies, for the first time in 30 years, and once again I cried like a baby over Candy's dog and at the end.
When I first saw it, I thought it may have had a few good laughs, but instead, the laughs never stopped.
Did you catch the neat way he mounted his horse right after first meeting George and Lennie?
What gets me the most is the little stuff in the movie that you might not see the first time.
Along the way the good and the bad happen first a meeting with dolphin secretary Melissa Robinson (Courteney Cox) leads to a blast-off bed moving romance!
I also think the plot is good, at least I didn't figure it out when I saw the movie for the first time!
A riot from start to finish, Carrey's first feature comedy is as cheerfully bawdy as it is idiotically inventive.
Being one of his first major roles and to actually manage to single-handedly make this movie what it is with his sheer brilliance at being a comedian-actor, well, it should not be overlooked.
I've never laughed so hard in my life; that was from the first time I saw it.
This was Jim Carrey's first official role and launched his brilliant career.
Jim Carrey, in his first film starring role after achieving genuine stardom being the "token white guy" on TV's 'In Living Colour', plays the title character, who is hired by employees of the Miami Dolphins football team to locate and retrieve Snowflake the dolphin, the beloved mascot of the team.
I first saw this movie when I was in high school, and I remember that I would ditch school and go to the theater to see it and I would laugh hysterically until my sides hurt every time I saw it.
Technical: The first time I realized that this was a low budget film was after I had watched it and heard the news from someone else.
From the first moment Robert Carlyle's Character is beat to the ground for causing the Japanese guard to "lose face", I was hooked.
It would take too long for me to go shot by shot, but one thing in particular which is good if you see a few scenes of it, but is annoying the first time is the frequent several second flashbacks...
The first couple times I saw them I wasn't sure exactly what was going on (Particularly the fight at the food line) but after I saw it a few more times, I finally figured it out.
Invest in the first half of this film, and then, let the debates begin!
The Japanese characters were a bit stereotyped at first, but they became real, nuanced, textured, and very believable as the story unfolded.
The animation was terrible compared to the first, it looked cheap tacky and rather rubbish.
I also recommend to watch it more than once because it has nothing to do with American fastfood film-making, so there might be things that are misunderstood during the first viewing.
What was good about the first one?
1) The good thing about the first one was that the genie wasn't over-used.
3) Because Jafar wasn't killed off in the first one, they brought him back, and he wasn't so fortunate the second time round, apparently - I didn't see any bones, but if he was still alive, they would have brought him back for subsequent episodes.
'Specially after the first one where he despised 'kissing up to that chump and his chump daughter' which is what he ends up doing.
When I first saw an ad for this movie, in fact, I thought it was really good that they'd brought Jafar back, but having watched the whole thing, I wished they'd left him in the Cave of Wonders to chill out as planned at the end of the 1st one by the Genie.
This was one of the first Disney sequals...
When a child watches a movie for the first time they get this glow and a twinkle in their eyes and they will remember it always.
Disney entered the direct-to-video arena for the very first time in 1994 with "The Return of Jafar," the sequel to the 1992 theatrical animated release "Aladdin."
So, I guess I should rather look for the first one, to find more Jasmine (and nostalgia of my friend) & a better story !!!!
The songs were an insult to Alan Maken and Howard Ashmen's wonderful soundtrack for the first film.
Dust off your old copy of the first one and watch it instead.
Ever since seeing Aladdin for the first time I wanted to see this movie.
Not me and nobody should judge it because of Aladdin the first.
(I also like the way that Al can swim underwater and resurface; at least it's better than drowning in chains in the first "Aladdin" movie.
It basically has a classic "defeated villain wants revenge" plot, where Jafar wants to kill Aladdin as he sealed him in the magic lamp at the end of the first movie.
The voice cast is the same as the first movie, except for one major difference: Genie.
This film is worth watching only for Dan's appearance; if you're not a fan of his work, and you are a fan of the original, then seriously, avoid this one if you don't particularly feel like ruining what the first one did to you.
In comparison to the stunning original, it's not only terrible, but it's an insult to every thing that made the first film so special.
Naturally that this movie isn't as good as the first one, like I said.
The artwork looks more poor comparing to the first one (which is more refined and more according to Disney's standards).
The colorful imagination, creativity and magic of the first one are gone.
He has the same general sarcasm and I like the idea that he becomes a Â«good guyÂ», but let's be frank: he's way funnier in the first one.
Jafar is now more annoying and not as humorous as in the first one.
The Genie is still funny, but without the colorful imagination and brilliant sense of humor he's got on the first one.
The soundtrack itself is nowhere near as impressing and memorable as on the first one - in fact, none of the songs here really capture our attention and hearts.
For kids it is just as recommendable and entertaining as the first one, but for older people the first one is, without a doubt, the best choice.
Aladdin and Jasmine are not married in this film, (even though they married at the end of the first movie) and the only really memorable scene is a brief goof, where the Sultan loses his eyebrows for a split second.
(Lewis Milestone tried to borrow first James Cagney and then Humphrey Bogart for the part.
OF MICE AND MEN was his first.
Suffice it to say that his first is a contender, and one of the best film scores ever written.
Even though the soundtrack isn't as memorable as the first Aladdin, I still loved Iago's song "I'm looking out for me".
Actually, there's another crime scene investigation, almost as funny as the first: Defoe gets so worked up that he sweats, tears his shirt and fires his gun in the air- AT A CRIME SCENE!
After the first 10 minutes of the film I began the elaborate process of matching scenes from the Boondock Saints to other films.
Not understanding that Dafoe was gay at first and then realizing in hilarity that he was, I laughed my way through this absurd attempt at a good independent film.
What develops is an excellent dark comedy/drama that explodes from the first frame till the last.
It also has a fairly original idea that is utilized in nearly every action scene in the movie, and that should be used more often in action films; first you see the aftermath, the crime-scene, the police investigating, counting bodies, etc.
I first saw this version of mice and men back in the mid nineties on AMC channel.
For me it was the first time I had viewed him as a serious actor.
At first, he just makes it up with a person named 'Tyrone'.
What attracted me to the movie was the fact that Morgan Freeman received his first ever Academy Award nomination for his role as a pimp in this film.
How did he come up with the idea to write about a pimp in the first place?
Kathy Baker is wonderfully appealing (and sexy) as Punchy, one of "Fast Black"'s girls; she shines in all of her scenes, especially when she's relating to Fisher the comedic account of her first ever trick.
None of these events would have occurred if Reeve hadn't told that first lie.
Perhaps even more troubling, its sense of his humanity has much more to do with a feel good Californian in the later 20th century (refer to Dogma's "Buddy Jesus") than it has anything to do with a first century Middle-Easterner.
For the first time, we get to hear all of Jesus' words and parables in everyday English, as Matthew wrote them in detail, which are delivered by Bruce Marchiano in the most lively, realistic way imaginable.
I didn't like this movie at first.
Thank you for being the first Jesus to smile, to laugh and to weep with such abandon.
Ringo Lam"s first Hong Kong film after his try in Hollywood is an impressive one.The plot itself has so many unexpected twists that you can watch it easily twice and still discover things you didn't see the first time.The good camerawork gives the movies atmosphere of tension,fear and the supernatural an extra boost.The cast has proven itself already in several other Hong Kong films and also here they deliver an excellent performance.This movie is a good start if you're not into Hong Kong films but want to give it a try,for the real fans it's a must see!
The first comment given here shows an incredible lack of understanding of Steinbeck in his California period.
At first I believed this was a SILENT OF THE LAMBS ripÂoff, and not a very bad one, and I even wondered why it wasn't more famous ,or at least somewhat famous.
Okay, before I start, I will be the first to admit that there are a couple of plot holes, an unforgivable contrivance, and that belief does have to be suspended here and there for Jessie the wonder-kid's feats.
This could, arguably, be a good thing as it still leaves a veil of mystery over the first two films.
Steve "The Sandman" Sandkuhler lights up the screen in his Oscar nominated portrayal of Terry Luttrell, lead singer of REO Speedwagon, as Tony Malanowski unfolds his first masterpiece, "Night of Horror."
I've seen it cause even hardened veterans of the Bad Movie Wars to hit the Eject button screaming after the first twenty minutes.
Ricco finds an ally in an old friend of his father's niece, Scilla(Barbara Bouchet)..Scilla, at first, participates for kicks, but soon finds that she's in love with Ricco and realizes that his feud with Vito will only leave a lot of innocent people dead.
The first half of the movie is so delightfully cheesy that I kept wondering where's Joe Bob Briggs when you need him.
It certainly isn't love at first sight when two restaurant employees meet each other on a rainy night.
I really liked the Jazz/slightly noir soundtrack, which seemed an unusual choice at first but soon felt appropriate.
In one of the first scenes I really got thrilled by the horse racing, although they were just two cartoons "risking their lifes", I felt as if that scene needed a stunt!!!
We find out within the first 15 minutes she plans to kill herself the day her boyfriend returns.
This is the first film from Douglas Raines' production company, 110 In The Shade, based out of Tuscon, Arizona.
John Savage did a great job as the totally creep guy, especially in his first scene where he describes what he does, but I won't spoil you by saying more.
This is one of those movies where the second time through will be better than the first.
Considering the fact this was the first appearance of Douglas A. Raine as director, there's still a chance of improvement.
His first lead is a mass-market statuette of a terrified woman, the screaming mimi, sold by the first victim the day she was murdered... Argento changed many details in the process of turning "The Screaming Mimi" into The Bird With The Crystal Plumage, but the most important is this: flawed and weak though he may be, Brown's protagonist is afraid of the universe of madness glimpsed when he gets close to Yolanda Lang.
Major Drango is appointed US military governor to a small Georgia community where tensions are running high after the defeat of the Confederacy .Drango himself participated in Sherman's march through the state and saw the devastation at first hand .Neither Drango or his men are welcomed in the community except by the small coterie of Union sympathisers  Opposition is lead by Ronald Howard (son of Leslie Howard ,in his first US Movie) the son of the local judge(Donald Crisp).The father -while in sympathy with the aims of his son -is less than impressed by the violent methods he employs.A confederate sympathiser is lynched and arson is also deployed as a terrorist weapon by the unregenerate Southerners.Drango -in addition to his professional problems -finds himself drawn to the daughter of the lynched sympathiser -winningly played by Joanne Dru  Chandler is a bit wooden in the title role -perhaps worn down by his production duties as his company produced the picture-but the rest of the acting is fine especially from John Lupton as an embittered Confederate Captain .The direction ,jointly undertaken by Hall Bartlett and Jules Bricken (who also scripted)is lumpen but the fluid and inventive monochrome photography by James Wong Howe is superb The movie is more intriguing than exciting but it is a striking and worthwhile movie with something interesting to say
Dru becomes Drango's support system, at first bitter with him for how he talked her father out of leaving the town for the nearest fort.
Cracking Up is one of my favorite movies.....OK, I might have a weird sense of humor... but the first time I saw it, I laughed so hard my side hurt.
I don't quite know where this story fits into the first's, though I have read that some people prefer to view it as an alternate storyline.
This is a continuation of the first film, Legend of the Overfiend while bearing little in actual continuity (wasn't the earth being destroyed at the end of the first one?).
But like the first one, the graphic depictions of demonic rape is rampant throughout, but now with mechanical rape added on.
Throw in the characters from the first one like Megumi and that little flying gimp monkey thing, and you're right back at home.
Movie moves into high gear when Nick (Cary Grant) sees his first wife as the elevator door closes in the hotel on the way to the honeymoon suite with his bride and he's on the spot to break it to his new bride but then finds out his wife was stranded with a hunk of an anthropologist (Randalf Scott).
I am writing this review because after years of watching this movie and loving every minute of it, every time I watched it, I have just watched 'Move over Darling' for the first time and thought I'd write a review of both and compare them.
For instance, the scene where Nicholas Arden first sees his wife in the hotel lobby and he follows the lift doors closing.
Let me say, first of all, that I am not complaining about this film.
It's all screwball fun and somewhat touching as their romance is rekindled and their children discover their mother for the first time.
It's obvious that the main reason for this film's existence is an attempt to recapture the magic of the first pairing of Cary Grant, Irene Dunne, and Leo McCarey, namely 1937's "The Awful Truth."
When Ellen explains that Stephen was out of commission with a broken leg for the first six months, Nick replies, "That still leaves six and a half years."
Later I found out that he was actually asked to play the James Bond character in the first 1962 Bond movie "Dr. No" but he turned it down because he believed to be too old already at the time to play the character.
Dunne is very funny, posing as a southern friend when she meets Bianca, and also is quite touching when she first sees her children.
Of course, she was never dead in the first place but stranded on a desert island with a hunky athlete as her only companion.
After his shipwrecked wife is declared dead and he takes on a new wife, Grant's first wife resurfaces, rescued after seven years on an island.
Dunne and Grant worked well together in another marital comedy, The Awful Truth and they were just as bright in My Favorite Wife as they were in the first film.
...albeit a little slow-paced in the first half.
Cary Grant's facial expression on the elevator when he first sees Dunne after 7 years is so memorable that I can still remember it 35 years after first seeing it.
I first saw this anime at the "Bad Anime Festival" at Ohayocon '06 in Columbus, OH.
When I first reviewed this movie on my website, I was very harsh regarding the acting.
A good amateur first effort.
Seeing the serial again for the first time in maybe two decades I have to revise that, the feature is worse.
When NITRO gets murdered, her Sister Cinnamon tries to figure out who's responsible.. By doing this, she teams with her friends who she meets as they all first gets sent to prison by kicking some poor soul's ass.
A renowned conductor comes from retirement to conduct, and hires baritone Lawrence Tibbett, one of America's first operatic super stars, whose superb singing is the chief attraction of the film.
Darryl Zanuck's first release after the merging of his 20th Century co. and Fox studio, this features the boyish baritone, Lawrence Tibbett, in his prime.
I believe that he made the first commercial recordings from Porgy and Bess as Porgy, using the same dialect as in this film when he sings the Negro spiritual "Glory Road" in a perhaps over-dramatic rendition.
Having recently gotten the first Looney Tunes Golden Collection from my library, I went through all the extras first (except the "music only" shorts).
Baseball Bugs is the first one listed on disc one.
Now it's the Gorillas against Bugs on first, Bugs on second, Bugs on third, Bugs pitching, Bugs catching; and it's no match.
And the cameo at the end of America's perennial first lady was a hoot - and Bugs goes and lampoons her on the spot!
And the characters kept going on about how nice Eva could be when you first meet her Â what?
I'll be the first to admit that the movie was very histrionic (in particular Ms. Crawford's performance) and is pure soap opera as well--but I still enjoyed the film immensely.
When I first saw it (and every time since), you could literally FEEL the presence of God in the theater.
But Hunter also has a partner (George Brent)and it's love at first sight.
This was one of Kay's final film for Warners, and you'll note they had already demoted her to first billing but beneath the title.
This movie stunned me when I first saw it, so I went and saw it again two days later.
I prefer the first one, even though I like Henrikson as an actor.
Here, he is a dupe at first, then a decoy at the end, and in between sort of a standard-issue government official (albeit a rare honest one).
His first assignment: Investigate the murders of one of the president's friends, a prominent U.S. businessman with secret ties to Colombian drug cartels.
This in my eyes is a true classic, of a man getting caught in a situation way bigger then he can explain at first.
The first hour of the movie or so even feels quite redundant afterward.
Fun part of this movie is how the computer kid solved the password in 5 seconds during the first part of the movie, while he was given all the personal "paper" data on the people involved and then was challenged with a serious job at the end.
Here the audience first meets John Clark (Willem Dafoe), a mysterious black ops veteran who will train and lead the team of soldiers in Columbia.
His first mission: To investigate the death of one of the President's closest friends, who has connections with drug cartels.
Honestly, the sequences that involves Ryan arguing with the President of the United States are just as good to watch as the films more exciting sequences (The memorable ambush sequence and the RAMBO-esquire finale are the first to come to mind).
The first time I saw this film I thought 'Wow!
THE BAD - This isn't as intense, especially in the first half hour, as Patriot Games and the ending was a little disappointing with a action-scene credibility problem.
I'll get the negative stuff out of the way first.
As someone who has an interest and appreciation of animation, I can say that this is the first film I've seen that successfully integrates computer-generated animation and traditional animation (and I've seen many attempts).
The first thing that will strike you about this movie is how totally fake the accents are!
Indeed the Fear Factory movies he's made have slipped a bit, but on the other hand, a lot of his first works were originally taken from H.P.Lovecraft novels, (so just imagine quite what a task it would be to even try to beat those!)
Unfortunately, 'The Darkness' was the first of his movies to truly disappoint me!
Salas, we learn, was an acolyte of Aleister Crowly, a notorious black magician of the first half of the 20th Century.
well i just end up seeing this 3 part of the eye franchise.i start liking this pang brothers and i get some of theme earlier movies,the eye was really surprising me for the power of scaring you and after giving you chill-out feeling.but the eye 10 make me disappointed but be cause of the willing to get scared.it was making sense until it start turning to looks like scary movie ,so if you like parodies this is your movie and if you wanna scare your self try french HIGH TENSION.i hope so they will go back to were they start , with the next movie.but don't call it the eye don't know witch number.give it other name so don't make the first eye be refused by those who never seen it.i give 3 of 10 for the break dance and for the good looking girls.make me remind me of the 80'is.
The first opening scene, I figured this movie was going to be a weird horror film... and then it just ventured off into an incoherent teen horror.
I thought it was scarier than the first 2 which I thought were quite heart warming.
I guess the producers were just trying to ride on their success of the first film and trying to produce as many films as possible so as to cash in on them before the steam runs off.
Well, the steam definitely had run off with the ending of the first film.
It's another genre that doesn't fit into a trilogy with the first 2 ones and yes it becomes a (lightweight) comedy at some moments but that doesn't mean its a bad movie.
But, to be honest, the first two films were full of such despair and angst, it was refreshing to see the third film a bit more cheerful and playful.
The first The Eye of the series was very creative and all the cast and crews did very good work.
The second one was not as good as the first one.
Many people gave this movie a bad review because they thought it was supposed to be scary movie like the first "Eye" and they didn't realize what was going on.
I say that if you liked the first two movies you should see this one, because you'll probably get a chuckle or two.
Also, you should see the first two before watching this one, if you haven't already.
My advice - give it a miss, especially if you've seen the first 2 and expect this to be anything like them.
This is my first time watching one of the series of 'The Eyes' by the Pang brothers.
Having really loved the first two films I was really looking forward to the third part.
I loved it a lot...it wasn't as bad as everyone said it was, in fact it was everything I hoped it would be...but was it better than the first 2?
This film doesn't try to be like the first two, it's is own film just like the second was to the first.
I'm sure some fans of the first film aren't going to buy into this one much but if you watch it as it's own film...it's a real treat.
This is one of the very first animated movies made for an adult mainstream audience.
With this movie DreamWorks showed for the first time that they are a worthy competitor for Disney.
After watching the first one, me and my friends were in the mood to watch another comedy, so we headed out to find the second "No Retreat, No Surrender."
Since Bruce Lee's ghost starred in the first one, I figured Chuck Norris' ghost would make an appearance.
Loren Avedon is simply matchless as a young humble American hero in his first movie.
Loren Avedons first starring role.
They kept his choreography to late in the shoot and I couldn't tell this was a first for him.
The cheesiest story and most blatant use of Russian bad guys except for the first film topped off with expert martial arts choreography.
No Retreat, No Surrender 2: Raging Thunder (1989) was a sequel only in name to the first film.
Despite being a sequel, this has nothing to do with the first movie.
Same score as the first movie: 7 out of 10!
Scott, sensing his impending doom, leaps from the jeep -- first making sure that the gas tank is full.
even now, years later, i vividly remember how a gangster boss gets shot up: first, they cut the power and come in with infrared goggles and shower everything in bullets, then the bad guys catch on and put on their own nightvision gear - they are prepared, of course.
Director's Gamboa is responsible for the teen saga La primera noche (The first night), La segunda noche, and the light comedy EducaciÃ³n sexual en breves lecciones (Sexual education in short lessons).
The first segment, "Breakfast" is uniform in it's depiction of each actor's "meal".
The first vignette "Breakfast" seems to be a slight repeat of his earlier movie "Et Cetera".
I saw it for the first time in September of this year and remember thinking that this is such a great movie why hadn't I heard of it.
I saw it for the first time in September of this year and remember thinking that this is such a great movie why hadn't I heard of it.
Talbert plays the role with warmth, heart, sarcasm, and conviction, and he does it so wonderfully (and this being his first film!
The first time I watched "Angus" I thought : "what a great movie!
I couldn't remember the title to this movie at first, but I remember the plum tux as plain as day.
Considering all the TRASH that Hollywood puts out every year, here you have a golden gem that would make a ton of money as more kids who are "first timers" in school would buy.
This isn't the first movie that Hollywood has mis-labeled in the name of sales and won't be the last - but for pete sakes PLEASE put this on DVD ?
By the time we are done with the first act we see that Rick has already managed to mentally, emotionally, and socially control Angus.
The first time I saw this, I was amazed!
What an ugly film, was my first thought as I stared at the closing credits.
Absolutely NOTHING happens in the first 30 minutes of this film!!
Hideo Nakata's sequel Ringu 2 is a stylish film with an excellent blend of thrills and chills, without rehashing any ideas that were in the first film.
With the feel of hope at the end of the first one fading away in the second film.
The first Ring was an absolute masterpiece, a milestone for the horror genre.
Some people die, characters are introduced only to disappear without trace, and everything about the first movie is explained with pseudo-scientific hokum, effectively killing any mystique which Ring 1 possessed.
In other words, don't bother watching Ring 2 if you expect the kind of suggestive horror that the first Ring was so brilliant at.
Ring 2 takes a lot away from the first installment, its mystique, its tension, its sense of isolation.
The psychic elements of the film are more consistent and less jarring in this film than in the first.
It is to the film's credit that for the first time *ever* I was finally able to understand the "virus" analogy in terms of emotion and psychic phenomena.
The cast from the first film is back along with the original director.
This one has more horrific overtones than the first one.
The first film as I said previously in the review was much less of a horror film as it was an amazing thriller/mystery.
Also Ringu 2 definitely delves more into the Psychic aspect of not only Sadako but Yoichi who seems to have acquired power from Sadako and Mai Takano who seems to have been given power by Ryuji who was Psychically strong in the first movie.
Hideo Nakata's commercially-driven sequel employs the same funereal pacing and one-dimensional characters which stifled the first film, and the results are no less disappointing.
Building on the events of the first film and following the dreadful video curse through to the next level, it is a very worthy successor to the original classic.
This is not to say that we grow to love Sadako any more in this film than in the first.
"Ring 2" also makes less sense than its predecessor and demands more leaps of the imagination than the first film did.
Rikiya Otaka also deserves a mention as Yoichi (the little boy from the first film) - his expressions of blank terror and occasional moments of rage are very effective indeed.
Simply put 'Ring 2: Spiral' is not as scary as the first one, but like  most classic horror films (except for Aliens, if you consider that to  be a horror film), sequels don't have the privilege of fresh shock  values of the original movie.
Especially if the second movie, as is  the case with 'Ring 2', serves the purposes of explaining the  background further from the first movie.
I may also add that  this sequel is more schizophrenic in its direction and visualization  than the first one.
Possible Spoilers There is no sence comparing this film with the first one they are completely different movies.
The first movie is an exercise in horror and scaredthe crap out of me, the sequel (although there are a number of scary scenes, when they see the manifestation of sadako and her mother for example) is more of a thriller come mystery movie.
The only really major disappointment in this movie is how sadako is manifested, in the first she was a faceless unstoppable force but in the sequel (except the scene in the well when she is quite literally faceless) she is portrade as a normallish girl........just a disapointment.
It's rather like suggesting that they're making The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers as a sequel to The Fellowship of the Ring, solely to capitalize on the success of the first one and make more money.
Further, you can't judge the first one by itself because the story isn't complete.
The sequel to The Ring, The Ring 2 is a continuation of the story in the first movie.
It is better if you watch the first one because seeing it will only lead to many questions.
After the events that happened in the first movie.
Not as good as the first but the last scenes of the The Ring intrigues moviegoers to the sequel.
A great sequel that lack only some chilling scenes like as the first that was very scary.
Another thing that disappoints, after the masterpiece that was "Ring", is that it lacks any one big scare or standout sequence to match the first film's finale or most memorable moments.
There is still a creepy atmosphere (just without the pay off of the first film).
There's also an effective sequence where a survivor from the first film sets off the hospital television  and the other patients start to panic at the sight of the infamous well.
The continuation of style, situations and characters from the first film, prevents this from just being an unrelated sequel, but it tends to ask new questions and then provides no answers.
A certain hint of ambiguity is introduced to the story of Sadako, who was a convincingly malevolent presence in the first film (despite the beautifully poignant scene where Reiko finds her body in the well and the skull almost appears to cry the gloop off from it).
An interesting sidenote is the fact that there is one scene (The first visit to the hospital), which was recreated in the US version of the first film.
The fear and utter dread continues with part 2 of the Ringu trilogy, set 1 week after the events of the first film.
For the first time, we get the sense of Sadako as a tragic figure, rather than a relentless spirit with the sole purpose of seeking revenge on everyone.
Again the acting is flawless, but the most interesting part for me was the fact that minor characters from the first film, get the top billing here.
Almost every surviving and death characters from the first movie returns in this movie.
As the novel, this film was called "Rasen" (the spiral) and while it kept the characters from "Ringu", it followed KÃ´ji Suzuki's novel more closely than the first.
As a result of this, the produces decided to reunite the crew from the first "Ringu" and shot a sequel that followed a new story based on the first film's plot instead of Suzuki's novel.
Reunited with most of the crew from "Ringu", Hideo Nakata returns to complete the tale of the cursed video expanding what he experimented on the first to truly make an improvement over it.
While he keeps the subtle, almost minimalist style of the first film, the bigger budget allows Nakata to try new things and play with suspense in exciting different ways.
While it lacks an "iconic scene" like the first one's famous ending, "Ringu 2" is a better balanced and overall improved example of Nakata's particular (and very influential) style of the New Wave of Asian horror.
Written by Nakata himself and Hiroshi Takahashi, "Ringu 2" acts like an extended epilogue for "Ringu", with the character of Mai Takano trying to find the missing pieces of the puzzle that Ryuji and Reiko tried to complete, and finally facing the evil supernatural force that Sadako was revealed to be in the first film.
Like in the first movie, the film bases a lot of its power in the relationships between characters, and while the bond between Yoichi and Mai may not be as strong as the one with his mother in "Ringu", it is very well-developed thanks to a cleverly written screenplay.
Avoiding the mistakes of "Rasen" (that tried to give a proper scientific explanation to the Ring curse), "Ringu 2" keeps its mystery as the driving force of the film, and delivers a conclusion that, while probably less shocking than the first one, it's no less satisfactory.
Most of the cast from the first "Ringu" returns, which gives the film a nice continuity.
"Ringu 2" is far from a perfect film, but in many ways it is a complete improvement over the influential first part.
Still, as "Ringu 2" is basically an extension of the first film's ending, it's definitely pointless to watch it without having seen the first movie, as it's plot is completely dependent of the first one, and it can't stand on its own without the knowledge of the events of "Ringu".
Another minor quibble, is that the film moves to a very slow pace (even slower than the first one did), so those expecting a scary experience like the first one will probably be disappointed.
"Ringu 2" plays heavy on atmosphere, even more than the first ever did, so it's slow pace is actually beneficial in this aspect.
Probably it won't become a classic as the first part did, but judging it as part of the "Ringu" series, this film is definitely a winner.
Overall an improvement over the first one, "Ringu 2" is definitely a film to see on a dark night with no lights on.
As we examine the aspects of the lethal videotape in this very good sequel, it is admittedly not as frightening as the first movie.
Nice to see Nanako Matsushima return as Reiko even if the main star of this story is Miki Nakatani's character Mai Takano, who had a brief appearance in the first film.
Ring 2 does retain many of the atmospheric and subdued sounds of the first film, but, unlike Ring, you can watch this sequel without the lights on.
I haven't seen the first one, only the Verbinski version, so if you find any utter ignorance in this review, please chalk it up to that(and no, I don't have an excuse for the rest of my writing).
And because of this as a whole it loses some of that great spooky atmosphere that made the first film so magnificent.
Also I wouldn't really call Ring 2 a sequel it start from where the first finished, if you play them back to back, there like one big 3 hour spooky movie.
An adaptation of a KÃ´ji Suzuki novel, 'Ring' had a breakneck pace because of its "race-against-time" plotting, and 'Ring 2' picks up from this by beginning just days after the events of the first film, allowing the audience to observe the aftermath of the terror that Sadako and her tape wreaked on so many people.
But 'Ring 2' isn't based on a book like 'The Spiral' was, and screenwriter Hiroshi Takashi has nothing to build on but the first film.
Takashi answers a few too many questions lingering from the first 'Ring', and while he counters this by raising almost as many (especially with the "weird science" sections in the final act), one may feel robbed of some of the first film's mystery.
However, there's a very interesting subplot involving a schoolgirl named Kanae (played by KyÃ´ko Fukada) who owns a copy of the tape that Okazaki wants to study, and this provides a truly hair-raising sequence, similar to the climax of the first film, where interview footage of a young woman somehow refuses to be erased from the videotape it is on.
With director Hideo Nakata ('Chaos') back on board, it's to be supposed that 'Ring 2' would end up as unsettling as the first film, and the director almost meets this dizzyingly high expectation, but he doesn't want to indulge himself here as much as he did the first time around.
Nakata unnecessarily restrains himself on all fronts, with the sound design here being less potent, the cinematography not as innovative, and composer Kenji Kawai's music cues not as chilling as his work on the first film.
But, dare I say it, Nakata seems to have become a tiny bit unenthusiastic with 'Ring 2', and this mutes some of the terror that he summoned up so effortlessly in the first film.
While certainly a competent actress (and has the "surprised/shocked/scared" expression nailed), it's difficult to empathise as much with the character of Mai as it is to with Reiko in the first film.
I can safely say that 'Ring 2' is a creepy, worthy follow up to the first film.
This is the way they should have went in the first pace.
The movie opens a week after the first one ends.
Before I tear this movie a new one, let me say one thing: minute for minute, this one has more scares than the first one.
In fact, the filmmakers have realized that Sadako has become so commonplace (a Sadako doppleganger appears in almost every Japanese horror movie made after the first Ring) that they need only show her trademark hair to invoke fear.
While it tries to explain the occurances of the first movie, it raises more questions than it answers (why does everyone suddenly have psychic ability?
It's also nice to see almost the entire cast of the first film reprise their roles (even the dead ones).
Fans of the first one won't be disappointed.
It's very instructive that although he manages the first test--even offering his satiated wife breakfast in bed the next morning, it is sex in bed--with him (to reclaim ownership) must come first.
They thought it ruined some of the mystery from the first film.
The bulk of the "atmospheric" or "creepy" material arrives in this last half hour to forty minutes, such as the videotape of another young girl suddenly changing, her head bizarrely, violently shaking similarly to an effect first made popular in Jacob's Ladder (1990).
In fact, it was so good that I began watching it after 1am and had planned on only seeing the first 10-15 minutes before bed.
It was exactly a quarter of a century after George Kelly's Craig's Wife opened on Broadway that Joan Crawford followed Rosalind Russell - who had starred in the first film version - into the role of the eponymous Mrs Craig.
Wendell Corey, at first seemingly miscast, does embody the role of the "Happy go Lucky" nice guy that the part calls for.
It is slower than watching hair grow on your dog -nothing happens for the first 45min.
I first came to know the rather unique director from his infamous DRILLER KILLER...
I still remember how much amazed I was when I first saw it.
This movie was one the first movies i watched and I loved it then and I love it 10 years later.
When i first saw the movie i fell in love with Meg, she was great.
When I saw this movie for the first time I wasn't Meg Ryan's fan yet.
I saw this when it first came out and it had everything going for it.
Here, he's absolutely hilarious; wound up, stressed, understandably amazed by just how insane this predicament he's stumbled into is (at first, quite realistically, he thinks he's losing his mind, maybe even possessed).
As Mr. Igoe, Vernon Wells, a.k.a, The Campiest Villain Ever (as seen in Commando), manages to be genuinely chilling and scary for the second and last time in his career as a bad guy (the first was Mad Max 2), while Robert Picardo is painfully funny as the Cowboy; on an added note, his method of seducing women in nightclubs using an imaginary lasso does NOT work in real life.
The viewer does need to suspend disbelief at times-for instance, why the gang isn't more suspicious of a new inmate who knows all about the stolen diamonds and just happens to have a workable escape plan on her first night in jail, I'll never know-but that just adds to the "charm" of this film.
Some of his antics can be funny too, such as the crazy dance he does in Tuck's apartment, and yelling "I'm possessed" when he first hears Tuck's voice inside his head.
One of the funniest scenes is when Tuck alters Jack's face to look like The Cowboy (Robert Picardo), someone who has come to buy the microchip off Scrimshaw (Kevin McCarthy), the man responsible for stealing the chip in the first place.
I first saw "Innerspace" when I was 11.
Giving away further details may lessen the experience of the first viewing, so I will not describe the other major plot developments that take place in this film, except to say that Hunter is left even more alone and powerless in this world, and calls upon the strength and wisdom of his grandfather to guide him to find the inner strength, courage and self-reliance to take the hand life has dealt him, and to become a true warrior and Cherokee brave.
Among the first noticeable of these revised Post-Mods was the 'Brat Pack'version of the Billy the Kid story, Young Guns.
Disclosure #1: I saw the first ten minutes and was so bored, I just FF'd through the rest.
I'm going to have to do a months worth of brain teezers just to gain back the IQ points I lost from watching the first quarter of this?
Having seen the first three parts I must say I do like this show and I don't wanna miss the upcoming episodes.
I was surprised at first to see this NYC Cashmere Mafia... Great team, interesting story..
The second episode was better than the first, and the show definitely has potential to do better than it's currently doing.
The chemistry between the four best friends could be better, but considering it's only the first few episodes... chemistry can be developed over time.
Being a guy who appreciates strong, assertive women, the main characters of CASHMERE MAFIA were exactly my cup of tea, and the metronome scoring for the first episode was a dead give away the pacing of the show was going to be somewhat rapid.
It's true that at first sight, one could blame the movie's flaws to it's low budget, it's bad special effects or to its director, however, I think that the real problem lays on the poor way the script was built.
While the intentions of the writers were good, the plot was probably not meant to work in the first place.
The camera-work in the film is moody and atmospheric, William's first meeting with Mr. X is very memorable, and one murder scene that takes place on an Alexandrian street is positively stunning, something Hitchcock needn't have been ashamed of.
In the first plot, which really is just a filler because they didn't manage to pad out the 2nd plot to last for more than an hour, the good guys need to rescue a little girl who's been kidnapped by her Austrian dad from his American wife.
This is the first movie I saw starring Hulk Hogan.
Way before Woody Allen laid claim to the same people and the same territory, this 1967 film based on a 1964 play by Murray Schisgal, directed on Broadway by the young Mike Nichols (who had been Elaine May's partner in Chicago) may be the first Hollywood film ever to feature a group of highly neurotic, overly articulate, and Â-although never named as such Âapparently middle-class Jewish urban characters.
The movie doesn't explain why Freddy is afraid of heights or why he lied to Carmen when they first met.
There were a lot of first rate actors in the movie Ernie Hudson, Nia Long, Donnie Wahlberg, etc.
What ever happened to the first stage (hippy) and second (sports and disasters) phases of his career?
Not one to be particularly impressed by the vast majority of so-called "great" things, it took me a while after my first viewing of Life Is Worth Losing to absorb what I had seen and several repeated viewings shortly thereafter to understand I was witnessing a truly great comedian, a genius, THE master of his craft.
The first thing is that his delivery is a little different; usually it'll seem like he'll go for his three topics (the little things in life 'Seinfeld' style, words and expressions, and the "big" world), but much of the special this time is with a delivery that doesn't (at least some of the time, maybe not for the most part maybe so) have that much of the same strange skepticism.
The third thing is that at times he is so into giving a lyrical, sometimes even poetic kind of rhythm to his bits and terms in his linguist way (the first five minutes of the special a great warm-up, is a keeper) that might throw people off.
After seeing one of her first recognized virtuoso acting performances in New York, Marlon Brando was quoted as saying "I should tear up my [acting] equity card--that woman is a genius!"

Wayne is first billed, but the cast is mostly ensemble.
The first half drags here and there, but the final twist is so sad you forget the few faults.
The first shot of the movie is also brilliant and if it wouldn't have been directed by Ford I could have imagined something surreal about it.
While A Study in Scarlet was the first Holmes mystery Conan Doyle wrote, it had been filmed only twice before, with an English feature and an American short both appearing in 1914.
The first part is based on history before 1990.
If we're talking recommendations and I have to exclude anything with Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, or Jet Li, I'd recommend any of the first four In the Line of Duty movies over this.
When porn first went "mainstream," it did so with a series of big screen feature films like this one from 1978.
Meanwhile, her father is worried about her but has to attend to his nuptial duties first, and when his maid complains he includes her in the wedding night proceedings.
Which is a shame, because one of the first ones I ever witnessed was Pretty Peaches I... this movie has it all.
I watched it with my new wife (our first 'dirty movie' together) and we were both laughing our asses off at the absurdity of it all, but it was good laughter... suffice to say I believe our son was conceived that night.
'The Galileo Seven', like most in the first season, is an above-average episode that shows Star Trek's creators coming up with imaginative and clever twists in the show's format almost every week.
This is the first episode to 'star' one of the shuttlecraft (though one figured prominently in ''The Menagerie').
But, since this was a first season episode, it may have been filmed before Leonard Nimoy had fully come to understand his character and the proper way to play him, (for example, he was still speaking with that put-on British accent like when he pronounces the word command as "commond").
Like Scotty's dire warnings about the condition of the ship's engines, or those red shirted security men who were always first to bite the dust, you'd know the situation was dire if Kelowitz showed up with a new batch of bruises and another alarming report for Kirk.
Rare for a first season episode, this focuses on Spock rather than Kirk, who remained on the Enterprise this time around.
The first when I was a kid at the 1980s and (Magnum) was the assured ride of fun.
So, when I made a list of my own for the best 10 TV shows ever, I found no competitor on the first rank but the greatest "Magnum, P.I.".
first aired which seemed so fresh and original at the time?
when by chance I saw an episode I now recognize as a third season one; I was puzzled then since I realized I was missing something from the life's stories of these intriguing characters: it was like intruding in someone else's life, more than a pi standard TV-movie... That's it: I believe you're hooked by the believable interaction of the main characters, their likes and dislikes; some episodes are quite 'poor' and unbelievable, but never awful; other episodes are more complex and well shot; but almost always you'll have some fun with them; and finally Magnum's off screen voice is capturing your attention, and make you another close friend worth of his confidence... After so many years, one day I just missed that feeling and I discovered the two first seasons were published on DVD, so now, after watching them, I feel reassured of not being a 'stranger' in Magnum's world anymore....
I actually happened into the first airing of the pilot episode by pure chance of changing the channels.
The first show introduces Hillerman & Sellecks characters & the motivation behind the feud they always have during the series run.
I admit it: I didn't watch this show when it first aired.
Magnum is, as his name suggests, the kind of guy who shoots first and asks questions later.
Magnum is first and foremost, Fun.
Tom Selleck and cast are utterly delightful, and I think this show is quite underrated, because when you take away the car chases there are still first and foremost good story lines and good writing.
It was the first two hour episode that introduced Michelle and had a spectacular gunfight at the end on the streets of Little Saigon.
Sometimes the stories were weak (too often, especially in the 2nd season), and the acting hokey, and in the first season the production values were laughable.
The original argument relates the history of a young person, Luisa Karlstein, that visits its aunt in the deathbed, which between death moans reveals to the young person the curse of the family: the first count was a vampire.
When Luisa arrives, her grandmother tells her of the curse that has haunted the family for generations, revealing that the first Baron Karlstein was a vampire, and gives her the key to the chapel.
I first started watching Jess Franco movies because I noticed on the IMDb lists that Klaus Kinski was in many of them.
The first 10 minutes of the movie seems awkward, but the story gets better.
Unfortunately, we didn't hear about the film until Monday, so we missed the first part, and can't wait to get our own copy so we can see part one to see if his shirt made it into the film (would have been the beginning we guess!)
STELLAR lineup of first nations talent, AWESOME animation, FASTIDIOUS attention to detail on part of the Director, truly FINE content which speaks from the HEART of all first nations peoples.
I couldn't agree more with the comments of the first reviewer.
It's stupid just to worry about how much money something is going to make without at least giving it a chance first.
This blockbuster flick kept in a cold sweat from the first moment the bees made their swarmy appearance, I am shocked that this movie was inexplicably panned at the 2002 Oscars?!?!
Who in Gods name does this sort of atrocity happen in Hollywood in the 21st Century....this movie needs to "Bee" re-released toot sweet perhaps now the so called insiders will be able to appreciate just what they missed the first time out.
If you see this movie on you TV listings, I urge you to drop everything and anything you are doing to make time for this entertainment roller coaster, be it the Superbowl or birth of your first child... you wont be disappointed!!!
The latter premise is nonsense because our films don't make big Hollywood money whilst the first premise is self-evident by your logic.
Seeing as it is her first movie as suppose to her previous short films, the film can be classified under the 'Beginner's' guide to film-making.
I think this was the first time Mark Mothersbaugh(of Devo) didn't do the music, and it kinda shows, it all sounded like Anderson's ipod left to shuffle (i almost thought this was gonna be a theme of the film, but it was just a passing in-joke), the music highlighted where emotion was happening on screen, but didn't really give me any sense of "what emotions" we were supposed to be experiencing(save for the i-pod scene already mentioned), it all just felt kinda vague like someone left the radio on in the other room.
The final scene reprises the first: the brothers just miss the departing Darjeeling Limited and must jump on board just as the train pulls out of the station.
The first thing to note about Wes Anderson's new film (featuring Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzman, and Adrien Brody, as the Whitman brothers, Francis, Jack, and Peter respectively) is that it was shot in India, mostly on a colorful old train traveling across Rajasthan.
If i had a De Lorean, i'd hit 88mph, go back to the point when i first decided that i wanted to watch this atrocity and say to myself "don't do it, trust me, i'm you from the future and i've seen it".
I am a fan of Wes Anderson, even though his movies generally leave me with a feeling of numbness on first viewing, and a sense of uncertainty as to whether or not I thought the film was any good from a plot and character standpoint.
We paid a princely sum for our tickets - $35 and that wasn't for the first row!
It is only a few years ago that it was first shown in Israel...a sign that in some countries of the world you are not as free as in others.
In my humble opinion, a film first and foremost should be intelligent in what it tries to tell.
At first I thought I could follow it until it neared the end.
This was the first time so far Troma let me down this much.
So, if you look into the movie, you may think it's better than the first glance.
At first, it looks like a basic college movie, with basketball, girlfriends and relationships front and center.
[This was the] "first time I thought editing could be a fun part of the whole process," he remarked after the screening, and it shows.
Sarah Michelle Gellar was Toback's first choice to play Cindy Bandollini and despite her heavy schedule and limited time she could spend on making the film because of 'Buffy' I think she did really well.
The acting in the first half of the movie is miserable.
What does save this movie is the first ninety percent of it.
The first hands him a machine gun and suggests (in a more overt fashion than, but still in the mood of, Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None) that he kill himself to spare him the agony of being viciously ripped apart.
The second tells him not to trust the first because, if the priest kills himself, he will go to hell; suggesting- is an eternity of suffering in the afterlife worth sparing him a few minutes of agony in his current life?
Dracula's plot and motivations as a villain are nonsensical, as he turns from this God hating hedonist that we had become familiar with in the first movie (and was not contradicted during his non-role in the sequel) into some Dr. Doom-ish would be conquerer of Romania.
In the first film, it was revealed that Dracula was Judas cursed with undeath, unable to bear the light of the sun.
The second movie totally ignored the end of the first one, and wrote out the entire human cast.
The first movie, although it did contain some really bad and ridiculous elements, still was pretty entertaining imo.
I thought he was spoofing it at first like Nielson in Dracula: Dead and Loving It.
The first was Van Helsing themed and then they made up another character, Father Uffizi.
Which reminds me, the first vampire woman you see in the movie.
I don't think it will win over any new fans, as the storyline needs to be followed from the first part to truly understand everything that is happening.
I saw the first one and liked the whole storyline but it was poorly executed.
But the second Dracula made no sense with the first one....so I didn't really like that one.
The character of Julie really bugged me at first.
I had reservations about Rutger Hauer playing Dracula simply because the actors used to portray the previous Draculas in the first two movies were hip and hot.
For a man that flies first class on his trips, America has worked out nice for him.
After the first 15 minutes you'll see why this film is free.
I thought by the title and the cover that it would be a little scaring and funny but...  Come on, the first 30 minutes are so boring!!!!
I first saw this movie on late night TV and was captured by the really funny lines and characters...all of them.
I first saw the film in NYC as a sneak preview before 2001 Space Odyssey.
One of many priceless snatches of dialogue -- PANDORA (ecstatic) Mother, last night I had my first orgasm.
I also like the head nurse, because although she wasn't thrilled about him at first, she grew to care for him a great deal, a must see movie.
After the first victim is killed while seated at the table the rest of the guests flee for their lives in a spontaneous and morbid game of hide-and-seek.
Treeves' first view of the elephant man is in a private showing by Bytes.
I was 10 years old (now 26) and this film was the first gore horror i laid my eyes on and it's mentally scared me in a way.
Even though, since... i've seen hundreds of gory films, but this one is still implanted in my head, possibly because it was my first.
I just watched this movie last night and i must say... it touched me in a way no other movie has... some of the scenes even brought me to tears, which has never happened to me before.... John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins are simple incredible, and this movie is just filled with unforgettable scenes....  but like some people have mentioned here before, it is an incredibly hard movie to watch, especially after you realize what a sweet, kind, smart and innocent man John Merrick was, it is often painful to watch the way he's treated by some people, and like Hopkins says after he sees him for the first time "I pray to god that he's an idiot", sadly, he is everything but that...  10/10, no question
I felt at first pity for John Merrick, but then my feelings changed to admiration, as the film went on.
Thus opens the film and sets the stage for the story of Valdez, the constable, who after killing the innocent man tries to set up a collection for his woman and runs into violent reaction from the wealthy, racist white rancher who wanted the man killed in the first place, and who runs roughshod over his own men, the Mexicans who hired out to him.
The black man, the Native American woman, the Mexicans, the Anglos, and then the rancher's not so faithful mistress, give this movie a lot of great subplots to think about, but the central story of Valdez first asking and then demanding money for the dead man's woman is simple yet effective as it draws out into chases and ambushes while revealing the characters for who they really are.
The first 30 minutes are rather tame in the gore-department, but still amusing because of the hilariously inept acting and crazy character drawings.
'Valdez is Coming' was the first, then 'The Lawman' (which i have not seen) and of course the mighty 'Ulzana's Raid'.
At first, this made me groan, but after a short time I realized that he did a pretty good job with the accent and there are many light-skinned Mexicans, so it wasn't too hard to believe this.
He uses Burt Lancaster, the title character, judiciously at first, having him enter inconspicuously and a little awkwardly, like a man who knows he is out of place.
When challenged to get the first $100.00 from Mr. Tanner (Jon Cypher) the rich landowner, the task become an impossible quest as Tanner has no intention of giving Valdez anything, but contempt, torture and pain.
This film reminded me somewhat of Charles Bronson's first big box office hit, "Chato's Land".
I usually avoid Westerns like the plague, but the pedigree on this film (debut of theater director Sherin, starring Lancaster, Cypher, & Clark and featuring Jordan & Elizondo in their first movie roles) kept me interested til the, well, offbeat ending.
I watched it the first time in the cinema and the following 5 or more times on DVD.
I was skeptical at first but the plot drew me in and held me until the end.
I watched it for the first time a few days ago and I must say, my breath was taken away by it.
Director Emmanuel Kervyn spends the first thirty minutes introducing us to his raft of absurdly unlikeable characters (none of whom really deserve to survive 'til the end credits), and the next sixty dismembering them in as many inventive and silly ways as possible.
Caviezel's character cried when he first talked to his father that had been dead for thirty years.
When I first rented the movie, I had never seen the trailer.
When I first saw the preview for Frequency, I thought that the idea of a son talking to a his deceased father over a radio was original and interesting.
at first i didn't think this movie would be very good.
I watched it for the first time the other night and it has jumped right to my "Top 10" movies of all time.
The plot of the film involves a sports salesman named Lenny (played by Charles Grodin, in arguably his finest performance) who rushes into marriage to the first girl he meets in a singles bar.
On the newlyweds first day in Miami, Lenny's wife, Lila, ignores his plights for her to put on some sunscreen.
I saw this when it first came out in 1972 and saw it again recently on cable.
It seems everyone loved this movie; I will offer the first dissenting opinion here.
Sure, the road-trip to Miami, during which Lenny all-too-quickly grew to hate his bride (one wonders how he ever chose to marry her in the first place), was hardly ideal.
I prefer watching it first, but if you want more mystery in the other films, watch them in their release order: Ringu, Ringu 2, then Ringu 0.
But those are overly generous comparisons, since at least the first hour of Ring 0 has little of the suspense, style or directorial panache of either.
We finally unravel much of the mystery behind Sadako (although there are a lot of questions that could still be answered), and gain insight into some of the events and comments in the first two-thirds of the film, which otherwise can seem cryptic (it pays to rewatch the first hour after the film is over--I enjoyed it more the second time).
Yeah, it wasn't the best, and for a first effort action movie a little light on the action.
For the first ten minutes I was trying to decide whether this film had been made by some kind of movie school in the UK or not, but to my growing joy I was proved wrong.
The funny thing is that these same reviewers are the first ones to lament about the dearth of fresh ideas found in modern cinema.
The first two thirds seem a bit aimless, like Mean Streets down under, just a tale of four thugs who seem to have an appointment to keep in the afternoon, and manage to keep it, in spite of the befuddled police they have to deal with in New Zealand.
As always it is the complainers that are the first to comment.
When I first heard about this film, I didn't have terribly high expectations.
Betsy Morris shines in her first script.
Admittedly the reason that I first decided to see Ten Inch Hero was for Jensen Ackles (Priestly) who I must say did not disappoint, the young actor has wonderful comedic timing.
The biggest compliment that I can think to give is that the movie captivated me from the first frame through the last and that it delivered exactly what I had hoped it would (with a few surprises along the way).
There is so much more I could say, but I have refrained from even telling my friends the details because this is a movie best watched unspoiled for the first time.
The premise sounds simple, but like all heart related matters it's more complicated than it first appears.
In my opinion, the same statement could have been made with a closer framed head-and-shoulders shot, at least for the first half of the scene.
If you want to see it yourself, then just check the first few pages of the comment history in chronological order.
Except a few honest comments, more than the first 30 comments in a row have "10 star" reviews over-enthusiastically praising this movie.
first by the movie i had to force myself thru right now, as well as by the amazingly high rating it got on IMDb.
The first time we meet Priestly his entrance it so dynamic and fun you can't help but fall in love with the guy.
Piper, the first person we meet, glides into view on a bicycle that reveals a great deal about her character.
The first act draws the viewer into a comedic whirlwind of wishful longing, then as the story spins into act two, the ax is dropped and the drama begins.
The dialog was fresh and edgy, and it was the first film that I have seen in a while that felt like it was written and directed by real people, and not vetted by a series of industry drones.
My husband, actually, had wanted to see this film which could be, at first glance, dismissed as a "chick flick".
The script by first time screenwriter Betsy Morris is refreshingly realistic; it is not overly dramatic or contrived.
The storyline is made up of two subtly intertwining narrative layers that make the movie as a whole hard to grasp at the first look, but thoroughly convincing as an independent character study at last.
However, this movie so profoundly moved me that I wrote a commentary on a note card and placed it inside the "Leo" DVD box the first time I saw the movie three years ago.
For a first time director to helm a cast of extremely talented actors, he's created a drama just short of a masterpiece.
However, I would much rather see a first time director tackle a project with the complexity and ambition of "Leo" than to have them make yet another pseudo wry, post modern, Tarantino imitation, or, worse, a boring, routine slasher film.
Robert Altman made industrial films before his first, undistinguished feature, which starred future "Billy Jack," Tom McLoughlin.
There are only so many Orson Welles types who spring forth a genius in their first effort.
He's just about to enjoy his first sip of a Paradise Cocktail when he spills most of it -- after being bumped by Kay Francis, who smiles brightly despite having an incurable disease.
Must have been 16 years ago since I saw this movie for the very first time, as a kid just 10 years old.
There are even Cameo's of the Stiller's ( Ben (in one of his first movies), his father Jerry and his sister ).
It seems strange at first, but think it through.
The crossed, broken cocktail glass image, at first seen quite early on in the movie, makes me question why IMDb Comments posters are saying this is movie has an unhappy ending (that's not a spoiler, is it?)
This was the first Fellini film that I saw back in 1974 or so.
You know how the thing is going to end in the first five min.
There is no doubt that there are many subtle points to be made, but it may not at first be clear what they are.
Petronius' Satyricon, the inspiration for Fellini's masterful, albeit non-linear, eponymous film, has a good claim on being the first novel ever written.
I first learned of the film while studying Latin and therefore was aware of the fractured nature of the original work and was prepared for the same in the movie, and while some of the action is provocative a fair amount of screen time is just, well, rather dull--its hard to follow and has no translation to modern times or sentiments, still through all the meandering there are moments--moments that are visually stunning, inspire awe, and feel like nothing from this world.
You know how the thing is going to end in the first five min.
There is no doubt that there are many subtle points to be made, but it may not at first be clear what they are.
In the first few centuries of our age, the roman world was in decay.
Obviously the movie is at first a gross-out masterpiece, a flaunting of Fellini grotesqueries, where there is boy-loving and boy-selling, decapitations, and farting.
Just a warning though; it is slow paced, even more so than Ringu, a complaint many people seem to have with these movies, and the first time i watched it i wasn't sure if it was leading anywhere.
Sadako Yamamura is part of an acting school, and her first role is a few days away.
Terrifying, and directed brilliantly- watch for the way the forest suddenly changes colour from green and full of life, to that Sepia tinge used in the first films to show both the past and the afterlife.
One of the most underrated horror movies of recent years, mainly because it can seem confusing at first glance, and because very few questions are actually answered.
I saw it for the first time when it came out in 69, when I was 16.
From trawling on the internet, I've discovered that there were 5 series of playing the field, of which I've seen the first 4.
It doesn't make any sense to me to release the first four series and not the fifth - someone please take note!!
My brother and I have been watching and re-watching Twilight Zones since they first an live back in the early 60's.
I don't remember exactly my age when I watched it for the first time(I think I was 11) but since the time I watched for the first time until now I cannot be tired of the story!
And his first love and his being seduced by an elegant and sophisticated married lady(played gracefully by Tilda Swinton).
The movie traces the life of the main character Benjamin Button born as an 80 year old and growing younger every year and his life's intersection with Miss Daisy first seen as a young lass who recalls the story in flashback form as a dying elderly invalid.
One should try to stay awake for the first hour.
The first hour of the film holds up quite well to the high standards set by Zodiac.
The premise of the film is so provocative, that I had real hope after the first hour that we were going into uncharted narrative waters.
After being thoroughly excited to see this film ever since I first caught wind of it, I left the theatre in a state of bewilderment.
It is perhaps the first time since Andy Serkis' rendition of Gollum in The Lord of the Rings, that great acting has eclipsed terrific special effects.
I think the first two-thirds of the movie is the best.
Good cast, too, with Patric Bergin being perfectly enigmatic in the first half, perfectly imposing in the second.
It misses something very, very, important: why they fell in love in the first place.
You can also tell why they had the affair in the first place: they wanted to find out to what it was like to be in love, or in the girls case: Benjamin's strange affliction.
Other performances are notable as well, such as Taraji P. Henson's as Benjamin's mother, and Tilda Swinton's as Benjamin's first lover.
She is first held up by a friend with a broken shoe lace.
The first half was not bad.
If i had to pick someone to bring this story to the screen I do no think David Fincher would have been my first choice.
When I first heard about this movie, I had to wonder...how was Fincher, the guy responsible for realistic, gripping, crime thrillers like Seven and Zodiac going to pull off the fantasy film of a lifetime?
We keep looking for some in this poorly-done piece of crap and are more disappointed than the first audience that saw "Plan 9 From Outer Space."
That's what comes to mind at first, and a few times throughout the movie, and truthfully, he just does not pull it off.
This is his first film (and I think only one) playing a totally amoral criminal.
23rd April 1992, the first day of my long awaited holiday to Hong Kong.
The bed won the arguement this time, but I'm glad that this was the first movie I ever saw in a Hong Kong cinema, it was everything I expected and more.
Definitely one of the true 'must see' films of the nineties, not only because it was the first to fully establish John Woo as the master of action movies and Chow Yun Fat as a superstar, but because it has had a massive influence on every action movie made since, and is easily one of, if not the best action movies ever.
Tony Leung's first meeting with arms dealer Johnny (Anthony Wong) is exceptionally well staged and scored (by Michael Gibbs), as is an earlier scene where Leung meets the older arms dealer who has become a surrogate father to him and his colleagues.
If "Hard-Boiled" had continued along the same stylistic and thematic lines as its first eighty minutes, I'd probably like it as much as "Bullet in the Head", but, for mine, it sits just below "The Killer" and above the more obscure "Just Heroes".
Hard Boiled is given the name Most Violent Movie by many critics, when it first released.
Hard Boiled was the first Hong-Kong-movie that I saw.
When someone mentions, "action movie", the first thing that gets in their minds is guns, fighting, blood, and so on.
There are two very important approaches in this film: the first, of course, is president Kennedy being shot some years later.
When the lead actress in the play dies, killed by a younger Sadako (who is more like the ghoul from the first two films - it's confusing, but things are explained later), Sadako is given her role, much to the distress and suspicion of her fellow actors.
At first it is slightly confusing as you are not sure whether you are watching the Sadako that will turn into the deformed, freakish ghoul that crawls out of TV screens to scare people to death.
The acting is first rate, especially from Yukie Nakama who gives a subtle performance as Sadako, and everyone else is on form.
But what it lacks is the pure, raw fear of the original that made it so memorable, and it wouldn't work without seeing the original first.
Better and scarier than 2, quite possibly on a par with the first.
Hard Boiled was my first John Woo movie and, in my opinion, his best.
Ragnar Tornquist's script, though, is hugely ambitious, and mostly successful; it has a superb premise - essentially a pair of worlds, one futuristic, the other a place of post-Tolkeinish fantasy, and with a heroine (April Ryan) who finds herself shifting, at first unwillingly, between the two.
That said, this game was one of my most memorable gaming experiences, right up there with the first time I played Zork, Myst, and Half Life.
The first 30 minutes of this Buster Keaton film are some of the stupidest he ever made, at least from what I've seen.
The training - and the first real laugh of the film - isn't until 47-minute mark when Buster begins training and can't get over the ropes.
I notice through the evolution of Keaton's movies that he did more and more acting and less and less physical comedy, with the exception of course of The Saphead, which was his first feature-length that was mostly drama-based, not slapstick-based.
Still it's worth seeing the film for the first sequence.
In "The General", we engage with Johnnie Gray almost immediately -- in "Battling Butler", Alfred remained a cipher for me until the moment when he nervously rehearses "Beatrice Faircatch"'s newspaper advice on making a proposal, with such an earnest air: it's funny, but it's also touching, and it's no coincidence that it is with his subsequent first steps towards standing on his own two feet -- tearing up and throwing aside the useless newspaper column -- that Alfred Butler may finally be said to have progressed beyond a simple one-dimensional character, and the film can really begin.
For the first half of the movie he looks like a 1920s fashion plate, exquisitely groomed, demonstrating What the Well-Dressed Man Will Wear for hunting, fishing, etc.
Still, I prefer the first half of the movie, with its gentle pace, low-key jokes and elegant touches.
This is where the clichÃ©s come from, they were the first people to do these things... And that is what you have to remember when watching this film, it is truly a snapshot in to the creation of rock and roll.
When he can't persuade a woman with whom he had an affair a year previously to come with him on his trip, he takes in her place an American woman (played by Hawn) who happens to be staying with the first woman.
Harvey Keitel, in his first role, is very good as a man who falls into a doomed relationship with a girl he meets on the Long Island Ferry.
The film has a typical Italian-American guy named JR (Harvey Keitel, also his first film along with Scorsese's) who falls in love with a nice girl (Zina Bethune), and the film shows they're relationship, while JR hangs with his friends, contemplating his life.
Keitel is just stunning in his first film, clearly this is the work of a great talent.
The greatness is apparent right out of the gate with his very first feature film; all the classic Scorsese elements are already firmly in place, even if the film is not quite as compelling as later works.
Similarly, Harvey Keitel delivers powerfully in his first collaboration with Scorsese, but the plot and dramatic impact of the script were just not quite up to snuff yet.
Speaking to Sheriff Tod Shaw (Sterling Hayden) about the momentous nature of his intent, Johnny declares - "...the first man they shoot to the moon in a rocket will take pains too, it's just never been done before".
It's his first film, but his emotional range was already astounding.
One of the more interesting bits in the book was the topic of Scorsese's first film, "Who's That Knocking At My Door?
For example, the scene in which J.R. and The Girl first meet on the ferry is nearly done in one take, with only two or three cuts (an effective overheard shot as Keitel changes positions being the best) while the camera pans back and forth as they have their conversation on the films of John Wayne, French magazines and language, and so forth.
The first scene where Keitel meets Bethune on the ferry has got to be one of the most imaginatively-shot and enthrallingly staged boy-meets-girl moments on celluloid.
In fact, Keitel was there from the very beginning, playing the lead in Marty's first feature, Who's That Knocking at My Door.
The promise in crafting an independent feature film in America were richly and passionately exemplified by Who's That Knocking at My Door?, the very first feature directed by great Martin Scorsese.
Scorsese would move on to make Mean Streets, Raging Bull, The King of Comedy, GoodFellas, and several other movies that double, triple and demolish the impact this first work, completed with greatly impatient urgency when he was 25, but as with most independent debuts, nearly all of which overstep the bounds of self-indulgence anyway, which has yet to prove a problem for Scorsese, one must be objective with its flaws and not water down its lack of guile.
at first she works at a shoe store but then meets two girls that convince her to work in a strip bar and whiles there she has to deal with overzealous customers and lesbian co-worker that wants to perform the baby making process with her.
In 1998, he got his chance to direct his movie; his first and only up to date.
I don't know what exactly the message Lee wanted to give was, I don't know what was going through his mind at the time, just as I didn't know what was Ice Cube thinking, so he could end up showing "The players club" in flames during the first frames of his movie.
Carolyn was my first crush as a kid!
After the first half I gave up and fast-forwarded to the unsatisfying conclusion.
A correspondent suggested that PURSUED might be the first western "film noir".
It surely is a "film noir" right enough, first or not.
The film grabs your attention and jumps headfirst into a pool of excitement within the first few minutes - what follows is an interesting and enjoyable story that takes plenty of jaw opening twists and turns throughout the film.
That is the complex characterization of the first half of the movie.
Jack Warner tested and rejected first Montgomery Clift yet to make his screen debut and Kirk Douglas according to Lee Server's biography.
She's first billed in this picture even though the film is really about Mitchum.
Upon learning that there was indeed a survivor, the killers set about erasing Jeb from the planet, thus Jeb spends all his life trying to find out what the hell is going on, and just why did his adoptive mother raise him in the first place?
The first thing you have to accept in PURSUED is that the hero, Jeb Rand (Robert Mitchum), has been scarred all his life by a traumatic childhood experience of violence that he can't clearly recall.
PURSUED was Mitchum's first lead in an A picture, and he not only makes the most of it, it makes the most of him.
In the first scene he rises out of the shadows in a ruined stone house, his ruffled white shirt torn, long hair mussed, eyes dreamily haunted.
PURSUED was also the first film to fully express Mitchum's persona as the eternal outsider, the man fundamentally alone and unable to fit into any community.
If you plan on watching the series for the first time, you might want to start with any episode from the season 6 through season 8 range.
Patrick Stewart, Picard of Star Trek fame, once commented about seeing Red Dwarf for the first time and wanting to sue Red Dwarf for ripping off Star Trek.
I cant remember if I watched 5 or 6 seasons,but I do remember that I thought the series was very funny for a while,but then it became a little more confusing and darker (I liked the first computer best),I don't know if its just me but I felt it was almost depressing watching the later seasons.
Series II: This series had more jokes than the original and expanded the series with most of the episodes being away from the mother ship as all Episodes from I were set aboard 'Red Dwarf' and the first mini ship was introduced: 'Blue Midget'.
On a personal note, my eldest daughter was 9 years old when she first saw Lister teaching Kryten to call Rimmer a smeghead, and she laughed herself silly.
Later on, in series 2, the crew come across an android, 'Kryten' - 'Robert Llewellyn' (originally played by 'David Ross' in the first episode titled, Kryten).
So please try to see this movie, its well worth it, almost as good as the first Ringu!
Craig Charles, when you think about it, was brilliant in the first six series.
***VERY MINOR SPOILERS***  At first glance, this show is a campy, cheesy, low-budget, poorly-acted Britcom.
The first two seasons play out like a standard sitcom, with most scenes being filmed in just a couple of locations on Red Dwarf itself.
It stops being a bunch of geeks and losers romping aimlessly around the universe; Kochanski is smart and gives the show direction, while the writers seem to be trying to fit a storyline to the randomness of the first 5 seasons.
Bottom line: Don't judge the show on the first two seasons alone.
From the first episode, to the last.
I was hopeful after the first episode as that was quite good although still a little overdone with that annoying cinema effect they used but then in the next few episodes, Rimmer left and they brought Kochanski into the show.
That said, the first six series are BRILLIANT
I watched the first episode for two reasons; firstly, it was the work of Rob Grant and Doug Naylor, writers I knew from their work on 'Carrott's Lib' and 'Spitting Image', and secondly, it combined two life-long interests of mine - comedy and science fiction.
There's also a talking computer called 'Holly', played first by Norman Lovett and then Hattie Hayridge.
I was a bit hesitant about renting out "Red Dwarf" the first time one of my friends recommended it too me but I got it out anyway because I always like finding a new fantastic show, and this was definitely all that and more.
The character's in the show are a great example of how character interaction alone can make a show 100 times better, and in this we see such a wide range of character's, lead and co starring that make this show great on its own even without all the other dimensions (This was, as I said earlier most of what the first 2 or 3 seasons were like).
The performances are brilliant, and considering when Craig Charles joined the crew it was his first acting job, that's not to be underestimated.
I need it to turn my lights on and off... "  I'm torn between whether I prefer on the whole the stark, bleak and basic environment of the first two series, or the polished, more modern look of series 5 and 6.
Rob Grant and Doug Naylor (thus the nom de plume: Grant Naylor) wrote the first 6 series and then split up.
The first 6 series are just such a wonderful pleasure that I felt I knew them.
That's what many people originally thought about the comedy classic Red Dwarf when the idea was first brought up in the mid 80's.
The first half of movie was fine, but the subtitle starts to appear about 5 seconds later than the actual dialog.
The detective did not take a heart shaped box the first time he searched the house.
How did the detective know about this box the second time, and if he already knew about it, why didn't he take it the first time?
Lois Moran, as Stella's daughter is adorable, and Douglas Fairbanks Jr., in his first real role, is excellent.
The first film version of the Olive Higgins Prouty best seller.
I was unfamiliar with the story of Stella Dallas, so when I first sat down and began to watch the 1925 version, I was expecting a simple, and light hearted silent; 'a fun way to spend an hour, but will soon be forgotten', type of film.
The made for TV movie "Visitors of the Night" explores the modern day phenomena of alien abductions that has, since the first reported case back in 1961 involving Betty and Barney Hill, gone from dime store novel material to being taken seriously by millions of Americans as well as tens of millions of people all over he world.
Hard to follow at first with a lot of sub-plots that it really could do without but when "Visitors of the Night" gets to the core or "Heart and Soul" of it's story it's very hard not to keep your tear-ducts from filling up and then spilling over.
Second, Outlander is an action movie first and everything else second.
This was the first time I saw that movie, but I'll comment while the good impression still there.
Again, this s just the first impression but like I said, I was not expecting the best picture, just a few action, a few drama and how to spend my time.
H.McCain is a first time director to be watched closely!
The main character at first, posing with a futuristic plastic-like toy in a ridicules way made me snicker, but only shortly as the whole took me comfortably through the most.
At first I thought aliens in prehistoric times; this is going to be one hell of a non-sense.
When my friend brought this over and described it to me my first reaction was "What the hell!?
You'll get that message in the first five minutes, and every few minutes all the way to the unsurprising end.
(I laughed my head off, when the first word he utters in Earth language is the "F" word :D) Wandering around in a forest, he is found by Wulfric (Jack Huston) and brought back to his village.
The basic plot is quite sound and for the first 40 minutes the movie is VERY gripping.
As for this film I can only recommend its first hour, which is its best.
The first hour of this film does an excellent job of showing the problems these early explorers faced and how something so promising could turn so bad.
This film's first hour does surpass all of "Aguirre: The Wrath of God" (1972) but loses something when it turns into a Conquistador "Apocalypse Now" (1979).
Cabeza de Vaca's few traveling companions, most notably the Moor Estebanico, helped fuel rumors of the Seven Cities of CÃ­bola, which led directly to the 1540 Coronado expedition and the first Spanish encounters with the Pueblo Indians of the Rio Grande Valley of New Mexico.
The movie suggests the shipwreck was in Florida, but that was actually the journey's first bloody stopping point.
Among the omissions: Gleason's film work (all the way back to the '40s and on to the year before his death), his first TV sitcom ("The Life Of Riley" was a 1949-50 Emmy winner!)
The first Zenon was novel and cute, and had meaningful plot line with quirky characters and a happy, Disney ending.
When we first really get a glimpse of the character, he turns out to be an enemy of Zenon, and you begin to think that maybe there's some kind of hidden alliance between him and the real villain.
I am a big fan of the first movie - "Zenon girl of the 21-st century", and after watching the first sequel I thought to myself that they ruined the whole story and the illusion, I saw this movie because there was nothing else to see on TV, and I'm glad I did, because this movie brought back my admiration to this story.
She had the "popping and bounce" as the Zenon in the first movie.
She did a great job for her first performance!
The first shot establishes the state-of-the-art in trains -- one that would look modern even by today's standards.
first of all, mtv is full if hypocrites.
I Just watched this last night for the first and last time.
Incidentally, I know first-hand about its 'banning' from the U.S. following a lawsuit by Universal for plagiarizing the first two entries in the JAWS series Â having heard director Castellari boasting about the fact (even going so far as to contend that the real reason behind the film being pulled from theaters was that its profit ratio exceeded that originally made by Universal) at a press conference during the 2004 Venice Film Festival!
Given a lean 88-minute running-time, it's no surprise the plot is so thin and obvious (virtually recreating all the highlights from the first two Universal shark flicks Â however, while characterization was a strong element, in JAWS at least, the scriptwriters here lazily resort to mere stereotypes).
Worse, the film repeats a good many of its incidents and effects twice or more: the idiotic 'explosion' when the shark attacks from below; the heroine Â played by the director's own lovely daughter Â falling into the sea, where she's not so lucky the second time around; the dives by would-be expert shark-fighter Vic Morrow Â complete with heavy Irish brogue a' la Robert Shaw's Quint from the first JAWS Â to destroy the creature both fail miserably, the second time getting tangled up in ropes and being dragged Ahab-like by the shark; characters get bitten in halfÂto say nothing of the ultra-fake blue-eyed[!]
Steven Spielberg's first great film Jaws (1975) was a film that was destined to be ripped-off, parodied, and referenced in horror films for ages to come.
But believe it or not, during the first half-hour of the film, I was getting the impression that I was going to enjoy it and might even forgive it for its plagiarism.
Some copies of this film are very dark too, which would hamper viewing (although the first version I watched, on Italian television, was as clear as anything).
The story is structured exactly the same as "Jaws", with the first half revolving on the introduction of a tourist beach communion where local politicians rather risk peoples' lives than cancel the popular annual surf contest.
One of the first things I did was order a copy of Preminger's Laura from Amazon to re-examine the detailed references.
Singapore Sling was one of my very first forays into the world of underground and/or extreme cinema.
My first is that the movie could have been a bit shorter.
You have to wait until the film's perplexing climax to witness the first and only bit of unsettling bloodshed and I found this to be a little too long.
I enjoyed all the episodes, but I must say the first ones, were the best.
And I love the character of Carrie Fairchild, maybe because she was like the first Fallon (Pamela Sue Martin) Carrington my favorite Dynasty character: a spoiled rich girl, intelligent, cunning and ambitious to get what she wanted.
The group of hippies that rape the girls first are an amazingly sleazy bunch.
I still have a special place in my heart for that very first Final Fantasy game to ever hit the world of Nintendo (once THE hottest game system around).
While the very first adventure in the Final Fantasy universe is far from the best of the games, it does manage to be a fine addition to the lineup and is far from the worst.
The elements that fans have come to expect from an FF game are all here to be seen, although they are in an infancy stage since this is the first game.
For the first hour or so, I was hoping it would get better.
Let me first say that this film is indeed a work of art - it is lyrical, spiritual and visually intriguing.
This first part of the film (for it can roughly be divided into three parts) plays much like a family drama with some small comic moments.
I first saw 'A Touch of Zen' in the late 70s; it had such an effect on me that I looked for it on video for years and years, but to no avail - then to my relief it was shown on TV during a martial arts night twenty years later.
It is over three hours long; the first hour is mainly scene-setting and not much happens, but this just adds to the impact.
The first section focuses on the artist Ku, slowly building a picture of a quiet life in a rural backwater.
I am a sucker for a good storyline and here Starcraft delivers wholeheartedly, the manual reads like the first chapter of a bestselling science-fiction novel and throughout the single player there a number of interesting plot twists, I'm a bit bemused that nobody ever bothered to make a Starcraft movie!
Lorenzo's first book told the story of a birthday boy who had made love to a stranger on a full moon night in the ocean.
The book that conceived Luna also made Lucia fall in love with Lorenzo, the shot of their first union cuts into Luna's birth, they both dropped into a hole together, and at the end, when Elena tells Lucia that she is a gift to the earth, she looks as happy as she would if she got back her lost child.
I first played StarCraft at another friend's house, from 1 a.m. to 3 a.m. in the morning.
I first got hooked on StarCraft from my friend.
So when I went to watch it for the first 10 minutes I began to get a little discouraged.
Like I don't particularly like it in horror films(with some exceptions) where for the first 10-15 minutes they immediately introduce the main characters and try WAY to hard for them to automatically be likable.
In "Steel Trap" for the first few minutes it unfortunately is that way.
When it went off I must say that I was satisfied, and that it over passed my original judgment from the first 15 minutes.
The first few minutes were somewhat painful.
At first, I thought this would be something of a Saw type of movie, but it is more like a straight forward slasher.
The first time I saw Richards was in the 1997 sci/fi epic "Starship Troopers" and since then she has appeared in "Wild Things", "Drop Dead Gorgeous", and the recent James Bond film "The World Is Not Enough".
The first time I saw Walker was in the 1998 Disney release "Meet the Deedles".
The first 15 minutes of the movie were O.K.
Although he's only in it the first part of the movie, you won't miss much if you just watch his scenes and turn the movie off!!
For the first half of the film, I couldn't believe what I was watching, and I couldn't believe that anyone would make a film like this.
I was at first not convinced by it, but as the film progressed I began to listen to the characters more, meaning the story took on a deeper meaning.
Well, I'll be happy to act like I was the first who discovered this hidden gem in Kurosawa's catalogue.
The story seemed pretty basic after the first 30 minutes, however upon the 45th minute passing I realized I was wrong.
Thankfully, HELLEVATOR is a very accessible, very watchable science fiction flick that is not trying to answer the meaning of life, just deliver 90 minutes of first class entertainment.
The movie is OK up until the last third which is just a redundant and long-winded exposition of the first 2/3 of the movie.
For example, as far as (2) goes, the film basically calls the pro-ID camp a bunch of "dodos" in the first 5 minutes.
This Movie is just an entertaining film, an audience preferring a more deep and dense plot should look the GDR production, for which Jurek Becker himself made the screenplay and earned the first and only Oscar nomination an East German film ever got.
I rented the film out the first day it came out for rent and have seen it about 6 times already.
When Jacob(Robin Williams) does that first "Radio broadcast", you feel yourself laugh along with the little girl whom he befriends.
Jakob, first and foremost, is absolutely terrified that word will reach the Nazis who will execute him if they discover he has a radio (whether he really has it or not), yet at the same time he can't let it get out within the ghetto that he DOESN'T have a radio, because since the whole rumor began the rampant suicides have completely ceased.
Whereas many romance flicks rely upon verbal dramatization, Eric Byler's first directed feature subdues the audience with tacit performances.
The first few minutes of the film establish the character of Michael (Michael Idemoto) through only visuals-a montage of his daily routine.
Her eventual slide into the monstrosity of the first and second Ring films is a sight to behold (and, hardcore fans will note, is echoed by a similar fall of Ando Mitsuo in the less popular Rasen).
Whereas the first two films are more exercises in combining psychological terror with techno-horror, Ring 0 takes a more Romero-esque approach to the social aspect of Sadako's transformation, meditating on the cruelty of her peers and the burning need for revenge of one journalist that brings the whole tragedy crashing down.
Films like this are the reason we turn away from the studio driven multiplex features in the first place.
The first 15 minutes of the movie are interesting if unremarkable.
To put up a first feature that is not plot driven or is not a formulaic comedy looking for easy adulation definitely took guts on the director/writer's part.
I haven't read the other reviews but seeing that the average was 2.2 when I first brought the rating up was kind of shocking.
I was not sure why I liked the movie at first: the dialogue is simplistic, there is no real plot to speak of, and there are no special effects (which I have really come to detest in movies anyway).
I caught this on IFC awhile ago, and I was rather hooked (the main reason at first was the title---The Cure is the best ^^).
Films like this are the reason we turn away from the studio driven multiplex features in the first place.
The first 15 minutes of the movie are interesting if unremarkable.
Darcy is a smoldering mystery who believes that sex at first sight is a great way for two people to get to know each other.
"Charlotte Sometimes" may not be for everyone (NFE), but it's definitely a formidable mature feature film first from w-d, co-editor, and co-producer, Eric Byler.
You can tell from the first moments of "The Smokers."
If it is their first credit you know the picture will be horrible.
The sex is much stronger and important in the first part of the film.
At first, I assumed that the movie would be a dark-comedy satire -- which might have worked -- but instead it was a straight-up drama that will head directly to the Camp section of your local all-night video rental.
I don't know, since I couldn't follow for longer than the first couple of minutes.
The first hour is spent not knowing a lot at a very high speed, and the rest of the film has too many slow spots where the background and the plot is revealed only by dialog, breaking the tempo and flow down to a very low pace.
Well, they get into a slap fight with their first customers, then decide to try selling mousetraps to the local cheese factory.
The next day, the boys go to see Anna as per her invitation, but first have to elude the angry chef.
Simply put, the duo are looking rather old and ragged and the jokes that worked well the first few times look a bit stale here.
I think this show should be brougth back and make new eps here in the UK as it will bring a new audience of people who missed it the first time.
I hope it keeps playing on the DAVE channel so others who missed it first time round can see it now.
I would also say yes, the very first moment she would come near me.  
The sweet, innocent side of her was never suspected when I first glimpsed the malevolent presence of Sadako in the first installment.
The weird appearance and way of walking from the first "Ring" is seen again here and there's some great bonesnapping moments when Sadako hunts down her final prey.
"Ring 0 : Birthday" maintains the mystery and ambiguity of the first two films and once again, imagination is a required element from the viewer.
When I first watched Pollio's first feature film, HOW IT ALL WENT DOWN, I was blown away with the story, the style and the execution.
I had no idea that the same guy that delivered hardcore grit with his first film would go completely the other way with a glossy and witty SHUT UP AND SHOOT.??
Pollio just skates by as Sonny Westwood and although his character has some fun moments in the film with his singing dancing, Pollio's real acting chops show in his first movie, HOW IT ALL WENT DOWN.
The first 10 minutes consisted of Pryor swearing at some guy taking pictures, followed my even more profanities.
This is where Eddie stole must of his jokes, and most of his style, only one slight difference: Richard Pryor came first, and it's still better than anything Eddie has ever done.
When I first saw this I did not know what to think because I had seen Pryor in several movies, but I had never seen him do his stand-up comedy.
At first I started to crack up because he was insulting this guy taking his picture, which to me when a comedian includes the audience and insults them it really makes the performance a very funny one.
I was in high school when this film was released and must have seen it 5 times the first month it was out.
In my first viewing of this tape -- at home on HBO with my family around 25 years ago (I was twenty-one) -- I was sober and I couldn't stop laughing through the entire tape.
This was the first time a stand-up comedian was filmed doing his act, and most people predicted that it would fail.
When you watch this you can know you're watching the first and the best.
Ranbir kapoor really didn't appear to be acting for the first time.
I intended to watch Saawariya as much as Om Shanti Om and I've already seen OSO on the first day it came out and I loved it.
You feel a bit of a void after it is over - my wife thought it was depressing at first - but once you discuss the characters' motivations and the ending, it all seems justified.
Whilst watching the trailers the first thing that caught my eye was the beautiful sets.
I was really excited about Saawariya when I first heard about it, but then my enthusiasm waned when I saw the promos for OSO.
Saawariya is not your typical dancing around trees romance but a mood piece exploring nostalgia, melodrama, loss, loneliness and love in various forms - first love, obsessive love, physical love, and heartbreak.
Ranbir does do a very good job portraying the complex emotional arc of his character from the "thunderbolt" of love at first sight to unrequited love.
Sonam has a complex many layered role, and she comes through in a more than adequate manner, considering that this is her first movie.
It is truly a concept album, reflecting the various shades of love, from the dizzying heights of first love (Masha Allah, Jab SE Tere), to playful romance (Thode badmaash) ,to intense romance (Yoon shabnami, Jaan-e Jaan) to heartbreak( Daras bina nahin) .The many years spent on perfecting this soundtrack show and how!
About the movie, I think both the new comers (Ranbir Kapoor and Sonam Kapoor) have done a wonderful job in first film.
For their first movie, the lead pair creates lots of magic!
This is the first movie which has impressed me with its looks and cinematography.
Oscar Wilde once said "The first purpose of life is to adopt a pose.
The first Monkey Island Game (the secret of monkey island) was very funny.
The Curse of Monkey Island was one of the best because it was one of the funniest and better graphics than the first two.
I think Guybrush is funnier than in the first three games.
In the end, I took what seemed like the first breath since the opening of the film.
There is a first person account on the website of the capture of a small boy shown in the film.
I first saw this film on the Disney Channel circa 1993.
I was about 7 years old at the time, I remember it was right after Disney Channel had aired "Barcelona '92: 16 Days of Glory", meaning I had Olympics on the brain when I first saw it, a bit of a bias.
I was enthralled by it at first, the whole film had a kind of surreal, mesmerizing quality to it and the music was great as well.
This film should have gotten better treatment when it was first released...
This is a must-see for fans of the first two movies.
However that hardly matters because the real pleasure lies in the smart script, engaging vocal performances and first rate character design.
I first saw ANIMALYMPICS back in the day when HBO was first getting started.
I like it when you can't die too easily, and I like it when you can't ruin the game by forgetting something or doing something wrong the first time.
Also absent was the choice of "light" and "mega" that was present in other games, because playing on lite first for a little while might have been helpful for "getting used" to the game before really going for it.
Our family found it a favorite when it first came out - and now that I am retired I still enjoy having a laugh at it now and then.
Yes, I played the first game and this one.
I can't explain the low ratings, unless people just watched the first 15 or so minutes and didn't watch it all the way through.
I've seen first graders write stuff more clever than this.
If you ever wonder why a feature is released straight to video, rather than to theaters first, look no further for a reason than this wretched mess.
Let me first try to give you some reasons of why you SHOULD see this movie....
i am so pleased i bought this movie at first i thought oh dear lets hope the film is more original then the title and to my surprise it was.
This film, by the way, was included on the first of three disks with the DVD release of "The Jazz Singer"--a marvelous collection of early talkies as well as documentaries.
Al Jolson made cinematic history in 1927, when he sang some songs & ad-libbed a few lines of dialogue, in the motion picture THE JAZZ SINGER - the first feature film with audible dialogue.
I like all the comments that Ihave read praising this wonderful film the tear's just flowed from my eye's when I first saw this beautiful story being so brilliantly portrayed and with such wonderful music of john Denver I still have the sound track of the film MCF 2566 ON VINAL Ilove to sit and listen to the song Sunshine on my shoulders.
I first saw this film in bar full of bikers.
The first time I viewed this version of the Vita Sackville West story I came away moved by the powerful performances, the careful, effective use of language, and the ever present sense of class and propriety that can both stifle a life, and open it to many things.
I now realize it was the first time I ever heard of this terrible thing called cancer.
I now have a stepdaughter the same age I was when I first saw this movie and I only wish she could view it too.
I first saw this movie in 1982 on TV in Scotland, which is where I grew up, and I immediately recognised it as the story of Lyn Helton, which I had read in a magazine at the library.
It's like two different people picked up from where the first book/movie left off!
I saw this movie when it first aired on television many years ago.I was around fourteen years old.My sister was sick with breast cancer,and it made a huge impact on me.I read the book later, after I had seen the movie.This movie was beautifully filmed, and I thought that it stayed close to the original book.The script was very intelligent, and the actors portrayed their roles perfectly.I love the sets.To see the beautiful countryside in some of the scenes was fantastic.The music in this movie was one of the wonderful attributes to the story.I find myself humming the songs all of the time, after all of these years.I found the soundtrack, and I listen to it all of the time.Cliff De Young, Christina Raines,Meg Foster,Billy Mumy and Brenda Vaccaro were excellent.The other cast members were great too.I always cry when I watch this movie.I recommend this movie highly to people that have never seen it,I have this movie.
It has been over thirty years since I first saw this movie and I still remember its effect on me.
Director Leslie Hiscott and cinematographers Sydney Blythe and William Luff get some nice proto-noir compositions into the first and last reels, but in between it's a very claustrophobic movie that seems to take place entirely indoors, either in the home of Ronald Adair or in Sherlock Holmes' and Dr. Watson's digs at 221B Baker Street.
First and foremost, you will hate this first 10 minutes or so of this film.
Everyone I've showed this to has agreed with me on this: This film looks like crap when you first turn it on.
One night, when his own date is ruined because Lucy doesn't come home as promised, Danny returns first and drives Ian home.
What is so great about the uncooked, haywire script in the first place?
Having known nothing about the film, I was a bit suspicious when they tell us the year 2001 in the first frame of the film.. and it all came to me when Irrfan Khan sat in the office with the calendar behind him.
It's legendary Indian actor Naseeruddin Shah's first try at directing and he does a pretty good job with it.
Rajubhai for the first time in his life is fathering an innocent girl on her first trip abroad.
Remember this as really the first and only game show about video arcade games.
Anyhow, my viewing pleasure with this film (if there was any to be had in the first place) was seriously hampered by the atrocious video/audio quality of the print I watched (which seems to come off of a TV recording), replete with missing frames (shortening its running time by about 6 minutes!)
Bela Lugosi plays a duel role of sorts in the film by being identical twins who are so identical that they have the same first and last names: Arthur Perry.
The first 40 minutes are spent setting up that relatively simple plot and absolutely nothing happens.
This is the first movie which is Rayesque to the core.One of his most obvious permanent feature really appears for the first time: the search for a father.The relationship Bogart/Derek is intense (after the death of the biological one)and predates those of "Run for cover" (John Derek again playing opposite Cagney) and "Rebel without a cause " (Remember Plato to Jim and Judy: "I wish you could be my parents" )But I could also mention the Mitchum/Kennedy relationship in " lusty men" or even Heston and the Chinese girl in "55 days at Peking" .Or James Mason and his (biological this time) in "bigger than life".Emma's character predates The Rayesque young girl ,the one you meet again in "they live by night" (note how Allene Roberts resembles Cathy O'Donnell).Allene Roberts' beaming face and her hope against hope are the only ray of light in a dark tragical story.
Excellent screenplay with a superb editing ;many contemporary movies (such as the brilliant "Usual suspects" ) might have been influenced by the first scenes.Note that the story begins during the cast and credits ,which shows that Ray ,when he was on top of his game,did not know filler.
It stars Humphrey Bogart in his first film after leaving Warner Brothers, though it comes off like a Warner Brothers film made in the 1930s - it has a real "Dead End Kids" feel to it, particularly in the beginning.
It's admirable that Humphrey Bogart would want to make a film about social injustice for his first project as a producer (this film was financed by his independent production company Santana), and he even lets most of the light shine on Pretty Boy.
I recommend two Nicholas Ray films that are a much more stimulating and thought- provoking experience: the first is THEY LIVE BY NIGHT for reasons already stated.
Nick Ray's 3rd film (I believe); his first with Bogey.
Probably the first film use of what has become a very tired expression.
***SPOILERS*** Nicholas Ray's first film that's very much like his 1955 classic "Rebel Without a Cause" which deals with a troubled youth where in "Rebel" it's star James Dean, as James Stark, was a troubled and misunderstood teenager.
Handsome John Derek's first film and he does the best with the part that he has giving a three dimensional, unlike the usual cartoon-like, performance of the ruthless criminal Nick "Pretty Boy" Romono who has a heart of gold under all that barb wire that he covers himself up with.
This is a curious film, as a porno/western hybrid, it's the first of it's kind that I've seen.
Daredevil then finds David's apartment and asks him to come with him at first he doesn't want to but Daredevil shows him who he really is and they go to his house where he explains to him how he became blind and how he can see sound like a radar.
Bill Bixby for the first and only time looks disinterested in the proceedings.
Another goof was the fact that David Banner had a beard in the first half of the movie, but the beard vanished when he became the Hulk, only to magically reappear when he reverted back to Banner.
The first half, he is a bearded and depressed man who could care less about life and looks like a homeless bum.
The scenario is very loosely based on the story of the first ascent of Cerro Torre, a hard Patagonian peak.
His trophy wife isn't particularly interested in him and he longs for his long dead first wife and his idyllic youth.
When he arrives late for the first rehearsal of his next play, the director (real-life director Sydney Pollack plays this part) is brash and obnoxious--further pushing him to long for the good old days.
The writing was first rate, and I believe this writer (E. Jack Neuman) was a rookie to the Twilight Zone.
This is largely due to the brutal nature of the film's numerous rape sequences, commendably NOT of the 'they may protest at first' variety.
1 Giant Leap are Jamie Catto and Duncan Bridgeman, who first met at a mutual friend's flat in Brighton and found that they shared a deep love for two universally influential albums: David Byrne and Brian Eno's My Life in the Bush of Ghosts and Peter Gabriel's Passion, the soundtrack to Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ.
This project is the first of its kind, both in its immense terms of reference and its revolutionary use of cutting-edge technology.
This first TV pairing of Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer was a Friday night must-see for me.
I don't remember it first time round, but recently bought it on DVD and I think it's hilarious.
There's something about BNO that has stuck with me since I first saw it in the early nineties.
At first you'll be thinking "What the hell is this?
I felt the need to defend this programme after reading the first review written by someone who has never been a fan.
I remember the first time this was shown on television.
From the very first viewing they had me, i was hooked and woe-betide the video recorder if it malfunctioned during the show.
The first story is in China, where a blood-for-money scheme turns a village slowly into a death camp, and gives us one of the best ironic dark humor lines in the film.
Hi there, my first set of comments here...  i just saw this movie at the Pusan Int'l Film Fest in Korea.
Inside the lion's den, Robin first provokes the lion and then makes his escape relying on nothing but his instincts!
In her disdain for the arrogant-and-obnoxious Sir Guy (Rathbone), we discern her personal ethics, for soon afterwards she is first provoked by then falls for the arrogant-yet-charismatic Robin, who `loves a man who can best (him)'-the antithesis of Sir Guy.
The first takes place in rural China where Lucy Liu plays Jin Ping - a woman who is a black-marketeer of blood products.
In this first of the three parts the film shows ruin and death brought to an entire village through greed and apathy.
However, in the first of three stories on the disease, we see Lucy Liu as a blood smuggler who buys blood for $5.00 a pint.
This film shows very different cases and reactions by people from the first world and third world, facing an unjust world and trying to do their best to get by.
In the first one, poverty associated to the ignorance and greed sentences the dwellers of a village; in the second, selfishness and need of money infects at least eight actors and actresses of the porn industry; in the last one, ignorance and lack of resources doom the poor people to the disease.
The first story is tragic and with an ironic conclusion when the dweller questions that he sold his blood for US$ 5.00 and he paid US$ 10.00 for the test.
Her lamented Max is on his way back to her, but first he needs to collect money from his pimp, Chrisina.
I saw this movie when it was first released, and then again last week on video.
There are still areas of the film that will have you scratching your head, like, oh..The poor lighting in the indoor scenes, the distant camera shots that last over 3 minutes (The first one takes place less than 5 minutes into the film and lacks a close up of a certain female that didn't get enough screen time either.)
being placed in a similar situation to the characters in the movie it is easy to see how quick it would be to pre-judge somebody without knowing all the facts.this film first appeared in 1988 (ian Barry), be careful there are similarly named movies out there.....
Predictably, the players hate her at first, then they start to like her and at the same time the team starts off losing before they finish up winning.
The only thing that is worth noticing is that Woody Harrelson, Wesley Snipes and Mykelti Williamson made one of their first appearances here, before Harrelson became famous as Woody Boyd and before he and Snipes were made a team in several films.
Mykelti Williamson also became well known, first in Midnight Caller and then as the shrimp connoisseur Bubba in Forrest Gump.
At first, the guys take a disliking to her, but soon afterwards, her efforts pay off as they win match after match.
Touted by many as the very first advertising film this is really nothing more than a shot of bemused actors dressed in kilts performing a very poor impression of a highland fling.
I first saw this wonderful movie as a young boy in 1938.
), the way it is depicted in film (with a selection of some memorable on screen moments from its first film, "M*A*S*H" in 1970 on up to and including "Scarface" (some 180 odd times, "Pulp Fiction" to "Terms of Endearment" to my fave, "Planes, Trains and Automobiles" where Steve Martin says it 18 times in one hilarious sequence; interesting side-bar : no Martin Scorsese films or Robert De Niro letting his favorite expletive fly!
My first concern was "The children!
This might be the first time I've ever written a review, where I actually have to self-censor the title of the movie.
I always thought the first one was that 'C-word' that most women don't even call each other, unless they're REALLY angry.)
We do know that it first appeared as a written word around 1456, but that's about it.
The first time i saw this in the early 90's I loved it and I recently re-watched it (2002) and still loved it, it lost a bit of it's surprise though.
Like the other reviewers, I first saw it on the Sci-Fi Channel's Anime Week's ROBOT CARNIVAL.
Its a good thing that this was one of the first movies shot in Technicolor, as that process holds up really well as you can see in the new ca 2003 DVD release, unlike Eastman color films that have all gone to hell.
And I totally did'nt guess the ending which I usually do within the first few minutes of other scary movies.
At first you'd swear that she is just as wholesome as shredded wheat, and feel sorry for any hardships that she has to encounter.
But this carefully constructed image gradually unfolds: Stacy visits the cosmetic surgeon more often than I see my dentist, and she occasionally comes off as incredibly callous, such as when she prostitutes herself to a wealthy fan (not too long after gushing about how frightened she is of losing her boyfriend because he might find someone better), or when she gets very cross at her boyfriend because he can't handle doing a double-teamed scene with her (she actually services the other guy first -- that's showbusiness).
My husband said that when it started out, SV "seemed happy and pretty much OK for a while", but from almost the first shot of SV talking about how this is a great job for her because she loves sex and how the porn industry "is the only job where she would get people telling her she's sexy and beautiful", it was obvious that though she is smiling and sounding positive, but really just trying deep down to convince herself that she's happy.
In the first few minutes of the movie she reveals that there is only one thing she has any sort of talent for that she could make a living from-sex.
I saw this movie first about 40 years ago when I was 5 or 6 and all I could think of was how much fun it would be to head off to Sherwood Forest to be a Merry Man -being a girl and living in America put that right out of the realm of possibility !
Seeing it with a crowd that was enjoying it with me, the families that had brought their children, the applause at Robin's first appearance and at key moments of the film (which I will not spoil for anyone who has not seen it) added to the joy and excitement at seeing it in a theater.
If anything, this film is a must-see for two of W.C. Field's scenes: 1) Fields' first meeting with Baby Le Roy (who also appears in It's a Gift), which is easily one of the best comedy scenes in the movies, and 2) Fields' juggling routine, for which he was very famous when he was a vaudevillian, justly so.
Legend has it that Hollywood's first movie star, Florence Lawrence, derelict & forgotten, made one of her last unbilled appearances here before her 1938 suicide.
Ever since I first saw it as a kid I've counted it among my favorite W.C. Fields comedies, and when I saw it again recently it was just as funny, warm, and entertaining as ever, maybe all the more so with the passage of time.
The boarding house where the troupe stays serves as the locale for two hilarious comic set-pieces, back-to-back: first, McGonigle's lunch is ruined by Mrs. Pepperday's rowdy toddler Albert, who flings food in his face, grabs his nose, and dunks his pocket watch in molasses.
These two sequences alone are reason enough to make this movie a must-see comedy classic, and, interestingly, in each of them Fields himself plays victimized straight man: first to Baby LeRoy, then to Jan Duggan, whose rendition of the song is a show-stopping triumph.
The first adjective may be apt; the second certainly is not.
That was when she saw "The Adventures of Robin Hood" for the first time in many years in a packed theater in Paris and caught the buzz of the people seeing it around her.
Before any Westerner visits India for the first time, I strongly recommend them to view Outsourced prior to their arrival.
The first half of the movie that takes time to build up the image of India perceived by a foreigner is actually quite accurate.
If I weren't really impressed with the first half, I might not have finished watching it.
Of course poverty was seen, but not the more prevalent poverty one sees when first arriving to India.
After the first half an hour, I was pleasantly surprised at the fact that the film was actually NOT 'just another movie'.
I too saw it at the Toronto Film Festival, sitting in the first row because I was in the "rush" line.
Still, the IMDb listings appear to be incomplete, as at least the first two among those I would like to watch are omitted: THE BANDIT OF SHERWOOD FOREST (1946), ROGUES OF SHERWOOD FOREST (1950; Alan Hale's third and last stab at the character of Little John, following those of the 1922 and 1938 classics!
But, beggars can't be choosers, and I like this second round of Boys Town almost as much as the first.
The special effects weren't as outstanding as they should've been; most times after the first season, we barely see Superman take off, he just waves his cape at the camera and literelly jumps two feet left or right side of the camera out of frame.
I think the writers perhaps identified that they made a mistake killing him off at the end of the first season as from then on Superman had no full-time enemy which in the long-run cost the quality of episodes.
This was one of the first (if not the first) series I really followed, pilot to finale.
There have been other series released on DVD that I followed, or are older than L&C, but this still was the first.
it was way back in 1993 when lois and clark aired the first season i was just 3 years old now i'm 17 i can fully appreciate the brilliance of this show Dean Cain Is By Far The Best Clark Kent/Superman and Teri Hatcher Is The Best Lois Lane/Kent it is not only about the man of steal it's also about the romance between lois and clark.
'Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman' was one of the better sci-fi shows to come out of the Nineties and it was probably one of the first attempts to give the comic franchises a modern twist.
Newcomers to the show should check out the first three seasons to see it at its best.
I would hate for others not to want to watch the series because they only think that the first two seasons are the only good ones.
The first Ski School is a classic.
the first ski school was an entertaining funny comedy that just clicked on all the right cylinders this one has none of the cleverness of the first one..Wendy hamilton is a good distraction though.
I watched this film 5 times in one day during the first year of owning a copy on DVD.
Herbert Mundin was the first one in this cast to die, he was killed in an automobile accident just two years after this film was finished.
It is his first world title and high TV show ratings show how popular his reign is.
This could have single handedly demolished JBL's credibility and heaven knows it took long enough for the fans to accept him in the first place.
What a terrible first Championship reign for Edge.
Gregory Helms wins after pinning Funaki to capture his first WWE Cruiserweight Championship.
It may be little boring to most to own(I personally loved it the first time around, but only re-watch it when I show it to others)but it is definitely worth watching at least once.
This first volume in the series was a stroll down memory lane for me.
I am almost ashamed to say it,but I only recently saw this film for the first time at the ripe old age of 36.After it was over, I thought,"Why on earth did I wait so long?
A DVD made up entirely of trailers at first seemed like a waste to me, but over 2 hours of splendiferous crap has changed my mind.
However, this is no triumph of style over substance: Raymond gently unfurls his tale, Mary at first still as she receives the message, her agitation growing as she takes the call from Simon and realises he is on the brink of killing himself, and then her flight into the night as she attempts to lay her own ghosts to rest by saving another, all leading to a taught and chilling climax.
Ms. Corr is performing in only her fourth movie role, and her first as lead.
The film bears two or three viewings to really get the "feel" of the whole storyline, and the "heart" of the personalities... at first I did not like it as I was expected another "preacher" story (Duvall's first fantastic film he wrote as well).
The first one was "just a taste."
When I first saw Robert Duvall's earlier "The Apostle" (1997), I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt being that it was his first effort as both lead actor and director.
I first saw the film when I was a small boy and I have deliberately avoided buying the DVD on the basis that over-familiarity could breed contempt.
"Assassination Tango" is completely overrated and I believe just for two reasons: the first one is because of the name of Robert Duvall, but he needs to look to Clint Eastwood and learn how to get old with dignity and glamour.
Conspiracy theory as a way of life has been endemic here, as far as I can tell, since the country first got going.
The film also reminds me a bit of Apochalypse Now in that you just sort of have to watch it -- many times, perhaps -- and realize at the end you're just about as confused as you were when you first saw it, so if you're like me, you accept that, live with it, and are happy to hear any new interpretations that might come along.
The performances are all interesting for different reasons: my first observation about Duvall was that his role would have been tailor-made for Robert DeNiro.
So here I am after seeing again after some years the very first South Park episode...
In this first episode, Cartman Gets an Anal Probe (the title itself certainly indicates that something in this animated show is just f****** wrong), Mr. Garrison is introduced and some of his words are the following: "I tell you, there's crazy stuff going on in this town".
His very first scene has him teaching his students, Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny included of course, together with Mr. Hat..."Mr. Hat, may I please be excused from class?"
), THE Chef (you gotta love "I'm gonna make love to you woman, gonna laid you down by the fire"), one of the most memorable deaths of Kenny... it's just the very first half-hour of the show but I tell you, there's crazy stuff going on in this town of South Park.
The first thing you'll notice when you first see the Episode is the Animation I mean the Animation isn't what you call Bad but it wasn't the best.
Also Isaac Hayes who was the first African American composer to win an Oscar for Best Original Song for the song Shaft appears in the Episode as the Voice of their singing School Chef, named Chef!
This is the very first episode of South Park entitled "Cartman Gets An Anal Probe".It has the worst animation in the series because it was made using construction paper...but we never looked at the animation in this show anyway.Nowadays, South Park has plenty of its humor stemming from current events and politics.I like this, I like all episodes of South Park, but its pretty interesting to go back to a time when it was just funny fart jokes with a simplistic plot.In this episode, Cartman recalls a dream he had where he was dragged on a ship and got an anal probe from aliens.However it was not really a dream and the aliens have come to south park.Cartman just thinks the other boys are trying to scare him though.The visitors kidnap Kyle's brother Ike and now they must go find him.With the help of the school cafeteria chef(played by Issac Hayes R.I.P), they get out of school and try to get Kyle's brother back.Meanwhile, officer barbrady has been investigating why the cows are being mutilated.This episode was originally 26min long.You can find this extended version of the episode on the internet.It makes a few changes, such as Cartman having a father and a sister and an introduction to Nurse Gollum(without the fetus on her head).Overall, its the not the best episode but it is pretty funny and good.
The Amazing Race is a show where teams of two race about Earth to win a million dollars at the end (the first to win, of course gets said million dollars).
Overall, I enjoyed it, but I absolutely hated seeing Zach and Flo cross the finish line first.
The acting is first rate and the mise en scene on the button.
At first, I thought that this is a comedy about those people coming from outside back to Russia, and experienced an entirely different cultural shock.
I recently had the chance to see it in the cinema for the first time, with the release of the remastered print, and wondered if it could possibly hold up to televised childhood memories.
Besides the tricks for a Disney movie, the "last minute efforts", the stupidest guards on earth etc, I suspect the KGB didn't run the country or kill more than 20 million people and could have not realized that, for instance, once Marie first gave sure signs of "dissidence" and then did what she did (Sasha), she wasn't going to try more mischief.
Not including the 20 million Soviet World War II dead (for which Stalin, as Hitler's ally the first few years, must take much responsiblity), another estimated 10 to 20 million "subversive" citizens were murdered or died after extreme torture and slave labor in camps.
The first thought was: "why would a successful doctor with the French wife decide to return to Stalin's Russia?"
The first thing they see when they leave their ship in Odessa is a father separated from his son, the son executed on the spot.
This is their first major movie as just about adults (nearly 18).
However, the first half of the movie is a giant plug for the band "Simple Plan."
There is an exuberance in seeing something done for the first time that is sorely lacking in later uses of the same editing effect.
I can really only comment on the first 20 minutes of this abysmal film, as that's all my wife and I could stand - we were laughing so hard at the God-awful acting!
At first I groaned but then to my surprise I found myself getting caught up in it!
At first I groaned but then to my surprise I found myself getting caught up in it!
I saw this on a date back when this first came out.
The first time they made it when they called it Ferris Bueller's Day Off http://www.imdb.com/Title?0091042  Clueless Parents = Dr. Drew  Eugene Levy = Me.
No sex or violence and no swearing which has to be a first these days.
Between Waiting for a dog to go to the toilet and having to watch the Olsen twins run around wearing nothing but towels, we didn't know which one would kill us first.
I honestly don't understand why the Olsen twins decided to work on this film for their first big screen picture in nearly ten years.
In less than 5 years, the cinema had made a gigantic jump from the short "documentaries" of the early pioneers (Le Prince, Dickson and the LumiÃ¨re brothers) to the amazing Cinemagic of french director Georges MÃ©liÃ¨s, who became one of the first filmmakers to focus entirely in making fiction movies.
Ever since he watched a movie for the first time (as a member of the LumiÃ¨res' first audience), MÃ©liÃ¨s was convinced of the enormous potential of the new invention as a form of entertainment, as as soon as he could he started to make his own films.
While in his first films he simply appeared as a magician doing his show, in this movie there is a set build for the scene (instead of a simple circus stage), and while simple, the movie is clearly set in the middle ages.
It makes no sense at all why most people who have voted or commented here at imdb even saw it in the first place (most I find didn't go at all).
The story at first starts of rather simple but just like in real life things are more complicated than they at first seem.
Dixie Lee, Bing Crosby's unfortunate first wife, does very well here as she cracks wise and sings.
At first there is tension between the two waring sides, but the slowly the two sides begin to see eye to eye.
World cinema is far popular now than when i first got into it and i'm not to sure thats such a good thing because there was a time where only the best titles made there way to this country, a time where renting a foreign film guaranteed quality but that changed with the sudden American studio interest.
I first saw this DVD about three weeks ago - nestling in the bargain bin in Morrison's supermarket.
This is the first Korean film I've seen , it perhaps will not be the last.
The first thing that occurred to me when I was watching Welcome to Dongmakgol was that I was watching a Hayao Miyazaki film.
In the film, we first see the main characters, as they fight each other for some abstract ideal, something they come to realize (or already realized) that they don't really believe in.
This is the director Kwang-hyun Park's first film, I believe.
For one thing, it's the first *colourful* war film I've ever seen.
When I first heard about this movie, I really had no expectations.
Oddly enough, I found the first minute or so with Buckwheat and Big Shot discussing the dog to be fairly endearing.
When I first saw "Tale of a Dog" back in the 70's on television, I had no idea this was the very last "Our Gang" comedy made until I read about it in Leonard Maltin and Richard Bann's "Little Rascals" book when it was first published in 1977.
Whatever the case, the acting is first rate and I think the film should in the coming months gain worldwide renown ( if indeed it is diffused in other countries than France ).
At first everything seems normal, but we slowly learn that especially his mother Edith (Sabine AzÃ©ma) wants him out of there.
Tanguy seems a lovable person at first but slowly we come to understand the parents.
I could muster a bit of sympathy for Baxter, and more for the very handsome spurned husband played by Kurt Johnson, but couldn't care less about the "star" played by Sean Young (in her first screen role) or about which absurd production got supported and mounted off- Broadway.
this is Rafi Gavrons first feature he is only about 20 years old (I did not look his age up), he does portray a slightly younger lad, & I do predict a bright future for him.
Instead of exuding such a goody-goody persona, Amira should have projected a more compromised person, someone who would cynically sleep with a guy and conspire to photograph him in a compromised position instead of first asking him if he would help her son.
This element is also displayed with Erika, who has to resort to being a cleaning lady and is automatically accused when the break-ins first start.
A performance like this helps remind me of why we touted his talents in the first place.
I remember watching Breaking and Entering more then a year ago but, at the time, I thought it was a bit dull and slow paced and I ended up seeing only the first half.
at first I had no intention of watching this movie well at first i didnt then i watched the last half hour of it and it really held my attention the next day it was on again.
Minghella is so desperate to put some 'real people' into this phoney saga that he drags in some hapless Bosnian characters, though even they are not convincing, despite the best efforts of the ever-brilliant Juliette Binoche with her perfect Serbo-Croat accent and a superb first performance by the young Rafi Gavron as her son.
And I don't know where they found Rafi Gavron who is brilliant as a first timer amongst such company.
Against any common sense, I decided to watch another family comedy starring Eddie Murphy.On my defense, I had two excuses to do that.The first one is that Imagine That is co-written by Ed Solomon and Chris Matheson, responsibles for Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure and its sequel.The second excuse is my continuous apology for Murphy, who I keep considering to be a great comedian, even though he keeps wasting his talent on atrocities like Norbit and Daddy Day Care.Well, unfortunately, Imagine That is another atrocity in his career.
If writer-director Paul Etheredge-Ouzts had cast more talented actors willing to imbue their characters with the slightest bit of believability as WeHo gay guys, this movie might have had some credibility as the "first gay slasher" movie.
There simply isn't any other possible way to describe HELLBENT than by saying it is the first gay slasher-movie.
And people, please don't make a sequel, but instead give us the first lesbian slasher-movie.
'Hellbent' is not good horror and it is not good Queer Cinema (although I'm the first to argue that there is very little quality Queer Cinema).
But for what will more than likely be the very first slasher film with an all-gay cast of characters to hit the mainstream, it's pretty freakin' GREAT!
We were first shown a trailer of another homo horror film hitting theaters soon Dante's Cove witch looked more like a skin flick to be honest.
I'm not a fan of slasher films, but I was intrigued by this because it's the first gay slasher film.
There are some wonderful moments in the film, like when Eddie first sees Jake, and has trouble hitting on him because he's nervous, or when Joey gets the phone number of the guy he's interested in.
Etheredge-Ouzts, who I met at the Philadelphia International Gay & Lesbian Film Festival, directs the first gay slasher movie ever, a fun and scary film that has nothing (other than the gay angle) original about it, but also doesn't pretend to be original.
I rented this movie last night with friends and at first we were looking for a really bad movie with half naked men in it....actually looking for a homo-erotic horror by David DeCouteau.....what we found was Hellbent.....A really good horror movie....I got scared....it wasn't too campy it wasn't over the top gay....though as in most horror movies the characters sometimes do things...well quite often do things that make you say "why are you parking there?
Surely it couldn't be the first.
But even if it is the "first gay slasher" it's just as bad as the last few slashers I saw for the breeder crowd.
Hellbent is really the first "gay" slasher picture.
If you saw the poster to this film and the first make-out scene in the film, you saw the best part of the movie.
If they ever do, maybe we will get the first GOOD gay slasher film!
When I first heard about this one, I was wary.
When he first comes into the movie you will see that he has a CGI puddle jumper airplane.
The first movie sucked, so why make a sequel?
The first thing I noticed was the painfully bad, stiff and empty acting from EVERY single soul in this movie!
Director David Flores clearly did not go to film school, and the way his cast delivers they're lines, you'd think they were learning English for the first time.
The first Nintendo games had more convincing special effects.
I enjoyed the first one, but this was just absolute gash; it seemed that they tried to copy the characters from the original movie (which was enjoyable enough) with newer, different versions- and they failed miserably.
Okay, so first of all, this movie is a MAJOR MAJOR insult to the first one AND movies everywhere.
If you liked the first one stop right there, and do not go any further with this film, PLEASE, DON'T GO FURTHER.....
We both liked the first one, so of course we are going to watch the second.
At least in the first one they had real choppers and planes and such, and the croc looked a lot better in the first.
It lacks pretty much everything the first one has, in fact, it pretty much lacks everything any film has, which is unfortunate as I have nothing else new to watch tonight.
I really liked the first one, I thought it was well cast and written.
From the first scene to the last, this garbage proved that there are still Neanderthals out there in the movie making business.
In the first shot, we see two men in a boat.
After the first death, you are introduced to a team of hunters who are hoping to get a little moolah for the creature that killed some fat guy in the beginning of the movie.
The first Lake Placid was the type of movie that you loved or hated.
I think a lot of the fans of the first one went into it with the right frame of mind.
If you didn't see the first one you may not understand the choices they went with as far as corny dialogue and silliness.
I'll also add that if you saw and liked the first, you may want to watch this just to satisfy your curiosity.
GREAT first effort film.
Well first of all I have to say I mainly rented this since I found out that Jamie Kennedy was in it, and I didn't think it'd be that good because well I was only 13-years-old thinking this would be boring.
In 1464 Dracula was already in prison, his first son name was Mihnea, in 1456 Iancu Huniade died and the sultan that imprisoned the boys was Murat II!
I recall being confused the first time I saw this film, not long after it was first released, probably due to being young and naive at the time.
Well Pirates of the Caribbean is first then Dark Prince The True Story of Dracula is the second.
'Sleeping Dogs' was the first major New Zealand feature film to find a wider audience.
*May contain spoilers in reference to thematically important quotes*  What first caught my eye about this movie was the title: Dark Prince: The "True" Story of Dracula.
The opening film of the HKIFF, I had hoped to have watched this on its first screening, but it turned out to be a blessing in disguise, as I had one week to trawl the streets of Hong Kong and Kowloon, and being able to identify the locales used, was an added thrill.
In her first movie role, I thought Kate Tsui did remarkably well in her role as Piggy, the newbie lacking field experience, yet being thrown in the deep end of the pool to sink or swim.
The acting is first rate by all.
And, while all this doesn't seem very original, remember that KING KONG was second--this was the first film of its type and so it deserves a lot of kudos and recognition for its place in film history.
If you liked the first talky version of "Lost World" or the original "King Kong" you will like this.
I loved "Phantasm" of 1979, and i liked the first sequel "Phantasm II" of 1988 a lot.
Not only is "Phantasm IV: Oblivion" an unworthy sequel to the brilliant first, and cool second part, it is not even a worthy sequel to the, already poor, "Lord Of The Dead".
To those who enjoyed the first 3 "Phantasm" films, and haven't seen number 4 yet, I recommend to skip this sorry attempt of a sequel, since all it does is destroy some of the magic of is predecessors.
And the first of its kind too.
The first movie made of Arthur Conan Doyle's "Lost World" story, and the first motion picture ever to use stop motion animation.
The sets and staging are all well done, costumes and makeup are far better than average, the photography is very well done, and the acting is for the most part first rate.
There are, of course, countless film adaptations of the story, and, wasting no time, I quickly tracked down the very first of them Â an old and rather battered VHS tape of 'The Lost World (1925),' directed by Harry O. Hoyt and featuring probably the finest visuals effects of its time.
Up until the point where we get our first glimpse of the mighty dinosaurs, I had decided that the film was a very loyal adaptation.
There is no steady build-up towards our first sight of the mighty Brontosaurus; we merely cut to it out of nowhere, and you can't help but feel that the director is doing O'Brien's excellent work a disservice.
"This was the first screen adaptation of the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle story of prehistoric creatures still alive on a remote Amazon plateau.
Having viewed "The Lost World" today for the first time, the predominant thing that struck me was the number of scenes that bore a similarity to ones in the original screen version of "King Kong".
Heralded by a pterodactyl's appearance first, we're soon treated to brontosaurus, allosaurus and triceratops.
His earlier Silent Movie Shorts when he first conceived the idea were corky & primitive but still entertaining today.
Later projects the first & bigger project would not use clay.
As the first stop-motion techniques used, it is extraordinary, just to see a fight between a gnarling brontosaurus and a small T-Rex-ish dinosaur, and preceding King Kong by eight years (and with many of the same crew including O'Brian especially) there's a sad quality to the dinosaurs like said brontosaurus as it wiggles all bruised and in tar at the bed of the mountain.
Just seeing the stegosauroses all on the move in packs, or the first sudden image of the pterodactyl, is thrilling.
This whole movie ties in so well with the deleted scenes of the first one, though, it is obvious the director is making this up as he goes along.
This is the first film of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's tale and significant for two reasons.
Secondly, it was the first significant use of stop-motion animation in a major motion picture.
OK, mabe only second best behind a certain Speilberg movie, but the first real classic.
The first big-bugget (for the time) special effects movie, the first dinosaur movie and one of my favorites, one of my most prized possesions is a FULLY RESTORED 135-MINUTE VERSION!
It's the first and adaptation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic tale.
The first film of this genre to really attract attention is still one of the highlights.
Hello and welcome to my first review.
I don't want to give anything away from the movie but I will just say that this is the first of the large monster movies and is the framework for any other movie of this kind without question not to mention that this movie is a masterpiece.
I always wanted to see the first film version of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic tale.
This was the first movie I ever taped when I got my first VCR back in the 1980's.
This first, silent version of The Lost World is the best one for dinosaur fans as it has more dinosaurs in it than any other.
More than 80 years after its release, the first adaptation of "The Lost World" remains as one of the most influential silent films ever, due to Willis O'Brien pioneer advances in the field of special effects, as it showcases the first time stop motion animation was used to create creatures on a feature length film.
However, the film's best remembered characteristic is the incredible special effects by Willis O'Brien, who after mastering his craft in short films got his first work in "The Lost World" and changed special effects forever.
Although there had been silent short subjects featuring prehistoric animals before, The Lost World was the first full-length feature to introduce the concept of such outsized monsters invading a major metropolis.
Roxton first conveys dismay at the budding romance, then resignation as he chivalrously bows out of this romantic triangle.
The brontosaurus, for instance, is first seen grazing sedately through a simple cut away from the live action, and is not shown in scale with the players until later, almost as an afterthought.
Even here, however, the suspense is dissipated by the fact we've already seen the Allosaurus (or another like it) attacking first a Trachodon, then a Triceratops, so its appearance in the camp is less of a shock.
A truly first class job by Director Phil Joanua and leading men Sean Penn as Terry Noonan and Gary Oldman as Jackie Flannery.
The first time i saw this movie, i missed the opening scene where sean penn meets with his contact before going undercover, so i didnt know noonan was a cop until he confessed it.
I found the nighttime and early morning scenes when terry is first back in the kitchen absolutely intoxicationg.
The Rooftop scene with Oldman, and Terry seeing Kathleen for the first time really communicated the feeling of Terry being home after a long time, and truly being HOME.
At the first time I see somebody shout Italians.
The more you watch you see all the bits you missed the first time.
But Oldman's first words to them in the movie are, "The last guinea who walked around up here was Columbus, and he only lasted a week!"
There are so many interesting mysteries and unanswered questions from the first three films, surely they could have picked a few points to expound upon?
If you're looking for a good horror movie, rent the first one!
I just saw this 15 plus-year-old film for the first time today.
Ennio Morricone is at hand, and while his score here is not his best (certainly not a bad thing), it really adds to the feel of the movie; first played over the opening credits over a St. Patrick's Day parade in slow motion, and reoccurring throughout the film, it is a nostalgic, haunting theme that takes us to times past and reminds us of the contexts of the scenario.
As the Tall Man's history unfolds in a series of scene's from the original Phantasm, a majority of these scene's were cut from the original release of Phantasm and are being scene for the first time, other scene's are just scene's created specifically for this film.
The first time I watched this I hated it, the second time I loved it, I don't know why, and now every time I watch it I love it, I guess the first time I just didn't like it.
I first saw this film as a rental some time around 1992, and it has not lost a bit of its relevance.
Gary Oldman was so convincing that I was surprised the first time I heard him speak in his native dialect.
L'Amore is divided into two parts, the first called "A Human Voice", and the second named "The Miracle".
The first episode is about love and sadness.
The first part, based on Jean Cocteau's "The Human Voice" is a relentless, desperate plea from a woman to the man she loves.
There is also a neat flashback sequence, with footage shot for the first film, but not seen before.
The first movie was a unique experience, the sequels have been pretty bad.
So when I tuned into it one night on Turner Classics, at first I wasn't too sure what to think.
I think it's a wonderful movie and it's been unjustly underestimated:it's oneiric,sentimental,poetic and the dramatic plot is dealt with a sense of humour.There are various issues like male bonding,homosexuality,friendship and I think every role is proper for the actor who plays it:my favourite actor JOHN MALKOVICH(GREAT)is a homosexual with some existential problems and he falls in love with Marty(Michael Zelniker)and they get engaged at the end of the film;Dennis(Kevin Bacon)has in vain tried to get successful in Hollywood as a musician,Al(Joe Mantegna)grows up thanks of Jamie Lee Curtis,Vinny(Tony Spiridakis)dreams to become an actor and Ray(Ken Olin)a painter.Even if the dreams of some of these guys don't come through,their strong and profound tie is the reason to continue to hope in the future.I also think the title is the only very funny thing of the movie(in Italian language it's "Dreaming Manhattan")but the film succeeds to alternate melancholy and thoughtless scenes:Mantegna climbs up the bridge which links Astoria to Manhattan,Ken Olin listens to his message "I love you guys" while he's thinking about his life,Kevin Bacon and Michael Zelniker play "ordinary people song" while Zelniker and Malkovich look at each other,Malkovich jilts Terry Kinney,who had fallen in love with him,because he doesn't like the way he talks about his friends(when Kinney asked him if those guys were his type,he replied "that I don't know but they are the best I could do"),Tony Spiridakis howls with a healer without a reason,Tom Waits reads his odd poem at Jack's,Jamie Lee Curtis takes Mantegna's gun and learns him to throw all away,Chloe Webb tells Madame Rose,a palmist, she's surrounded by idiots,the five boys shout out Arnold's name while they're having a bath under Hellgate during the night because he was the only guy,apart from Mantegna,who climbed up that bridge and they don't see Linda Fiorentino stealing their clothes out of spite,because her husband Mantegna spent all his time with his friends(he also kisses John Malkovich at the disco)...well,these guys are amazing!They are either crazy or gay,either sad or happy,sometimes they make you cry,sometimes they make you amuse.Personally I was a depressed sixteen year old girl when I saw this movie for the first time on a night during last summer and it made me dream:this movie is everything for me,it lets me to take refuge in another world and it makes me isolate from my reality,whom I hate as much as I can, but fortunately I'm not here,I'm under Hellgate Bridge to dream with other Queens.I thank Tony Spiridakis,who wrote the story,and all the actors very much for this wonderful movie!!
And while I'll be the first to admit that this fourth installment has it's fair share of problems, I commend the production team for a job well done.
Great character actor John George (as Cojo) has a fine role as Chaney's helper - the scene where he first unwraps the girdled "Alonzo" should have your eyes glued to the screen.
When I first saw this movie I was a little disappointed.
Luckily, I rewatched the film recently and saw it for what it was: a wonderful end (probably) to a series that had taken a momentous effort to get made in the first place.
My first impression on viewing this film was that I didn't like it - then as I thought about it I realized it was a compelling if bizarre movie.
My first impression of The Unknown was made within the first ten minutes of the movie.
My first thought was to say that The Unknown was a masterpiece given the tools and abilities of the period in which in was made, however, the more I think about it I think it is a masterpiece period.
Beginning with The Wicked Darling in 1919 and ending with Where East Is East in 1929, their collaborations typically involved a character seen at first as sympathetic.
This even includes the reason that he joined the Zanzi Circus in the first place.
Kudos to the first time director, Pete McCormack, and to the supporting cast.
It took the humor out of Phantasm III, and got back to the dead serious tone of the first film.
Whittingham shares a credit on the film, and the novel, Thunderball, which was originally intended to be the first James Bond picture.
There simply is not a single sign of action in the first 20 minutes after the title credits.
I am honest to say that I saw the rest (after the first 20 min of pure boredom) accelerated, in 4 time - 8 times DVD speed.
My finger itched for the FF button on my remote from the movie's very first scene.
After one or two bad nights out - indistinguishable from his later title "dates" - he decides to go really self destructive and move back home to Cleveland (Ohio may not be New York or SanFransisco - and why is Josh suffering in L.A. and not one of THOSE places in the first place!?
The best thing about this movie is that its title is numerical, so it shows up among the first DVDs on Blockbuster's "New Releases" wall.
I had my first doubt as soon as I pulled the disc out: the artwork is an amateurish drawing, likely created by a friend of the production, and features 6 guys in a giant Martini glass... but wait, isn't that movie supposed to be about "10 attitudes"?
In my opinion it is a beautiful work of art, and I watched it 3 times only in the first 2 days having the DVD.
In this process, first I watched Page 3 (by Madhur Bhandarkar), and then Satta (again by Bhandarkar) and after viewing these movies, I realised that I indeed was missing some thing in life.
For the first time, I am seeing a movie whose subtext doesn't label each character as good or bad.
The first combination of India's finest Director & Finest Actor gave a lot of expectations.
"), and we learn the significance of the dimensional portal introduced in the first movie.
The first half of the picture is a match for Island of Terror, building a suspense around the unknown.
They all figure that within a few hours the heat will be unbearable, if the aliens don't get them first.
It was showing at the CMJ convention in New York back when it first came out, and that was quite possibly the films only stint in theaters.
Imagine my surprise to deliver my first child in 2002 and find him diagnosed with hemophilia, which wasn't inherited from my parents.
Two parent that have been there in the boy's first steps and first words now have to be there in his first and only death.
It's been more that 7 months since I've watched it for the first time and posted a comment in IMDb.
Today I've had the oppotunity to watch "Go Toward The Light" again and the feeling it brought me weren't much different than the first time.
I first became acquainted with this movie on Movie Plex on True Story Saturday several years ago, and it has stayed with me ever since.
The first time I watched this film, I must have been about nine or ten and even at that age, I sobbed my heart out.
Seeing your boy die and holding him in your hands when he goes towards the light Â being with him when he leaves this world as you were with him when he made his first breath Â this is the most painful experience for any parent.
Doesn't anyone at RedBox actually watch the movies first?
Hooray, my first review on IMDb.
The tone is a little uneven, with Coscarelli seeming torn between delivering the slapstick gore and laughs of the previous 2 sequels and going for the darker more surreal approach of the first movie, so a lot of Reggie's scenes seem like they could have been pasted in from a different movie.
The adventure lasts for a very long time, taking approximately forty to sixty hours to complete the first time.
This is was my first feature film where I portrayed Alex as Salma's husband.
It was made worse after I saw the first three because they're all so good by comparison.
Though it's nice to see the deleted footage from the first film, a lot of it feels like padding.
How I regret not heeding the warning as I watched the drunk gal in film's first ten minutes.
At first it appears to be a throw-back to cheap '80s slasher movies, but after you watch a good twenty minutes of it it's apparent that it is nothing more than a failed attempt that pulls tricks and scenarios from every other slasher movie of its type.
But at least that particular scene leads to our first kill, which is pretty good, its distribuingly inventive.
and u know, i can tell it by first 30 minutes.
when u cant see any dead bodies at the first 30 minutes in the movie, then, its a non-watchable film, dare!
The only thing lifting this above total non-entity is a bit of decent gore for fans of the red stuff and even that is all over during the first half of the film (the first couple of kills are the best and then it's down hill all the way).
All the flashback footage we are shown in part IV finally reveals what REALLY happened when Michael first encountered the Tall Man.
There's ten minutes gone in the first fifteen; furthermore, some of it was a SPOILER IN YOUR OWN MOVIE!!
I have foolishly viewed far too many of these "8 films to die for" DVD's, from both the first go-round & the second.
I would first like to open this review by stating one of the funniest and best lines out of the entire movie: "That's how you f***k, family."
However, when the first murder takes place, that's when his TBS drama turns into a Fright Night.
There were some over dramatic parts to it, the scares where okay, there was great twist and a disturbing subtext, the actors where okay in the first half and excellent in the last half and the story seems to keep you on the edge.
The first question gets an answer in Jebediah Morningside..an inventor on the brink of a major discovery, a portal that can reach endless time and space.
I first saw Cold Comfort Farm way back in the early 70's on TV, but this latest version is so much funnier.
When I first watched this movie, I wasn't sure if I would like it, but as the story unfolded, I grew to love it more and more.
Kate Beckinsale plays a young lady among a decidedly strange group of relatives on an obscure English country farm and, while ostensibly there to write her first novel, brings change to the lives of everyone involved.
I saw part three first in 1994/5 on Sky and at the end thought 'Our heroes can't be left like this, Mummy (I was 12) how will they escape?'
At first, we didn't know it was a comedy.
The first time I saw CCF I walked out of the theater wondering whether or not I liked it.
If you remember the first movie at all, and you approach this movie with an open mind, you will find OblIVion quite satisfying.
Though not as atmospheric as the first movie, there are several creepy scenes scattered throughout, including the opening scene and a dream sequence involving Reggie.
But if your willing to at least watch the first film, or if your addicted to Phantasm I, Phantasm IV will clearly keep you wanting more.
After taking the series too far in the direction of horror-hokum, Don Coscarelli pushes Phantasm IV further into sci-fi than any previous film but brings back the narcoleptic approach the first that II and III were sorely without.
After the first 10 minutes, I thought for sure I had found a winner.
My first Claude Chabrol thriller was a nice surprise.
I think the decision to shoot in such a minimalist manner, from the performances to the style, enhances the film..like a good Hitchcock thriller, Chabrol is even able to create a type of McGuffen regarding the first murder as we follow Helen and Paul's bonding, the way they meet each other(..stopping by each other's place of employment as they work), spending time together, disregarding the village uproar about the vicious slaying, acknowledging it in a subdued way.
That's not to say that Chabrol has made anything that can't be enjoyed by one looking for a good entertaining thriller first and foremost.
This stretches out into the first half of the film; a friendship develops around food that Paul brings over, and it's only when Paul thinks its time to go the 'next step' that he's told it can't be because of a past horrible relationship that Helen faced- horrible in the sense of disappointment.
At first it's seen as the most suspenseful thing in the film so far as Helen leads her class along a mountainside and stops to have lunch.
Whereas the movie may work as suspension and entertainment the first time it takes at least another view to fully understand it and notice the main part of the details.
Chabrol's triumph and also Stephane Audran's finest performance;only "le festin de Babette" will give her a part as strong as this one.She plays a luminous radiant beaming schoolteacher ,teaching her pupils spelling with a little help from Honore de Balzac and dance with "le menuet du Bourgeois Gentilhomme",a MoliÃ¨re-Lully collaboration.She epitomizes honesty,loyalty,innocence and devotion to her work.In direct contrast to her,we have Popaul,the butcher,masterfully played by Jean Yanne (He's never been as good as with Chabrol:please,please,do see "que la bÃªte meure" (The beast must die)):He's obviously in love with HÃ©lÃ¨ne /Audran but he realizes the gap between them.He's a crude uneducated brute,but his clumsiness is so touching you side with him.But we know from the start that won't be a happy story:the first scene,dealing with Cro-Magnon in dark caves heralds a story of blood and bestiality.Popaul is Cro-Magnon ,but he's also a victim of the war they waged with his blood.Chabrol 's camera insists on the war memorial,this inhuman piece of stone surrounded by four shells.LOOKS are more important than words between Popaul and HÃ©lÃ¨ne,and as she begins to comprehend the horror of the situation,we know ,that in spite of what Popaul has done,she feels for him.Chabrol excels in depicting a small village ,French critics often compare him to an entomologist.
"Le Boucher" though, is first and foremost quintessential Chabrol, and as such it's less concerned with plotting than either Clouzot or Hitchcock, another cinematic forebear, the focus more specifically being the interior psychological states of his protagonists.
He's evidently scarred by the violence he's seen and also by his relationship with a cold, unloving father who seemed to be the reason he left France in the first place.
So, the bonehead son (and this is not his first of flubs), having connections to street thugs, decides to help his mother by delivering some cocaine for a gangster.
Even the first delivery goes wrong because the boy wants to help a guy who is writhing and retching on the ground.
True, the first half hour or so is a bit on the slow side, but once it gets going, it just keeps on getting better and better.
In spite of some beefing by the other gangsters at first, in the long run this ends the in-fighting and all the gangsters make more money in the bootleg booze business and like the arrangement.
The first thing she does when introduced to the Mother Superior is to uncover her breasts as a protest.
He isn't the first African Â American superhero either.
(There are Spoilers) Rarely seen and almost forgotten early gangster film that in fact was the first of the great crime motion pictures of the early 1930's, released before the big three "Little Caesar" "Public Enemy" and "Scarface", that put the "organize" into "organized crime".
Hesitant at first the leaders of the crime gangs soon see the genius of Ricarno's master plan in that they now can runs their illegal business's without the fear of being rubbed out by each other.
Though he drops a couple of notches in the screen credits from his first picture, "Sinners' Holiday", James Cagney still dazzles as a top mobster's second in command and hones the skills that will find him topping the bill for 1931's "The Public Enemy".
This was my first look at Lew Ayres, who heads the cast as crime boss Louie Ricarno.
We watched Hot Rod Horror first as we had preconceptions of The Shining through its reputation and having read the book.
Well of course it's the same Tomie and she has came back to claim her first love.
However, he has also brought with him the devil (in the form of a statue), and this leads the local priest to visit the convent in order to expel the demon, only he ends up featuring in the nuns' desires also...  At first, I didn't think this movie was going to work as a porn film because the first couple of sex scenes are far too rigid and it seems like the actresses are just doing what they're told.
Television first became commercially popular in 1947 the year I made my earthly debut.
What "Radio Days" is about first of all and foremost, is nostalgia.
(That's summarized in the first 100 words of narration, so it's not a spoiler.)
After watching about half an hour of this movie on FX, the first comment we made to each other was that this is entirely too realistic.
And for you martial arts enthusiasts out there, who heard this movie is the first movie made by the re-opened old Shaw Bros studio- you're right.
At first I thought it might be a comedy - they were exaggerating the acting on purpose.
After watching Drunken Monkey the first time, I wasn't all that impressed, and rated the movie a 6.
It's a very good and rare old style kungfu movie with a slightly slow start after the first fight scene with Lau, but gets a lot better very quickly.
Whilst the action scenes are first class, as one would expect given Lau Kar-leung is the man behind the film, sadly the rest of the film doesn't really hold up.
Not bad for their first big martial arts release for nearly twenty years, but a big "could do better" seems appropriate.
Directed by Chinese-American Steve Wang this film was the first film to use film and fighting techniques later used by such films as The Matrix.
I have never seen a film before that when I first watched it, it completely blew me away - something that has never happened before.
The quirky Bunker is really annoying at first, but his honesty and gentleness shows depth that should win Mos Def an Oscar, or at the very least, an Oscar Nomination.
It's one of the best American Martial Arts films of the past decade (not saying much, I know), being one of the first films to mix Hong Kong-style action with an American film.
Drive was made first.
Great action, great witty dialogue, the first (that I know of, correct me if I'm wrong) "cattle prod/electric baton" fight scene, and the main char.s name is TOBY WONG.
What Toby neglects to tell Malik in the haste of the moment when they first meet, is that he is an enhanced human, with a powerful bionic booster implant on his heart.
I was sceptical at first because straight to video martial arts films tend to scream 'rubbish' from the front cover all the way to the final credits.
After a slow first ten minutes when we get introduced to the main characters Toby Wong (an excellent Mark Dacascos)and Malik Brody (equally as good Kadeem Hardison) the action gets under way and doesn't stop until the closing credits.
The first half of the movie didn't really contain a story, which can be OK (see "Dude where's my car"), but in the second half they suddenly tried to make a story, in which they failed big time.
It is Def's subtle homage to the great Styepin Fetchit (Hollywood's first black "star"-- for what it was worth at the time) adds hidden depths to 16 BLOCKS, and it compliments Bruce Willis' affecting performance quite impressively.
For its first forty minutes, Clockwatchers effectively creates a Twilight-Zonish office hierarchical atmosphere with our heroines as the office pariahs.
After the first hour, it is the viewer who is the clockwatcher as it winds down with no additional insights, humor, or surprises.
I'd give the first half a 7, and the second half a 1, which leaves me with a 4.
John Kerry who was a hero in Vietnam now turned out to be a first class wimp, by letting Bush & the Republicans step all over him, when running for the highest office in the land.
There are only two simple facts for this: either this movie is one bad remake or the first one just sucked to start with.
Unlike the first one, Sly Stallone is the main character, Jack Carter.
First things first, I want to clear something up.
At first, it keeps looking like the kind of movie that's going to beat you over the head with every simplistic character motivation or plot point, but it doesn't.
Then we have Michael Caine - of whom I honestly cannot decide whether or not gives a good performance because I cannot get over what a backstabbing Judas he is for being apart of this film in the first place!
For me it was like watching it all over again for the first time.
Miss Sten plays the naÃ¯ve but strong-willed Polish woman who reluctantly at first, begins to fall for the writer portrayed by Cooper.
The scene in which Cooper reads to her the first chapters of the new (autobiographical) book he is writing, is most telling in this aspect; because Miss Sten does not fall for the dashing, tall, handsome Cooper, but for his character's sensitiveness, feelings and emotions which she apprehends by means of this book in progress.
My first thought about this movie as I watched it, was that the leading man was more beautiful than the leading lady, as Gary Cooper certainly looked fabulous and was photographed with great sensitivity.
I had heard about this film and about how underrated it was,then last week i saw a copy of it on ebay on VHS PAL UK.I was really surprised as i didn't think it had ever been released in the UK.It must be one of the rarest videos in Britain as sadly not many people have heard of it.Luckily i won it for just over Â£3 not bad eh.So if any one else is interested in buying a copy,there must be others available in Britain,if you really look around.I couldn't wait to watch this film,and i must say i wasn't disappointed.Its starts off a mildly amusing story that suddenly gets sadder and sadder until it reaches a climax to a very tragic ending.I must admit the last 10 seconds of this film does bring tears to the eyes,i wont say why,but try and see this movie and you will see.The acting between Gary Cooper and Anna Sten is first rate,her character is very likable as she is totally unselfish,and is trying to please everyone,so she does deserve happiness.Garys character,well he is married and his wife is not a monster and she does love him,so you feel sorry for her as well,i think you have to decide for yourself in a triangle like this someone is always going to get hurt,but you don't know who.Also this is a very early film showing us cultural differences and the sort of conflicts that can arise when two people from very different back grounds want to be together.Can it work?he is from a literate sophisticated family,she is from a poor immigrant family that is still trying to learn new ways.The answer is if two people really love each other then they can over come their differences as true love conquers all,i think overall this was the strongest message that comes out of this film,to some people the married issue may be the point of the film.Any way this is a very haunting film and well worth watching if you get the chance.
I had never heard of Anna Sten but according to the posts she was a protÃ©gÃ© of Samuel Goldwyn in one of her first Hollywood films.
Playing the grizzled, alcoholic NYPD police detective, who is on the verge of retirement, or suicide (whichever comes first), Willis hits all the right marks.
As viewers of Alfred Hitchcock's first true thriller, a silent film from 1926, we are halfway convinced, but privileged shots of the Lodger's face that we are granted in various situations have made us feel sympathetic to him, see him as some sort of victim, not a psychotic killer.
He tells her a story of how his own sister was the Avenger's first victim.
It is also one of his first films.
I first saw it when I was 9 (I'm now 13), and I did not find it too scary.
We know we're in the hands of a master director to be from the first moments of the film.
Here the ending was changed to protect Novello's reputation as a romantic leading man (as was the first talkie sequel in which Novello also played the lead, albeit to a slightly altered script, character and motivation).
The Lodger is as others have already said Hitchcock first suspense movie.
For example the fog when he first enters, the flickering light as if something is going to happen etc.
yeah its fun and the best Hitchcock i think.i hate that undertake is making it this is the one and only best no 1 i mean no one can change that good suspense and fun 1 for black and white While this wasn't Hitchcock's first feature film, he refers to it as the one that set the pace for his later films, the first to show his vision, style, and bravura.
The Black Lodger was Hitchcock's third movie, and his first masterpiece, as I understand.
The first "real" Hitchcock film leaves a lasting impression from the atmosphere - a killer (rape is, of course, not mentioned) is on the loose in London.
(possible spoilers) In what Alfred Hitchcock considers to be his first true film, he presents the story of a man who is suspected of being Jack the Ripper.
The Lodger is also credited with being the first film where Hitchcock started making his trademark cameos, one of him at a news desk early in the film and once again in the crowd near the end.
It is Hitchcock's first thriller, and establishes his tradition of placing himself in one scene for a brief cameo.
According to Hitchcock/Truffaut Interview, Hitchcock told Truffaut that he considers The Lodger as his first true film.
So those first ten minutes introduces us to the terror and threat that hangs over the Embankment as a Jack the Ripper type murderer does in his victims.
'The Lodge' was the first film to be considered a complete fully feature by Hitchcock.
At Age 27 after three films (two of which are lost, the other, witch was "The Pleasure Garden") Hitchcock Culminated his first seminal quintessential film ,it was raised in the schools or Berlin and Was hailed as the Greatest British Picture Ever Made at the time, Its A theme He would Return to many years later in Frenzy made outside the golden age of his successes in Hollywood.
It was Hitchcock first major Success and one of two films in the 20's (the other was "Blackmail") that gave him an enormous reputation , It offers a possible explanation for"Jack the Ripper" and shows the beginning of many Hitchcock trademarks such as the Wrong Man on the run, fetishistic sexuality and murder, Death and Pleasure, In the Dark Thick Fog, London is awash with fear and loathing over a serial sex murder known as "The Avenger" who targets Blond Woman in particular and leaves their warm corpse lying in the street ,He always strikes on a Tuesday, his Face is covered, and Leaves his calling card always tucked away in the victims pocket, On a Tuesday night Daisy Bunting(June Tipp) a Model comes home to her little flat she shares with her family, her boyfriend(Malcolm Keen) the local chief of police is there boasting how he's going to catch the"avenger killer while flipping a coin in the air, Suddenly the Gas meter switches off and while Daisys Father (Arthur Chesney) goes to insert another coin in , The house goes dark All of A sudden their is a knock on the Door and Mrs Bunting (Played beautifully by Marie Ault) Opens the Door to a pall faced Tall man with his face Covered (Ivor Novello) inquiring about the room for let upstairs,The Pale Antisocial Asexual Unnamed man begins his association with the family and starts More trouble than they can possibility imagine, especially when we seems to take Interest in Daisy who Just Happens to be Fair Haired.Suspicion Falls upon the odd Introvert and coincidence seems to follow fact as Tuesday Night Comes Around Again and another scream is heard in the Depths of the London Fog.
During the first decades of the last century, the city of London was well-known for its many objects of local colour; to say London was to say Big Ben and by extension, the Houses of the Parliament, Buckingham Palace, the Queen Mother, the gin-tonic, the river Thames, the fog and Jack the Ripper.
Regarded as a classic by most people simply because it is Alfred Hitchcock's first suspense film.
The lodger's first appearance, dressed like the description of a murderer named 'The Avenger' with a wrap across his face, makes it a bit too obvious that Jonathan Drew might be the killer.
Alfred Hitchcock masterfully directs his first British thriller with hallmarks of the style that in later years would make his name a household word.
Although The Lodger isn't Hitchcock's first feature, it most certainly is the film that launched his career as the "Master of Suspense."
The Lodger was the feature which Hitchcock himself described as his first true film (it was actually his third complete one), and film historians, particularly auteurists tend to focus upon it because it is it introduces themes of murder and suspense that Hitch's name would later be synonymous with.
To be honest, the first thing that strikes me upon watching The Lodger is its sense of rhythm.
Of course what generally interests followers of Hitchcock's career is the fact that The Lodger is the first time he deals with the grisly subject of murder.
Sir Alfred Hitchcock (1899-1980) became a director of note with this silent film, his first thriller and only his third directorial effort, which shows the young Master's talents being developed in embryo.
He also made the first of his famous cameo appearances, twice actually, which would also become part of his trademark.
But then the Buntings begin to suspect that he may be the Avenger and want Daisy as his next victim...  Hitchcock's first thriller and a very good one.
It was one of his first films though so this can be forgiven.
To sum up one can say that the flick was good in the first twenty minutes.
ThereÂ´s Herbert Lom as Dreyfuss, but he seems fatigued and too mellow by now, thereÂ´s Claudia Cardinale who played the princess in the first Pink Panther movie, but here sheÂ´s supposed to be Maria Gambrelli (from A Shot in the Dark).
This film is great i am not a fan of the first few films (The Pink Panther - Shot In The Dark) they arnt bad just not as funny.
My god, this is the first time I have EVER seen a fair-budget movie been wasted by something like this.
Its tone isn't quite as lighthearted as the first.
Mention should also be made of Paula Cale as Dean's first wife, Bettya and to Kate Levering as Dean's second wife, Jeanne.
I really enjoyed this the first time I saw it in the theater in 1969, and again when I found the DVD in 2001.
I saw this movie in December of 1968 when it was first released in the US.
I first this during it's theatrical release days.
A few days ago I decided to watch it in it's entirety for the first time in 38 years.
Marlon Brando, Richard Burton, Charles Aznavour, James Coburn, Walter Matthau, John Huston, Ringo Starr, john Austin, Elsa Martinelli, Anita Pallenberg and Sugar Ray Robinson are among the cast with Ewa Aluin in her first film role as Candy.
In "16 Blocks" you are asked to suspend disbelief in the first 10 minutes of the film, regarding the basic premise of the movie.
I was initially drawn to it because of the involvement of one of my heroes, Marlon Brando, and after seeing it the first time, I thought, "What were they thinking?".
The choice of Aulin, a Twiggy lookalike who can't act, was the filmmakers' first misstep--Henry's flimsily constructed script is the second.
I have been wanting to see this movie again ever since I first saw it in college, 30 years ago.
Here she gets into yet more sexual situations, first being raped by a weird hunchback thief (Charles Aznavour) and later rather indecently frisked by a horny cop (Joey Forman).
When we first see Bruce Willis dragging himself up the stairs, his weariness as a human, and a cop, is evident.
And in the same scene Dr. Wu is first threatened with a gun, kicks the gun out of the mobster's hands and then starts to fight with the other mobsters, while no one thinks of pulling a gun and simply shoot the good ol' Dr.  Painstaking efforts at acting, especially in the scenes that are meant to be sentimental and/or romantic.
Without comparing this too much to the first Butterfly Effect, the storyline was what made me watch this time waster.
The challenge for the crew was to create the feeling that the New Zealand fjord was a Scottish Loch, and they did a first class job with it.
It is a friendly, lovable creature at first.
This is also the first portion of a two-part "Loch Ness Saga" which will include a review of Beyond Lock Ness.
I'm only have 3 years old when I see for first time this episode and let me tell you that this experience is still in my memory.
However, this initial fun turned quickly to boredom once the inane plot began to develop about 15-20 minutes into the first hour of this two-parter.
The show took its first turn toward the direction of Science Fiction with the introduction of the Bionic Bigfoot played by Andre the Giant as well as the hidden colony of alien beings.
But this first Bigfoot 2 parter is high on the recommendation list.
I saw this movie for the first time at the Philadelphia Film Festival in 2004 and I was amazed at how funny this movie was.
That said, Crusades lost money when first released, if you only look at its Domestic boxoffice rentals but was the biggest grossing movie of its year.
Incidentally, it seemed common practice in spectacles of the era to provide villains of the Muslim persuasion Â as can be gathered from the likes of ABDUL THE DAMNED (1935; a British production I first watched over Christmas), THE LIVES OF A BENGAL LANCER (1935), THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE (1936) and GUNGA DIN (1939).
He goes to The Crusades in the first place to get out of marrying Alice because any promises would be absolved if he went on Crusade to reclaim Jerusalem for Christendom.
I first saw this on television, many years ago, by accident.
The first story - directed by Ken Russell ("Gothic" and "Altered States") - IS probably the most enjoyable since it features the most nudity and gore of the entire movie and is about an aspiring young actress whose breast implants have a vicious thirst for blood...
I would recommend just checking out the first segment since it has nipples biting people in the face...
I saw this the first day it was out and I guess it almost lived up to my expectations.
Phoebe is first and opts to tell the story of how she got implants from a human cadaver in order to help advance her movie career.
The first segment sets up expectations that TRAPPED ASHES will be a much more lighthearted film.
The first story, "The Girl with Golden Breasts", comes courtesy of actress Phoebe (Rachel Veltri), who relates the story of a breast enhancement surgery with truly horrific complications.
Aside from some so-so effects in the first segment there is nothing to recommend this disaster at all.
It promised introspection, scope, meaning, and a bit of beauty, yet the first three were still-born, and the last ruined by triteness.
Your first look at Bruce Willis as the burnt-out over the hill cop tells you this will not be the normal shoot-em-up cop drama.
One minute he hates her enough to spit in her tea when her back is turned; the next he smiles at her childish singing like the first fool in love in the history of the world.
When I first saw Zhang Yimou's wonderful 'Raise the Red Lantern', I missed all but the last 30 minutes.
Watching the first 5-7 minutes of Haunted Spooks justifies my opinion.
Lloyd tries his best in this part of this generally weak movie, but really shines in the first 1/4 of the movie, where he really is amazing.  
Soon, her greedy relatives begin to scheme how to drive her out - but, first, her lawyer determines to find her a husband opting, naturally, on Harold (once again suicidal over a failed romance).
This first half provides the film with many of its best moments, as the latter section - relocating to Mississippi - mainly resorts to some crude racist humor and overly familiar ghostly 'manifestations'.
This was my third time viewing the film - the first as an extra on Image's DVD of the Silent version of THE CAT AND THE CANARY (1927) and the second on TCM, as part of a Harold Lloyd marathon in anticipation of the release of this same 7-Disc collection, when I was in Hollywood late last year; actually, I liked it better this time around, hence I upped the rating from **1/2 (besides, back then, I wasn't as familiar with the star's short films as I am now)!
I in the process of watching or revisiting all of Lloyd's short and feature work and the first few shorts i've watched that i had not previous seen, most notably Number, Please?, have not seemed to have the inspired genius of his features, relying more on the tired run-fall down-slapstick violence and chases of the over-rated Keystone films and Roscoe Arbuckle.
It is also interesting to note that the accident with a prop bomb which claimed index finger and thumb from his right hand and nearly killed him happened during production of Haunted Spooks, halting production for some months, and the prosthetic glove by wore to disguise this is first evident here.
First of all, the casting list at the beginning of the film gives the first chuckle from the film by saying that the Girl had 'never-well,only once or twice..' and the Uncle is a 'man of sorts-we are not saying what sort'!
I especially enjoyed the piece of music when the Boy and Girl entered into the mansion for the first time.
Hey, that was better than trying to kill himself, which he unsuccessfully did in some humorous scenes in the first half of the movie.
This is made especially more painful from the tease of the establishing sequence of why Benny chose to come to Arizona in the first place.
But the first time I saw it, I didn't know it was made for cable.
I might agree with my first comment but this film pulls on the old heartstrings and makes you want to go visit the mens room because it makes you laugh out loud!!!
The Wedding Singer is the first Adam Sandler flick that guys can take their girlfriends to see.
Adam Sandler (a Wedding Singer) and Drew Barrymore (a waitress) first meet at someone else's wedding.
This was the first movie that taught me what romantic chemistry was.
When I first saw this, I laughed so hard that I had to turn it off!
I remember seeing it the first time.
When I first heard about it, it didn't appeal to me that much.
At least, that's what I thought when I first heard of it whilst browsing through my dad's collection of strange and funny series.
Take the first, second, and third seasons of Family Guy, which are well-scripted and still very funny.
The quality of animation in some bits is inspiring, and the breadth of what they are spoofing is amazing, you know your truly geek if you can figure out most of even the most esoteric (look up word if you don't know what it means, because it actually is ) references  Season 2   There are some gems in season two, however due to the fact that the DVD is uncensored, it makes it a bit more harsh, especially because most of the time we know what they're saying the overuse of the word douche seems to be without a doubt lack of a thesaurus in scripting, yes as immature as it can be, it's still kind of a funny word , but not used as a crutch the way most of the fart jokes come across, which there seem to be more in the second season than in the first, even though I don't think there really are in season two.
At first look i thaought it was stupid until my friend turned me on to it and I'm glad he did.
The first 45 minutes of "Nola" are almost pure romantic comedy.
After those first 45 minutes, though, a strange subplot is put into action.
The first was "Street of Dreams" which she sang at the very beginning, and the second was "Don't Break My Heart" which Emmy sang at the end.
I decide to watch this one for two main reasons: first, it has a still young-looking James Mason, appearing in his thirtieth movie (he first appeared in 1935) and there's also one of the heavies of the thirties and forties, Herbert Lom, once again showing his under-rated acting ability.
Despite many criticizing the pre-Renaissance 1980's as the worst-ever decade for the animation industry, it produced memorable films like "NIMH 1", "An American Tail", "LBT 1" (all three produced by Don Bluth), "Oliver & Company" (Disney), and this, one of the first full-length cartoons ever to be based on a toy franchise.
From the Canadian company Nelvana comes the first installment in a trilogy of big-screen movies centering on the Care Bears and the Care Bear Cousins follows the adventures of Kim and Jason, two small children who feel that people don't care for them enough.
It came out the year I was born, and I'm reasonably sure that it is also the very first movie I ever saw in my entire life.
The first of the three was really good and really dark and dramatic, the second one was just as good but seemed more like a comedy than a drama, and the third one was just plain weird.
I grew up with this movie, It was one of my first theatre-going experiences as a child, This film unfortunately has never been given the credit it deserves.
the first movie is all fun, and very little scary-ness.
its also when you first meet the care bear cousins, which are a bunch of jungle animals and at the end they all get their little tummy-pictures.
In the 90's, when I watched this movie for the first time, I was very impressed with such a tight screenplay and outstanding performances of the cast, and I decided to "recheck" my first impression.
Although, they have to take responsibility in it, when it's them that started the life together in the first place.
Seek counseling first, or talk with close friends around you and don't ever simply base your longing on an emotional state of being...for sure you'll be sorry in the end.
I saw this movie when it first debuted and I have never forgotten the vivid performances and how I cried.
Director Alan Rudolph does a good job creating a story convincingly told throughout by flashback and from the first person whilst coming back to present time repeatedly.
Be that as it may, this is a superior thriller mainly because the story is compelling and the acting is first rate.
I was disappointed when I first saw this, and recently wanted to see if it had improved with time.
what a flawless film...the acting...paulette goddard sublime...lake..her first real good effort and colbert gracious and sonny tufts...really credible.
I saw this film when it first came out.
1st watched 4/20/2002 - 2 out of 10(Dir-Jay Andrews): Bizarre, idiotic story-line is the first problem with this movie.
This is one of the first films that put women in the spotlight as true war heroes, and in the front lines.
The first time i ever saw this movie was probably in 1992 when this was still on the video shelves and as far as SciFi Horror goes, this is one of the very best there is.
Hence, it is gradually revealed trough the eye of the camera the contrast between the heroic, raw atmosphere of the first communist years and the light perestroika of the present cinematographic time.
There are two scenes which can more or less summaries the story: in the first one, we can see her right at the beginning in a rough quarrel with her Television supervisor, and we can consequently grasp the theme of the incessant conflict with the authority.
Not all great first scene gives you a good film but all good film will give you a great intro scene, but this one gets its greatness in it's "nothingness".
Both are so good that like I said from the first scene they appear, all you see are the caracters not the actresses.
This is the first film that I wouldn't recommend to anybody, save yourself the time and go outside and enjoy a moment with your friends or something.
This film is the first film to make me ever say, don't bother.
His first scene is copied from the episode of Mr. Bean where Bean gets his hand stuck in the back of a stranger's pocket and ends up following them into a bathroom stall.
The film is good till the first half and then the director looses control over the film.
However, one can't shake off the fact that the movies LIFTS scenes and story lines from AROUND 5-6 Hollywood MOVIES, right from the first scene.
They do the first thing that pops into their heads, and they have all got the rap sheets to prove it.
The plot is a little out there, but it works here as we see a rich woman give back to the people who need it more...  At first I was quite sceptical...And feared for Ruth but the film tries to portray the message that 'don't judge a book by it's cover', and in turn; something wonderful is thrown at the audience.
This was one of the first times I'd seen a "normal", everyday guy as a homosexual.
It reminds me of Roderiquez and how he made his first feature 'El Mariachi' with no crew.
This is a movie for indie filmmakers first, and lovers of the 'artsy, ambitiously creative little budget movies' second.
When Kyle is captured by a machine and brought to the Skynet headquarter, Marcus decides to help the youngster and heads to Skynet; on the way, he saves Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood) that suggests him to meet John Connor first.
(Pronounced CHOON) The comedy starts when these two meet for the first time.
I saw this when it first aired.
However, for the rest of the viewing public, I recommend you do what you did the first time.
I started reading the books when they first came out and have collected most of them and re-read them often.
Wow, i know that this show is praised and considered to be one of the best shows of the 80's, but i certainly did not expect such a good first episode, in fact it's a double episode that's almost 100 minutes long.
Ricardo 'Rico' Tubbs (Philip Michael Thomas) in this first episode.
Ricardo Tubbs come to Miami by representing himself as his brother which died three weeks ago in undercover operation gone wrong and he was killed by a same man and his gang that Ricardo wants to catch and kill in Miami, that's the reason of his coming down south in the first place.
When these two meet they of course argue a lot at first and don't get along, but fate has different plans for them as they start working on their first case of catching drug dealer Calderon (the same one who killed Tubbs's brother)...
I have to say that this first episode passed by so quickly that i thought it was a regular episode (which means 50 minutes long because that's the length of 'Miami Vice' episodes unlike some shows which have 40 minutes episode's length) and not a double one, it was exciting and entertaining in almost every scene, acting was very good, far better from what i have expected, since i heard that 80's detective shows aren't well known for their flawless actors, but Johnson and Thomas are dead on most of the time, specially in dramatic scenes and dialogs.
Soundtrack is naturally amazing for this 80's TV series, i heard music themes from 'Miami Vice' long before today and the first episode of it that i watched, official 'Miami Vice' theme is very good and likable as well as the music from 80's that was used for this show, for example in this episode we hear well known hits such as 'Girls Just Wanna Have Fun' and 'In The Air Tonight'.
At first they suspect it's a joke but when the first one disappears during a party and is found dead, things change and the students investigate / get slaughtered.
This movie isn't worse than most similar stuff coming out of Hollywood nowadays, in fact i'd say it's slightly more interesting, and it has the added benefit of being the first film of its kind to be produced and directed in Austria.
I like this movie, because it is the first step to a new age of Austrian movies.
"In Drei Tagen Bist Du Tot" is remarkable in many respects: First, it is the first Austrian slasher movie.
In 3 Tagen Bist Du Tot (Dead in Three Days) is labeled "Austria's first horror film".
As mentioned before this movie probably is the first one of its kind to be made in Austria by Austrians artists only.
At first, they don't think this is any big deal (Huh?
I've heard that some people can't get into this movie, and maybe the difference in opinion is somehow linked to ties with the first three movies.
What really makes the episode stand out, though, is its sense of fun and prescience: ordinary people's reaction to the sight of Kirk and Spock is always a joy to behold, and it's pretty funny to hear our heroes mention man's first landing on the Moon as taking place on a Wednesday at the end of the '60s: they got it right, weekday and all, a full two years before the whole thing happened.
This was the first time travel story from Trek in which we visit Earth of the past (the others were "City on the Edge of Forever" and "Assignment:Earth").
The X-men powers are cool at first but become quickly boring.
I didn't see too many films on the big screen back in 2000, so I didn't see this this first "X-Men" movie adaptation.
After the first scene, which is set in 1944, and the story skips to the near future, where the rest of the movie takes place, the film gets pretty shaky, starting with Rogue in her room with her boyfriend, just before she discovers her powers.
Wolverine) first finds himself in the X-Mansion.
So, overall, this first "X-Men" movie does have its cheesy moments, but that certainly doesn't mean it has no entertainment value.
However, they soon discover that the Brotherhood, led by Magneto (or Erik), plans on using them for a scheme, which he tested on a Senator first.
X-Men was a really entertaining, and overall great film.Than again, I use great in lowest term, but still, I think it deserves to be called great.This movie is one of those superhero movies that delivered and stuck.Most just deliver and then you forget about them, but this one always has to be one of the first superhero films that comes to mind when you think of that genre.The casting could've have been more perfect either.I mean, Hugh Jackman, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, and Halle Berry.All of them I've seen in numerous amounts of films and I think they're all fantastic.This is a good movie, and I recommend it for basically anyone.
I really enjoyed this movie a lot when it first came out 8 long years ago and I decided to revisit it with my little brother tonight and enjoyed it just as much as I did back then.
I think it's definitely one of the better Marvel films and up there with the first Spider-Man and Iron Man.
This first movie about the X MEN is my favorite of all the trilogy, and the only one I was really excited to watch and I really liked of them all.
There is not a better Wolverine then Hugh Jackman, and I cannot imagine Dougray Scott , who was the first choice to play Logan, in Hugh's place.
After watching all the X men movies, only now I noticed that Halle Berry was using an accent to play Storm in this first movie.
When Rogue (Anna Paquin), a Mississippi teenager kisses her boyfriend for the first time, he ends up in a coma for three weeks.
Generally, however, the first film is all about setting the stage for the films to come and it does do that in a satisfactory manner.
My only problem is that I was too young to appreciate both AbFab and High Society when they first started airing.
Where was the war that we get clips of from the first three Terminator films?
I remember in the first Terminator, the terminator was merciless.
Though Adrien's ties with Manu have become platonic while Manu see Mehdi daily, Adrien is the first to notice lesions on Manu, lesions that are the hallmark of AIDS.
It is set in the 80's, when the world first heard about the disease.
From here we get to see the T-600 and Kyle Reese, Marcus is rather cold towards him at first but he is pretty confused about what is going on.
We get to see some of the old terminators from the first movie and all kinds of new non-humanoid Terminators but sometimes I feel that the T-600, the new endo-skeleton deserved a bit more of action than motorcycle terminators.
It's true these movies could have been more plot and less explosions but it has as much plot as the first.
Whomever cast Kiron Kher in 'Rang De Basanti' must have fallen in love with her heart-wrenching performance in 'Khamosh Pani' first before doing so.
At first, it all seems harmless when we find out that Saleem has only been sneaking away to meet with his sweetheart Zubeida (played by equally intense Shilpa Shukla) in an abandoned building, their regular meeting spot where they sit and dream about how their lives will be, and do other things just like young people in love do.
This movie is the first since Transformers in which the action had me stunned.
But all in all a wonderful first effort by Sabiha Sumar, i would give it a 9 out of 10.
Perhaps the first south Asian film that has had such a lasting impression on me, Khamosh Pani has hardly received the glory it truly deserves.
Here, the debutante filmmaker has made a commendable first effort, with visible sincerity.
This is the first Pakistani film I've ever watched; Sabiha Sumar has made sure it won't be the last.
With Shoot 'Em Up, director/writer Michael Davis takes the over-the-top violent action film genre and blows a blood soaked, mile-wide hole in it good an' proper, and that's just in the first 5 minutes, give or take a few.
Given that the first thematic film made was a western ("The Great Train Robbery"), it's startling how many NEW gun-play ideas this film contains.
In no more than 3 minutes, you see the first gun shot and quickly the movie turns into a violent gun fight.
What do you get when the first 5 minutes of a film has a guy kill somebody with a carrot, and proceed to deliver a baby in the middle of a shoot out while constantly dishing out one liners that are nothing short of snappy-as-hell?
The title intrigued me at first but it should be really named: " last call for no much to see" !
One which will give forth coming movies a new style of script, this could be the start of something new, a new genre of filming pleasure has brought its first cards to the table.
My cousins and I almost didn't get to see it because the nim-witted box office staff decided ticket stubs would be needed to get into the theater even though we had Shoot 'Em Up passes directly from New Line Cinema reps. Because ticket stub holder got in first, we ended up sitting in the top seats of the theater, which turned out to be a blessing.
The movie itself was entertaining for the most part, but lacked the suspense that the first two Terminator films had.
I think Clive Owen might be the first true action star Hollywood has had in a long time.
When it was over, the first thing I said was, "I want to see this movie again RIGHT NOW!"
I've always been a fan of the Terminator series, T2 was one of the first films I can actually remember watching as a kid and comprehending the plot.
Like a lot of people I was kinda bummed by T3, it was an okay film but a FAR cry from the first two so I was psyched for Salvation when I first heard about it, but as each successive trailer was released and the PG-13 locked into place I found myself worried that it would be a let down...  As it turns out its not as bad as I thought it would be, the action sequences are thrilling and gripping, the plot isn't all that bad and there's enough violence to make it R-Rated-ish...
Remember how relentless the Terminator was in the first film??
Well that is carried over here, these guys won't stop until their processor is dead, but since they're CGI for the most part it lessens the feel of real danger... Somewhere deep inside the Terminator fan in me was wishing to return to that dark skull covered gritty landscape we saw glimpses of in the first Terminator (this definitely isn't the future Connor's Mother warned him about)  Hardcore terminator fans might want to avoid this, it was better than T3 but still pretty far off the quality of the first two, still, if its a Summer Blockbuster you want then go see Terminator Salvation, you could do a lot worse...
I first saw this episode in 1995, and it has haunted me ever since.
The production qualities of OSB seem "cheap", "noirish" and old-fashioned at first viewing.
The time line problems began with the very first sequel, directed by Cameron himself, and perpetuated with T3.
Anyways, let's start with a bit of good news first!
Their yard is a washing machine graveyard and their meals depend on which animal passes away first, and for Thanksgiving dinner, Woody and his wife Pauline are anxiously awaiting their TB ridden turkey to pass.
If you like mindless action then I guess you'll like this but what made the first 2 films great was the story (let's not kid ourselves, that's what makes any film great).
You get a first hand account of slave life, it will not be pretty at all though there were some times of joy in their lives.
Only the worst kind of human being with a lack of education, common sense or human dignity could ever think such a thing in the first place.
You can tell how disingenuous he was by stating at first that he had hoped to come away with some insight on the situation (meaning the history of slavery from those who lived it) but was instantly disappointed.
This is a beautifully made movie which brings Michael Winterbottom back to similar territory explored in his first two, and best movies.
I got very little out of this first time round, in fact my reaction was positively antagonistic; characters seemingly as shallow as those in a currently popular BBC soap opera with a similar London setting, but here handled with that clumsy hand held camera cinema verite look, which for me is always a turn-off unless the material itself is brilliant - "The Dream Life of Angels" and "La Promesse" for instance.
Unlike the characters in masterworks such as "Secrets and Lies" and "My Name is Joe", those in "Wonderland" are one-dimensional: we know all there is to know about them on their first appearance.
A weekend in the lives of three sisters as Nadia looks for love, Debbie packs son Jack off to her ex's and Molly prepares for the birth of her first child.
Like "Magnolia", the first half of the film traces their predicament (each in powerfully unique ways) as it slowly reaches towards a discernible 'crisis point' in which these sisters are forced to accept fate.
I was told at first that this was a typical woman's movie, but I -being male, 17 years old- was still interested to see it.
Little weaknesses: because the main characters are all part of one family, they are much alike and it was a little problematic for me to distinguish the different characters in the first 30 minutes; composer Michael Nyman seems to have understood the intimacy of the movie with his score but his music is a little too emphatic.
At first you have to keep your head together to see where the characters interact and at what level they are coping or not coping with their troubles.
The first, a single mom who pawns her son off to her anything-but-worthy ex-husband so she can go out and party.
Right from the first frame, Mr. Drach displays his vivid imagination, sparkling style and a splendid sense of irony, together with a socially aware attitude that transcends the usual clichÃ©s about age.
A great script from first time screen-writer Lawrence Coriat.
I got caught up on the first 50 or so episodes by the season box sets which are great.
Nonetheless, the constant digressions start to wear thin after the first few seasons as the plot ends up progressing at a labored crawl for most of the series.
When I first began watching it I loved it and tried to watch every episode, but after a while my interest in Inuyasha began to fade and I found myself tuning out around the time the episode count rounded 80, the problem was that the show began to progress at a snail's pace and we were all left with these story plots repeated over and over again in a slightly altered fashion each turn: 1.
(It was good the first three times, after that it got boring.)
I love Inu Yasha, it has to be one of my favorite animes, it's one of the shows that got me into anime in the first place.
Some of the other characters include: Miroku, a kind but somewhat perverted young monk(my favorite character, that's why I put him first ^_^); Sango, a butt-kicking girl whose village was destroyed by the evil demon Naraku; Shippou, a cute little fox demon with the ability to shape-shift; Kikyo, a whacked out priestess (seriously, she has major problems) of whom they think Kagome is the reincarnation of; Sesshomaru, Inu Yasha's evil demon brother who happens to be quite good looking; Naraku who is an evil demon person who's out to get the sacred jewel shards; and there are tons of other people too, who either aren't as important, or just show up a few times.
I appreciate this series very much and it will always hold a place in my heart (it was the first anime I really loved, that's why).
The plot with Naraku is interesting, though I found it a bit convoluted at first.
I don't know why, but when I first saw the ads for this show on YTV, I thought that it looked stupid.
First of all they spent the first hour of the movie acting like Marcus is a person just to have the major revelation that he is actually a machine - but wait, we already knew that from all of the trailers out there, so we just spend the first hour of the movie saying to ourselves "why are they still acting like he's human"????
Then there is a terribly boring fight scene that I swear they copied directly from the first two films.
John injured his heart reenacting the fight scene from the first Terminator movie, so Marcus (the machine with a heart) gives John his heart.
In fact, when i first started to watch it, I quickly became hooked.
One particular joke (sit boy) is found within the first five episodes, and you can literally expect it to be used again and again for the remaining 162 episodes.
The first 30 episodes are very clever, original and enjoyable for anybody.
from the very first scene, i was hooked.
This is not the first time Brazil has been the subject of international attention.
For roughly the first two-thirds of its nearly two-and-a-half-hour running time, the film focuses on the lives and struggles of the prisoners, as seen through the eyes of the compassionate doctor whose book on the subject served as the basis for the film.
2) For some reason, John Connor was (a) unable to trust a terminator even though he found out in part 2 that they can be trusted if programmed correctly and (b) totally stunned to find out that a terminator had flesh and blood and organs, even though that's the first type he ever encountered.
When the first season of oz finished airing, we had many characters who we grew to care for (or hate) presumably dead.
The story is almost in told in 2 parts, the first about the prisoners, and about life in the prison.
You can tell in the film that he is a fan of the first films...
It has a documentary approach which works at first, but drags on so long, and so slow, that it turns tedious.
Leaving the theater, I honestly felt as though this one gave the first two a run for their money as a film, as much as it pained me to say it.
Anita Smithfield is at his side again (returning from the first reunion movie).
The first reunion movie "JR Returns" at least had a decent script and some good and entertaining parts, but this time it just didn't work.
I first heard about this movie from my parents, who said they were surprised by how raunchy the film was.
Culture shock cuts into the American Adam Goldberg beginning the first meal, braised rabbit.
Loved the Woody Allen glasses Julie Delpy wore for the first part of the film.
Julie Delpy makes an impressive first work as a director in 2 Days in Paris,a great movie.The best thing about this movie is,no doubt,the screenplay because it makes very intelligent commentaries about the modern relationships and it also has brilliant dialogs.I would say this movie is a twist between Annie Hall and Before Sunset,because it has the intelligent humor of the first one and the brilliant dialogs from the second one.Delpy makes a pretty good performance but Adam Goldberg really surprised me.This actor made a perfect performance and he does not seem to be acting at all and I think that's the greatest achievement of any actor.The only fail I found on this movie is that some scenes are a little bit pretentious.2 Days in Paris is a brilliant movie I truly enjoyed.I totally recommend it.
Regardless of what any one else says, this is a well done movie particularly considering it is her first with writing, directing and scoring credits.
While at first being quite magnanimous, Jack will confront his fears and ego-busting situations when he starts to realize in his own warped perception that Marion may well be the village bicycle, having ridden with/on/by every male they come into contact with.
Whether one wants to call him touchy and easily offended will probably also depend on whether you think that, in the first place, he is being treated badly by all those slightly crazy Parisians or whether you would rather want to say that he is a bit stiff and inhibited.
Adam Goldberg is compelling as the sarcastic yet witty American boyfriend visiting Paris for the first time with his girlfriend.
But hold on this one is different.Parker Stevenson gives a sensitive, endearing performance when he first encounters the alien that the military have captured.
After the first couple of minutes (and arguments between Delpy and Goldberg, respectively) I was still skeptical.
Of course, it is a bit graphic and over the edge, but at least it can do that while still holding the emotional appeal that makes it so great in the first place.
But meanwhile, they are still growing up in Kansas, and Neil gets his first real job as a hustler.
He takes the bike he stole over to Wendy's to celebrate their first hoist.
Never mind that Neil let his first john almost mutilates his genitals.
The first film is The Vampire Lovers which is a wonderful adaptation of Le Fanu's work.
One of the big reasons is that it didn't miss one possible shot of nudity, especially in the first half hour of film.
While the first one had it integral to the plot, this one instead seems more like it was done because it could've been done.
A first for me, for sure.
I don't think I saw anything this graphic since I first saw "Irreversible" a few years back.
I first saw this film as a little girl.
It is interesting because the first half of the movie is focused on Barbara Parkins and then the 2nd half is focused on Barbara Stanwyck.
I saw it for the first time when I was 15 in 1976 and I still love to watch it.
It could be that the conservative attitudes of 1950s Mississippi made it difficult for young people to feel comfortable with any sexuality at all - Billy Joe wants to have sex with his girlfriend, but that's taboo, and she is reluctant to go all the way, so he jumps at the first chance he sees for real sex, even if that means sleeping with a man.
The action is kind of lame at first but picks up towards the end and the gore is half decent.
The extended scene when the "kids" first arrive at the house and try to start fixing it is a gem.
But first, in response to a previous post, a word about accents.
He sounds at first almost childlike, but it is a mask - he's pretty wily and knows what he is doing all the time.
The rest of the cast was all first rate, and the Oscar-nominated sets were excellent.
It doesn't seem like it at first, but trust ole Zeke on this one.
A 300 year old map, pirates a treasure map and a competition on who can find the treasure first.
I first knew of her via a short story on the web which had a couple of photos attached to it.
When this show first came out it was considered the Sex and the City for the black folk, and while the premises of the show is smiler (withe the four female friends looking for love career and everything else in between) it's rather different as well.
I was resistant to the show at first because I was overwhelmed with shows like Moesha, the Parkers, and I didn't like the way they portrayed black people.
I'll admit that Girlfriends didn't look so bad for the first 5 episodes.
I saw this movie (with my parents) when it first came out.
This is the second film loosely based on the story "Carmilla" and "The Vampire Lovers" was the first and "Twins of Evil" being the third.
The first film "The Vampire Lovers" is the best and a bonafide classic but this is a pretty darn entertaining film also.
Now, first and foremost, the star of the film is the scenery.
And, the second half improves over the first.
The first thing I didn't like right away was that the opening dialogue between the unseen couple in the car discloses the whole plot twist.
Her first companion is Alexey, a typical modern Russian youth, easy-going, talkative and romantic, a modern variant of SaintPete intellectuals, who meets her on the street at the very beginning of the movie and takes a walk through the city with her.
Alternatively, you could do as we did: watch the first 10 to 15 minutes to get a feel for it and watch the rest on fast forward until the last five minutes.
The setting is mostly quaint -- often opulent and petulant -- in outback, and somewhat eccentric, Australia still inside the first one hundred years of white settlement.
At first I thought I was going to hate My Brilliant Career.
The gasps heard all over the theater when Sam Neill is first seen (from Sybilla's POV in the tree) also made an indelible impression.
Seeing a great film for the first time is a distinct pleasure.
But you can see it here and I imagine that this is the first appearance of the style in a competent film.
Even twenty odd years after I first saw it, this film makes me want to cheer.
I first saw the > movie on cable and found it to be a very funny movie.
For some reason I have had a DVD copy of the film in my collection for some time now, probably a b-day gift or some such, and I never watch itÂLast night, sixteen years after it first appeared, I watched it again.
But I saw this movie for the first time in years recently, and I thought"These were the days when Mike Myers actually did good stuff".
For a first (and I know it's not his absolute first but close to it) this movie was fantastic.
When asked what my favorite movie of all time is (a supremely tough question for a movie buff) this one always pops out first.
And didn't we already see this story in the first tale of 'Tales From the Crypt?'
I remember first seeing this movie in the 50's on TV as a kid and I enjoyed it then as a social commentary and just a reasonably good story.
Once, when it was first released on TV in the late 50s or early 60s; and a second time, in the early 70s.
Its second theme Â and the one that ultimately trumps the first Â involves the rescue of a little black girl (and parallels, minus the cynicism, Billy Wilder's Ace in the Hole/The Big Carnival of the same year).
It falls to the sheriff (Richard Rober) first to locate the girl then to stem the violence before a lynch mob coalesces.
The minor but ever interesting Russell Rouse wrote and, in his first go, directed The Well (though he shares that credit with producer Leo Popkin).
Mario Bava directed the first giallo film in 1963 with The Girl Who Knew Too Much.
After the first murder Bava's camera pans up from the feet of the killer to his black gloved hands in a typically clichÃ©d giallo shot, however, Bava then carries on up to reveal the killers face in a move that goes completely against the sub-genre's rulebook.
However, merely being "the first" slasher movie does not make you the best.
This all happens in the first ten minutes of the film without a single world of dialog!
The first couple Brunhida and her boyfriend Robert separate from each other with Brunhida going skinny-dipping in the lake only to run, or bump, into the squid-eaten body of the murdered Count Filippo!
This is one of first real slasher films, and inspired the many films of the eighties.
Thereâs no denying that the murder set-pieces are the filmâs true raison dâetre: to this end, Bava devises varied and often stylized methods in which to dispose of his 13 victims â strangulation, stabbing, gunshot, decapitation, meat cleaver in the face and, most infamously perhaps, a double spearing (which, in 1980, was imported wholesale for the first installment of Friday THE 13TH!).
It is also one of the first films to include aspects of the future Slasher flick, and, along with Sergio Martino's awesomely nasty Giallo "Torso" (1973), it is THE film that influenced the genre the most.
From the first minute, the film has a delightfully morbid atmosphere and an incredibly macabre sense of humor.
The film starts with an aging land-owner (or bay-owner, to be more precise...) who is murdered in the first scene.
This film gets right down to business pretty quickly; in short order two of the characters get knocked off although the first nine or so minutes, rather effectively, play out without dialog.
It has to be said that the film never tops its opening sequence, but Mario Bava's gore-fest manages to remain fascinating all the way through, as it turns out that the first murder scene sets off a violent chain of events that results in a very high body count.
For his first film, Vince Rocca has delivered a great piece of entertainment... enough to make Kevin Smith jealous.
It's actually my only real beef with the movie, as I wanted to smack him around for being such a moron for breaking up with her in the first place!
Kisses and Caroms could possibly be the first "anti-romantic comedy," a fresh, witty film that explores relationships with a- no-bullshit, tell it like it REALLY is attitude.
In fact, according to the site, Kevin Smith gives it his seal of approval: "Kisses and Caroms is as assured a first film as I've ever seen.
been watching the progress of this movie since i first found out about it on the view askew web board and knew i needed to see it.... after watching the trailer i knew it was going to be one of the greatest movies id be allowed to see by the evil gnomes who choose my movies very carefully.. the type of movie this is really isn't done enough and the quality of the writing will amaze you... its tough writing a review for something while not saying too much about it but i really hate to spoil movies for other people, as i hate having them spoiled for me... let me just say to you.... awesome frickin' awesome   check out Kisses and Caroms, you surely will not be disappointed...
I love Ginger Lynn, first off.
The film comes with high praise from film-maker Kevin Smith: "Kisses and Caroms is as assured a first film as I've ever seen.
The title is a bit esoteric, and at first glance makes me think of Hershey's Kisses and chocolate carobs, but watching Nicole Rayburn as Tara certainly took my mind off everything else.
Bottom line, a fun film, a great first film, and entertaining to the last ball.
SO, I am probably one of the first people in the whole world to see this movie.
Overall, knowing this is a first movie, and was made by a guy who never made a movie before, it was great.
She was nervous about going down at first, but he made her comfortable.
Traci Lords would later write that her first filmed scene was spontaneously done in a kitchen with Tom Byron.
To the guy from netherlands , first of all , she was arrested the day after her 18th birthday , would have been 8th may , thats late 87 is it ?
and you say she coulndt have possibly made any movies before she turned 16 , yet she was penthouse pet in September 84 and the story read she had starred in dozens of porn movies , so she starred in dozens of porn movies prior to September yet her first movie according to you wasn't produced and released until late 84 ?
And if you don't have enough time for the whole thing, just watch the first 20 min or so, you'll thank me.
It is the first film I rated 1.
Sumuru, or Sumitra as she's also referred to, is like an evil version of "Modesty Blaise," played here by actress Eaton with that familiar coy smile which most of us first became acquainted with in "Goldfinger."
At first glance, the sight of all these armed females, usually lined up in a row, catches one's interest, but, after 15 minutes or so, you realize there's nothing else there beyond just setting up the visual.
The fight scenes are very substandard, as if the filmmakers had to use the first takes.
There are certain scenes in this film (like the hero's first meeting with super-villainess Shirley Eaton) where it seems to be on the edge of breaking sexual taboos and doing its premise (females want to rule the world by making men slaves) justice, but it never dares to.
All in all, a first class production.
Some of the shots - especially the one where the Indians first "materialize" to Barbara Hershey and Tom Berenger - are really awesome.
I loved this movie when I first saw it and I have enjoyed watching it again and again.
After first seeing the theatrical release, I rushed home and scoured my trusty atlas to locate the Oxbow Quadrangle in northwestern Montana.
It was not until the movie first hit TV (HBO, I think) that I endured the credits to learn that it had been filmed in Alberta, Canada and Mexico.
If I could "roll up the carpet", Micro$oft, WallMart and McDonald's would be the first to go under.
I have just seen this enjoyable yarn for the first time on afternoon UK commercial TV - not a great showcase .
The first sentence says it all, but let me say that the actors are well matched and the chemistry is great.
I am not a movie critic and as you probably can tell, this is my first, impromptu attempt to recommend a movie.
***SPOILERS*** You at first don't exactly know what your watching in "the Last of the Dogmen" it that it has nothing at all to do with the 19th century American West but the hunt for a trio of escaped convicts in the wilds of modern Montana.
This film was written and directed by Tab Murphy, and it is a tragedy that he has not directed another film since (and this was his first).
I am a 42 years old male who's first VHS movie purchase was Terminator back in 1984.
However, as I held the remote in my hand, fumbling to find the scan button, I noticed Mario Kassar in the opening credits and Carolco Films, (both instrumental in producing the first Terminator film).
The only problem I did have, is at the end, he refers to himself in the first person as if he was somehow part of the story, yet it was never revealed which character he was, (a good guess would be he was the lead Deputy).
For example, in the first scene, a town's person tells Tom's character that his brother went into the woods years ago and never came back.
The first time I saw the movie the story line was so believable I had to look it up on the "net" to see if there was any truth to the story.
It's such a shame it wasn't given proper presentation when it was first released theatrically.
One scene in particular is the one where Lillian, and Lewis, first encounter the Native Americans.
Best Picture winner more known for putting together the first all star cast in Hollywood.
Lionel Barrymore is nearly heartbreaking as a dying man who makes some real friends for the first time in his life.
Crawford (the first film of hers I've seen) was, at least to me, a revelation.
His turn as the dying, socially awkward geek living life for the first time is one of the best performances I've ever seen.
It was a smash hit when it was first released, and the film even managed to win the Oscar for Best Picture.
At first, the 1930s all-star comedy-melodrama "Grand Hotel" seems like the type of movie they don't make anymore.
Although Chaucer and Boccaccio together with many successors dealt with literary interpretations of life in urban settings involving strangers meeting in public places, Vicki Baum was among the first to bring this genre into the twentieth century world of movies and popular fiction.
"Grand Hotel" was a first not only in the era of talkies, but of bringing together an ensemble of character actors who were all stars in their own right.
The movie might not be as old fashioned as it might seem at first sight.
The sets are elaborate, everything looks perfect and this was the first film with an all star cast.
A slew of imitations followed in the early 1930s, and author Graham Greene was inspired to write his first successful novel, "Stamboul Train."
'Grand Hotel' was my first film to feature actress Greta Garbo, and for a few minutes I was left wondering exactly why she is held in such high regard.
When first released, Crawford was notoriously frustrated that Garbo received top billing (she was rumored to have always arrived late on the set, playing Marlene Dietrich records in between cuts just because she knew they were Garbo's pet peeves), but to me this only enhances the characters: Crawford's role is supposed to be more subdued (afterall, she IS the stenographer and Garbo IS the celebrity in the film).
Yesterday I saw this movie for the first time.
The first point that called my attention was the constellation of the stars sharing lead roles: none of the previously mentioned character has less importance in the story.
From the films that I have seen of this decade, this is one of the first examples of an intertwining narrative structure.
"Grand Hotel", as directed by Edmund Golding, was a magnificent film that had a lot of first class stars of the era in prominent roles.
In fact, this seems to be one of the first films to have relied in the prominent "names" it gathered to portray the different characters in the movie.
This is considered to be the first `all star' movie.
if 1.5 million of less than 2 million of them are killed in the first quarter of century how come they are now 10 million across the world 1-to-20(if all beings are at a reproductive age)in only 3-4 generations and in such poverty what a fast reproduction rate...
A few comments- First of all, I was student body president at Antelope Valley College when this movie filmed there-they got to film because they kicked $750 into the student government accounts and loaned us original prints of three films for an on-campus showing (they came back to re- shoot two scenes on a weekend, and snuck onto the football field by conning a security guard, btw)...I'm also a background extra in three different scenes in the first 10 minutes, and several of my friends are also in this movie.
After the first sequence, you'll know that there is nothing much to expect in this film.
Unfortunately my first assumption was correct.
I was really anxious when i was going to watch is buy the first time, it really surprised me with things the others movie didn't have like Jason going body by body.
This sequel is known for it's less than traditional take on the admirably repetitive series in which Jason is ambushed and blown to pieces in the first five minutes.
Maybe I'm being a touch harsh on it as I've seen far worse but I'm fed up of wasting my time with crap like this, having said that I'll still be stupid enough to be the first in the queue when the next low budget piece of crap gets released.
Let's understand two things about slasher horror from the 1980's: first of all, they had a legacy of saturating their own market, and secondly, they were simple stories born out of the twilight of an ever changing world.
Didn't the first one have a low-key, independent feel?
The beginning of this movie starts off just like the first four.
Well to be honest, if the film would have ended after the first ten minutes, I would have been more satisfied than I was at the end of this film.
Firstly, this marked the first time that no explanation was given for Mr. Voorhees' reemergence.
I saw The Black Pirate during the first season(?)
"The Black Pirate" was no exception, my first encounter with the legendary silent action-adventure hero Douglas Fairbanks (Sr.).
One thing though, once on board the Merchantman, didn't it seem like there was a whole lot more of them than could have arrived in the first place?
However if you freeze the frame on the first part of the ransom note to the Governor, the amount demanded in Roman numerals is XXVII (assuming that what looks like a 'C' is actually a parenthesis).
Douglas Fairbanks Snr., can quite fairly be given credit for the first movie action star.
This was my first Fairbanks film and I was quite impressed with not only his screen presence, but his ability to do impressive stuntwork, including the infamous sliding down a sail on a knife.
In fact, it was such a lavish production that it was supposedly the first full-length film made in 2-color Technicolor--an early and somewhat crude way of producing a color movie.
However, despite what the video box said, it was apparently NOT the first full-length two-color Technicolor film.
But his plans for revenge become more complicated when he meets his first captive - a beautiful Spanish princess.
A milestone in cinematic history, this was one of the first movies to be filmed entirely in Technicolor.
The film is set around Holmes' life as a Supreme Court Justice with the late Louis Brandeis who was the first Jewish member of the supreme court.
The film is first rate and the script could use a little work.
Yet we first meet Mr. Justice Holmes and his lady right after that appointment, buying a new home for themselves in Washington, DC.
They met as children and it was love at first sight.
Finally, I was irritated by the fact that there is a recurrent character named Adams, whose first name is never mentioned.
I was also delighted by Eduard Franz's underplayed portrayal of Louis Brandeis, the first Jewish justice on the US Supreme Court, after whom Brandeis University was named.
At first I was surprised at the number of votes for this film, but on reflection, it becomes all too clear why this is so.
J - 28 years old artist, Y - high-school girl, who want make a first sexual experience for her own choice.
Not that they would allow themselves to be seduced by this deeply moving yet quietly disturbing film in the first place.
I was at first disgusted with director Sun-Woo Jang because I had felt that he cheated me.
I couldn't see the characters at first and his sloppy introduction which blended both realism and cinema together was amateurish at best Â yet this film remained in my mind for days after I viewed it.
This is fun at first, but again, Jang's repetitive streak seems to make it feel boring than exciting.
When I first saw this, I laughed out loud at the obvious satire of our society's need for sex and violence in our entertainment.
At first the film seemed like a competent look at how two people in love want to explore every aspect of each other's bodies.
When I first popped this DVD in, I had no idea what I was in store for.
Joan Crawford's first talkie reveals her to be irresistibly sexy and personable, but her role is hamstrung by the inane plot and contrived dialogue.
In her first "talky," Crawford plays Bingo, a girl brought up in South America who inherits three million dollars when her dad dies.
She moves to NYC by cruise ship, and meets a young man played by Robert Montgomery (in his first role as leading man!).
Untamed is famous for being Joan Crawford's first talkie, a curiosity.
One of the first MGM soundies full of music, dance, drama and Joan Crawford!
I could go on for pages about how horrible it was, but being the optimist I am, I will mention the only two good things about the movie: It was the first movie I have seen, containing Ninja-Priest-Mummies and it contained quite some large boobies.
The first half of the movie explains all of the character's motivations...and it works.
Asides from some dialog, I enjoyed the first half.
Alas, Dead Heist, while at least struggling to patch some back-story onto the main characters in the first half, totally abandons anything but pointless dialog in the second and forgets more or less what the heck is the point of a storyline anyway.
The first thing that is somewhat dolorous in Dead Heist is that the zombies are nicely introduced while rolling the front credits, but then forgotten for about an hour Â and when they are brought back you'd wish the wait would have been worth it.
Some shows have a feel that they were produced on the first draft of a script; this one felt like the scripts were taken from rejected ideas.
When i first saw this i thought it would be a bit samey, like any other sitcom or teen show but it wasn't, it's very funny.
Dorothy Malone plays an awful, selfish woman who was Chaney's first wife.
My dad saw it as a first run, back in the days.
His first marriage was a rocky one, just as the film portrays.
Whether the trouble started over his first wife believing that their child would be deaf and being horrified by the possibility as is portrayed in the film I don't know, but given early 20th century attitudes toward disability it is entirely possible.
Cleva was 17 years old when Lon Jr was born.Chaney and his first wife Cleva had trouble finding work and were forced to travel the country with various theater groups searching for a job.
Others in the cast of this splendid film are Dorothy Malone giving an excellent performance as the singer and Chaney's first wife Cleva Creighton, Jane Greer as his second wife, Jim Backus as his press agent and Robert Evens as the boy wonder of the motion picture business Irving Thalberg.
The first problem with this film is that both people are fairly screwed up and are more annoying than interesting.
Each has the problems, disappointments, unsatisfying or unfinished relationships by the time of their first encounter.
The first half of the movie is especially hard to take, but as the dramatic unfoldings take place, you'll find yourself caught up.
The manic action that takes place when they try to first turn Albert straight, then as a woman carries the movie.
It is all setup through the first half of the film.
Binoche in her first successful comic role (in Chocolat afterall she was a more tragic figure) succeeds in creating a wonderfully funny and charming young woman, with an endearingly vunerable side.
But, in this original, we see first, a story of a young small-town girl, Esther/Vicki, who dreams of becoming a movie star.
Lester's star rises and the first story fades as her dream is fulfilled Â she has become a star.
Julliet Binochet, almost unrecognizable during the first half of the film because she is buried under makeup and an odd hair style, is totally delightful and stunning, especially when she finally appears with no makeup and wet hair.
Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan,Amy Whinehouse, they weren't the first stars that went down in oblivion and they most certainly won't be the last ones.
I saw just the first hour of this movie trying to see what my guide meant by dead.
Give you an example, the first time the zombie gang attacks our "heroes" of this movie one of the marshals is firing out of the SUV and it looks like they used a blue screen either for the character or for the background.
Why does a zombie carry around a jackhammer in the first place.
this is the first version of this movie made,and the only version i have seen so far.i liked it.i thought it was touching and ironic,and also tragic.it basically tells what the movie business can do to you,and the sacrifices that are made.it also shows how disposable the industry and the people in it are.as long as you are the flavour of the week,everything seems fine.but when you're no longer useful,reality hits and things can come crashing down.that's what basically happens in this story.it's an indictment(ironically)of the movie industry,however subtle.regardless,i thought it was well done.the acting by the tow leads,Janet Gaynor,and Frederic March,as well as the supporting performances,are terrific.i also thought the writing was very good,and the movie flows very well.for me,A Star is Born gets an 8/10
The first two were the presence of Williams and character actor Dick Miller.
This was the first film in about 10 years allowed to do so.
I was in my first or second grade, all the kids learned the tricks of cheating exams, well, not during the real exams, but to act like those kids in the movie.
Together with by best friend, I had my first experience of the short going to see Spiderman.
But it made quite an impression on me when I first saw it in the theater back in the mid-50s.
At first, everything seems just peachy, but later these underground people turn out to be major jerks who keep incredibly ugly creatures as slaves.
He never even made it to the first plot point.
I saw The Mole People when it first came out.
Ganyor, the winner of the first Best Actress award, is also very good as Esther Blodgett/Vicki Lester.
There are some wonderful sequences here- March's outburst at the Academy Awards, Esther and Norma's first meeting, March's final scene.
For the full effect I'd suggest you view the straight version first and then try to find the MST3K episode.
I viewed this film for the first time on laserdisc on a video projector in a darkened room with some mates and we found it to be entertaining different atmospheric in parts.
When I watched the film first time, I thought I felt the smell of death.
The movie seemed formulaic for the first hour, but happily breaks out of that rut.
Let's get the title correct first.
The first reviews which drew me to watch Kekexili compared it to the great American "Westerns"-- so I'll start with the DIFFERENCES.
There are especially strong connections to Chen Kaige's first film "Yellow Earth" (1984).
As an action movie, only the first scene is really where the brutality ensues as antelope are systematically killed (right in front of the camera, which makes it a tad intense for anyone not used to these images) and the patrolman trying to protect them gets a bullet in his head.
Apart from that, I don't have to add much to the other users' comments, but it can't be said often enough how much energy this film gains, first from the not-telling-but-showing technique of the portrayal of its characters; and second, from the way nature is depicted as it breaks the will even of these strong characters.
The reality of Tibetan life in the modern age is probably that it's tough, first and foremost.
I first remember when I was a little kid being in Mann's video store in Bridge City, Texas and seeing the VHS cover of Communion and seeing the alien face really scared me.
I'm right in the middle of reading the book now for the first time, and it's pretty scary too.
The first sight he has of the creature in his bedroom is one of the most intensely frightening scenes ever filmed and is the beginning of the real life nightmare Strieber and his family are then plunged into.
Sometimes Strieber devoted a whole chapter in the book to a certain anecdote, while in the movie it gets reduced to nothing more than one line of dialogue (obviously carrying a lot more weight than you'd at first imagine).
I'm became a complete Walken fan after this movie (my first Walken experience if you will), and I won't reiterate the already spot-on comments.
Flip enlists the company of some guy to track down drug dealers, since dealing drugs is the first step on the "how to become a gangster-rapper" handbook.
Sure, we have seen this story before, but this was the first incarnation.
So how does a classic compare to its first version.
It is the first Drama-Comedy I have ever scene.
I first rented this movie looking for a few laughs.
The first time I watched this movie in high-school, I instantly loved it.
At first I was put off this film due to the title 'Please Kill Me, I'm a F*ggot N*gger Jew', but after being constantly badgered by a friend I eventually sat down to watch itÂ Boy was I surprised.
I was enthralled with the programme with the first episode when they went into that strange storm.
Jack wants to go home in the first three seasons.
Fredric March gave a magnificent performance, probably the best of his career, as Norman Maine, the actor whose career is in the descendant as that of his wife, Vikki Lester, is in the ascendant in this, the first 'official' version of "A Star is Born", (the 1932 film "What Price Hollywood" roughly told the same story).
* Why did Carley not call the cops when she first saw the ants?
That was the first impression that this film was worth seeing.
The story was good at first, showing a plantation owner looking for his workers.
But my anticipation shrank when the first shot of the menacing critters flashed to my television screen.
The first story about a rendezvous at seven is the best.
I first saw this in a cinema and was immediately disappointed with its low-budget production values.
The first has a clever climax; while the second deals with complex issues in a sombre way, leaving the third to close this dynamic in its own unique fashion.
The first, "Rendezvous at 7 O'clock," is about a young woman who finds out that her boyfriend sees other women.
Cusack at first did not make me think of Jane Eyre, as I found her a little too quizzical, too mocking.
You can believe that these two have an attraction that, at first, perhaps neither of them can define or understand.
I first read Jane Eyre the novel many years ago and have since watched various adaptations of it but never really found one that I thought captured the essence of the book and portrayed the characters as I imagined them.
I was just a lad of ten when I saw this 1973 BBC production of "Jane Eyre" for the first time.
Nevertheless, it is the best of all screen versions there are of "Jane Eyre": the most faithful to novel, superbly tight and paced, very well put up together, with first class performances and Elgar's Introduction and Allegro for strings, Opus 47 (1904-05), as the musical background.
Sorcha Cusack the first Jane I can imagine Rochester falling in love with.
I then read the novel, my first ever classic novel.
I watched this when they first showed the series on TV.
But the misrepresentation of Jane's character is not Cusack's fault alone but partly also due to the script, which brings me back to my first point of criticism: Since the script is overall so faithful to the novel, the viewer naturally concludes that each word uttered in this version must come straight from the novel Â but such is not the case.
The first is the gypsy scene.
I first saw this mini series back in 1973 when it was broadcast on the BBC and thought it was wonderful.
This is the first movie I saw of Gina Gershon, I definitely want to see more movies, not because she was so good in this one, but because it seems as if she is capable of so much more.
Unfortunately, masterpiece is not the first word that jumps to mind.
Stanwyck plays his crooked-nosed second wife, who eventually gets bombarded by clues that Bogey's first wife was poisoned and that he has the same in store for her.
We also have here Bogey's daughter from the first marriage; this girl is given dialog that would make a forty year-old woman sound too adult.
Bogart stars as a crazed killer who has already murdered his first unseen wife and is well on his way to do in wife #2 played by Barbara Stanwyck.
Ann Carter stars as Bea, Bogart's daughter from his first marriage.
The Two Mrs. Carrolls was one of a handful of motion pictures done by Warner Brothers which were released to the Armed Forces overseas first and then to the general public.
Bogie as a kinda sexy guy, a la Casablanca, at first, but becoming more unhinged as time passes.
It occurred the first time in 1945's "Conflict", but in that picture, it was Bogey's character who did the pursuing, while here, it's Cecily Latham (Smith) who intrudes on Geoffrey Carroll's marriage to the second Mrs. Carroll of the title.
By that time though, Sally Morton (Barbara Stanwyck) had already been the 'other woman' to the first Mrs.C., who we only know by the 'Angel of Death' painting.
But if he was that sharp, he should also have concluded that if Carroll was deranged enough to kill his first wife by poisoning, then knocking off a druggist wouldn't be much of a stretch.
Also, this was the first movie I saw Barbara Stanwyck in and she's an amazing actress.
At first it almost seems as though the film follows a non-linear narrative; we find out later that this is not the case.
He's the centre of this story, a mentally disturbed and jealous painter who, it would appear, murdered his first wife (the first Mrs. Carroll) in order to marry the second, played very well by the beautiful Barbara Stanwyck.
At first he appears to be just like your stereotypical artist; insular, unpleasant, cynical.
Really no thriller elements in the first halve, just some formulaic drama and romance.
After the death of his first wife by poisoning her with milk he had spiked, Bogie, who plays a psychopathic artist meets another woman and marries her and he intends to do the same with her as he is having an affair with someone else.
The second Mrs Carroll gradually gets suspicious of his behaviour and eventually finds out what he did to his first wife and manages to call the police.
I first saw this movie when I was a kid and recently, I have viewed it over and over again because it is one of my favorite movies.
This "documentary" had a conclusion first and then set out to prove it.
It seems to me that sometimes addressing a problem is only a first step and this movie did little other than to wag its finger for 90 minutes.
When I was flipping around and saw this title on HBO the first thing I thought was "ohh... blue vinyl" and thought I might see some skin.
first of all i'd like to say disregard all negative comments about this film.
I wish I could go back and watch it again for the very first time.
Me and my Brother watched this together and the first words that came out of our mouths at the credits was "that was brilliant".
The main cast here (Dave, Norm, and Danny), do very good with the script they are given, and there were quite a few funny lines throughout the movie (Especially when Dave and Norm's characters meet Danny DeVito's character for the first time, as well as a majority of Mrs. Crock's lines.)
I decided to see it anyways on its first showing at the local theatre with my friend.
Because it sure looks brainless at first.
If I had had anything better to do during the first five or ten minutes of "Screwed", I'd have turned off the TV.
Still, the first part of the film is a laugh fest.
Not what you would expect at first "Daughter of the Mind" is a lot more then a ghost story it also has a lot to do with the defense of the United States that Prof. Constable is very much involved in his top secret work for the Pentagon.
The supernatural is handled in a very unusual and honest way in the film by at first not trying to disprove it and then trying to make those who believe in look like gullible and mindless fanatics.
I have not seen a darker movie than this for some time....maybe not ever...but as well as the darkness, Dead Mans Shoes also offers some extremely poignant and moving moments I think the acting performances from all involved are first class...but paddy considine is a cut above that.
This is one of the rare gems of the made for television movies back in the early seventies.I saw this movie for the first time when I was around eleven years old, and I never forgot it.I saw this recently, and I enjoyed it as much as I did when I was a child.The cast in this movie was very good.
Hopefully the couple will continue making films that will be better than this first attempt.
The plot is way to political, most viewers don't even why the Mexicans disappeared in the first place.
At first I was confused but then I figured out what was going on....
But rivalling Considine is Gary Stretch who delivers an equally brilliant role as the leader of the drug dealing gang and the first confrontation between the Considines and Stretch's character is brilliant the scene is very tense shown in both Richards facial expressions and threats and Sonny's (Stretch) sudden turn from being a confident hard man to being terrified of Richard as all his gang are.
see the movie first and read Douglas Turner Ward's play afterwords.
I am sure Californians would rise to the occasion if ever put in this predicament but for the first 24 hours it would be this silly, ridiculous and tragic all at the same time.
He too has a breathtaking scene with Considine when Sonny first confronts Richard and Richard shows no fear whatsoever.
Of course that would take away the competitive advantage of employing illegals in the first place which is not very different from how African-Americans were once treated with the exception of no pay and more whippings.
When I first saw the ad campaign for this movie, I couldn't wait.
With this movie and Giallo A Venezia, I think Mario Landi attempted to do something outrageous, black humored and gory as Peter Jackson`s first two movies, but failed to gain such popularity because he aimed these elements at the sexual, to which most of the audience is very sensitive.
It is very hard for me to agree with almost everyone who reviewed this movie and Giallo A Venezia, because the question arises how did they sit through them in the first place since they have always been movies with such bad reputations.
Hilariously funny dialogue (see Patrick's fathers' explanation of the first death) and scenes (see Mr. Lewis' death by hook).
Jerry desperately wants to escape and he takes what he hopes will be his first step by getting a regular job behind the counter of the local fast food outlet.
This movie is totally awesome,when i saw this movie first time back in 1995, i thought it was great funny and somewhat strange.
I saw Coneheads for the first time on TV last week.
Even Sinbad does a nice job as Beldar's first boss.
My husband is patient with me, and allows me to use much of the duologue from the movie as repartee.All the performances are first rate and the writing is sharp and biting.
Maybe because I grew up watching SNL live during its first 5 or so years but I really got a laugh out of the Coneheads when they would do that skit on SNL.
This is a feel-good movie of the first league.
Sinbad has some funny moments as Beldar's first boss and Adam Sandler is funny in a brief scene as a guy who provides Beldar with a phony Social Security card and whole new identity.
The brutality and vulgar cruelty - bested upon Anthony (a very good turn by Kebbell making for very empathetic/sympathetic victim needing to be vanquished) whose only crime was not knowing the common sense in seeing just how ugly his new 'friends' could be (again told in a certain amount of restraint in the scratchy black and white sequences, jarring as they are) - indeed are in need for swift retribution and when we first see Richard, a slight, malnourished pasty-white, scratchily bearded, porcupiney scalp of Considine's character we assume he is just one of the unassuming, local blokes of the pub/ pool hall that one of the goons is dealing drugs in.
After a good twenty minutes, half of the redneck population is already dead, while the local doctor and dumb sheriff are still cleaning up the blood of the first victim.
The pacing slows down a little then, since new moronic characters need to be introduced first.
Next cut of the camera, he is stuck feet first into the ground.
The first movie in the series what fantastic and the second was just horrible because they change the actors a little bit and now the 3rd movie in the series is just horrible.
The first movie in the series had a lot to tell about Bufford Pusser's life and the second in the series had just had few thing that really happened to Bufford but not enough to make it interesting and now the 3rd movie in the series is just horrible worst then the second one and this one doesn't tell anything real about Bufford life except for when he died at the end.
If anyone if planning on watching this movie you should not watch this one and just watch the first in the series its more interesting then this one.Please don't waste your time watching this movie go on and make coffee instead.
You don't have to agree with its message to enjoy the first "Walking Tall".
The first sequel, in which Baker was replaced by Bo Svenson, was a boring, by-the-numbers follow-up, with none of the force of the original.
The second sequel is even worse; talky and drab, it exploits (in an almost cannibalistic way) the first movie by lifting and recreating the most famous sequences from it.
The violent end of the story, which you are set up for in the first few minutes, was very jarring nonetheless.
Shonali Bose, the writer director should have stuck to directing as the handling is mostly first rate.
And the spirit is what drove me to see the film in the first place.
I still can't believe that it was a director's first film.
And yes, the pace seems slow at first, but the build up is terrific (although the music during the opening scenes could do with a little less of the dramatic bass undertones) and the scenes at the dhaba and in the jhuggis are first rate, as is the portrayal of Gobind by Yashpal Sharma.
I had the pleasure of seeing "Amu" during the launch of the first annual Asian American Film Festival in Pittsburgh this past weekend.
Perhaps a fitting testament to the reason festivals such as this need to exist in the first place, the film deals with a subject I hadn't even known existed beforehand: the Sikh massacres in India over a three-day period in 1984, and the complicity of a corrupt government in facilitating and masking the events.
It's entirely possible the film would have worked better without the "mystery" angle, especially since it seems to come from left field midway through the film and then becomes all-pervasive, in direct contrast to the semi-documentary "romantic comedy travelogue" feel of the first half.
It is hard to believe that Shonali is a first time director, who captured on celluloid a slice of life that was actually manufactured.
This movie was a total surprise from the first scene.
I don't think anyone can watch this--especially the first 15 minutes--without wondering where Max's incredible anger comes from.
For the first two acts, it seems a black comedy that is heading down a clichÃ©d path toward ignominy.
Things go well for him at first as she appears as subservient as advertised, but when he embarrasses her (and himself) in front of his friends at a poker night, he finds that she is much more than just a prim and proper housewife.
Having grown up idolising the great man and having seen all his movies countless times, when I first saw the "Curse of the Dragon" documentary I was most intrigued by an interview which was conducted with Bruce's long time friend, colleague and training partner Dan Inosanto where Bruce's original concept for "Game of Death" was brought to light.
The first Bruce Lee documentary that tells the real story behind one of the most fascinating men of the 20th Century.
I actually saw this on AMC for the first time and was blown away by the in-depth interviews with Bruce, not to mention his spectacular demonstrations.
To be frank, from the first few minutes I felt that knot in my stomach that comes from deep apprehension and anxiety; I was being manipulated from the off, and it just got more and more intense.
He allowed first hand witnesses to speak freely.
Once they started working together Buster Keaton and Roscoe Arbuckle made their first half-dozen short comedies in New York, from spring through fall of 1917.
(I first saw this movie at a public screening as part of a Keaton festival some years ago, and although it had been going over fairly well up to that point this sequence totally killed the laughter for the duration of the film.)
There are a lot of superb silent moments, as for example, the first and unseen kiss in the garden, the night meadow scene, each and every shot starring the heartbreaking Dame Norma Shearer and a charming Herr Ramon Novarro.
"The Student Prince in Old Heidelberg" is a film about youthful dreams, the first painful love and the greatness and illness of falling in love.
"The Student Prince in Old Heidelberg" is a first rate silent film production, expertly directed by Ernst Lubitsch.
Freed from the strictures of the Karlsburg royal palace to attend University, THE STUDENT PRINCE IN OLD HEIDELBERG experiences true love for the first time.
When he first wakes up in the catacombs, the room is bathed in a warm light, it's clean and Hawaiian style music is playing.
You'll be AMAZED at the things you missed the first time.
( black and white horrors ).If anyone can help me out it would be appreciated.I will pay money and costs of shipping or exchange for some items from Australia ie White pointers (Shark) tooth pendant.On vhs tape can be either ntsc or pal recordings.Just remember you can never replace the memories or scared feelings that these old hammer horrors gave us when we were young and impressionable.I gave this a 10 rating cos it was the first horror film i saw and the fond memories of how scared i was are still with me to this day 30 years later.
I first seen it on our national TV before more that 10 years and I was stunned !
To say the least, the first 30 minutes is certainly awesome, considering the premise: what would you do if the end of the world was fast approaching.
We begin to sense the escape's ultimate futility on the pre-dawn Wilshire roof top while an odd collection of passengers line up two-by-two for the first leg of their voyage to sanctuary in a water rich hidden valley of Antarctica.
Now, I must admit that I missed the first few minutes of the movie.
If you feel you must see it, rent it first!!
I first saw this movie 15 years ago; then the night before last I stumbled onto it again.
For the first and only time in my life I experienced the true panic and fear of 'the end'.
The plot is incredibly good, with much more depth than I thought after seeing it the first time - at that time I mistakenly thought it was a little flawed.
I first saw this movie on video around the time it was produced.
This pretentious film focuses entirely on the director for all but the first thirty minutes of the film.
I screened it among a film society audience of highly forgiving film lovers, and I believe it was the first film shown in our forum to have had audience members leave, continuously throughout the movie.
This is a qualified 10 out of 10 as the first hour or so of this documentary is great, the last half hour and/or the 90 minute total length started to put me too sleep.
I thought the first hour was magical.
I see from the other comments that this sort of nonsense appealed strongly to teen-age girls when first viewed.
The first thing we should realize here is that I have judged this movie not by how professional the actors are or how good the filming is, but for the general feeling this movie gives you.
Later on we see Hoffman in a different light as if completing the Birdman of Alcatraz analogy, Hoffman's role is similar to that of Telly Savalas who's a tough character when we first meet him in Birdman, but later becomes acclimated to prison life.
******CONTAINS SPOILERS****I watched the movie for the first time when I was really young and remembered it being really gripping and intimidating(especially the bug scenes).
I still enjoyed the first half of the film up until they leave the leper but after that the pace gets strangely confusing.
I remember the first time I watched it with my pa', I was 7 or something, and I was really captured by its deep humanity.
That was the first and last time I watched this movie since this year, when I found it in a store and immediately bought it.
In any case, he may mark the first time Hollywood created a gay character - at least in a big-budget film - who is sympathetic, not stereotypical or ridiculous or treacherous, and is given his fair share of personal dignity.
The first half of the story is much more compelling than what happens in the final years and the last half-hour of the film is a bit sluggish in pacing.
My first viewing of the film years ago made an indelible impression on me, but I must confess that later viewings convinced me that it is not exactly flawless in that the pacing is sometimes much too slow and the ending is somewhat unsatisfying.
Regarding color, this documentary is where I first heard about the fabulously- filmed movie, "Days Of Heaven" (1978), which has become one of my all-time favorites.
When she meets and romances, almost the very first day, hunky Bill, "Big Shot On Campus" - he just may be able to give the push she needs to make her dream come true.
My first disappointment came with the marketing strategy used in the promotion.
When I first started seeing the comercials for the "lost season" of the Real World.
I have seen other movies by MTV films, and I would have to say that this is the first one where they really dropped the ball.
I was taken back the first moments of the movie.
I struggled through the first episode trying to understand just how on earth such a desperate show could ever be greenlit.
Ignore the first couple comments which are brutally obvious plants.
Maybe the future episodes will be different but the first one was TVPG.
This show premiered last night on tbs and at first i thought it was just gonna be a new show with no point.
That is if the sting of "Daisy Does America" hasn't worn off....  "10 Items or Less" establishes all the same clichÃ©s of being a grocery clerk that any common customer could see while wrangling this menagerie of failed auditions for Mad TV under the frayed control of manager Leslie, who assumes ownership of the family store after his father dies in a supposedly comedic fashion (a heart attack that knocks over a display stand, with the nearby employee fixing the stand first before helping the fallen owner).
I caught the first episode in its first run and have seen subsequent episodes "on demand", which is a powerful tool for a late-night TBS series.
:)  Okay, from the very first time I saw the previews, I knew it was a rip off of THE OFFICE and that Leslie was a poor substitute for Michael Scott.
"10 Items or Less" is a poor shadow of THE OFFICE, but I have to admit that I was laughing from the first scene, but it was the awkwardness of Leslie in his new situation as an owner/manager of Greens & Grain.
The first time I saw this movie I thought it was entertaining.
The first episode did a nice job of introducing the characters with humor and even had a little dramatic tension.
The first being, I don't believe that skinny is pretty.
I promise you that, no matter how sweet and gentle, the first person that befriends me to attempt to save me from my food will have a very rude awakening.
Rather abruptly - and permanently - veering from its storyline at first confused this viewer.
At first he appears a doddering derelict, worse than a bum, covered with dirt, inarticulate and almost blind, clearly crazy.
When asked his age he holds up his fingers twice, and you realize he thinks he's twenty -- the age he was when he was first imprisoned.
The first disaster is that Spiro disappears from the nuns' institution where they have left him.
I first saw 'Lamerica' at its British premiere at the Edinburgh film festival.
They are first pulled in under the guise that he is making a documentary about "Sherman".
The first 1/2 hour poses an interesting premise.
I intended to watch only the first ten or fifteen minutes of this film, on a recommendation by a professor.
I liked all of that and it was a fresh approach when it first came out.
However, through an ingenious perspective shift near the end of the movie, we realize that the father is not nearly so free of blame as it first appeared.
It is the fate of all of us to direct our first sexual impulse towards our mother and our first hatred against our father.
This is also the first time I would place an American film on the same rung as one of the Dutch-language pieces that has elevated Paul Verhoeven to godhood in my viewpoint.
It is a complex film and not every viewer will understand it at first.
SOME SPOILERS TO FOLLOW (IMDB requires that I draw attention to these spoilers to provide readers with a choice but I should point out that I consider them imperative to a proper understanding of the film, although they may be read equally well after one's first viewing)  At the commencement of the film Bernard is a successful academic and writer but one whose work has been overlooked in recent years.
Later in the film we learn that his wife (played by Laura Linney) has been published in the New Yorker and subsequently shall have her first novel published.
At first, it seems that they just don't love each other anymore; later, new facts come to light in front of their sons' Walt (Jesse Eisenberg) and Frank (Owen Kline) eyes.
When she propitiates the demise of her family it's at first seen as an act of selfish abandonment, but one look at Bernard and his abrasive, self-obsessed, hurtful personality and all is explained.
Seeing it for the first time is truly the start of a romance with ideals that will live in you long after credits end.
Walt is attempting to begin a sexual awakening as well with his first girlfriend but is getting all the wrong comic advice from Bernard who is clueless with the opposite sex as he is also trying to have sex with Lili while burning over Joan who has hooked up with Frank's tennis instructor Ivan (a doofy Baldwin whose every other utterance is "Brother").
He has a keen touch with his actors Â especially Daniels, the centerpiece character, who is brilliantly funny, touching and head-shaking misanthropic at the absurdity of his situation (at one point he says glibly with a touch of melancholy, "that's my home which I used to live inÂas you may know", to his son during one of their jaunts back and forth) that has echoes of his first fine role as Flap, the philandering English professor husband of the doomed Debra Winger in "Terms of Endearment", suggesting a bookend to what Flap may have become ultimately (and I'm damned if I'm not right at one point Walt is looking at his father's novel's backflap and the photo suggests a still from that film!).
This a wonderful film imbued with a fantastic sense of place and time and small details in which the viewer can find great delight (like the hilarious scene where Jeff Daniels takes his teenage son and the kid's new girlfriend to see David Lynch's "Blue Velvet" instead of the first choice "Short Circuit" or the closing shot of the actual squid fighting a whale at the NYC Musueum of Natural History).
Kline hits a home-run in his first major role.
Other outstanding performances include William Baldwin (the one from "Backdraft"), Holly Feifer (as Eisenberg's first girlfriend) and Anna Paquin (underused, but still very effective).
Brooklyn College was a hotbed of activism and liberal arts when I first encountered Jonathan Baumbach (rechristened "Bernard" in the film, a sly wink at Jonathan's mentor and hero, Bernard Malamud).
I have never read any of the books that these movies are based on, so maybe part IV is a more faithful adaptation than the first movie.
But I felt like it took out all the interesting elements from the first Howling, left the boring stretches, and then added in some new boring elements.
If you've seen the first, you'll be familiar with the structure of part IV: A writer is stressed out, so she and her husband go to a small town to relax.
At least the first three movies weren't this boring.
This is actually closer to the book that Gary Brandner wrote that was the basis for the first movie, but being close to the book doesn't make this movie any good.
This movie ranks #2 on my worst movies list (The first one of course, being Hard Rock Zombies).
First (and most important of all) this movie is so S-L-O-W, nothing happens in the first 60-70 minutes, except for a anxious woman hearing sounds, and her husband cheating her with the local grocery ho.
I've seen many sequels of the original Howling (can't keep track how many actually) but this had my mouth drop wide open right after the first few minutes of it.
The concept is almost exactly the same as in the first installment but this one sticks quite firmly to the original book.
But it's pretty much like watching the first movie remade by bunch of talentless amateurs (probably even retarded ones).
And to stay awake through the whole movie you should not have seen the first because it kinda gives EVERYTHING away.
Today was the first time I actually saw this movie (I know, I'm late), but I think it was a really good movie.
They made the same mistake with "Batman and robin", it just wasn't aimed at the same audience who liked the first Batman movie.
As if the first movie was not painful enough to watch, we have another one (yawn!).
This is just a sucky part 2 and difficult movie to get into, unlike the first one.
This sequel makes little a note to the first one, remember the one with Kevin Bacon.
Frank Turner (played by Peter Facinelli) are the first to arrive on the scene but to their utmost shock the FEDS arrive soon after and take over the bizarre murder case.
I hope that the special effects will be better than the first one.
skip to the last paragraph) this is just my opinion, but the first movie, up until Kraine (Bacon) changed the passwords on the lab doors, the movie was all about what we'd do (or what we'd fantasize about doing, anyway) if we were invisible.
In the first movie, Kevin Bacon is actually there all the time, and he becomes "visible" in several ways; blood splatter, water, plugs on head, infrared, manipulating objects (and body parts) etc.
You don't even see the actual anatomic transformation, You do see; Slater washing some blood of his face with tap water, two invisible guys fighting in the rain, footsteps on grass and carpets, but nothing even close to the sleeping redhead in the first movie.
As it stands, HM2 is predictable straight to DVD junk that offers very little to fans of the first film: what effects there are have a distinctly cheap look; Slater phones in the majority of his performance (he only actually appears in a brief flashback); the script and direction are bland; and the film ends rather abruptly with the highly trained Griffin being defeated all too easily by Turner.
Don't let Hollow Man 2 lure you in if you liked the first.
I mean really, the first film was pretty good because it actually tried and succeeded in being entertaining.
It is a shame that sequels only follow up the horror and the violence, the first movie was quite interesting at least during the first half, with impressive special effects on Kevin Bacon and the gorilla.
The same fate befell "Final Destination" where the first movie raised lot of interesting philosophical questions, and the sequels were crap.
Anyway, I first saw the movie with a friend years back and whenever we get together we still can't help throwing out a "who's idea was the corn?
I knew Hollow Man 2 was in production, and as a fan of the first movie I was a little non-plussed to find the sequel getting a Direct-to-DVD release.
I was pleasantly surprised therefore to find an engaging little movie - very much in the spirit of the first (no brain, no logic, full speed ahead with cardboard characters and a plot straight from the back of a 40-year-old comic).
To the people that are slating this saying "It's not as good as the first, really disappointed" etc etc, I simply have to wonder exactly what they were expecting!
After Lauren is dropped off at her school, a young man is wearing a Columbine jacket, which is the first we hear about what school officially she attends.
I found Streisand's character to be irritating at first, and more and more likable as the movie progresses.
I still felt the film was relevant even watching the video 35 years after I first saw the movie in a theater.
", George Segal makes Felix a lovably insecure schlub and provides great chemistry with Streisand in her first non-singing role.
Barbra is doing this film soon after winning an Academy Award for Best Actress in her first film (Funny Girl).
It has to be added that this is the first major film in which a major actress says f*ck.
THE OWL AND THE PUSSYCAT is also notable for giving the current female singing sensation Â Barbra Streisand Â her first non-musical role; in fact, it led to other wacky comedy vehicles: foremost among them WHAT'S UP, DOC?
It's original and has some clever puns on the whole Lewis and Clark adventure - it's essentially about two guys (Matthew Perry and Farley) who decide to "beat" Lewis and Clark by "getting there first."
Streisand, her Brooklynese so thick she sometimes lapses into Cockney, wears tacky, hilarious hooker-outfits, but her shrillness isn't modulated (at least not in the first act) and she can sometimes be grating.
It was an historic word also, the first time a star had ever  said it in a major film.
I first caught this movie when it aired on CW a few months ago.
Apparently, the creature is really after the latter Â and eventually he gets to work on executing his personal vendettaÂ   Being a Spanish-British co-production, the film features two English actresses among the bevy of willing beauties Â Susan George (whose contribution is the most important, even if it comes exactly half-way through the film and extends to little over 30 minutes of screen-time) and Fiona Lewis (who appears early on and is actually the shark's first victim).
I'm on episode 7 of the first season, but I've already bought all four seasons and am in for the long haul.
Although he is easy to underestimate at first, he grows into his role, showing astonishing decisiveness and strength.
They don't take or make a false step from the first frame to the last.
There is also a tune in the film when something bad is about to happen, when you hear it for the first time in the movie recognize the tune immediately, when you hear it you feel uncomfortable and are at the tip of your seat.
As Spadaccini's first horror film, he is proving himself to be quite an evolving polymath of film genres.
Okay, first off, this film is not everybody's cup of tea.
If this is an first time attempt which i think it is then it is a very good attempt.
The first song "Tinka Tinka" is wonderfully subdued yet stirring and will stick with the viewer for long after viewing the movie.
Sanjay F. Gupta made a terrific film for his first attempt he only made one film so far but still he is one of my favourite directors.
the flashback scene of John's first kill, was in animation, black and white for John's dream and sepia for the song Tera Hi Karam when he was in huge depression.
Where he was in the club during the song Ishq Nachaya Kare dressed like Eric Draven in The Crow and he killed the first man in his hit list.
I first saw this film when I was 17.
I watched it the first time and giggle a bit, I watched it the second time and laughed here and there, I watched it for the third time and laughed nearly all the way through!
**SPOILERS** Even though the advertising for the movie "Spectres" makes it look like a ghost story it's a lot deeper and philosophical then you would have first expected it to be.
At first thinking that Kelly is suffering from the aftermath of her suicide attempt Laura sends her to a psychiatrist Dr. Halsey, Dean Haglund.
If I saw this movie with almost anyone else cast in Chris Farley's part I probably, well, would have never seen it in the first place, but if I did I would have given it a lousy review.
The film sags in the first hour because there is too much exposition (and some attempts at social-drama undertones), and it doesn't much improve when the actual heist begins.
The first part of the movie deals with the individual reasons of the three women of different social backgrounds to plan and execute the heist.
She states that if he does the first phone call she makes will bee to his wife.
The first was Susan Saint James who looked great in jeans and everything else she wore.
I saw this at the movies when it first came out and found it to be very funny and enjoyable.
At first we give Edwards kudos for deselecting him, but when Fontenot lets it be known that he'll only join the expedition if his hot Indian woman (she's not a spouse or girlfriend to him, but property), Shaquinna (Lisa Barbuscia), can also come along, Edwards figures that they probably won't need a translator's services that badly anyway, so brings him on the journey.
I first saw this movie when I was about eight or nine, about thirty years ago, on morning television.
I tawt eet was somtheeng bad," and an adolescent boy smoking his first stick).
As we see in the first part of the film, there are at least three pine trees before we see the first woman bashed in the head with a rock and then planted.
The first time I saw the movie was in the theater at which time I laughed at the "obvious" laugh-parts, but it was not until I had seen it another two or three times before I picked up on the absolutely hysterical dialogue, terriffic comedy styles of the various supporting characters, and the sheer brilliance and irony the script presents.
Never be turned off by the first glance of this film.
At first the change of scenery does Sarah good until John's unknown French daughter, Julie (Ludivine Sagnier), rudely interrupts the idyllic atmosphere.
Note: This first paragraph is spoiler free.
Also the very end with the wave sequences of both Julia and Julie shows the first as it really happened, and the second as she imagined it.
I first saw "With Friends Like These..." on video and assumed that it had gone straight to video.
This film first shook me with its great music, which I later realized as being a classic move by Ozon, then with its setting and ending.
When we first meet what we later find out to be a hugely successful author with many adoring fans and numerously successful books, there is a deliberately anti-climatic sense about the character.
Dive head first into the mystery and intrigue of `Swimming Pool'.
In fact, it was the pool scene with him standing over Julie that first convinced me I was watching a depiction of the writing process.
The first half of the movie involves the comedy of how the secret gets spread (no, not by the actors' wives, but by actor envy and insecurity).
I first saw the trailer for this film at Fredddy vs. Jason back in '03 and me and my friend were in hysterics at how lame it looked.
I first saw this film on HBO in 2005 and now own it.
The movie was really too slow for me for the first 70 mintues, however, and I kept wondering, what is the point of painting us a pictures of this dour and unhappy author's interactions with a lustful irresponsible bratty young woman?
I might not find the first 70 minutes too slow after all.  
Swimming Pool is a first rate film from French genius FranÃ§ois Ozon.
I think it was while watching "Dark Command," the John Wayne movie (though Claire Trevor gets first billing, for some reason), that I first realized Roy Rogers was really an excellent actor.
The first two episodes are hurt by a weak narrative (the protagonists appear to recall information they should not be privy to), while the last chapter is hurt by miscasting (neither Douglas nor Angeli looks quite comfortable doing these gymnastic moves).
The first stars Kirk Douglas as a circus artist.
Rachmaninoff's "Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini" is the gorgeous music to which Moira Shearer danced her lovely ballet in the first story.
It is sometimes used in period movies whose action takes place before the piece was actually written & first performed.
In the first one, a ballet dancer is forbidden to dance because she has health problems.
The first story The Jealous Lover concerns ballet impresario James Mason and his protÃ©gÃ© Moira Shearer.
Vincente Minnelli did the second story, Gottfried Reinhardt directed the first and third.
The first story is the best.
It is the first color film she did.
But it is the first, which deserves 11 out of 10, which makes this film a "must see."
Several years ago, when I first saw this movie, I felt that it was melodramatic with awkward dialogue and clumsy direction, and not worth my time, except for the dancing segment with Moira Shearer and James Mason ("Jealous Lover").
These three leading ladies were certainly chosen for their youthful radiance and sensitivity, and the luminous close-ups plus the saturated color and lush music by the great Rozsa (who appears as the conductor in the first segment) lend a baroque richness to each of the segments reminiscent of Visconti's "Senso," or possibly even "Il Gattopardo."
Second, the camera work and lighting are excellent, both subtle and dramatic at the same time, fully enhancing the flashback aspect and sense of fantasy in all of the stories and revealing the delicacy and individuality of the three women, not to mention the great Agnes Moorehead in the first segment.
Both of Wynorski's sequels are completely unrelated to the first Sorority House Massacre, rendering that film obsolete for either understanding the inconsequential plot or enjoying the scatterbrained characters and their extremely toned bodies.
Even the first fight scene with Orville is choreographed in an identical fashion (the knife to the guts is in the same place, as is the strangulation by handy extension cord).
The same girl manages to take a shower first again (Melissa Moore), her spontaneous undressing moderated by remarkably silly saxophone riffs.
The film's second half is better than its first, and I enjoyed the end quite a bit.
if you want to see plenty of hot chicks showering Goofy violence and the overall awesomeness of Orville check this movie out i first saw it on USA network years ago and have been wanting more Orville ever since Check it out!!
It may be the best of the trilogy, downplaying the derivative slasher element that defined the first two films and instead taking an exuberant action-horror-comedy slant (the title, in case it wasn't obvious, is an obvious spoof of Die Hard).
The one thing that REALLY got on my nerves bad (I mean besides the vampires dancing like zombies half the time), was the fact that logos on shirts were blurred out, and since a good deal of the cast wears a jersey during the first half of the film, this became extremely distracting and almost made the film unwatchable.
While in the right hands the scenario of an innocent woman at the mercy of psychos with neither knowing where the other is can be (and has been) done effectively, here Klenhard's sloppy directing and slack writing wipe out any suspense and rack up the unsubtle hints ("You could scream for days and nobody could hear you") while the implausibilities steadily get in the way of any effectiveness - one of the few decent moments comes when Josie is trying to get out of the locked-up condo where most of the action takes place and finds she's trying to force the gate open with the plank the villains used to beat her friend to death, but then you're wondering why they dragged her corpse out of her apartment in the first place.
The best part about American Desi is that it is realistic and both first and second generation Indian-Americans can watch it and relate to it on a personal level.
No structure, clichÃ©d plot stereotyped characters and all the recognition in the world just because it was the first Indian American film released into the marketplace?
The main female character falls in love with the main character and is not a typical American type character where a man and a woman sleep with each other during the first few weeks.
The first five minutes of this film had my friend and me squirming in our seats, convinced we were about to see another tired gay comedy with stereotypical characters and an all-too-obvious plot line.
Instead, the film's soul is truly in the scripted storyline and in the very digestible way we are taken on one character's drunken and stumbling path to the first spark of his own electric and glittery evolution.
This film knows it's audience--within the first 10 minutes there are about 5 full frontal nude men shown.
Plotwise I hated it at first--Luke was obnoxious, VERY effeminate and just annoying.
Meerkat Manor isn't on here in Australia at the moment but I have the first 3 seasons on DVD so I can watch it whenever I like.
The film seems too stagey at first and would be easy to just turn off, but given a good half an hour to develop, it kicks into gear later.
However, I was pleasantly surprised...at least for the first half of the film.
The first season ended with a huge mystery that they say will be explained when the second season opens.
A year later in the June of 1968 history would be made when Elvis once again entered a stage for the first time in 7 years to record his TV special for NBC now affectionately known as 'the Comeback'.
I'm kicking myself for having missed this show until the final week of the first season (at least I managed to catch several repeats inside of a single night!).
It's science first, and scientists filming in the wild generally interfere with nature's own course to the least extent possible.
This is one of the first Bud Abbott and Lou Costello movies that I had ever seen in my life.
The first I can understand, but who does he get to aid him in his second objective.
It was the first - and unfortunately, only - film made by her production company Marilyn Monroe Productions and was also the first time she had made a film abroad.
For MM's first outing with "Marilyn Monroe Productions" producing this epic film, I am somewhat disappointed.
It is a first class production.
When Marilyn first goes to the embassy to meet the Grand Duke and ends up getting tipsy is an absolute riot.
From waiting patiently for the very first show to appear, I watched that episode and I have watched and enjoyed each and ever episode since the first one!
Perhaps Olivier himself was less than impressed by the film, as it was his first experience of directing other than his three famous Shakespeare adaptations, and it was to be his last until he directed a version of Chekhov's 'The Three Sisters' thirteen years later.
First, he never gets to first base with her (she gets drunk and falls asleep, despite his varied attempts to get her into the right mood and position).
Olivier was to direct her, his first film direction assignment since RICHARD III.
The name kind of makes sense anyway, i'll bet that half the people who hate this movie didn't make it through the first hour.
Dame (as Paul) gets his best lines, with the funniest delivery, in the first section of the film, where he continually breaks the mood.
I saw this movie for the first time about a year after its theatrical release, and I seem to remember it receiving mediocre reviews at the time it was released.
"The Mayans were presented as savages" - that is because they were(check out their rituals), or what is your definition of a savage?There is another moment in the film:the bad guy threatens Jaguar Paw he would skin him alive and then wear his skin.I first thought, well that was original of Gibson, but then I found out on the internet that skinning your enemies and wearing their skin was an ACTUAL RITUAL of the Mayans.Yes they were savages, and I don't care how many Mexicans(who think they are the legacy of the Mayans, which they are not) feel offended by this movie.
During the first third of the action, Gibson acquaints us with a small village of hunters isolated in a distant corner of the rain forest.
The Spaniards were very much astonished when they witnessed their first human sacrifice, talk about cultural clash.
Not that "first nation" communities in America all made nice with each other before the Europeans arrived.
I won't spoil the plot (or lack thereof) but if you've seen the trailer you've seen the first hour of the movie.
The achievements of the post-Classic period, 900-1521 A.D., were a far cry from the CLassic Period; the cities were in decay and the people scattered; nothing of the city life portrayed in the movie existed in 1519, when Cortes first entered the Yucatan peninsula.
By the time of Cortes' first landing on San Juan de UlÃºa island near the future city of Veracruz in 1518 (no other Spaniards had landed in Mexico other than a couple of shipwrecks in 1511 or so), the Mayan city states (no where near Veracruz, where Cortes landed) had long since disappeared.
The first 95 minutes or so -- up to the eclipse -- is possibly the best movie to date in 2006.
After the eclipse, however, the movie settles into a conventional "chase" mode which, though interesting, can't compare to the first 95 minutes.
This is an interesting movie for many reasons, the first being its Mayan language.
This is the first movie I have ever been to where people actually walked out of the theater.
I don't want to get into any spoilers but let me tell you there are, at least, 4 moments - not merely technical but emotional - that are a first for the movies.
Okay let me get this out of the way first thing.
This is the first part in a trilogy of "Flesh" films.
first time I saw it I thought it was lame but with time and appreciation for independent films I developed a special appreciation for this movie after working at an advertising agency for 3 years.
I loved it the first and only time I saw it years ago on HBO or Showtime of something like that and I laughed my ass off.
I first saw this movie more than 30 years ago whilst studying French in high school.
Still, this was my first Visconti and I was pretty impressed.
Too bad it's not available on VHS or DVD, when I first saw this film years ago I was blown away , the mood it evokes is totally what living life day to day is all about , pure existentialism, my father was one and I have some of that in me , so I totally got it , Life is but a fleeting moment by moment .Existentialist ,Camus was one along with Sartre it's the same day everyday ,only we ,measure our own decay with the man made notion of time.Based on Camus's novel This film will either impress you or bore you.But then again it all depends on how you look at life.
And Anna Karina was never more beautiful (especially in her first nude scene).
So when the film at first appears to be about the integrity of gay fiction -- compromising orientation and honesty to pander to a straight public -- there is a promise of THE DYING GAUL being a story of substance.
At first he's a money-obsessed movie producer (the kind that seem to fill Hollywood these days), but as the movie goes on, he fleshes out his character and becomes a pretty sympathetic man.
The writer, at first, resists because the screenplay is based upon his relationship with his own deceased lover, but is soon won over by the charismatic producer.
I'm convinced that fifty years from now film historians will be looking back and wondering why Campbell Scott wasn't a megastar from his first role on.
I also saw this film at the first screening at the Seattle International Film Festival.
Jeffrey introduces her to Robert first via his screenplay, which moves her to tears (as he is deleting all 1172 instances of Maurice and changing it to Maggie).
(Then again, anyone who's come into the Internet for the first time does so with a sense of novelty that only progressively, after much disappointment, loses its truthfulness.)
Surely to G-d this was not the first time Campbell Scott's character had stepped out on his wife so she must have known something was going on.
From the first scenes between Peter Sarsgaard, Robert, and the handsome Cambell Scott, Jefferey, this film doesn't ring true to me as a writer in Los Angeles, as he heads to meet a Studio executive in such a nonchalant and unprofessional manner to discuss the purchase of his script THE DYING GAUL.
At first Robert refuses, but he is offered a million dollars, and he needs that money.
She flits around the first 20 minutes of this movie in a bra and panties, toyingly svelt but with a panther-like quality you only realize later.
Campbell Scott, Peter Sarsgaard, and Patricia Clarkson consistently do interesting work and are appearing together for the first time.
In one of the first scenes Robert (Peter Sarsgaard) elaborates on the title of his screenplay, "The Dying Gaul," with studio executive Jeffrey (Campbell Scott.)
Robert at first refuses to 'sell out' but eventually gives in and does the re-write.
Craig Lucas, in this his first directorial outing, proves to be an artist with style, with vision, and with guts to put tough material into visual form.
At first, he doesn't seem to have a say so in his plea.
Jack Moore gets himself in a very bad situation with a young Chinese woman, he some what falls in love with this gal on first sight and winds up in bed with her and all kinds of problems seem to happen.
Most likely it was because it was on HBO and I missed the first thirty minutes.
the plot is completely predictable after the first five minutes, the acting is hammier than a pig farm, and there is nothing special about the special effects.
The big event happens within the first minutes of the movie: the remainder of our time is spent wondering how those trapped will escape and will they do it in time to avoid the dastardly plot of the Bad Guy, in this case the eely Stuart.
No, there are NO spoilers in this comment - I'm only talking about what happens in the first 15 minutes of this movie.
the time spent developing the chars in the first half was great.
However, the movie largely ignores all of that after the first 20 or so minutes and instead focuses on the story of Nick Diaz (Jsu Garcia, whose first name appears to be missing at least one vowel).
Strict one-child policies forbid any couples having a second child, but the Brennick's first child died at birth so they attempt to get away with a second pregnancy.
Marine Captain John Brennick & his wife, who is pregnant with her second child (the first died at birth), are caught at a checkpoint & sent to the Fortress, a secluded underground prison complex situated in the middle of a desert.
***Possible Spoiler Attached*** * * *  At first glance this film is just another sci-fi flick with a mediocre plot and sometimes dull dramatics.
Their first child died and during an attempt to cross the border into Mexico, the land of the free(sic), they are taken prisoner.
It deals with complex social issues; those of overpopulation (which generally means first world values foisted on third world countries), incarceration in prisons run by private companies (a concept currently being adopted world-wide), and the love of a man for his wife and child.
Getting sent to prison for having a second baby even though the first one died?
When seeing this film the first time, it makes me wonder why they don't allow prisoners to dream good things about intimacy, yet they allow assault by that 187 guy.
So what's being pointed out in this movie is that murder is not allowed in the public, but in prison, the warden is allowed to murder whoever he wants and if a prison doesn't obey his orders to murder someone, they get punished, and they may of been in there in the first place for murder.
Fortress was his first entry to non-horror oriented field, even though Fortress still has many horror elements, too.
It was filmed entirely in Australia and the film was first big budget movie for Gordon.
Anyways, today I watched my first true silent film.
I found the original FIST OF THE NORTH incredibly moving when I first saw it.
The first 14mins (about the length of a He-man cartoon) are the best.
Fairbanks spends the first 20 minutes scene-setting with plenty of stealing and acrobatics, then tries to steal from the Caliph of Bagdad but falls in love with his beautiful daughter instead.
Anna May Wong plays an evil traitor but confidante to the Princess, a role she reprised 10 years later in Chu-Chin-Chow the first film version of which appeared the year before this, and which provided some of the story here too.
If you are not a fan of old movies, you really have to keep those things in mind when watching "The Thief of Baghdad" for the first time.
The movie tells a good story, although one that sputters and stalls a few times in the first 30 minutes.
In fact, the first five minutes of the film are incredibly entertaining the way he manages to pickpocket wealthy patrons, and effortlessly fling his way up to a balcony with just a long rope and a donkey.
He fulfills the prophecy of the princess by being the first to touch the rose of the tree.
I saw this movie for the first time, about twenty five years ago.
George Gerswin's "Rhapsody in Blue" is performed for the first time in NYC.
Calvin Coolidge gives the first presidential radio broadcast.
We have here our first Douglas Fairbanks movie, our first all-out adventure movie, and one of the earliest all-out special effects movies.
These scenes contain lots of special effects (the first we've seen so far) that must have been quite impressive for the day.
I first saw this on cable, AMC, I think, and I loved it.
Fantasy films have been around since silent films first took the world by storm.
This silent film was the first of its kind, not in its theme of adventure but in its stunning visuals and effects.
There are a couple of slow spots, the Thief's repentance scene and his first time alone with the Princess go on a little too long, but so much else happens in the film that these momentary slowdowns are easily overlooked.
We also get the bonus of seeing Anna May Wong, in her first 'big' role, so beautifully slinky as the evil Mongol slave / spy.
You can see him in 'Seven Samurai' (1954) and the first 'Musashi' movie, 'Mushasi Miyamoto' (1954) with Toshiro Mifune.
Especially toward the ending the movie starts to become greatly adventurous after a sort of slower middle and good first part.
I first viewed this movie in 1924 at age 6 yrs--probably the first movie I ever saw.
It didn't really have very much of a movie feel to it after the first few minutes or so but I still enjoyed it and hope Ms. Lansbury's in good enough health to make a new `episode' or two.
It was refreshing to watch a "Who done it" that wasn't easily solved in the first 10 minutes of the movie.
Of the 3, only "The Curse of Dracula" completed its story (Although when the series first aired, It was already on Chapter VI (But then, none of the three started on its first chapter).
I was a mere child when "Here's Lucy" aired first run on television and I loved it.
There's the 'generation gap' for ya - those that know and have established views and those that don't and like what they see for the first time.
I loved the first Crypt movie & love this one even more.
While the first film was a solid, self-contained horror flick with a touch of humor and a fair amount of sophistication and imagination, Bordello of Blood falls apart under poor direction and a far too free-spirited nature.
Despite it's problems Bordello Of Blood still manages to be an enjoyable tongue in cheek piece of hokum for lovers of the genre, but it's unlikely to convert anyone else, and isn't a patch on the first Crypt film.
Let me first start this off by saying any movie with Corey Feldman in it will automatically lose one star from me.
A lot people will disagree that this is no where near as good as Universal/ Tales from the Crypt first movie 'Demon Knight' - I personally think its just as good.
Which the first movie was "Demon Knight", it was a modest box office success.
Amidst the sound of a nightclub, the first words the audience hears is "We are family..." This movie reminds people that no family is perfect.It shows the similarities between the contrasting serious and traditional family versus the lively, unorthodox family.
My first impression of Rafe is that he's a jerk, but I discovered (rather quickly) that he is rather good-natured and good-intentioned, and that he truly wants to help Katherine out.
When you're first billed, doesn't this mean you'll show up earlier in the film?
One the same point, the entire first twenty minutes of the film is a complete drag.
For instance: 1) the scene in the first part where Belldandy uses her magic - great timing and great music; 2) the scene in the second part where Urd appears (jumping out of the TV-set) - the change in colour is brilliant; 3) the scene in the fourth part where the ancient tree is shown - wonderful animation and fantastic church organ music piece; ...well, this list can be continued.
I first saw this on AXN, the animation looks just like You're Under Arrest.
As always people who pass him by or approach him a first glance feel slightly intimidated by his deformity.
For example, when the school principal who recommended that her deformed son be placed in a "special" school and how she told him off to his face that he will thrive with the normal students and threatened to sue him, shows that her love for her son will always be first before her.
At first we do not see what he sees, but he goes to get his mother.
I have seen "Mask" many times and it remains one of my favorites, since the first time I saw it in 1986.
It was difficult to watch when it first came out.
i saw this film recently, and it was the first time a movie has made me cry for so so long.
This movie has moved me since it first came out in the 1980's.
As I said, I'd like to make a reference to the taxi drivers: the first one, played splendidly by Winona Ryder is a compulsive smoker who looks and acts like a boy and cares about nothing else than her work and becoming a mechanic; the second one, played by a phenomenal Almin Mueller Stahl, is a man who is apparently driving a car for the first time; the others include Roberto Benigni (and I think with that you can imagine the character), a black driver played by Isaach De BankolÃ© and a driver named Mika played by Matti Pellonpaa.
Of course, if like I said in the first place, "Night on Earth" had been a series of shorts, or a miniseries or whatever, I wouldn't have had this trouble writing the review.
At first Ryder is an annoying, obnoxious, Juno-like character (except she swears and doesn't talk about Argento) but then we suddenly learn that she isn't all we see her to be.
This section of the film elaborates on the idea that some people are who they are, and don't act any differently, but then we know this is never true because no matter who the person is, you get to know them and you see them as differently to how they act on first meeting.
At first he's just a confused foreigner who knows nothing about America, but then we discover that, even though he is, he's also a smart, happy guy who just loves being who he is.
The characters often speak with a much more modern speech pattern (see, for instance, Unferth's first confrontation with Beowulf, where he comes off as much more smarmy than in the poem) that is jarring to the ear and that often seems to lead, yet again, into Gaiman and Avary's unspoken goal of de-heroizing, de-mythologizing, and de-bunking the poem.
(Cain, the first murderer, who is claimed to be the ancestor of Grendel's kind, not "Cain," the not-appearing-in-the-poem whipping boy of Unferth's, that is.)
Some have said that they thought the first story with Gena Rowlands and Wyonna Ryder was weak ,but I disagree.That story was about someone being content with who they are not looking for the brass ring.
The first episode (Los Angeles) was the most boring.
After you get through the first scene with Winona and Gena Rowlands it is all gravy.
Not that the first scene is not better than most movies it is just not nearly as good as the rest.
When I first heard about "Night on Earth" I thought it was one of the typical award-winning Arthaus- movies your girlfriend forces you to watch.
So Beowulf today was my first 3-d experience, I went in expecting something good because of the 3-d, but I didn't expect the movie itself to be superb.
Ray Winston obviously is not the first actor who comes to mind when playing an ancient warrior.
Sure his cockney acting at first seems a bit bizarre coming from the character, but after a while you see the subtlety of the performance and come the final half hour you realise he's quite possibly the best thing in the movie.
My favourite segment, however, is the equally funny New York section starring Giancarlo Esposito, which is basically a culture clash between a working-class New Yorker and a foreign immigrant's first night driving a taxi.
It is not bad but it has one big problem: it is the first one.
This first episode cannot present anything spectacular, only first class character acting.
Honestly, when I saw the first minutes of this movie I thought: `O dear, I'm going to fall asleep!'
The first of five segments (in L.A.) deals with Winona Ryder (in a broad, self-conscious performance) as a cab driver who picks up Gena Rowlands, who wants to put her in a movie.
Sometimes one style was kept totally consistent, with all comedy in episode four or all tragedy in episode five, or the two styles went back and forth like in the first two.
The fifth cartoon in the series, 'Stop, Look and Hasten' brings together all the lessons learned in the first four Road Runner shorts and uses them to create a perfect marriage between the ingredients that make these characters and their antics so popular.
It began with '300' (a film I really enjoyed), and the first that stands to benefit from 300's success is Beowulf.
The first view is one of enjoyment and laughter.
Despite the fact you haven't get to know his family too much, this scene surely gonna bring tears to your eyes... for the first time in this movie.
This had to be one of the first movies I saw because I watched it for years and years after that.
The first is the one in which our psychotic monster rips an unborn fetus out of the belly of a woman and starts to eat it, while the dying husband is watching and the second one is the ending when the killer is starting to eat his own intestines after being stabbed in the belly.
It's frustrating to say the least, when watching a horror movie, if the "Bad Guy" does not even appear ONCE during the first hour.
The first, is so quick and built up that its done before it even begins.
It could be considered somewhat boring the first part of the movie, but the only time I think of that is when I watch it with friends, and they say "isn't anything going to happen?
One of his most famous was `Joe D'Amato', beneath which he produced numerous sexploitation films, mostly starring Laura Gemser (Black Emmannuel) followed by a string of gruesome horrors, the first of which was The Erotic Nights of the Living Dead.
Maybe this is a technique designed to unsettle the senses, but either way, makes viewing difficult at first.
But first there's the a long intro kill.
The plot was so sluggish I wanted to shoot myself (there was plenty of fast forwarding after sitting thru the first 30 minutes), the gore was limited and/or nonexistent, the fetus eating scene looked like it was cut and it was still boring as balls.
This is the first movie in a long time that I can honestly say scared the life out of me.
The film also has a nifty sequence where Julie finds a hidden room where Eastman's sister kept many of his first victims through the breaking of a mirror, in the mansion of a family who worked for the village.
When going into the theatre to see this I in two minds - it was my first 3D movie and I had heard good things, however I wasn't particularly taken by the concept or the trailers.
You don't need those extra scenes to enjoy this film, but if you're going to view it, you may as well get the full effect and see what lead to the banning in the first place.
In encountering the cannibal, the tourists are encountering the truth about the system which allows them to afford such luxurious holidays in the first place.
The German tourist sees himself reflected in the cannibals knife, the first dead Italian confronts a mirror shortly before death and later the boat-hiker has to smash a huge mirror in which she is reflected in order to find her way into his lair and discover his secrets.
I first watched this movie under the title of The Grim Reaper.
I finally got to see this gem, my first taste of Joe d'Amato's work.
When I first started watching popular my first thought was "how great another average teen comedy-drama about popular and unpopular teenagers in a stereotypical high school" which was, I am sure, many other peoples first impression.
Mind you, the first time you watch this show, you will be confused, but give it a few episodes, then you will agree with me.
Here comes my first proviso - Beowulf in the UK is getting a 12A rating, but there is no way I would take a 12 year old to see this film in all its eye-ball spearing, spine-snapping, ligament-tearing glory.
Beowulf is one of the first movies to be released in the UK using REALD - a system familiar to anyone who has been to a Disney park in the last 20 years.
Unfortunately the second half of the team turns out to be terrorist hijackers with no social conscience who slaughter most of the first half, leaving only two survivors to stop the ship from it's final destination.
Tucci co-directed with Scott, who plays a Cadillac salesman, the first time behind the lens for both and it shows in the form of some sloppy camera work.
The first time was during a benefit at a local independent movie house where several of the chefs from local italian restaurants cooked for the audience while Big Night was shown on the screen.
While we discover this mainly through their interaction, it is also subtlely exemplified in scenes such as the first sign of Secondo's pure delight while test driving a Cadillac, and Primo's abject happiness while discussing art and his passion for food with a woman with whom he is clearly smitten.
They might have to close their doors, but first, they plan a huge dinner, expecting Louis Prima and his band.
This was my 2nd viewing of the movie, with the first viewing quite a few years ago.
Janney adds just the right touch as Ann and you can understand the awe that she feels when she watches Primo at work and can witness his skill first hand.
Tucci and Scott said they studied a lot of film masters, and it shows here; there's nothing that screams "first film."
But not on an empty stomache, get some snacks in first eh.
Scenario:Good..The tie-in's are great,the evolution of characters are good,first the dream sequence which gives us emotions of characters to frp style evolution of their work style;first stealing math exam,second stealing their pre-test exams,then the final one..  Jean Claude Van-Damme:We see him talking french and being himself and B type movie style kick and steal sequences,what can we ask for more for this film?
Everyone seems to want to take poor Mabel's wares until Chaplin arrives on the scene and appears to defend her at first.
I watched this a second time after seeing it first some years ago.
The first time it almost frustrated me too much for an immediate response, even though I did like certain parts.
The audience is almost given the most fractured romantic tale in modern cinema, where you do (or at least I did, if not more on the first viewing then both times) feel for Matthieu who is not really as flawed a bourgeois character as in 'Discreet Charm', and is actually a rather nice and easy-going fellow.
And on a first viewing- and perhaps this shows how strong a feminist tale it is considering as a guy I got almost too subjectively involved- one might not understand why Mattieu keeps on going after Conchita, even after her intentions are made.
Conchita- played by two actresses- is sometimes (particularly on a first viewing) indistinguishable from one another, and it adds to the maddeningly seductive power she has over her old, aged rich follower.
If you are planning on watching this, get totally blitzed first.
I first saw this movie at a young age and it had a great impression on me.
If it were not for the fact that private companies like Boeing were developing planes before the military were asking for them would could have been fighting the first year of WWII in biplanes.
Watch the cigarette in his first scene with Albert in drag.
No matter how many times I have seen this film, I always spend the first hour or so relishing this particular scene.
The Army's first postwar chief of staff was the only man ever to hold the rank of General of the Armies, John J.
So when the footage of the first flight around 31 of mars 1903 came, I thought; "Wow, is this for real, is what I was thought in school just bull"... Then I remembered that the documentary was made in 1995, and this I would have heard of...
I remember watching this movie on TV when they first showed it in Sweden, I think it was in 2002.
Ambarassing at first, then, when I saw that it was a Peter Jackson movie, I could only laugh.
I have even seen worse examples here in Sweden  Though one factual error actually caught my attention, when Colin is filming the first airplane flight they use "digital-enhancement" to check the date on the mans newspaper.
At first I thought Forgotten Silver was a joke, but I changed my mind when I saw that one of the greatest of contemporary film historians and critics, Leonard Maltin, had contributed his insights to the story of film pioneer Colin McKenzie.
It's hard to comprehend how this one man gave us such things as steam-powered projection systems, the first tracking shot, the first example of a talking movie, the first color film, the first close-up.
The first talking movie, for instance, featured Chinese day laborers speaking their native tongue.
He was there filming man's first heavier-than-air flight.
I first saw MOST of this film on a flight from New Zealand to Australia, but missed the ending when the flight ended before the film.
Having watched Bunuel's first film: Un Chien Andalou, I was expecting a film of a pretentious, pointless, and angering nature.
It took me the first 10-15 minutes before I realised that this wasn't a documentary, but was in fact a mockumentary.
In fact, when it first screened in NZ it caused an uproar because it was assumed to be fact.
According to this, McKenzie filmed the first airplane flight, which preceded that of the Wright Brothers by 9 months.
He also filmed the first 'talkie', which was a failure because all the actors were speaking Chinese.
In both films the the ones making the film put themselves in the film, and the stories within the film within the films are fantastical and ambitious turns (in Loch Ness, a documentary by Werner Herzog about the search for Nessie, and in Silver, Peter Jackson's search for the elusive location and film cans of the first un-finished feature-length film made in New Zealand).
This comes out clearest in the actual silent footage itself, where MacKenzie breaks through first with color, but because he (unintentionally) shoots topless natives in the shot, he's thrown in jail after the judges deliberate long enough to watch the footage repeatedly.
At first sight, the story of New Zealand film pioneer Colin McKenzie is completely convincing.
This was such a clever way to laugh the ways of New Zealander's and the blind belief in documentary:   Kiwi's are obsessed at being best and first at as many things as possible.
I vividly remember the first time I watched this movie.
After the notorious splatter period and of course massively praised "Heavenly creatures" - his very first motion picture with a slightly more serious look and feel, the insane New Zealander Peter Jackson directed "Forgotten silver" with Costa Botes.
I watched this again tonight - probably the 4th or 5th time I've seen it since it was first screened as an (allegedly) true doco back in 1996.
It's no wonder so many people were sucked into believing it when it first screened - the Colin McKenzie saga has an emotional depth which is heartbreaking.
When I first saw this on Spanish TV years ago, I didn't know it was fake.
Peter Jackson and Costa Boeates decided to make this great mockumentary about a man called Colin McKenzie, a man who invented such things as color film, audio film and above all, made the first full length feature movie.
The film starts pretty choppy, narratively speaking, and at first it goes way too fast.
At first the tone is a little haphazard and there are some attempts at cuteness and quirkiness that don't go over so well.
The game plays excellently, the first levels play nicely, presenting a nicely challenging first person shooter.
Following up to the first Jedi Knight was not going to be easy.
Level design/LOD are great, if not quite as expertly done as that of the first, but there are definitely some marvelous things to be found... these include switches and such that you activate with your Force Powers, a vehicle or two(not spoiling the surprise in this review), and more.
The boss enemies are fun, for one immediately obvious reason, but the explanation behind them(and thus, how compelling a presence they are) just doesn't measure up to that of the first... even if there are far, far more of them.
This helps make the fact that the cut-scenes are now(as opposed to the live-action of the first) almost entirely engine-based(supplemented with a handful of CGI-sequences) easier to accept, as does the reasonable cinematography and range of animations, and the flawless programming of both.
The game-play is entertaining, and that is an(but not the only one) aspect where this really lives up to the first(and at times surpasses it... although there are parts of this that are surpassed by the first).
The power of it, the deflection... in this game, their appearance closer resemble those of the new trilogy of films, at least in part due to the release of the first of them having been to the theaters when they were making it.
The latter group is, for example, the first two Prince of Persia games, and both this and the third game(where the focus still laid largely laid in the second of the two categories) of that series attempt for a mix... in the case of both, the result is that you can hack and slash away effortlessly and, more by chance than anything else, take out boss enemies and other players.
Unlike that of the first, where it was more or less of a sporadic nature which did and which didn't, here, *every* weapon has an alternate fire mode.
Not all from the first game return, but I'm not sure there's a single FPS armory need that isn't covered.
The first one is self-explanatory... saber fights, one on one, in kind of a tournament.
It gets to become pretty obvious after a while, but at first it is wonderfully surreal, the sort of subtle gesture that Bunuel is an expert at doing.
Before watching this show, my first impression was that it is wonderful that society has taken a proactive stance against people who hurt animals and made a division of law enforcement specifically to stop it.
First things first.
Not a great movie, but a lot of great directors had some rather questionable material come out of their first hours behind a camera.
Given this, I found the photography great (with the use of a rather dark and "dusty" light) and the first battle scene rivals "Private Ryan" (does it have anything to do with the fact that Steven Spielberg is one of the producers?).
Sometimes you see a movie that opens a door into a fascinating topic, into subject matter that is completely new and original, and that was the case when I first saw "Flags of Our Fathers".
This was the first depiction of the Battle of Iwo Jima I've seen that attempts to divulge the mostly unknown faces of the men made famous by a photograph and the problems they faced at home.
This isn't a review but simply my impressions after seeing the film for the first time.
The first time you see certain things and the next time, now that you know everyone, you'll see more.
Its exploration of the almost entirely different worlds occupied by those fighting a war and those watching from a distance grabbed me from the first moment and kept me totally absorbed until the end of the final credits.
And the Battle of Iwo Jima had its historical significance given it's the first landing of Allied troops on Japanese soil, and one of the bloodiest yet with high casualties on both sides.
It's not a macro look at how the Allies secured their first foothold in Japanese soil.
Well, you get Clint Eastwood, Paul Haggis and Steven Spielberg who have teamed up for the first time to bring to the screen the new WWII story of the six soldiers who raised the American flag at Iwo Jima and became media heroes in the new film Flags of our Fathers.
Six soldiers on the 5th day of the island's invasion planted the flag of infamy just seconds after the first flag was that was erected was taken down.
The film tells three stories: first it is the WW II battle of Iwo Jima where thousands of soldiers (Japanese and American) died 'conquering' that island.
But she's reluctant to help him because Richard has her daughter, which is the only reason she continues this demeaning job in the first place.
There's simply no good explanation given as to why Richard actually had the kingpin killed in the first place.
True, this isn't the most well-written role the actress has had (well, then again, she's not really give many well-written roles in the first place, is she?)
This movie in terms of fighting would have been first rate if it weren't for the shoddy camera work and editing during most of the fights.
The first rule of shooting a martial arts scene,especially when the actor is also a talented martial artist, is to pull the camera back and shoot it with a wide angle with longer takes and not to do so many close ups with excessively fast cutting of scenes to the point where the whole body cannot be seen and consequently the FUlL power, grace and the execution of the technique is lost to the audience.
Credits must also go to the director (Chris Nahon) , making this movie as your first movie ever is a great earning !!
One of the first mainstream pictures that Li made outside of his career in China.
spoilers  I really wish I hadn't known the title of the movie before seeing it for the first time.
The first desperate escape through the corridors and passageways of the hotel, the death-defying escape from the Seine Barge and through the tunnels and sewers, the orphanage confrontation and (especially) the final scene in the police station where Lui Jian takes on a dojo full of martial artist police officers, evil twins and finally Inspector Richard.
Viewers with an interest in British history might wish to note that since the first Hanoverian came to the British throne (George I in 1714) it has been occupied by dimwits.
I spent the first 20 minutes trying to figure out if this was a joke or not.
The observer unit flies two-seat biplanes doing primarily reconnaissance work, but this does not stop Young from being a very successful pilot, downing two enemy aircraft on his first mission alone.
Though he continues to shoot down many German aircraft, he has the appalling luck of losing five observers in his first two months.
On Young's first day, he had to perform this task five times.
When I first saw this show I thought I was hearing David's self-congratulatory inner thoughts through the mic he has on his desk.
Towards the end of the first season, Drew buys a diner, and quits his back-breaking construction work to run the restaurant, and things start looking up for the Thatchers.
Also this series had it's first double eviction.
I laughed harder than when I saw "Young Frankenstein" for the first time years ago.
The fact that Robin Williams and Gene Hackman were cast seemed a bit strange to me when I first saw the names of the cast, but they were perfect for the characters they portrayed.
when it first started out in 2000, it was intended to last for one series and be a social experiment.
the first two series were this.
the first series was great, a good bunch of people with one evil fella, nick bate-men, who showed the viewing public how bad and desperate some people are for fame.
Its odd now to look back at that first series and see how normal the contestants were compared with those of recent years.
At least no one has to suffer this show any longer as the T.V stations have now come to their senses and taken 'Brother' off the air, though why it lasted as long as it did in the first place is beyond me.
They still fall for the same old, same old rubbish that was boring first time around.
Well first it's absolutely boring.
I'll confess - I loved the first series of Big Brother.
When it first started it was reality, but now people are just coming in being people completely different to what they actually are.
Natasha Henstridge does her first "real" acting in this movie as the girlfriend and is great.
This film is especially notable as being the first film of Kim Novak.
She is already a sizzler, from her very first scenes.
Fred MacMurray is the leading man in this film, excellent as usual but really too old for someone like Novak to fall in love with at first sight as called for in this story.
This movie was actually shown on PBS when it first came out, and many schools also utilize it in English class.
Fred MacMurray offers an eerily familiar, though less inspired, repeat of his performance in the Wilder classic; Kim Novak (in her first film) is no match for Stanwyck, nor did she ever become one; Richard Quine simply was not as fine a director as Hitchcock or Wilder.
Now when I watched this movie, I was confused at first and thought about turning it off, but please stick with it, as all the confusion fades and you get a crystal clear picture of why everything happens like it does.
The first girl murdered was dressed sexy.
The lead girl is first seen in the first 5 minutes of the film, for around 15 minutes and DISAPPEARS until the last 5 minutes of the film!
I will state for the record that I am a big fan of Kurt Russell and it was his name on the marquee that first made me take notice of this film.
After having seen it a number of times-- first in the mid 1980's after if was released to negative reviews and poor box office receipts--most recently last week-- I think that THE MEAN SEASON is an under-appreciated, tightly crafted suspense thriller that, in spite of what other reviews have stated, does NOT pander to clichÃ©'s--this film is old enough to have helped establish those very same tropes that have since become clichÃ©s; remember, this was made before Manhunter, Silence of the Lambs, 15 Minutes, etc etc...and was one of the first films to deal with the whole notion of fame/celebrity/serial killers and the lack of ethics displayed by journalists, who must rank somewhere below pimps and pickpockets in terms of moral turpitude.
Andy Garcia makes a very strong impression in what i think was one of his first roles in a film and he is perfectly paired with Richard Bradford, who reminds me so much of my 1st step-father ( an ex Marine Corps drill instructor turned cop)that i have absolutely no trouble believing him in the role of a burned out, bitter homicide detective.
By contrast, THE ADVENTURES OF BUCKAROO BANZAI by having it's exciting jet car sequence first, gives filmmaker Richter nowhere to go but down.
I caught the Banzi band wagon a little late in the game (first viewed it on tape around 1986) and have seen it about 3 times but never seem to tire of it's subtle (and overt) humor, colorful and well formed characters, clever and original premise and terrific ensemble cast!
When we first meet Connie, she seems to be a careless teen ager from rural California, hanging in the local mall with her best friends Jill and Laura.
Well, first off - Buckaroo Bonzai is not a great film - what it is - is a amusing, silly sci-fi romp that pretty much spoofs the whole concepts of sci-fi / screaming mad aliens / with an implausible plot and a comic book continuity.
When I watched it for the first time, I thought I must have missed something.
2 out of 10 if you dislike silliness, satire, slapstick and sci-fi..  "Only and idiot would drive head-on into another car without first having a few drinks"
Working from the highly imaginative, clever and detailed screenplay by Earl Mac Rauch, Richter has fashioned and delivered a colorful and exciting adventure filled with subtle humor, the unexpected and an array of outrageous characters, from Whorfin and the Lectroids (all of whom have the first name `John'), to Buckaroo's cohorts like `Perfect Tommy (Lewis Smith)' and New Jersey (Jeff Goldblum), to the alluring, mysterious woman Buckaroo encounters, Penny Priddy (Ellen Barkin).
He throws so much at you, in fact, that it's impossible to catch it all the first time through; but it's a movie that lends itself to repeated viewings, because it's exactly what this kind of film is supposed to be: Pure entertainment from start to finish.
And finally, I originally saw this film when it was first released, in the Harvard Square cinema in Cambridge, Mass.
Aliens hiding on Earth, all with the first name of "John".
I first watched this film in an Early Modern European history course and it blew me away.
I have not seen the first XTRO, nor have I seen XTRO 3 (!
Xtro II: The Second Encounter has nothing to do with the first Xtro mainly because the Director had the rights to the name "Xtro" but not the story of the first film so they could have any type of Alien scenario and make it a sequel to Xtro, this is why the Xtro films have no connection between each other and why the Aliens are different so Xtro II is a completely different film to the first Xtro.
Now I got to admit this is far better then the first movie.
I mean no wonder why it had nothing to do with the first movie, who'd want to be connected to that rotting British Cheese.
Now just because this is better then the first movie (like it could be worse) does not make it perfect by any stretch of the imagination.
The monster looked kind of interesting at first, but when they finally showed it in its entirety it looked like a model with crappy lighting.
It was dull it was pointless it was a rip off of alien for the first part then Aliens for the second.
Also it has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the first film Xtro, I am guessing they just called it Xtro II to try and get some people to buy it, and I am one of those people.
Well duh, it's the second movie after the first movie.
I saw this movie for the first time when I was a young teenager, and I actually liked it.
I even think the first XTRO is worth tracking down and watching it, 'cause it's a peculiar and unique little sci-fi/horror-gem.
The worst of it is, Eric Lee can actually be quite amusing, see his supporting roles in the first two 'Ring of Fire' movies, but here he proves that a leading man he is not, Gerald Okamura, one of these guys who seems to be a henchman in every martial arts film ever, is wasted as the titular villain with bad makeup.
This film is the first sound picture filmed entirely on location, with good plot, and great action by the dogs that actually DO their stuff the way they were bred to do.
The subtitles are 2 or 3 seconds late-synched for the first 65 or so minutes of Disc 1 making it very difficult to watch.
As a head trip food for thought film this is almost too much to take in.For the first Hour and fifteen minutes or so its also a finely crafted supernatural thriller.
I first saw this when I was 10 years old and it baffled me.
I loved the first Michael Davis movie, Eight Days a Week.
The second one was mostly a rehash of the first but pretty good.
What was cute and clever in the first two is now bland and bitter.
That's what I had on my mind when I first slipped in the DVD of this movie.
But curiosity was stronger than skepticism and, frankly speaking, I was pleasantly surprised from the first images.
Woland's meeting with Ivan and Berlioz, and the first confrontation of Pilate and Yeshua Ha-Notsri are not only beautifully portrayed and well performed, but in addition they matched remarkably well with the images that I had in mind when I first read the book.
The acting was typical for a movie in this genre.. nothing much there to complain about, if you're going to willingly watch a movie like this in the first place.
I think this is the first comment I've been compelled to write, and I use imdb all the time - the last scene with the girls in slow-motion jumping around for the papers just p***ed me off that much.
Ignoring the existence of the first two films, Girl Fever (100 Women), trucks along in a weird state of being.
The first half is not really funny and by the time you get to the heart of the story, it feels like you have wasted time getting there, BUT at the same time, the film is amazingly watchable in it's own "cuteness."
There are only two things that are clear: first, Eight Days a Week deserves a DVD release in the states, so I can purchase the BEST Davis movie AND more importantly, Erinn Bartlett is smoking hot and at some point will break-out in Hollywood.
Viewers of the first movie will have heard it all before, but I found Monroe's grossness far more amusing and far less disturbing than James DeBello's.
Especially since we know who does the crime after the first ten minutes, we love surprises in how Columbo catches his man or woman.
This film had the misfortune to be shown for the first time opposite the Academy Awards broadcast.
'Special Report: Journey to Mars' tells its story in the form of television coverage of the first human landing on Mars, in the year 2014.
Even the stupid commercial break gimmick is wrong; how many commercials did we see on the first day of the Iraq war?
It really is a great movie its to bad the Film Did not get a lot of publicity, I first viewed the movie on late night cable when I Could not sleep.
In the first part of the movie his character is not a good guy, and it's believable.
  one of the first of the tv "bible" movies, the story of david is one of the finest of its genre.
Francis Ford Coppola first thought of making Tucker as a dark Brechtian musical back in the 70s and went so far as to have Leonard Bernstein think about the music.
I was, at first, reluctant to show this movie to my friends.
when it first starts, i had to scoff at the acting in the first scene because it was SO terrible, but as the movie progressed, it got better.
Thus the film could be played either direction for the same effect although it is so skillfully done that the viewer does not realize that at first LOL, at least I didn't.
First, about the adventures of Devil and his company in the 1920-th Moscow; second, about Pontius Pilatus and Jesus in Jerusalem of the first century, and the third one, about the Master, the writer who wrote the second novel, and his eternal and true love, Margarita.
I wish to first disagree with the earlier poster who said John Hurt was one dimensional in his performance.
The story told here is that of the first five emperors of Ancient Rome.
This series remains vivid in my memory, no matter it was 1976 when it first was shown on PBS!
At first I was quite miffed--the homecoming friend ignored for a TV show?
Years after watching it the first time round, I was delighted to have my hands on that "new" technology, the VCR, so that I could watch "I, Claudius" whenever I liked.
The plot concerns Emperor Claudius compiling a warts and all history of his family, starting with his grandfather Augustus, the first ever emperor of Rome.
Brian Blessed (Gladiator) as Augustus did a wonderful job and you'll really admire his efforts as the portrayal of Rome's first emperor.
None of these movies match up to this miniseries- which is not afraid to tell the facts of the first five emperors; Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero.
I first remembered seeing part of an episode of this TV mini series when I was very young.
The stellar cast really is first rate and that applies to the major actors right through to the supporting characters who are all superb.
Brian Blessed is excellent as the families original patriarch, and the first master of the Roman Empire and possibly the greatest political mind of all time.
I remember watching this series when PBS first aired it in the US in the late 1970s, and I remember being fascinated by the story and the characters.
I first read the novels "I, Claudius" and "Claudius the God" when I was a sophomore in college.
In the final part, Claudius himself is proclaimed Emperor and the story follows his troubled reign, with the debauchery of Messalina and the scheming of Agrippina, as the real Claudius said; that it was his destiny first to suffer and finally to punish the infamy of his wives.
The acting in 'I, Claudius' is just first class by the entire cast, especially in light of the relatively low production values.
I watched the series when it first appeared on TV back in 1976.
The first time I saw the film, I saw the "trippy" opening titles and a little of the film some way through, (where Hans gives his father the red leather that ends up being the princess' shoes) and found Uncle Olie a little freaky.
I, CLAUDIUS is, first of all, a film art.
Like the serpent that appears in the open credits, the story twists and winds--and covers several generations of the ruling family as Rome slips from the republic to royal rule, largely due to the manipulations of Livia, who has few if any scruples in her determination to rule first through her husband and then through her son.
The drama gives an insider's view of the Julio-Claudian Dynasty, the first emperors of Rome.
But it is the tantalizing glimpse into the inner workings of the world's first `First Family' that makes `I, Claudius' so much fun.
The movie may not be as great as the first one to some people but the film is interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end.
Having seen the first film and enjoyed it so much I couldn't wait to see the sequel, however, I couldn't believe the out come.
The only thing that connects this to the first film is the title and setting, anything after that is Cohen's own creation.
The more depressing first film with it's downbeat ending is replaced by a much more comic film with great dialogue.
The scenes of the vampires knocking on the windows in the first was a classic but this peice of @#%$* is terrible.
Then there is the fact that it has nothing to do with the first movie, or the book.
They should have had a different movie poster that didn't feature Barlow (from the first film), because he is nowhere to be seen, I guess that was one the other disappointments for people.
Seeing this movie at first made me think this looks good... infact I think it started good then gradually got worse then it just buried itself.
An extremely peculiar, rather uninteresting film, a considerable step down from the first film (which wasn't terrific, but was at least exciting!)
The challenges the characters face are their personal demons, and their reasons for being there in the first place.
Upon first watch of this movie, the shades of moderate pathological narcissism (of the woman whoring herself) are unidentifiable in this scene.
Van Damme give's one of his best performances to date, and for the first time use's his brain and fist's instead of his martial art expertise.
The first group, the Van Damme fans, are all complaining that this is not your average VD film and bitching about how they were cheated into watching a serious drama.
Equally thoughtful was the selection of the other principal cast members: the aforementioned Peter Vaughan's burly and stern handyman could, at first glimpse, have been played by just any heavy-set person Â but there's no denying that the part benefits immensely from his experienced presence; and pretty Lorna Heilbron (from THE CREEPING FLESH [1973]) as Pleasence's housemate, with short-cropped hair suggesting the then-fashionable androgyny.
Ever since I first heard that the book by Erling Jepsen was being put into a movie I have been anticipating its release since I have read the book with much pleasure and since I have actually worked on that mental institution Sanne is committed to.
The cinematography and directing are first rate, this is not a low budget or low quality film.
This is Reyes' first chance to do comedy, I guess Doggett's as well, though it doesn't feel like it because of all his clever one-liners we are used to hearing.
I had only seen this episode once when it first premiered, but it came on tonight and I saw it again.
That first time I was a little bit disappointed and bored, but wasn't really 100% paying attention because I was tired and using the computer while watching.
OK, so I watched it again the next day because I didn't really see the ending the first time, and I knew it wasn't even close enough to being scary to bother my kids.
And the second time, doing nothing but watching the movie and understanding what was going on, I found the movie to be a lot better than I thought the first time.
If unoriginality is the first major flaw of Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon, the second major flaw is just as annoying.
Name a slasher since the big three that has added anything new to this genre...more graphic gore is not setting a trend...blair witch was absolutely a yawner...and i am guessing the same people yapping at this movie loved Blair Witch...what an awesome idea treating it as behind the scenes documentary for the first half...sure it was predictable....name a slasher or any other movie for that matter that isn't...sure there were movies that have shocked us but they are few and far between...as to protecting people...relax those protector's also love the nanny state and probably need people to protect them from things like horrible flicks.
And then, all of a sudden he goes to boobietrap a house where about 6 kids or so are gonna have a "party".. And then he just kills them all.. And they tape how he sets all of his "boobietraps".. so basically you know everything that he's gonna do when he's gonna kill them, as he first shows everything on tape.
Anyway why would these people volunteer for filming this in the first place they must be screwed up.
What were they doing in the first place anyhow?
Their hope was that people will just scan the first few pages of these suck up commentaries and proceed to pay their money and get ripped off.
Let's first start off with our crazy man.
But even at that young age, I was only half way through that first episode when I realized that it was really, really bad.
The first 2 thirds of the movie is more on the fun side of things with the actual horror thrown in at the end which works pretty well with the build up with it's dark humor.
First off, the opening we see a "news reporter," a woman who looks about 19 with bad teeth who wouldn't be able to get a job as a news reporter in Walla Walla, let alone anywhere else - and in the first ten minutes she actually compares herself to Diane Sawyer - now that was laugh out loud funny.
BEHIND THE MASK is the first independently-made American feature that finally gets it right.
Angela Goethals is also very good as Taylor Gentry, the aspiring on-camera reporter who gets sucked into Leslie's disarming charm when he agrees to allow her and her film crew to document every aspect of his first major endeavor: the selection, preparation for and actual execution of a bunch of drunk, horny teens.
There are really so many things I want to blab about concerning this great deconstruction of the slasher horror genre, one of the best since the first SCREAM installment.
I'm excited that this is Glosserman's first feature, because it makes a great calling card, and gives us fans so much more to look forward to from him.
Man, there are so many symbols, inside jokes, and references that I want to see it again just to see what I missed during the first viewing.
In the first part, we see Leslie as human.
Because we have seen him as human in the first half, seeing him as a monster in the second isn't as scary as one might expect.
His every move is followed by a documentary film crew - Angela Goethals, Britain Spellings and Ben Pace - as he makes preparations for his first mass slaughter.
One side note: Many fans of the series have puzzled over the identity of the individual who "played" the dead Jonesy in the first episode.
Neither of those guys look like typical maniacs, so when Leslie does make his first appearance masked and all, it's rather amusing.
Still, regarding the fact that this movie strictly concentrates on fun in the first two thirds and only begins to throw in full on horror bits in the end, the showdown works quite well.
This is the first color film from the Fleischer Studio and it's in something called "Cinecolor"--which appears to be a variation on 2-color Technicolor.
I really liked the Cupid who banged the prince on the head with a mallet when he first glimpsed Betty.
The latter is generally credited as being the first full color process American cartoon, as opposed to two strip color which emphasized either blues or greens at the expense of certain shades that were lost to the lesser and less costly techniques of the day.
all of of the tortures in the world could not compare to sitting down and watching this filth.Surely even when this film was first released it would have been considered tacky back then.i'm ashamed to even live in the same country as this film was made in.what a waste of plastic and film.
Despite copying ALIENS and PREDATOR scene for scene for the first 80 minutes the producers of these two films won`t be able to sue .
It feels like a film made by aliens who've been observing human emotions but have never experienced them first hand.
The series begins much in the same manner as the first movie.
The promise Jeremy Podeswa gave with his first film "Eclipse" is really fulfilled now in his second "Five Senses".
Intelligent dialogues and good actors complete the very good first impression.
The story only deals with an interpretation of the first part of Jonathan Swift's classic story Gulliver's Travels.
Good examples of this include when Gulliver steps over the town and during the first shipwreck scene.
', followed by the king seeing the giant for the first time, and immediately streaking back to his chambers, being pursued by a whirlwind of flying furniture that his wind motion has generated, I honestly couldn't stop laughing!
The first episode of Trauma was the most exciting, but after that, things seemed to go downhill.
I missed the first rescue, something about a parachutist stuck in a tree.
I can only guess at the reactions of movie-goers who first saw this film in 1939, but I suspect that they were blown away by the sheer scope of the artwork.
The pacing is a bit slow during the first part of the film, but the filmmakers do a nice job of setting up the conflict between the two tiny kingdoms, which (true to the spirit of Swift's story) is caused by the pride of the rival kings.
While not one of the great animated features (it was only the second released in the United States, Disney's SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN Dwarfs in 1937 being the first) GULLIVER'S TRAVELS is an enjoyable film which should bring pleasure to uncritical viewers.
GULLIVER was their first foray into feature length animation (HOPPITY GOES TO TOWN would be their second in 1941), and eventually they would expend their energies again on the cartoon short subject, including the highly acclaimed SUPERMAN series which would commence in 1941.
LIVING DEAD GIRL was my first Jean Rollin experience and I have to say that I somewhat enjoyed it.
At first glance, I had inspected more, but if you focus on the beautiful images, this is a fair deal.
Even with this being the first and only Jean Rollin movie I've watched so far (and having viewed a couple of trailers from his other efforts), I feel like I already have a pretty good idea of what this Frenchman stands for.
Now, I myself saw it coming even before the first act of the film was finished.
In short i love the DVD of the first season of Emergency.
Marcie tries toasting the eggs and ends up cooking them; At first Woodstock can't fit in his new house, but soon he makes himself right at home!
I saw this for the first time since I was 7-8 years old, I had a fuzzy memory that she took the downward spiral, went into seclusion and then came back with a roar singing THE ROSE in concert ending the movie.
It was her first starring role, and it was a challenging one, but she pulled it off perfectly.
Midler is in virtually every frame of this film and completely commands the screen that completely belies the fact that this is her first film.
Ok first of all, Bette Midler is one good actress, and singer.
Well two out of three can kill you these days.But The Rose was set in the late sixty's or early seventy's where drugs were all she really had to worry about.She diden,t.If your a fan of Bette Midlers or Janis Joplin you should love The Rose.Bette Midler Gives an Oscar worthy performance (she was nominated,but Sally Field won for NormaRae)in her first major film role.Rose Foster is a major star in the rock and blues music world But being a great success with a voice that most of the world would kill for is not enough to fill her emptiness.Shes on the booze in the first few frames,the drugs soon follow.Recently relesed on DVD,The Rose is not the feel good movie of 79 or any year but Bette Midler,her voice and her acting talent make this film well worth watching.
I attended the first day of shooting on location, but did not go for the second day - they came to get me, I suppose because they liked what they saw in the "dailies" - There was a third day of shooting, all of which were totally miserable for me - I had no aspirations to be a "movie-star" - I was an established drag-act with a large following and loved my work.
This was Bette Midler's first starring role in a film and she finally showed the world what a great talent she is.
Yes it was a good first attempt at putting one of Tennessee William's plays on screen, but they did not need to change it.
What set this show apart from its predecessors was in drawing respect from the audience for the firefighters it portrays; for the first time the paramedics, doctors and firefighters didn't arrive to wave a magic wand putting the fire out and saving the patient.
I first watched this movie back in 1998, in a late night slot on the UK's Channel 5.
In the first few minutes, I assumed it would be a romantic drama on a tropical island.
Who was watching them when they first made it to the beach?
Some of my favorite sequences were interviews made with people on the street during the 1973 "Christopher Street Pride Parade," probably among the first Pride festivals ever.
"A Very Natural Thing," according to sources I've read, was one of the first films to show gay men candidly as people.
It's worth remembering that this was still only twenty years since the emergence of the first extensive film productions, and that it would have been sophisticated in its day.
His first two Keystone pictures had little plot but allowed his little tramp to interact (chaotically) with a realistic environment, albeit with a handful of supporting comedy characters thrown in.
When i first bought this game it was a million miles from where i lived and so i brought it home and tryed to play it but wouldn't work and i couldn't go and take it back either.
so i was stuck with it and so today when i bought it i played through the first mission and i was so excited because i thought that it would be like that for the entire first level but no it completely changed the level after.
This is one of 5 Chaplin that are on the first DVD of Chaplin's Essanay Comedies.
While I agree with many of the comments regarding the first few episodes, what most people have missed was the amazing turnaround of this series.
There is no hiding Gina Holden's bad acting in those episodes, and it seems like they rushed through the shows on the first take like a soap opera.
The first sign is the episode with the Hawkmen/Dactyls called ascension.
Let me first say that after watching the pilot I agreed with the first poster; the show was awful, and I was ready to call it quits and free up space on my DVR.
We sit down to this show now with pleasure, and even choose it first over other shows like "Heroes" when we want something guaranteed to be light and fun.
If you haven't seen it since the first few episodes, take a look at it now.
I hope at least it manages a whole first season rather than just about 13 episodes or what not.
To my surprise, it actually improved significantly, going against all known laws of television shows, which generally peak with the first few episodes/seasons and then drop off from there.
It was the plots that made this so-so at first.
They were of the "meh" sort, at first, but story arcs are beginning to develop, and now that the Flash-Dale relationship has appeared to stabilize (no more awkward, groan-inducing pseudo-romance scenarios), this is one of my favorite shows.
I want to be the first to tell you that's okay because Flash Gordon isn't trying to be like BSG.
And I do have to say that I didn't care too much for the first episode.
We're still in it's first season and I think it's getting better with each passing episode.
When i first got this game i was most pleased with it.
Buffy the Vampire Slayer had a disastrous first season with terrible, cheesy writing, low brow plot lines and terrible acting... yet it went on to have a huge cult following and seven seasons.
through a series of events, Flash opens a portal to Mongo and jumps head first with Dale Arden to try to rescue his father from Ming the Merciless... OK.  Dale fights with Ming's daughter, who's fighting with a bounty hunter chick, who's fighting with Flash... OK.  Ming's daughter wants "the Imex" a secret thing that Flash's father had.
In fact I liked this this TV show the first time round when it was called sliders.
"Agent Under Fire" is the first (to my knowledge) James Bond game that isn't based on one of the movies.
High hopes turn into groaning frustration and confusion upon seeing the first (and unfortunately not the last) episode of the latest attempt to resurrect the popular hero.
But if your kids are old enough to remember the first two films in this franchise, they're too old to enjoy this one.
With its bland photography, flat direction, and a lack of both gags and ambition, the only surprise to be found in this 13-years-along follow-up to the first sequel is that it wasn't designed to go straight to video.
Tiresome, repetitious and plodding, this trundles through a series of barely-linked scenes, none of which are particularly unexpected, most of which are reheated from the first film; meanwhile Linda Koslowski does very little and does it even more wetly and woodenly than before.
The original Crocodile Dundee film was fresh and creative, as was the first sequel, as it juxtaposed the culture of the Outback with the shallowness of modern urban society, tipping its hat to the superiority of the former over the latter.
All the charm and wit of the first (and to a lesser extent the second) film has vanished, taking the characters and goodwill with them: Paul Hogan is starting to look a leathery as the crocs themselves and the most interesting thing about Linda Kozlowski here is trying to pinpoint the plastic surgery through the soft focus filters she's often shot with and work out how much of her disengaged performance is down to boredom and how much to Botox.
She's a primary school play version of a reporter while somehow Mick Dundee seems to have suddenly become a complete simpleton with no memory of all the things he encountered in the first two films in the hope that the audience will find his newfound ignorance funny rather than simply bewildering - it's not even as if his character took a whack to the head in a contrived plot point, it's just plain lazy writing.
If you enjoy the first two Dundee movies, especially the first, you'll probably enjoy this as well.
But the first thing he does is to cover for this hoodlum, and then I was wondering why I should even continue watching it.
It's not like the first two Dundees were Oscar nominated flicks.
First of all I never saw the first two Crocodile Dundee movie's personally I think its not a great movie but it is entertaining but some of the jokes ar not so funny but there are also a few good joke's but still I liked this movie paul hogan acting very well as Mick Dundee now I want to see the other 2 movie's and I heard they are better then this one if thats true then I really want to see them I give it a 7.5/10
This movie didn't have the plot-structure as the first one which would probably hint as to why it was no where near as successful.
Ok, I was three when the first one came out, so I don't remember seeing it in 1986, but I do remember no.
View this third offering with an open mind and you will enjoy it without comparison to the first two.
The film spends the first third fleshing out everyone but the centerpiece and then doesn't give him any depth as he stumbles through his thick cockney mumblings from one costar to the next.
If you liked the first two Dundee's you're guaranteed to like this one.
I did wonder once it had finished, if this film would be more successful if it had been released closer to the first two and sadly I'd say yes.
It's just about some entertainment...  but i would suggest to watch this movie if you like Indiana Jones and movies comme Ã§a.. if you don't, then don't bother to watch this one...  to those who saw the first two a long long time ago all ready..  You must love this one too..
If you enjoyed the first 2 CD movies, than you'll probably enjoy this.
The movie has the same charm and humor as in the first Dundee.
Critics should not be comparing it to the first or even the second Dundee movies.
From the first scene to the last the script does not disappoint as it becomes ever more bizarre in what I can only assume is an attempt to trawl the lowest common denominators.
Hunter was a kick-ass, take-no-prisoners kind of cop, even in the first 3 seasons where only a few suspects were actually killed when confronted by Hunter & McCall.
The idiotic, bleeding-heart approach to law enforcement - especially the 'warning-shot' policy issued by Hunter's captain (Michael Cavanaugh) in the pilot episode - really annoyed me in the first two seasons.
Commander Cain (Arthur Rosenberg) was even more loathsome; he was a man who was a politician first and a policeman second.
Enjoyed the series when shown on TV first time around.I have purchased season one to three (as available) and I am wondering when further seasons will be released.I enjoyed Fred Dryer's laid back acting(I know he was replacing Clint Eastwwod persons on TV) but the cast was so right for the show,except maybe the "Captain', until the arrival of the actor who finally settled in the role.I seem to have forgotten the name of whoever played the captain.
He can't get a job; is consistently, racially harassed by the police and goes back to an area which he tried to escape from by joining the army in the first place, hoping that on his return there would be some improvements.
Stir Crazy was one of the first films I ever remember watching, it came out the year I was born and I always associate 1980 with the time I came into the world and Stir Crazy.
Maybe this is not quite as good as their first film together but it is still one of the best comedies around.
"Stir Crazy" is entertaining and funny for about 10 minutes and those minutes are just at the beginning, so if after this comment you are going to watch it anyway I recommend you to stop watching it just at the first moment you find it a little boring because from that moment the movie will get after each passing minute even worse until the end.
)At first, prison is considered to be a living he** for the both of them.
At least for their first two movies together.
I may have even thought it was funnier and more exciting this time around than when I first watched the film as a teen.
The crux of the humor in the first section of the film is the naivety of Donahue's "grass is always greener on the other side" conception of the Western U.S. compared to New York City.
This film tempted me to leave within the first half hour during the screening at Sundance.
This first time director rivals the work of the legendary Stephen Spielberg.
I watched some of the "original" first then switched over to the Troma version & while the original was pretty funny (unintentionally) anyway, the Troma version was probably much more funny.
The Amazing Race is a show where teams of two race about Earth to win a million dollars at the end (the first to win, of course gets said million dollars).
Overall, I enjoyed it, but I absolutely hated seeing Zach and Flo cross the finish line first.
Taking advantage of this sick sorry a** of a human being the out of work and always drunk Frankie Paterson, Timothy Hutton, Tony took his $1,100.00 bet on the Dallas Cowboys, who were behind by almost 20 points at the time he took it, knowing that the poor slob was in no condition to make a bet in the first place!
The first was Sad Cypress, and the reason is the same.
OK, first of all, most of this movie sucks.
The first time that I saw him, I just kept thinking, "Isn't he going to be arrested?".
This is Tushinski's first documentary.
At first it's just a typical killer creature picture, but it turns out to be a scary and fun film.
Once the first death begins, the deaths just keep on going until the end of the movie.
The first twenty minutes as I said before are devoid of anything remotely interesting.
For the first 30, 40 minutes or so, it was quite tolerable, and I was actually very entertained.
OK when i was younger and seen frogs for the first time it was kind of scary,then as you get older you find all the mistakes and plot holes and such.this is no way as great as Alfred Hitchcock's the birds.this one deals with a bunch of rich people all celebrating the 4th of July.y birthdays on a Florida island.the patriarch(Ray Milland)who was a hunter before his crippling accident invites his family members all doltish and strange with the exception of his granddaughter(Joan Van Ark)and a model(Judy Pace)and a photographer(Sam Elliot)who is just passing through after his canoe is capsized by a drunken boater(Adam Roarke)the scenes with the animals attacking are really bad.and don't come off as realistic.a harmless rat snake,harmless geckos and anoles,even a snapping turtle,a slow moving one at that.there is a scene where some of the characters flag down a motorist.and the motorist stops for them one of them is carrying a rifle.OK if thats me i would'nt stop for anyone especially if they are carrying a rifle.
There have been persistent rumors that Rosaleen's first husband, an intrepid explorer, is still alive and as such would nullify her marriage to Gordon.
The worst part of this movie was the first 20 minutes in which absolutely nothing happened.
Sam Elliot as the do-gooder nature guy doesn't go over-the-top, and doesn't lecture like so many "nature first" characters can do in these films (i.e., no rants).
The first hint that the movie was bad was the premise: An East German inventor creates a car that runs on potatoes--or as he continually calls them "tubers."
An Australian director working in France for the first time (in French language) with two American lead actors (one of whom apparently didn't speak any French when cast) and a script worked on by veteran scriptwriter Gerard Brach (Jean De Florette, The Name Of The Rose) could have been a mess but instead Samantha Lang has crafted a beautifully moving and delicate drama.
At first all smouldering eyes and wry smiles she also grows over the course of the film into a sympathetic and tragic figure, allowing the audience to truly care what happens to both these characters and understand the deep core of loneliness that brings them together despite their differences.
A particularly well played and haunting dream sequence will stay with you long after your first viewing of the film.
I say first viewing because you will want to revisit these characters and return to see this expertly measured film all over again.
Comment first for Ian: Small town?
This is one of Christie's titles which was carefully thought out and contains all the clues one needs - we are dealing first and foremost with an adventurer and opportunist!
I missed this movie in the theaters the first time around and just saw it on cable.
At first I was bothered by DM's accent (& her blonde hair is a shame) but the sweet script transcends all that.
The movie isn't a first class romance but if accepted on its own terms it's very enjoyable with a message or two about life and understanding.
I rated this show a bit higher because during the first few years it was on, I didn't know anyone who didn't watch it.
I think King was only there for the first 1 or 2 seasons.
I first saw this show when I was very young (when it first came out).
In fact, I believe it was the first "horror" show I was allowed to see, I was 7.
Catching the film really from the first frame for the first time in years I was shocked by just how damn good the movie is.
His first was 1953's THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS, with classic stop motion effects by Ray Harryhausen.
It will take another eleven minutes to get to our first monster scene- where Behemoth raises out of the water, and attacks a Thames River ferryboat.
By the time I started nodding off, the monster makes his first appearance, and looks kind of like a piÃ±ata.
The first half of the film is all building creeps, burns and radioactive study, low key tension and regional accents, set around the the Cornish coast, captured rich in atmosphere by the chilly cinematography of Desmond Davis and Ken Hodges.
The monster is a tad patchy in its appearance, at first looking pretty shabby, when it properly emerges it is an effectively fearsome force, and the final effects work of the great Willis O'Brien (King Kong).
For the modern viewer it takes a bit of patience to chew up the first three-quarters of babbling around, but there is enough to keep your attention.
The film itself is actually a British version or British spin-off of the Warner Bros. 50's Sci-Fi Blockbuster The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms with Ray Harryhausen doing the Stop-Motion with his first major film with no help like he was first animator in Mighty Joe Young (1949)With Pete Peterson doing about 15% of the animation towards the end of that picture.
I first saw this late-night camp classic when it was released in the late Fifties and clearly recall leaving the cinema with a fetid taste in my mouth.
Of all the "lizard" movies this was the only one that scared the cheese out of me, having first viewed it when I was eight years old in 1963!
I first saw this movie when I was 9 years old and it was the scariest movie I'd ever seen.
Although Jack Rabin, Irving Block and Louis DeWitt are first billed in the effects credits, it was King Kong's Willis O'Brien and his assistant Pete Peterson, that brought the Behemoth to life.
In an atmospheric night scene reminiscent of Beast From 20,000 Fathoms, the Behemoth, in silhouette, wanders into some power lines, reacting first with shock, then anger as it attacks the high-tension towers.
In the first stop-motion scene of the monster rising from the Thames, the Behemoth strides towards the camera, attacks some dockside cranes, and continues forward, eventually passing over the camera- a trademark of O'Brien's visual style.
It was a low budget film and it was my very first.
Edward G. Robinson is "Pressure," an ex-con who at first tries to keep customers out of the store ("if a customer comes in, blow him off") - but when he tells the young woman like a daughter to him (Wyman) that he's sincere, she starts working with a luggage salesman (Carson) on big promotions.
The first time I remember coming across it was in a Sherlock Holmes tale, "The Red Headed League," and I doubt it was original with Conan-Doyle.
The first of the two Snake Plissken movies (The second is "Escape From L.A.") this is an interesting, but strange view of the future in 1997, which is now, ironically, the past.
Snake is one of the first damn cool Actionheros in Moviehistory.
Escape from New York is probably the first modern action movie, and still stands up pretty well.
The jokes are funny as they were when Otto told them the first time and the little new stuff is pretty cool.
I took it seriously when I was in my early teen years and first saw it, and loved it.
The scene when the dwarfs first meet Snow white isn't entirely a bad thing, although it's probably not appropriate for a younger audience who the original story is directed at.
Our anti-hero of the piece, Snake Plissken, is superbly played by Kurt Russell, the original choice interestingly was Tommy Lee Jones, but Russell fuels Plissken's mantra to make him one of the eighties coolest grumpy bastards!, and his work here is first class in terms of the films apocalyptic structure.
Calling Escape From New York an action picture would be setting first time viewers up for a real let down, what action there is is minimal but highly effective, the machismo flourishes acting more as a point of reference to the pictures time bomb urgency.
Especially the first sixty minutes of this movie are terrific, since there constantly is the introduction of new and imaginative characters.
Particularly because the first hour is so great, the ending seems quite tame.
(For further information on such a desperate breed, see Rhys' first major film: "Notting Hill") Okay, there is the overstatement that sees a male voice choir singing Mungo Jerry's "In The Summertime", or the twins joyriding their own father's hearse, but generally this film, despite the extremities of it's plot, does keep an eye towards realism and naturalistic dialogue.
In fact, this was the first feature of the two writers involved and they haven't written another film since, presumably due to its lacklustre showing at the box office.
Right...first of all, and this is CRUCIAL, hmmmm?!
When i first watched this film they said its a WELSH TRAINSPOTTING A Welsh Trainspotting - No.
When I first saw it, I thought I'd tuned into an old war film by mistake, with Anne Robinson playing a Nazi interrogator.
'Mr Denton on Doomsday' is a play in two distinct acts; the first act finds the drunk and pathetic Denton suddenly regaining his unrivalled ability with a shooting iron and the second act sees him face the consequences of being a renowned gunman.
'Mr Denton on Doomsday' is the first 'Twilight Zone' episode to feature a truly surprising and satisfying twist.
Denton is explored thoroughly as a character and Serling's writing is deeply touching, particularly as Denton reveals the reason he started drinking excessively in the first place.
Fallon was a great host first of all.
There are so many good lines in this film that it continues to be amusing watch after watch and for the first few viewing had me almost in tears at some points.
They did the first Deuce Bigelow and they did Dickie Roberts Former Child Star.
I have seen the film probably over 50 times but each time I laugh as if it were my first time viewing it.
It's a great movie to watch with friends for the first time, especially for the fact that you will be quoting lines with them randomly for quite a while.
I'd love to see the movie again, but it seems that the slow first part of this movie has turned so many people off that few people have seen the whole thing, and therefore, there's virtually no demand for this nail-biting, on-the-edge-or-your-seat story.
We have been searching in earnest first in stores and then on the internet and discovered to our dismay it was never recorded and sold as a VHS or DVD movie.
She doesn't give away her character in the first scene of the movie, but holds back some of it, making you watch closely to discover the type of person underneath the character's cautious facade.
This is the first time I just typed in the title on browser and got some sites to check out.
I was 19 when it first came out on HBO.
I fell in Love with Treat Williams the first time I saw Hair.
Very good movie with a multistar cast unique to cinema viewing 6 stories only 4 of them which are really good the 2 stories which i don't like are the homework story and the apple story first of all the homework story isn't that good and well it's different from the other stories and the apple story is just wow bad people turning into apples come on and the ending isn't strong enough either and stupid because the movie would have been interesting had it had a different ending besides the ending and the 2 crappy stories this movie is a pleasure to watch and can make for great cinema and can be quite a great entertainer good movie great directorial debut by Prawal Raman and great script written by Ram Gopal varma's selected writers and driectors and for the first time Ram Gopal Varma did a great job a t producing a movie hats off to him and Prawal
The first story was extremely scary and had very effectively used great sound effects.
Antra mali played a good cameo in the first story that the group shares.
Darna Mana Hai is not your usual commercial Hindi film.The first thing that you need to keep in mind when u watch D.M.H.is it is not a horror film.It is bizarre,it is different and yes it is wonderful.
The first of the 6 stories was pretty horrific featuring Antramali.
The fruition of this pure intention translates into an extremely creative and awe inspiring endeavor that this reviewer hopes to be just the first of many more to come.
I seen this movie at the Library like 2 or 3 years ago and didn't really want to pick it up, then I picked it up this year because I read the entire description that meant like Indigo children have powers and I just thought that it will make it a wonderful and inspirational movie, but when I first turned it on, I felt like I fell asleep in a nightmare of demon spirits until when I got to the part where they were in the house and a little girl was in the car.
It all seems a bit airy-fairy to me, but first to the technical/artistic notes.
You know what they say, no guts no glory, well this one got both and heavy on the first!
That was my first mistake and it reminded me not to expect anything in life.
It certainly seems that the producers are trying to feed off of their first born in this genre, "What the Bleep Do We Know..., Like Bleep it promises existentialist views of rather unexplained events and experiences in our life with a spin that was thought provoking and entertaining.
After the movie our 25 year old son, who has recently left the Army, gave me a giant hug for the first time in his adult life and said, 'Dad, I didn't know what all this stuff was about that you got into when you changed your life around until this movie and event has shown me and I am very proud of you'.
At first the characters don't seem to have the depth needed to sustain the movie, but as we watch we learn more about each and the decisions they make to "better" their circumstances and the repercussions of those decisions.
That is she neither a man that age changes as such without some prior history nor a girl presented as she is at first presented does what she then does.
In the first of four tales, she is just window dressing.
The story is first rate and it has you on the edge of you seat wondering how it all ties together.
The first story explores the issue of homosexuality, which I think is a brave idea in a country that is quite religious.
WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD:  I'm writing my first review ever so please understand.
The movie first focuses on the story of Rutilio, who allows his homosexual feelings to surface.
One of the first great scenes of the movie is when, after abusing his wife a few days earlier, he's crying on her lap and looking for comfort and she's reluctant to console him.
The movie also subtly introduces other characters during this first chapter.
At first, one only sees these people on the outside and only learn a little bit about them.
Even the shop owner, who at first just seems a one-dimensional lecher, actually wants to get remarried, and please Alma by taking her to the opera and the theater.
Guicho, the bartender, who at first appears only as a thief and somebody who takes advantages of others, struggles to stop his impulse to steal and truly loves Susana.
The tagline proposes: "The life he wanted to end, was just about to begin", in reference to Wilbur (Jamie Sives), who, when we first meet him, has just tried to kill himself.
Harbour meets her first, and tells his brother about her hair and her smile.
Just watched this film for the first time this evening mainly because the brilliant Julia Davis was listed as being in the film.
At first, it seems that he is animated by his brother's good fortune, but soon he finds himself romantically drawn to, Alice, his brother's lover and wife to be.
What can I say... well first off this is John Fallon and Christian Veil's new film which has been in the making for a little while now.
The world's first feature-length movie was directed by Charles Tait and filmed at the Tait family's Chartersville Estate in the Melbourne suburb of Heidelberg.
It cost Â£1000 to make, but that money and more was recovered within its first week of screening.
In my efforts to rediscover many of Australia's forgotten classics, I'd decided that I might as well start from the beginning: released on 26 December 1906, 'The Story of the Kelly Gang' told the thrilling story of Victorian bushranger Ned Kelly and his comrades, and is more than likely the first feature-length film ever produced.
Throughout the silent era, the subject of bushrangers became of staple of Australia cinema; it presented many of the same components as the American western, which had first come to light in 1903 with Edwin S. Porter's 'The Great Train Robbery.'
Not only was 'The Story of the Kelly Gang' one of the first bushranger pictures, but it was also the world's first feature film.
On the newly-released DVD, there are two versions of the film: the first is the seventeen-minute "restored version," which basically presents the story as it now survives, with a pleasant piano accompaniment by Mauro Colombis (and an experimental soundtrack by Endorphin that I wasn't game enough to try).
'The Story of the Kelly Gang' is generally believed to be (and most likely WAS) the first feature-length movie ever made, produced in 1906.
As a part-time Australian (born in Scotland, expatriated Down Under as a 'child migrant'), I ought to feel proud that Australia produced the first feature movie.
THE STORY OF THE KELLY GANG is believed to be the world's first feature length film.
What follows is a lean, uncompromising revenge flick that showcases Fallon in his first leading role, and proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that not only can he write, but the boy can act too.
I donÂ´t know who to blame first.
I don't like to know everything within the first ten minutes.
No surprise that this skipped theatres and went straight to ultra-cheap DVD, but you'll still find yourself wondering how and why it ever got made in the first place.
He doesn't spend time with his son, or daughter, and he is neglecting his wife, who, if anything, ought to be the object of his obsession.Harry Hamlin makes a fine performance, getting so deeply into the character that one thinks maybe Harry Hamlin himself knows first hand about the problem.
The history of a man betrayed by a system in which he believed in, first, by becoming what he hate most and after that by being abandoned by them after the brutal murder that I talked before.
I have not read the book that the film is based on; although I am a big fan of the first three books in Ellroy's 'L.A.
The first half of the film is really rather good and plausible; but then the twist hits and it really requires a suspension of disbelief from the viewer.
A disease is killing the human race, and its down to the first family to save the world.
The same scene being shot in plain day and then pure darkness was not only confusing at first, but extremely annoying.
For the first time in goodness knows how longÂ I crave an American Hollywood-style ending.
This was my first fully subtitled foreign film, so once I became accustomed to that aspect I really enjoyed the film and appreciated Absa's sense of humor.
The first twenty minutes at least is just watching our main characters wander around the haunted house.
At first you get an eerie surveillance cam atmosphere which reminded me of "my little eye" but they just take it too far.
This was my first Asian Horror movie watch.
This was my second run at Oriental horror films and unlike the first try (some movie about spirals) I actually enjoyed this one.
Afterwards the guy in the videostore confessed that he only saw the first ten minutes.
Let me start with the positive things first.
The first 35mins revolve around claire taking care of the boy at her house.
The movie shows having the girl her first period, contributes nothing to the story.
The rest of the movie is as slow and stupid as the first part.
'Moonlight' is the first movie I've seen that's directed by Paula van der Oest, and (again) I fervently hope this is not a typical example of her craft.
You can stop watching after the first scene in the basement, I'm going to give you a quick summary: The main character doesn't say anything until it is too late.
The first third of the movie is not too far removed from being a drama about a group of children in the summertime; but as the film moves on, things start to get dark pretty quickly and by then the film grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go until the credits role.
When he first sees Meg tied up in the basement, he is horrified.
Aware that forthcoming scenes had led to some instances of horrified audience walkouts, I took whatever solace I could in this preliminary scene-setting, desperately hoping that young David's first foray down into the basement would be a mere tease from the filmmakers.
At first the young David seems like a lucky fellow-playing games with local friends, drinking beer next door at his neighbour's place, and meeting Meg, a lovely young lass who is adjusting to a new life at Auntie Ruth's house with her caliper-splint wearing sister after losing her parents in an automobile accident.
This is the first Horror / Thriller were I actually felt for the characters.
There are lots of preachy/teachy speeches at first, before the murder, and then a full obsession into finding the killers.
I watched this movie when it first came out.
by the time the first musical number started, i was rolling on the floor laughing.
This show gives us some surprising twists to the ordinary world of Peanuts, including a glimpse (for the first and only time, as far as I know) inside Snoopy's doghouse, Charlie Brown's victory at kicking the football (maybe), and a rare moment of Lucy getting (in my opinion) her well-deserved comeuppance when Snoopy performs a feat of levitation on her and leaves her in a very interesting situation.
I have been a longtime fan of the controversial TV show South Park, and I went to see the feature-length movie the first night it came out.
However, you are not going to be able to keep the tykes away from exposure completely, so best to talk to them aboot the content and language first.
It's what the film is about in the first place.
What grabs us first(perhaps) are the very real homes of Det.
The investigation, after the subsequent finding of the first victim takes Mills and Sommerset, and the film viewer into a dark, seedy world where the crimes performed by the 'killer' are inspired by the seven deadly sins.
Indeed, one of the pleasures of owning a copy of the movie is having the ability to review the movie, in slo-mo if necessary, and discover throwaway sight gags that one has missed in the delirium of watching this anarchic satire the first time through.
As long as they disguise that statement(s) with all that made them popular in the first place, they can get away with it.
Hill finds himself abandoned in the scorching, unforgiving desert, and at first is tempted to give up.
From its first frame, "Se7en" sets its tone with Fincher's bleak visuals, moody weather and Howard Shore's slow, atmospheric music (you won't believe this is the guy who would go on to make the unforgettable Lord of the Rings score).
Contrary to what it may seem like at first sight, the humor is overly refined without being intellectual, instead of jumping in your face all the time.
The life of a pregnant girl and her family who have been living on the subway (riding in perpetual circles), who decide to go back to the surface world, coincides with the story of our Lord the bed sitting room, which represents a real problem...not only is the man an object, hes the first new building, and sign of civilization in years.
With it's completely surreal narrative and winning photography, The bed Sitting room hits me now for a number of reasons, the first of which, is that despite looking strangely contemporary, all it's main leads (Except the young uns) are dead.
That's where I first saw both and they have been locked in my consciousness as equally great and poignant comments on the "future".
So she cuddles up to and makes out with the guy who she first thought killed her brother, but who turns out to be a good guy and they live happily ever after on the $3 mil in real and counterfit money that every body was after in the beginning.
When I first saw THE FATAL GLASS OF BEER, I was puzzled.
Fields widely portrayed cynical men, but this was too much for me, especially as the parents were so warm-hearted at first."
I wouldn't recommend your first viewing of Se7en to be 2am in the morning like mine, but any other time I would recommend it as strongly as any other film.
I first saw this send-up of "the prodigal son" when I was a high school freshman.
When I first saw this film I was wondering if it would be a spoof of Chaplin's "Gold Rush."
I just about wet myself the first time I saw Fields go out to "milk the elk".
I loved this short from the first time I saw it as a kid, and I think it's one of a kindness really makes it his best (though others are quite funny.)
"Flushed Away" co-director David Bowers makes his stand-alone directing debut on the $65-million, Summit Entertainment, big-screen remake of "Astro Boy," the first example of anime that Japanese television broadcast in 1963.
Ultimately, it was never explained why the Peacekeeping evil robot was needed in the first place.
I think the animated series Astro Boy is more reminded because of ts cultural meaning than for its intrinsic attributes, because it was the first "anime" which found popularity outside of its natal Japan.Personally, I have never seen that series, so I went with zero expectations to see its film adaptation.However, the movie ended up being a boring, bland and cloying clothing which combines elements from A.I., Wall-E and Peter Pan.
I admit that I have dozed off watching it, which is maybe the first time it happens for me in a theater!
When I had first heard about this movie around about last summer, I was pretty excited to see it, even if people were saying it was a waste of time, I still had to see it because I knew it was based on an actual anime/manga series long ago, and because I'm so heavily into that sort of stuff it was definitely something I was going to see and believe, I walked out of the cinema smiling because I felt really happy and cheerful and I knew it was because of that movie.
This is my first written movie review ever.
Its manga series was first published in 1952 and its television program first broadcast in Japan in 1963.
The first fifteen minutes of its dialogue was groan-inducing...this, combined with Nic Cage's droning voice is enough to turn the viewer off quickly.
Sure, it might be a little bit over-stylized and the ending is not quite as logical as it seems to be at first, but none of that disturbs the experience of watching this film.
After the first viewing, the images are burnt into your head, the ending leaves you drained and broken and you will think about it for days.
Even though the effect wears off after repeated viewing, you can always remember the way you felt after your first experience with this movie.
It is the kind of movie of which you never forget where you saw it first, who was with you and what it was like.
The cover art is an obvious first impression example.
At least during the first half when the audience needs to get a grasp on the basics of the two-dimensional universe.
The first time I watched Flatland the film I found it very interesting with great 3D animation.
As I watched a second and third time I began to notice hidden things within the film, which must have been placed within the film on purpose, and I did not notice them the first time I watched.
If this is the director's first feature, there are big things in store for him.
I only wish there were subtitles to it, as English is not my mother tongue and I struggled enormously at first with all these terms and the peculiar accents.
From our hero's perspective, he is at first confused, then exhilarated as he is lifted into the three-dimensional world.
The human beings are cattle as soon as they put their first toe in the system.
They pay heftily for their passage first, just like the Jewish community had to pay for the passage of the Jews who were deported to Auschwitz.
It's not the first, but this one features the astonishing Kierston Wareing, who landed this leading role after appearing briefly in just one TV episode.
In her first feature film performance, Kierston Wareing shows great promise as the blonde, leather-jacketed, motorcycle-riding entrepreneur who is willing to deal with the sleazier aspects of the business.
Understandably riled, she decides to play him at his own game and set up her own recruitment agency (the job she was fired from in the first place) and dole out jobs for immigrant workers who will work below the minimum wage.
This is not the first of its kind to be done, but this film had sympathy, warmth, objectivity and class and a viable plot.
The first is (David Mills/Brad Pitt) who is so rash, tense, running mostly after his sensations and always relies on the photos, the shape of things.
So you'll have them both at variance, too contradictory and the only clear medial between them was the first's wife.
So to those first few folks who put there rave 10 star reviews - what planet are you from?
His first big step is a relationship with the prominent pianist Nicholas Rubinstein.
The show is funnier for me today than when it first aired, mainly because I now understand that the main target were not children but people of more age, something that is relatively unknown.
My favourite moments were the celebrity intro of the first season when 2 women, who looked like Hilary Clinton and Princess Diana, had a punch up over Freakazoid.
Fortunately, most of Dalton's performance is preserved in the two-hour version, which nevertheless cuts out a lot of scenes involving David Morrisey's character and his wife, and Dalton's interactions with "his girls," as well as the vast majority of the series' first episode that takes place in Spain.
This is the first film for aspiring writer/director David A.
Only the first 20 minutes or so of the film have anything at all to do with ghosts or "ghost watching."
the fact this film is meant to be a horror is a joke as the attempt to make it at all scary is thrown out the window with in the first five minutes.
David cross, his actors and crew did a great job and show a whole lot of potential even if they didn't get it ALL perfect first time around.
I don't know ANYONE who ever got everything right on their first try.
But its only the first of a string of ritual murders that will be committed by a killer who is basing his crimes on the seven deadly sins as depicted in Dante's "The divine comedy".
There was nothing worth watching the first time what on earth could have inspired the second go-round?
Some people may say this film was good for a low budget movie, I say I thought it was written, directed and performed by a class of first year performing arts students, and that is what I honestly thought.
I thought I would watch the extras on the DVD and be amazed by this tale, of a group of performing arts students who had made their first movie which had become a cult hit and propelled all of the stars into Hollywood stardom, but sadly not.
At first, I was a little hesitant about taking time out of my life to see Seven.
How did she ever get the motivation to commit first degree murder?
Writer director David Cross who is a first timer when it comes to credentials, isn't necessarily to blame.
At this point I can't imagine ever finishing the first film let alone attempting a sequel.
Finally, the first few minutes start off promising and there is some humor but that vanishes further on.
A TV cowboy star is in actuality a wussy egomaniac who doesn't know the first thing about the Old West.
The entire first half is just CRAZY--a beautifully staged "chamber-comedy" in which we find ourselves enmeshed in the quirky interplay between a tedious, pampered boor and the behind-the-scenes mechanics of TV make-believe.
From Rance's nutty first entrance to the hilarious concluding plot twist, Serling managed to crank out his best comedy while buried under the stress of his third full season of production.
When I first saw this on the shelf at the store I thought that it had a strong potential to just be a "feel-good" movie geared only towards those in the open source movement.
I was taken to see this for the first time when I was too young to get most of the humor.
This is only about the first 2/3 of the film.
Somerset, (Morgan Freeman) a deeply Intellectual Detective, with barely a week left until his retirement and Mills, (Brad Pitt) the new cop in town, who is a pretty weak detective, are thrown together to investigate what at first appears to be another Homicide.
At first, she has a blast with only the occasional twinge of guilt.
It was probably not the vivid and beautiful 3 strip process which I think first appeared in 1939 with Gone With The Wind and The Wizard Of Oz (at least for major studio releases).
I'd heard this was an outstanding screwball comedy of the sort common in the mid and late 30s, so the first time I saw it, years ago, I thought I had caught the wrong movie because it wasn't very funny.
Wally is first banished to the obituary column of the paper (Ernest is given a janitorial job - this film is from the 1930s, by the way, so some stereotyping is going to be here).
He finds Hazel and makes the offer that Oliver has for her - if she will come to New York City, the newspaper will give her first rate hotel accommodations, fine dining, take to all the sites, and have the city lay out the official red carpet to her - until the day she dies.
One of the first movies filmed in Technicolor, it still looks pretty good though there is subtle graininess and typical for a film of this age, a constant popping noise exists in the background.
Then there's the propeller-driven airplanes, the first of the airliners flying right past the head of the Statue of Liberty.
The first time you get a good look at Lombard, she has shaving cream on her face from kissing a man who is shaving - also not the normal star-moment you might expect.
Even though I knew it was his first--and therefore probably cheesy--I still hoped for something of value.
So he made Shivers, his first feature.
Shivers is considered to be his first proper film & I personally liked Shivers much more than the rest of Cronenberg's early films like The Brood (1979) & Scanners (1981) for instance.
Technically Shivers is a little on the rough side but this is to be expected since it was Cronenberg's first film, having said that it's not badly made but it's just not as polished as maybe you might expect from Cronenberg.
In a posh apartment building there seems to be more to a bizarre murder/suicide than first apparent.
David Cronenberg's first feature film has all the visceral themes of his early works and they are executed with a vengeance.
That makes for a must see for horror fans and this is a great first film from a great director.
"Shivers" of 1975 is a nasty and highly entertaining exploitation flick and furthermore the first feature film directed by cult filmmaker David Cronenberg.
When I first tried to watch this film, I was around ten or eleven and though it was lame, boring and disturbing.
Still, this slice of Cronenberg's diseased reverence for "the flesh" carries the same "I need a shower now" feeling when it ends, as it did when it first unspooled on movie screens back in the day.
The young girl whom he had an affair with is the first, the second victim is the guy who works for a firm keeps a secret from his wife.
Your body will turn against you first, way before that happens!"
He'd said it before quite effectively in his first full-length feature, RABID.
David Cronenberg's first feature, THEY CAME FROM WITHIN (a.k.a., SHIVERS), is.
'Shivers' was the first major horror movie from Canadian film maker David Cronenberg, future director of 'The Brood', 'Scanners', 'Rabid', 'Videodrome', and the remake of 'The Fly'.
Cronenberg's first movie of note, Shivers (AKA They Came from Within), is the director's first attempt at tackling a theme that would eventually become his trademark: the progression of man's evolution through technology.
As more and more of the residents become infected, Roger attempts to at first destroy the creatures, then contain the situation, and eventually, when the block is finally completely over-run by sex-mad 'zombies', escape from the island.
It was the director's first long-feature film, made with an extremely low budget, but already showing his large interest in mixing shocking horror with subtle social criticism.
The first big screen flick for Canadian horror master David Cronenberg was this skin-crawling B horror movie.
Of course it's Cronenberg's first feature-length film, so it's worth seeing for historical reasons, but the script is boring, monotonous, unfocused and it lacks an engaging protagonist.
An early piece from David Cronenberg, this is his first cinematic exploration of themes which he would continually come back to throughout his career in films such as eXistenZ, Videodrome, The Fly and Crash.
"Shivers" is the first movie of this great Canadian cult director David Cronenberg, indeed a very low budget trash movie, with a final cost of US$ 179.000,00.
This was one of the first movies Richard Fleischer directed.
The Treasury department comes to ask his help and he at first refuses.
It must have been Director Richard Fleischer's first solid hit, as he went on to have a pretty distinguished career in Hollywood.
The film also features tragic sex bomb Barbara Payton in her first major role and she also scores as a somewhat naive, yet ruthless, partner to Bridges.
Lloyd Bridges plays a character with the unusual first name Tris.
The first things you notice is the great soundtrack and the film ( camera angles, etc.)
Lets list the positive first.
Actors are absolute talentless teens and the big drug dealer seems to be at his very first movie, without any reversals.
That first of all, she wouldn't get him to get OUT of his car before showing her badge?
As I heard, whatÂ´s the theme of "Common Ground", I thought first about other attempts like "In & Out", "Jeffrey" (also with Steven Weber) or "The Birdcage".
Many aspects are also named twice, especially in the first two episodes.
The first time I watched Common Ground I actually sobbed.
While Common Ground ends on a positive note and Connecticut actually is one of the first states to legalize gay marriage, I wouldn't want to be holding a wedding (or similar) ceremony in a place like rural Oklahoma or in 2/3 of the United States, for that matter!
The struggles of previous generations (the first two stories in the film) are still common in way too many places, even if substantial progress has been made in the West Coast, Mid-Atlantic, New England and Iowa (who would have guessed a gay person would have more rights in the heartland than in California?
A trilogy of gay/lesbian stories tracing societal attitudes towards homosexuals and the homosexual lifestyle from the 1950's to the present, this is the first "legacy" film for gays.
Rising actress Brittany Murphy (so good in very different roles in "Girl, Interrupted," TV's "David and Lisa," and "Clueless") is wonderful as the woman, displaying a touching range of emotions from wonder and excitement when she first visits a gay bar, to sadness and shame as the same townspeople who have known her all her life and at first welcome her return make it clear she is no longer welcome in their midst.
The first on passes in 1954, when a navy officer (the great actress Brittany Murphy) returns to Homer after quitting Navy.
The screenplay, performances and direction are superb, but I really would like to highlight the first short story: Brittany Murphy is really a great actress and has an outstanding performance.
By far the strongest segments were the first two.
As Murakami, the rookie, Toshiro Mifune internalizes his usual intensity and lets his eyes and expressions convey his growing sense of shame and horror when his pistol is used first in a robbery and then again in an even worse crime.
Watch the show, first, then watch the documentary to savor it.
There are some scenes that go on too long, and the first half is a bit slow.
This movie can be considered the first of the Japanese police dramas.
Kurosawa uses the actors that he uses in so many classic movies - Toshiro Mifune (a breakout role for Mifune, who had been typecast as a yakuza in his movie roles thus far), Takashi Shumura (Detective Sato) and the first movie appearance for Minoru Chiaki.
Like many others, my first Kurosawa film was "The Seven Samurai."
This was one of Kurosawa's first films and was set in modern Japan.
Mifune, a greenhorn homicide detective, has his gun pinched on a bus-ride home from target practice; the remainder of the movie finds him searching for his missing pistol, first undercover as a homeless veteran and then under the tutelage of Takashi Shimura's Detective Sato.
On first glance the scene feels too long and the audience gets the point after a minute, but by doing this the focus turns from the plot to the character of Murakami as the viewer sees how badly he wants his gun back.
The moment when, visiting the home of his fellow detective (the excellent Takashi Shimura) Murakami smiles for the first time in the movie on meeting his colleague's children is particularly moving.
In particular critics have often attacked the long drawn out search sequences in the first half hour of the film.
This may be his first 'great' movie, but in some sections it betrays his relative inexperience as a film maker - it slightly loses focus in the central part of the movie and he occasionally over-eggs his metaphors (something Kurosawa was always inclined to do).
Though it is not quite the masterpiece I had {probably unreasonably} been anticipating, I can only promise that my first Kurosawa will certainly not be my last.
Murakami first begins searching for his stolen gun, there is a wonderful extended sequence in which he purposelessly wanders the poverty-stricken streets, experiencing the decadence of society for himself, for the first time understanding why a criminal might have been forced to tread a darkened path.
Early Kurosawa masterpiece; arguably, his first.
Captivating American-esque noir, one of Kurosawa's first great films.
STRAY DOG stands as the legendary Akira Kurosawa's first real masterpiece, noteworthy for at least two big reasons: the style - classic American film noir (rich, velvety b&w atmospheres), enhanced with a touch of Italian neo-realism (great use of diverse locations, which provide a great view of day-to-day postwar Japan), and the star, a young Toshiro Mifune, whose truly collaborative association with Kurosawa was cemented here, and would grow in spectacular fashion during the subsequent 16 years.
Mifune became as much of an international icon as Kurosawa, and this is the first film where it's easily evident why.
STRAY DOG was perhaps the first of his films where it truly resonates in a global fashion - a timeless, classic film.
The following year, 1950, would see Kurosawa achieve his first major international success with the masterpiece Rashomon.
The only reason to keep watching beyond the first few minutes is the vain hope that the two crew might get it on, so let me save you the trouble and let you know that they don't.
Notice the double standard of Kensit's character as she first has sex with a man (in exchange for something she expects but never gets) & then disapproves her friend's (Hurley's) going a bit "too far" after their burlesque dance routine.
He takes the time to reflect on his life and what he's done-or not done-with it, and why he started taking pictures in the first place.
The first movie, The Ambush, delivered good action and I thought was good enough to start off the film series.
The first of the films that deserves and R Rating, it has profanity and violence unlike the others; sensitive viewers beware.
The first film was a groundbreaking car chase by the "master" John Frankenheimer.
Let me say first thanks to BMW.
Take a look to his first (and of course, awarded and successful) movie Amores Perros and you will understand what I mean.
While I found this style a little annoying at first, I ended up actually enjoying it and liking the commercial for being different without being bad(like the one Ang Lee misdirected).
However the pacing is slow and given that we know the pathetic final reel (indeed it is used as the first reel and we work backwards!)
Quel maledetto treno blindato (aka Inglorious Bastards) has risen from the ranks of the rest of the obscure Italian made, American acted cheapies first of all because of Quentin Tarantino's reverence for the film and the fact that he plans to a remake of sorts under the same title; second of all even though Tarantino's word is enough PR to get any obscure film to raise from the depths of the unknown into popular culture, it wouldn't work if the film wasn't any good.
It's fun sometimes and that type of fun is also in "Basterds"; here we have first a German soldier with the bastards and he at one point will give Tony and the Italian dude a surprise, that is not quite as dangerous as in "Basterds" but really funny: Tony thinks this German only speaks German so he insults and stuff, you know (in "Basterds" the Jew Hunter, Christoph Waltz's character at one point surprises everybody with his really good Italian!
It's great because at first it was just more of the same, I mean more killings and more lies with the bastards, now they killed a bunch of American soldiers thinking they were Germans and took advantage of the confusion of the French pretending to be, this time, certainly not Germans but other Americans, the American soldiers they just had killed, the American soldiers that were especially trained for a mission.
The film is entertaining from the first minute to the very end; and this is achieved by a bunch of interesting characters, some well worked humour; and best of all, a plethora of violence.
When everything seems to be on schedule, the mission suffers a major set-back when a second train featuring a host of German soldiers arrives in the village where the first was supposed to stop, with many men dead after all is said and done.
The cast is first rate.
I wasn't sure at first what to expect from director Enzo G. Castellari.
The first type are those that you fall asleep watching.
That's a first one.
I first saw this movie on TCM, and I became enamored of this fabulous acting couple.
At first dubious, the Actor is eventually convinced that his wife was playing along with him, and the two romantically embrace.
Preview: Summary: This one has a trained penguin  This is the twelfth Bulldog Drummond film, the third starring John Howard as Drummond, and the second based on Sapper's novel 'The Third Round' (the first version of which was the silent film of 1925 'Bulldog Drummond's Third Round' starring Jack Buchanan, of which one print is said to survive in an archive).
(Could also be his first name may have been a downer in the long run.)
After seeing THE SOUTHERNER for the first time, I had a number of reactions:  (1) The title was a desperate marketing ploy by United Artists to find an audience for a film that must have been a severe marketing challenge.
THE SOUTHERNER is notable for giving ZACHARY SCOTT his first real chance to shine as a promising new movie actor headed for stardom, teaming him with the always reliable BETTY FIELD as the wife of a dirt poor farmer in this Depression-era saga, uplifting despite the adversity of their situation due to Jean Renoir's fine direction.
In the first part, agent Dane Corvin (Richard Chamberlain) is posing as a businessman interested in buying fish illegally caught by members of the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community.
Unfortunately Go West spends first two and a half minutes on prologue, boring prologue to be precise.
Sometimes the characters do not act as sane people would, and everything is a bit stretched, but this movie has other good points and is important maybe not as a great movie, but as a first movie that tackles homosexual love in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Here is the first line: "Former Navy Seal Lamont Dixon (Eddie Griffin) thought he left his fighting days behind when he became a tugboat captain... "  Okay I really rented the movie based on my vision of the pitch someone had to give to get this movie made.
This approach is nothing new, but in the bad of old of the 1980s, when they were first trying to do this, what they were essentially doing is producing soap opera.
Also, do NOT watch this until you first watch THE WINDS OF WAR to set the context for this miniseries.
How it impacted the Henry family, and showed us why we should care about them now than the first series.
And anyone with a lick of sense would have replaced that comical, cardboard cutout of a Hitler from the first series.
I saw it when it first aired and I watched it again this month on DVD and it is amazing how well it holds up.
He was first and foremost a dedicated military man, not a Lothario.
Just be sure to watch the "Winds of War" first.
If you are going to watch this series do watch Winds of War first.
One other odd aspect of this series, which people find jarring to various degrees is that different actors fill major roles in the first and second series.
After reading the book The Winds of War and watching the first mini series in 1983, I waited for War and Remembrance to premier in 1989.
The first half on this DVD set covers the years 1941-1943, beginning with Pearl Harbor and weaving the Henry family into all the events of the war.
However, with 5 years between the first and the second series, much happened and the result was a number of actor/actress changes that make the second series confusing after seeing the first.
Major characters, such as Natalie Jastrow-Henry, played by Ali McGraw in the first, Jane Seymour in the second.
I attended just such a performance at the 24th August 2005 premiere screening of Gypo in the UK at the Edinburgh International Film Festival (EIFF) and found it to be a powerful dramatic piece (the first British one) from the recent Dogme genre of film making.
Personally I had problem with the first hour of the movie, which is quite boring and sometimes very annoying.
The director put a lot of scenes in the movie, which don't have nothing to do with a whole story; for example first 10 minutes we're just watching the lead female character stripping on the stage.
Or, if it's election night, and you're excited and you wanna celebrate because some fudgepacker that you date has been elected the first queer president of the United States and he's going to have you down to Camp David, and you want someone to share the moment with.
Our first introduction to him we wittness him taking his gay neighbour's dog running around and chucking it down the garbage chute.
Hunt and Nicholson falling in love is an easy out because then Brooks doesn't really have to deal with the more difficult (and more interesting) ideas brought up in the first half.
I have to say that after watching this movie the first time, I totally enjoyed it.
The only safe bet I had was Dustin Hoffman and from the first scene he looked his usual best.
When I first saw this movie I thought it was really boring and overrated, but I saw it again the second day and immediately loved it.
Direction is first rate, Brooks made Terms of Endearment so it's well established that he's quite capable of making great films.
He first intrudes into their conversation saying, "People who speak in metaphors oughtta shampoo my crotch."
Bruce was one of the first comedians to use swearing in his act and was actually taken to court over it.
His first movie, The Offspring, was great, and his Stepfather and Pumpkinhead sequels were better than average.
Chronologically, I'm definitely not a 'kid' any more, and wasn't when I first watched this excellent series either, but I still couldn't resist its charms, and thankfully, had the foresight to record most of the episodes.
They present these life or death scenarios without truly exploring why we're supposed to care about the world's inhabitants in the first place.
Prime example, in the beginning after Lucy returned from Narnia as she re-entered the wardrobe, the character specifically knew that she had been gone for apparently hours, so as she re-enters, the first thing she does is to shout out to everyone who inevitably will be worried about her, that she's OK. After they question her, she then realistically asks, "wait, what?
She first begins to use it, but then is told by Susan that it's too late, implying that since he's already dead, the potion would do no good since it's meant to heal injuries only.
It's good, yes, but it's not really all that fantastic, compared to the first films of "Lord of the Rings" and "Harry Potter."
In this first film of probably many, we're introduced to four children, all uniquely different in a good way.
It feels like you would want to spend a whole movie with, which is the first thing one must do before making the movie.
The first act drags a bit and I thought they could've sped up the pace a lot better.
I remember being hugely disappointed the first time I saw the first installment in what is shaping up to be the massive adaptation of the Chronicles of Narnia novels into movies.
This is not, as you know, the first time the Chronicles have been attempted.
When it was first released I was unimpressed.
I watched the movie again the other day and, while I can see what I didn't like the first time, I think I was a little harsh in my initial opinion of the movie.
For starters, it is a brilliantly visionary and faithful re-creation of the book for almost the entire first hour, and doesn't get genuinely cheesy until the talking wolves show up and the movie forgets that it's not supposed to take itself so seriously.
James MacEvoy, by the way, gives one of the best performances in the movie as Mr. Tumnus, the half-man/half-fawn that Lucy meets as soon as she first enters into Narnia.
My first exposure to the world of Lenny Bruce was the Broadway show, Lenny.
I don't remember what film I was watching (it was 31 years ago) when I first saw a trailer for the film, but as soon as I saw a clip of Dustin Hoffman as Lenny I knew something was wrong.
The direction was first rate.
When I first heard of Narnia I thought that it was an old movie that in a few weeks was going to be released on TV.
I read the first two books in about a week and I wondered to myself.
NARNIA should glow and jump off the screen, but the first act is to busy getting from point a to point b than to allow us to immerse ourselves in the NARNIAN landscape.
Because if you can get through the first hour (which really isn't that bad).
While this film has a few rough spots and a first act that needed some work THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH, and THE WARDROBE is an enchanting journey that is worth the price of admission.
Now comes this wonderful film of the first chronicle, "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe."
I do not think that it will win the best picture Oscar though because it is only the first movie in a series of seven.
The director, Andrew Adamson is a bit unsteady with his first live-action feature.
Even though I missed the opening night due to bad Canadian weather, the crowd retained that grand spirit of being one of the first to see a film.
I was surprised Bardot had such a big role considering this was her first picture.
I'll admit that when I first saw this movie when I was about nine years old, I loved it.
You would swear you were seeing these improvisations for the first time if you hadn't heard them already.
I saw this movie when it first came out, and just recently purchased it.
While the premise certainly has promise, alas said promise is severely undermined by writer/director Brett Piper's lackluster execution: the sluggish pace crawls along for the first two thirds of the picture, there's no spooky atmosphere to speak of, the special effects are strictly so-so, and the drab and uneventful script gets bogged down in a dull surplus of insipid talk.
Fosse, known for his choreography which is still being used in films like Chicago years after his death only directed five theatrical films and three of those were musicals in Sweet Charity, Caberet and All That Jazz so Lenny would be the first of only two non-musicals he would direct, both biographies, Lenny and Star 80.
The first comment is just one opinion.
The first 5 minutes or so may be a bit of a drag, though-however, it is well worth enduring.
I loved this film even though im not familiar with the first two.
Let me just say that I was very happy when I first heard that in Jopog manura 3,Shu Qi was going to replace Shin Eun Kyung as the lead role.
The first thing that struck me was the bad effect's in the opening scenes but then I saw that it was computer generated graphics and not CGI in a time when Windows 95 was the hottest OS.
The first thought that sprang to mind after the movie was: Why did I have to see this movie?
The first part focuses primarily on the Mutual period when Chaplin made twelve films in sixteen months.
This was the first.
Charles Chaplin was truly the first independent filmmaker - with the exception perhaps of Georges Melies.
At first, I thought this all sounded very dry but as the film continued I realized what a great treasure this is.
A first rate movie for people of any era and age.
For me, this is the film that convinced me that Dustin Hoffman is truly a first rate actor.
The thing that really got me, the first time I saw this film, was how gorgeous Shirley Temple was as a young woman.
This was his first and only non musical, and he was triumphant.
Some of my favorite moments with Hoffman in Lenny was when he thinks about the nurse the first time, when Honey calls asking for money, and when he asks the Judge to sentence him now instead of going through the trial.
I am also aware of how little respect English gets as daily we hear of schools cutting back on their Literature studies to help support their sports program, or how the first way to cut back spending is to close libraries.
His is a superb,nuanced performance,leading us in time to an understanding and an empathy for what at first appears a "lost boy", just as he comes to find what had been lost within his spirit.
The film doesn't talk down to the audience, something I find very refreshing after a summer of blockbusters...the first few minutes are a bit chaotic and confusing and they mirror the troubled protagonist.
The first of those was quite early on, and I thought that the film was going to pull itself together and turn into something really good; but she disappeared then until another short scene quite close to the end.
This is a first for the French cinema, the remake of an American film, when just the opposite is what happens always.
Emmanuelle Devos is his dad's new girlfriend, whom Tom first calls a whore and rejects and then wants to hire on to calm things on the home front.
I can really recommend this film, first rate.
Two assassins are hired by someone to make a perfect plan on killing the President, but first they intend to lure him to Seattle where they have people on the inside to help kill the President.
I just keep wondering why there isn't a love interest yet for the President since he did say in the first movie that he is a widower.
I saw this film the year it first hit the theaters.
My first pick to watch was not Rawhide or The Gunfighter, the two black and white pictures in the collection, but rather the Technicolor, Garden of Evil.
The "Fox Western Classics" DVD version of Garden of Evil reminded me in terms of picture quality of the first time I saw Garden of Evil, on a theater screen when it was originally released in 1954.
It looks at first like she deeply loves her husband, but she isn't really behaving like she does.
The group's troubles grow when they discover they are in danger, practically harassed by savage Indians...   "Garden of Evil" was Cooper first motion picture in CinemaScope...
Some interesting things of note from this episode: We get to see Scully drive a boat for the first time in the series.
With lovely locations in Mexico this was Fox's first western in the then new process of Cinemascope and Stereophonic sound and boasted a top notch cast in Gary Cooper, Susan Hayward and Richard Widmark.
The main theme, first heard over the credits, is a brilliant defiant statement for full orchestra and is played in different guises throughout the movie.
Roger Adams (Cary Grant), a newspaperman, meets and falls in love at first sight with Julie Gardiner (Irene Dunne), a young woman who works in a record store.
The movie is told with Dunne's character, a woman contemplating divorce, reminiscing on happier times with the record she first listened to with her husband spinning.
There were a few bright moments of comedy, notably the first night of parenting their adopted child.
This is the first comedy performance of hers I have watched.
Just start with "An Affair to Remember" first.
The first 3/4 of the movie is cute, but nothing to rave about: boy meets girl, they eventually falling love, marry, she becomes pregnant and everyone is happy.
Grant was nominated for his first Academy Award as Best Actor for his heart-wrenching portrayal of a man that seems to repeatedly lose everyone he ever cares about.
Unlike the first two films - Leo McCarey's "The Awful Truth" (1937) and Garson Kanin's "My Favorite Wife" (1940) - this wholly sentimental 1941 tearjerker is not remotely a screwball comedy.
This wonderful film has been a perennial favorite of mine, ever since I first saw it as a small boy.
The movie depicts in a very real, truthful way, everyday vignettes in the lives of this couple since they first meet, with plenty of dialogue (some viewers may find it kind of "talky"), but nonetheless of a very honest kind.
If only the filmmakers had implied that several *months*, or better yet, a year or more, had passed, and shown the couple finding each other again first, it would have been much more believable and touching.
Cary Grant got his first of two trips to the Oscar sweepstakes with this film.
I wasn't much of a Cary Grant fan until I saw this film for the first time about 10 years ago, and I also discovered the embodiment of grace and charm that is Irene Dunne as well.
It was also an interesting insight into how a couple struggles to raise their first child, which is something many people can relate to, no matter what the time period.
Beulah Bondi (who played George Bailey's mother from It's A Wonderful Life) has a great supporting role as the head of the adoption agency who has doubts about the couple at first, but then grows to care a great deal for them.
I agree with the first reviewer for the most part.
Former Oscar winner Mercedes Ruehl shines in the role of his mother who at first thinks that he will outgrow his obsession of being a girl only to find out that this shall be his way of life.
I watched this movie the very first time it was aired on october 1992 and have watched every rerun on lifetime since.
I liked the flashes of the future in black and white though.And the explosion at the start looked pretty good, I think thats why it's disappointing, because the first five minuets were more entertaining than the rest of it put together.
There's also the over-used music from Holst's The Planets and Handel's Messiah (hey, Phil, it was funny the first 600 times someone used it back in the 30s).
The film is basically historically accurate, with some interesting interpretive film making involving John Glenn and his first flight and other tidbits.
I loved it when I first saw it and I still enjoy it.
It seems that just about the entire cast had their first major breakthrough on "Right Stuff".
An Excellent Showing for Thibault's first Directing/Writing Debut.
Watch the movie  The first step in writing the review is to watch the movie.
I first saw it in 70mm in a cinema re-release in 1995, and still remember that night as one of the most transcendental cinema experiences of my life.
And more impressively considering its ensemble there's almost a key character to the mix with Chuck Yeagher, the first man to break the sound barrier who never got into NASA with all the other go-for-broke test pilots, but did taste that rush up to the sky just once - and what a rush.
the cut-aways to the aborigines during Glenn's flight up in space) still carry some worth as far as being filmed wonderfully or with a strange quality that makes it fun to watch - any other director might take out the crucial detail of Alan Shepard urinating in his suit before the very first successful launch of a US man into space, but it's left in, and stronger for it.
The movie first starts out with Chuck Yeager(Sam Shepard) attempting to break the sound barrier.
The movie continues with other story lines as professional pilots desperately try to get into the NASA space program, become the first Americans into space, and try to break some kind of record that will beat what the Russians had.
The first couple of hours go by as if they were 25 minutes, and the last hour is thrilling, as well as inspiring.
An interesting insight into the United States' space program, beginning with the exploits of fighter pilot Chuck Yeager (Sam Shephard) and concluding with the dramatic flights of the first astronauts.
Then we are treated to a long-but-interesting segment of how those first astronauts were trained.
Sad to say, most people know very little about those first astronauts, who were true heroes.
Here are three examples: Cooper dropping a tiny toy space capsule into Grissum's drink (foreshadowing), Copper reading Life magazine before the publisher enters the movie (to make sure we viewers know that Life magazine exits), Yeager bumping his elbow on a limb of a cactus tree as he walks into Pancho's at the beginning of the movie (I never noticed this the first few times I watched the movie, but surely this tiny action was deliberate.)
Though he was one of the first ones out, he was also the last one eliminated, and it was almost disappointing to see Austin beat him.
2001 definitely was the best year for WWF and its first PPV starts things off nicely.
I first saw this film on the Arts and Entertainment channel (A&E) in the 1960s when i was teaching in Montserrat.
I was fourteen years of age when I first saw this film.
I first heard about this movie when I was living down south and a friend of mine mentioned it to me.
Because you get the opportunity to watch one of the greatest films of all time for the first time, an experience I wish I could relive.
Not at first.
The problem was when after finishing seeing the movie i went back and saw the first minutes, and then... oh boy did i cried.
By leaving us with these two characters, who piece by piece are stripped of their innocence in just the simple task of fending for themselves in a shelter (they at first stay with an aunt who considers them freeloaders) and scrounging for food any way possible, we're left with nothing else but their struggle, essentially.
Each time a layer of emotional defense is peeled back, it becomes harder not to connect strongly with these characters, such as when Seiko casually says she knows her mother is dead as she buries the fireflies and Seita finally cries out for the first time, or when Seita is left broken and humiliated after being beat up by the farmer for stealing food for sick Setsuko.
And the prospect of watching it didn't sound too appealing to me at first, considering the rather subdued DVD case cover...(I know, I'm ashamed)   That said, this film is a masterpiece of story telling, the calibre of which my current favourite films pale in comparison.
I've vowed never to see this film again, as I think revisiting it would lessen the emotional impact of the first viewing.
For the first time, I have decided to write a comment.
This is my first review on IMDb.
I first saw this film when I first really got into anime in High School.
Because their father is off fighting in the war and they have no way of contacting any other family, they're sent to live with their aunt, who is at first warm and welcoming to them, but eventually becomes very cruel and the children are forced to live in a nearby bomb shelter.
While at first they're taken in by his aunt the relationship between him and his aunt takes a turn for the worst.
I also learned that this was his first film, and what a way out of the gate!
Being my first Anime review I thought I'd start off with my one of my favourite pieces of work from who else but Studio Ghibli.
Visions of this film have haunted me since first watching it, and I would find it hard to watch again, simply from it being so heart-wrenching.
As for a character revealing that he is dead in the first line of the movie, this is a device which has been used in centuries if not Milena.
At first I winced when I heard this show has the tag-line of banality, namely "A Sci-Fi Channel Original".
It's kind of endearing to watch these guys so earnestly vie for first place while chasing imaginary bad guys and saving planted characters around the city.
Well the first time I saw this my first thought was... "Oh god no...".
People who will like this show will be fans of superheroes first and foremost.
I preferred the first half of the series to the second half.
I think that it turned into a bit of a soap opera to me with all their wayward children and their love lives :) I could watch the first half where William and Sarah first meet over and over though.
I have to admit, I loved the first part of the movie best.
You first saw it in The Scarlet Pimpernel, and was very important for this movie.
The first aspect that addresses the viewers, both opera buffs and modern genres' lovers, the aspect that highlights the very core of their emotions and experiences, are the visuals of the movie.
I first heard about "Cha Fa Nui" (Camille) from the mouth of my mother when I was still an upper primary school girl.
Furthermore, the book inspired Giuseppe Verdi first to make it into an opera but not Franco Zeffirelli's movie.
His editing down of several (repetitive) arias, and visual depiction of many of the arias' contents through flashbacks caused much controversy in Europe where I first saw it in its 1982 premiere.
What I find very interesting is that the rabbit we meet first has more modern animation, the type in Robert Clampett Bugs Bunny shorts and in the short film with Hiawatha, Bugs Bunny is done in his older animation.
Personally I prefer the first style of animation to Bugs.
He is awarded, however, the first Raspberry, moulded in his own image, which comes to life and kisses him.
Kristen seems like a normal and decent sort of person for the first 1/4 of the film.
If I had seen this film before reading the book first, I still would not have liked it very much.
It follows the first book in the trilogy very faithfully.
A beautifully directed, well acted, and consistently faithful adaptation of the first of Sigrid Undset's Nobel Prize-winning novels about her fourteenth-century fictitious heroine, Kristin Lavransdatter.
My only regret is that they did not make sequels out of the second and third Lavransdatter novels to complete the trilogy, since, indeed, the ending of the movie and of the first novel leave you hungering for more.
Sijan is to be commended for his courage in parodying a genre that has never been too popular with Serbian moviegoers in the first place.
Remember your first love?...your first great loss?...the camaraderie of your best friend?...
; Edward Arnold's belated entrance, in my opinion, brings the film to life after a rather slow first half.
Believe me, by the first few episodes I was hooked.
You'll fall in love with it from the first episode.
A group of Bounty Hunters looking for criminals, that is how you see the series the first time you watch it, but believe me: THIS IS A MUST SEE if you want to feel alive.
This is the anime that got me introduced to anime in the first place, and it is stylistically brilliant.
The show is stylistic, in fact one of the reasons i was drawn to it from the first episode was because of that very stylistic nature.
I think the best way to begin this would be not to thank but to bear hug,the creative geniuses who created this piece of art..i mean everything about this show is f**king perfect-the characters,the plot,the direction,the music,the screenplay,the script..Its a perfect example of when all the things come together to make something that is larger than the creators themselves..I don't know how i stumbled across the page of cowboy bebop but it must have one my lucky days..I have to say i was not intrigued from the plot as much as from the characters,which i read about in the comments..my expectations from the show were pretty low despite the rating but man when i watched its first two episodes,even the 9.4 rating seemed an insult..and IT IS THAT GOOD..you would filled with awe for its creators after you watch it..you would even love the cowboy bebop sign that comes in between the show..The best thing about the show is that is has no specific genre,or you can say its a genre in itself..i wont have the slightest doubt if the show gets a cult status..so you never know whats gonna come out in the next scene,whether you will be convulsing with laughter or staring at the screen in empathy for one of the characters..as the show goes on and on,you keep on going deep into the skin of the characters..you don't know when it happens that the characters just occupy a permanent space in your head..you start to wish that they are always around..with a bored spike smoking his cigarette,jet watering his plants ,sulky faye with her frown and industrious ed jumping around with his laptop..and when the show ended,i actually felt a part of my life going away..and i bet you will feel the same way when the show ends..you will stare into the eyes of spike and say " no this is not going to happen,i wont let you go"..its a rare feeling for someone in real life but its almost impossible for someone in reel life..  so my respect to shinichiro wantanbe from the bottom of my heart for directing the show so perfectly and congratulations to hajami yatate for writing something so perfect in itself..and kobayashi and yoko kanno,no man i ain't forgetting them either..the show wouldn't have been complete without their music which encompasses everything from jazz to metal to blues to country to electronic..I urge everyone who reads this comment to watch this show..doesn't matter if you're not an anime fan..this show is apiece of art and it must not be missed..and if you're an anime fan,then you wont be seeing something as great as this in a long time..i guess if you take my word,then you're in for one of your luckiest days of your life..  SEE YOU IMDb COWBOY..
My first thought was, was this movie colorized?
Next, several story arcs were at first hinted at, then truly converged and were resolved by series' end.
In the very first episode, we see Spike in a violent gun battle against people unknown, and we really don't revisit that event till several episodes later.
A lot of anime's do have concepts that are sort of hard to understand the first time around, but Bebop is pretty simplistic and to be fair I first viewed it at, I think, the middle of the whole series, I got it no sweat.
When I heard this was made in 1995, I was at first surprised and then understanding.
Started out to seem like one of those exploitation fliks lots of naked ladies, dodgy doctors, even dodgier prison warders, yes this is what happens in the first half hour or so, but actually it turns out to have a fairly good ,if not basic, story line.
The Runner was perhaps the first of the post-revolution Iranian films to attract worldwide attention, ... and very deservedly so.
I've heard that this was the first in, what has been referred to as, "the Amiro trilogy".
"Going Highbrow" is a must see for fans of Zasu Pitts as she dominates the first half of the film with a somewhat different variation on her airhead character.
My first complaint right off the bat is the group were apparently at a rave and didn't seem the least bit high or drunk.
An excellent film and the first in many years to actually deserve the title of 'horror movie'
For the first time in my life it actually made me jump back in my seat- and that was pretty embarassing seen as there was a whole row of girls a couple of rows back!
Then we get to the negative points, beginning with mostly indifferent or awful acting, slow pacing, especially in the first thirty minutes, and an atrociously rewritten script, which keeps the basic plot line,but throws out most of Hammerstein's dialogue to make way for some memorably corny lines ("There's still not enough room on this boat for the two of us!").
After pressing play on the VHS, this rather confused and quite frankly stupid reason of thought was quickly diminished after the first ten minutes or so had passed by.
So, tentatively, Chad walks down the corridor, slowly at first, then building up a little as he nears the door.
You don't kill the most attractive cast members first.
I can only admire this film, and considering it's comparativly low budget and it being Marcus Adam's first; they've done an excellent job.
The only way for the demon to go back to where it came from is if he kills whole group friends who let him out in the first place.
As I said, I had no idea what this film would be like - my first shock was with the opening Voice-Over - it was a Liverpudlian accent!
I must say, for a first time director/actor/writer...Mr. Cherot has many skills.
My only question is with some of the acting, but damn...for a low budget, first time debut--- this movie impressed the hell out of me.
The plot was a bit fuzzy and had the makings of a first time director but overall entertaining.
Chris Cherot's first feature is an indication of good things to come.
I saw Hav Plenty when it was first released back in 1997 and i still feel about it today the same as i did when i left out of the theater back in '97.
As the first true American "musical play", it marked a significant departure from operettas, light musical comedies of the 1890s and early 20th century and the "Follies"-type musical revues that had defined Broadway.
The first scene leads you into thinking that it may be a good movie, but after that it rolls out all the old clichÃ©s.
CREATURE WITH THE ATOM BRAIN is actually the first Sam Katzman-produced horror film I've checked out Â and it's one of four that were recently packaged together in Columbia's ongoing "Icons Of Horror" series of genre Box Sets; a second, THE GIANT CLAW (1957), followed this straight awayÂand, even if I wasn't exactly enthused with either of them, I'd still like to catch up with the remaining two titles (namely THE WEREWOLF [1956] and ZOMBIES OF MORA TAU [1957]).
I don't know how I missed it on my first viewing (in the same theater).
Having just seen this for the first time, I was pleasantly surprised; this is a solid, well-acted and scripted, somewhat tongue-and-cheek but scary horror/sci-fi film with a premise simutaneously nightmarishly banal/outrageous: a petty American criminal (looking like a cheap burley thug, the kind who would "threaten" George Reeves on the cheap sets on the t.v.
John Launer (in his first movie role) played police Capt.
This must have been quite frightening on the big screen, particularly after being accustomed to the more distanced style of the first sixty minutes of the film.
I had to walk (run) by some woods in the dark on the way home from this movie and I was quite convinced that one of these guys was going to stroll out from among the trees and break me in half just as the first creature, Karl 'Killer" Davis, did to his gangster victim in the opening scene.
I loved this show from the very first episode.
Ask me about my childhood, and if the first thing I mention isn't this show, you can bet I'll start humming the theme song as I think.
I can't continue to write about it without spoiling anything or reminiscing about how I used to get yelled at in first grade for telling my teacher that I invited these characters to school to join us for lunch.
Those events would not affect anyone's life negatively, and yet, it would not have been our first thought.
Comedy is just the perfect condiment that guides you and distracts you through a series of events that never have sense for the first time.
For example, the first episode shows an execution in 1808, and the last shows a present-day riot where people are shot.
The key vocalists are absolutely first rate: Howard Keel, Kathryn Grayson and William Warfield were at the tops of their games here.
This is one of the first 'surreal' films that I have seen.
The first act contains what I consider the best back to back to back musical numbers in Broadway history with Make Believe - Ol' Man River - Can't Help Lovin Dat Man and the movie rearranges them out of order and only River is fleshed out.
The other note is that if you wonder if this structure has ever been repeated or expounded upon, Richard Linklater's first film Slacker comes closest, though with a much different tone and style of comedy.
"Le FantÃ´me de la LibertÃ©" is perhaps BuÃ±uel's least accessible work since his first two films, "Un Chien Andalou" and "L' Age d' Or".
All they did was alter the first movie slightly, take out some of the conflict, throw in some different actors...
I did not find the 'big finale' very interesting, meaning I had to sit through an hour and a half of drama that I'd already seen in the first movie, just so I could see the poorly done finish.
I liked this movie just about as much as the first, if not more.
None of the original cast was in the second one (no one can take Julia Stiles place in that movie) and just the fact that everything that Sara and Derek went through in the first one just to be together - "they" decided to take a break from each other and date other people.
They repeated the same story line as the first but with a different love interest for the same main character.
It totally ruined a great movie and now I am going to have to try to forget that I ever saw it in the first place.
It did not relay the message as the first one did.
In the first five minutes of this movie we saw an interview with no context (Who was interviewing her?
On the first appearance of the room mate, Zoe (who even has a clichÃ© quirky brunette name) we see that the writer clearly doesn't even have the basic knowledge required for his craft.
Even allowing for the fact that anyone can make a fool of him/herself when it comes to love, Fred's abrupt changes of heart, especially the first volt face when he decides to employ Maizie, left me a little puzzled.
This Rex Beach work was first done as silent movies in 1914, 1923.
A sometimes painfully slow first half, partially due to Dietrich's role being stretched out to fit her top-billed status, is redeemed by an engrossing and exciting second half, including a rousing climax at Wayne and Carey's mine and a helluva great fist-fight between the Duke and Scott.
When the first version was made the Emperor Franz Josef was still on the throne in Austria.
From the minute I first read that she'd appear alongside Wesley Snipes in a new action movie, I knew it'd go straight to video (the Blade franchise is the only thing keeping Snipes in theatres) and I feel kind of sorry for her if she was expecting things to go any bigger, but this could be the start of bigger things and I wish her well for the future.
The lack of script starts showing up after that first scene making the movie a pretty bad clichÃ©.
The location was a great one, the first car chase was great, fast paced and full of action, they then duplicate it towards the end.
The car chase in the second half looks just like the one in the first half.
After the first car chase the camera inverts for no reason i can guess at.
The first car chase was a ton of fun and the action-packed climax was very cool.
I saw this movie in England when it first came out and it has stayed with me ever since.
When I see it again I am sure I will get a lot more out of her work, but the first time through it was tough.
Trina's performance wasn't bad for her first movie.
No worse than other rappers or singers the first time out.
Few will remember that he took the lead role when "The King and I" first came to London at Drury Lane (I think) and that he was the natural choice for the Harry Lime role in the radio version of "The Third Man" (circa, 1951).
i have to say i was a little skeptical at first when we paid a dollar to rent this movie, but no doubt it will find it's way into my DVD rack sometime soon.
A very good first half hour gives way to long exposition in the middle hour, and while there are some genuinely nice moments its a little too plodding as it tries to cover one clichÃ© too many.
I don't remember when was the first time that I hear something about this film but since then and when I saw the trailer it becomes for me the film to check this year.
Even I really liked the first part of the film, with the story of the town and some memorable scenes (like the "now my name is Henry" or the escape of the gunman), is the final part the best one.
In fact, the plot is yet another rehash of Japanese master Akira Kurosawa's samurai classic YOJIMBO (1961), which had actually led to Sergio Leone kick-starting the Spaghetti Western subgenre with that film's first remake A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS (1964)!
The film is very well acted & the production values are first rate.
A fine cast of actors doing a brilliant job with a first class director.
This was Miike's first all English production, and it showed.
But all the old westerns and samurai films should have trained you to be patient in the first 15min.
I was a bit taken aback, at first, and I never really understood why, but I rolled with it.
With the first words spoken, however, it became painfully apparent what this movies main problem would be.
who was a protÃ©gÃ© of one of the first western gunmen in Japan, "Bingo" (cameo by Quentin Tarantino) to destroy the clans and bring peace to the town.
Language was my first problem.
To it's credit, there was some cool style and cinematography going on, and if the whole movie was like the first 5 minutes, minus Quentin because he's a bad actor, This movie would have been awesome.
Koji Endo composes the soundtrack, it is not his first time working with Miike and hopefully won't be the last.
it was first place in box office by the tickets sold in cinemas across country.
I wasn't expecting much of it since i only went to the theatre to see Alexandra Mutu who was sooo hot, but i was far worse than i had expected it to be.A poor plot, poor characters(except Garcea who makes you laugh a few times only because of the stupidity), crap acting and crap directing.The beginning made me wanna know what the heck i was doing there in the first place, the Skol beer advertising was horrible and the character - director interaction from the movie, which was intended to be fun was just bad taste.The TV show is far better.
When I first read the story, I thought it would be fun to see an ordinary thief change into a legendary general!
Also you see a bunch of British actors all trying (badly) to fake American accents (the kids who are killed first).
But, fortunately, they did bring a horny lady who talks incessantly about sex and who lifts her skirt at the first available moment on an island where mass murder just occurred!!
She also starred in the first Broadway production of "Cabaret" as Sally Bowles.
It appears less often than Hammers output or other more famous British horrors so it was a first time viewing for me and I enjoyed it a good deal.
I've just seen Tower of Evil for the first time and found it rather scary in parts.
The first part of "Tower of Evil" is a bit dull, but the rest of the movie is exciting.
I saw this movie when it was first released and didn't really care for it.
So I gotta give her a little bit of credit, being that this was her first performance.
Houston is, of course, gorgeous and sings like an angel, but her acting "talent" is nowhere to be seen, and her ineptness brings down the whole movie--not that it had a lot going for it in the first place.
In the real world Costner's character would have told her to screw off after the first day and dumped her, but--in a plot "twist" you can see coming a mile away--they proceed to fall in love.
They hate each other at first but naturally fall in love.
In fact without the soundtrack, the movie would have died on its first weekend.
Incredibly Last of The Summer Wine first appeared in 1973.
The performances are first rate, especially Bill Owen as Compo.
Let me first say that I have noted the many favorable comments here but as far as I'm concerned, to quote Fawlty Towers' outboard motor salesman: "This Wine Is Corked".
This programme has been one of British televisions centre pieces since the first pilot episode.
Her blown-out of proportions lips invade the screen from the first seconds of the film, and sadly, her acting is proportionally emphasized.
The only reason to see this tripe is for a very steamy sex scene between Banderas and Jolie within the first half hour.
It grabs you from the first shot and never lets go.
All of the reviews I read ( the first 20 or so) were all raving about this in my opinion silly remake.
Although at first glance this film appears to have been done as a final project for a film school freshman, the film has many great and classic qualities.
But Julia may not be who she claims: first a private eye (Thomas Jane) shows up on behalf of Julia's sister, then the sister herself.
This was the first film I've seen of Luis Bunuel and this movie stars Pedro Armendariz as a strong guy with a lot of muscle but not a lot of brains.
Well, while the film seems at first aggravatingly conventional, there are enough subversive digressions from the genre (beast-mollified-by-virtuous-beauty) that makes you rethink the point of the entire film.
OKay first off I had nothing to do with this movie nor did I personally know any of the actors or any of the cast or crew members for that matter.
Seeing her in this film was like seeing Brad Pitt for the first time in 'Cool World'.
I was waiting for long for Kisna to release and saw it on the first day itself.
Considering that this was Hartsell & Shirley's first film, it's an excellent effort from two people who are obviously fellow horror fans.
or see other parts of the ship besides first class?
You can't be happy with the first thing you write that's just wrong.
Recently I saw for the first time Scorsese's comedy After Hours and was fascinated how masterful he was in creating a darkly funny surreal comedy.
The narration by Joanne Woodward is jarring at first, yet gives the modern viewer an idea of 1870's New York City mores.
Then you can see a guy who looks like Mister T on a different vehicle in a scene, then in the next scene he's on a different vehicle and then back on the first vehicle.
I completely "missed it" the first time around.
Mizoguchi is well known in the world of Japanese film, because he was one of the first Japanese directors to put the role of women in Japanese society on the center stage.
I won't hide this was a huge surprise for me because it is the first pre-WWII Japanese movie I ever lay eyes on.
Break out the stash first and you'll be rating it up there with The Godfather.
The first time I ever heard of this title I thought it was a joke; it was in reference to a movie poster for the film.
And I could only bear to watch the first 10 - 15 minutes of it before I had to turn it off.
It is a pretty good movie, but the first half was too long.
This is the first of two films with the same trio.
The first three quarters feature her lying on bed, and the remaining one introduces her as a good human being and caring sister, too typical and boring.
I didn't know who the editor was at first, and I thought he/she should be fired.
Concert disc:  Let me get this out of the way first.
END SPOILER  If this is to be way of all future concert DVDs I will be forced to stop buying them (luckily I rented this first).
Some are even from the same show, just not having all the jump-cuts on the first disc - hence more enjoyable.
I gave it a 4 rating, because the reason you buy a concert DVD is for the concert, and that is what I would rate the first disc.
After more than 25 years since they released their first album, they are still going strong!
I have seen this series again since the first American run in 1977, so I'm not relying only on dim memory.
Also there was a transsexual character--a real first for TV.
The first word I thought about after watching this was "ugh."
If he had a doggy whistle with him all along, gosh, it doesn't need a super-sized brain (or the sun to power it) to use it in the first place.
Still, my first reaction to it was "stupid."
I thought it sounded interesting when I first read about it.
Anyway, a video store owner is the first to be visited by a zombie, and since the sheriff is out of town and the deputy went back to the place of some woman he went out with last night (who just happened to live in Panama City, Florida), the town is without an authority figure, so the video store guy plops the corpse in the lobby of the sheriff's office with a post-it note stuck to its forehead (for the sheriff to call him on Monday, of course).
Their first though is, sell all their shares before the public finds out.
Brassy Glenda Farrell appears all too briefly as William's first betrayed lover; this was an actress who could really light up the screen, but she's only given two scenes here.
When i first heard That 80s show i thought it was just a rip off of That 70s show, but i was totally wrong.
If you haven't seen it I recommend downloading the episodes from some peer to peer network, you will love it if you watch more than the first 15 minutes of the first episode.
i hope they will also bring in more characters and add some other locations if you haven't seen the show they have not released a DVD but they have the episodes floating around on the internet you can find some on you tube in parts and in torrents but some are in poor quality i recommend that you watch the first 4 episodes and to get others to watch it maybe if fox notices the increase in fans they will do a reboot
His girlfriend (Mala Powers) at first feels there is no place for her in his life because of his mother.
The way to play a priest is the way Spencer Tracy did - as a man first.
When Edge of Doom was first released, audiences turned away from it with the coldest of shoulders.
I was a bit anxious at first when I heard about this remake.
I'm kinda a romantic and like the fantasy chick flicks, but this one is probably one of my favorites because the relationships and situations are what love is really about and how it is to want to make that good first impression on your future in-laws.
Bernie Mac plays a great dad and reacts like a real father would when meeting his daughter's boyfriend for the first time.
In particular, Orthodox Jews will be able to understand the psychological enormity of the taboos that Mendy breaks - starting with cutting his peyos (sidelocks), then tasting his first cheeseburger, and having sex with a non-Jew.
The fake-Eastern European movies that Joseph GrÃ¼nberg alias "Jo Green" had made with his troop that he more or less evacuated form Galizia, Wolhynia, Bessarabia and Podolia approximately five minutes before the first NS-pogroms started in the 30ies, are good but not authentic.
It's also the first of JCE Productions' international iterations, marking the beginnings of Jackie Chan's endeavors as world-hugging producer on the global stage through is own outfit.
Bolivia (2001) This is the first feature-length film from director Israel Adrian Caetano.
Oso, the unemployed taxi driver is the first one to show his own prejudice against Freddy, who has not been disrespectful to him.
After his first day in the restaurant, we follow Freddy as he roams the streets of the neighborhood next to the place he works.
It's great to see all the old Doctors, for example (even if the first Doctor was dead and is played here by a lookalike and the fourth Doctor rather childishly didn't want to be in the show, so is featured via old, unused TV footage), but it's still a bit cheesy to have simply SO MUCH Doctor Who crammed into one show.
The first is simply as a drama film like any other, a well-set piece for the epoch it unfolds in; certainly the clothing and set accessories are all in their right place for the 70's/80's.
Fred Durst from some music group called 'Limp Bizkit' directed this & it is his first effort.
For a first timer he did a first class job.
Jesse Eisenburg is Charlie & he is just first rate.
Eva Amurri is also first rate as a love interest.the entire cast are all first rate.
it was very good first choice for Fred Durst.
I am very much impressed by his first attempt.
I understand this is Fred Durst's first film.
It's a great first film and is also very smoothly and seamlessly edited.
The plot is rich...even the music was first class.
I thought the show was stupid at first but as I started to watch more of it and enjoy the movies that they aired I became hooked on it.
I then saw for the first time a beautiful blonde Rhonda Shear hosting on Friday nights.
I believe this was the first movie I had seen.
(I suspect this 1950 production was one of the first to integrate TV into the storyline.)
He'd like to whack 'em all, but first he has to meet with his head-doctor (Levene) who's obviously done a pretty rotten job so far.
The film is also notable as it was one of the first movies put out by MGM under new management which turned the company away from solely making big budget events.
At first the movie seemed to be something as rare as a genuine catholic drama, but the various themes were not developed in a religious fashion.
In her first Emmanuelle film (a French erotic film), she acts the role of her life, becoming famous immediately in France, and soon thereafter in the world.
The countless sequels to this first Emmanuelle film certainly don't measure up to the artistic standard - or even to the erotic standard - of this one.
I first saw this film back in 1976, and only remembered that it was fiercely arousing to a young man at the time.
At first viewing the film is admittedly just an erotic flick, with thin connections between the erotic scenes.
Plenty of reasons to put bums in seats then to enjoy what was presumably their very first dirty movieÂ Exquisite 20-year old Dutch model turned actress Sylvia Kristel, who had enjoyed minor success in her native country, landed the title role and would forever be associated with the character.
More bemused than shocked, Emmanuelle turns to precocious nymphet Marie-Ange (a youthfully glowing Christine Boisson, later to become a highly respected French actress) to whom she confides her first betrayal of her husband with a pair of handsome strangers on the flight over, a perfectly paced sequence of suspenseful anticipation which probably instigated the whole "Mile High Club" idea.
I was just out of my teens and just experiencing 'the world' when I first saw this original film Emmanuelle.
Yeah, my mouth hung open in shock during my first watch of this.
I NEVER saw or heard of nice women doing ANYTHING like this even though it was 10 years old when I saw it for the first time.
Emmanuelle was the first adult film I ever viewed and it delighted me.
Even the music is first class and still does the rounds on its own.
This was the first in a series of erotic films which were made possible by the increasingly liberal moral climate of the seventies and eighties and which enjoyed a success de scandale.
Although this was one of the first productions of the mainstream cinema to deal with erotic subject-matter frankly, it is not particularly explicit.
This sort of cod-philosophy became one of the first casualties of the AIDS epidemic.
The movie did not portray most of the characters in a believably authentic manner, although the Hackman character for the first 90% of the picture was fascinating.
Rahul finds it to be love at first sight but his boss gets there first.
The film ends up by, at first, seemingly in tragedy; but there is a sudden about face with a hopeful (if not exactly totally happy) ending.
Move over, Harrison Ford; your namesake John got here first.
It must have pained him to play this role and, with his reputation, made his character in here - watching this film for the first time in the 1990s - have no credibility.
When Herbert J. Yates of Republic Pictures made a deal with John Ford to produce The Quiet Man he first made Ford agree to do one of his cavalry epics with John Wayne because he wanted a surefire moneymaker before taking a chance on The Quiet Man.
This was the first of three films Pedro Armendariz did with John Ford in an effort to broaden his appeal beyond Mexican cinema.
The first one is to compare and contrast this film with the novel from which it is loosely inspired, "The Power and the Glory" by Graham Greene.
Her acting abilities surprised me because at first glance she seemed like she was just going to be "eye candy".
At first I was a bit disappointed, but then I said "why not?"
This is the first Anderson film I've seen that I've been absolutely satisfied with.
Honestly at first I had serious doubts about this movie.
I wanted to leave after the first 5 minutes as it was, and after that it was like sitting through one of those bad documentaries at school for the other 2 hours.
When I first saw Victoria Hamilton in the trailers, I thought, 'she's not a good likeness', but having seen the first episode, I can only praise the wonderful acting and superb script.
No-one ever expected it to win any golden trophies in the first place.
The first 2 days are competition/elimination rounds reminiscent of Mario Kart as if it was designed by some rogue member of GTA on a disgruntled day but who loved the hidden short cuts and power-ups.
The folks who established that tradition were Victoria & Albert, first cousins in the Saxe-Coburg family and husband and wife.
I first have to warn a few people who are thinking about seeing this movie.
I read a lot of positive press about this Canadian-shot film, first when it was being made (in Vancouver) and soon after its release.
I saw him on the cover, and instead of checking IMDB first, I took a chance.
this movie isn't my cup of tea.i couldn't watch it all,since i lost interest,but form what i saw,it just wasn't good.i just found it boring,with pretty bad acting,and a plot that is all over the place.it's a Russian made movie,the second i have seen now.the first one being Nightwatch.i didn't like that movie either.it also has a plot that doesn't make a lot of sense,at least in my opinion.anyway,Mirror Wars starts off promising enough,with some scenes of jet fighters doing maneuvers,which look pretty impressive.after that though,it's not so good.i wouldn't recommend it myself,but if you liked Nghtwatch,you might like this movie.for me,Mirror Wars is a 3/10
There must be 10+ setups for each scene, where the lighting is perfect, as if it was a student filmmaker's first 35mm film.
Jane Campion's direction could teach many that it's not the coverage, and multiple set-ups, but the performances, pacing and story that goes first.
His reaction upon seeing his mother for the first time, was so heart wrenching.
At first glance, this episode is wonderful.
In the first scenes of this movie you can tell that Cher needs more than a day off, she needs a man.
The first scene with The Justice giving a "clerk-typist" an envelope with "hope it's sufficient - use it well" should tell you right now there's some hanky-panky going-on.
Cher easily convinces us of her serious attorney's commitment to helping society's outcasts;Liam Neeson in his first film role as the silent hulking Viet-vet street person accused of murder; Dennis Quaid at his cocky best as a razor-sharp lobbyist/juror, and John Mahoney and Philip Bosco.
The screenplay ,directing and editing are all first rate.And if you pay attention, you can learn a lot about the inner workings of our government's congressional/lobbyist bedfellows and the scary fallibility of our justice system and its judges and lawyers.
The aspect that makes this movie a gem is the fine acting: Cher as the overworked and underpaid public defender, Liam Neeson as the deaf/mute defendant in one of his first major roles, Dennis Quaid as a sexy lobbyist (often messing around with congresswomen to get votes for his industry) turned juror turned amateur sleuth, and John Mahoney as the stoic judge at the trial.
hi,  This was my first experience of an Afghani Film, and even though my family is not too keen about the movies i watch, they all gathered and watched this, at various points expressing shock and emotion at what they saw.
For a first film, this shows a great deal of visual confidence.
The winner of Best Foreign Language Film at the Golden Globes last night is the first feature-length film from Afghanistan.
He incredibly elicits professional performances from amateurs, building tension and intensity from the first opening scenes of the Taliban spraying crowds of women clad in shapeless blue Burkas.
Osama is the first movie made after the fall of the Taliban last year.
One of the first scenes you see in the film is that of a rally of women all asking for jobs so that they could feed their families.
This film has gained a lot of notoriety for being the first movie made in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban.
When this movie first came out, the reviews were generally favorable but the subject matter was utterly depressing.
The atrocities of the Taliban and other extremist Islamic fundamentalists must be revealed to the resistant and skeptical west and "Osama", the first film to come out of Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban, does just that.
This is the first film made in Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban.
For a debut feature, w-d Siddiq Barmak delivered a quietly poignant film - it may not be evident at first impression right after seeing the film with the sadness and injustice it burdensomely carries.
This is the first film made in Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban.
This was the first movie made in post taliban regime in afghanistan.
On a slightly different note, I was quite surprised to read the feature review on the first page of the movie info, Eyal Philippsborn write "was it the setting or did the Taliban also banned the building of houses with roofs?"
For two reasons: first of all, in the limited time-span of a movie, one cannot possible hope to see all aspects of life.
This is the first film I have seen by Angelopoulos, and his reputation having preceded him, I expected a lot better, but can honestly say that this is one of the worst films I've ever seen, and I won't go out of my way to watch any of the director's other work in the future.
Fate and History are not presented as flesh and blood characters in this first part of Theodoros Angelopoulos' "Trilogy: The Weeping Meadow," but the presence of each is so tangible that they could be exactly that.
The central characters, Alexis and Eleni first meet as children driven together by the destruction of the town of Odessa, Greece, during World War I.
She becomes a kind of "Everywoman" of the first half of the twentieth century, an era when countries worldwide repeatedly called men to war while women became casualties of the grief, poverty, and physical destruction left behind.
That this first part of Theo Angelopoulos' Trilogy is an indisputable masterpiece is a fact that speaks for itself.
The period that the first part of the Trilogy covers is 1919 -1949.
It is the first one of trilogy.
This film has a lot in common with the director's first big success, The Traveling Players.
The film then proceeds very elegantly for about the first third of its running time.
There is a superb scene at jusr about the end of the first third, where Eleni,the film's principal character, wants to leave and walks down to the water.
"The Weeping Meadow" is the first film of "The Trilogy," Angelopoulos' latest and most ambitious project.
The colors, the characters and their costumes, the usual decors of the familial tales are all represented in tableaux and plans-sequences of an Angelopoulos who has totally reverted to the aesthetics of his first films.
It may be unfair to judge this film based on only watching the first 3/4 of it, but we could only take so much punishment as an audience.
Basic deal: If you want to catch the essence of what this film could have been, secretly videotape a close-knit group of first year college grad students toegether that are studying the humanities and you'll have something more interesting than this film.
Such stilted performances could only come from one of two places: the actors' first time in front of a camera, or incredibly bad direction.
At least the folks responsible for Metropolitan's lighting and art direction were kind to his first effort.
I think this is the first film I have seen where they didn't purposely cast a homo.
However, this was Stillman's first film, so I'd be interested in checking out his other 2 films to see where he went from here.
This is a movie that amused me the first time around, delighted me on further viewings, and continues to grow in my esteem.
Another familiar face from Stillman's movies is Taylor Nichols, who plays Charlie Black, who when we first see him is stumbling through an explanation of why he believes in God and you do, too, even if you don't know it, and later on offers his own alternative definition of the preppie elite as the Urban Haute Bourgeoisie, i.e.
His first film does exactly that, pulling off the twin feat of having cinematic fun and giving a preppie an even break.
it was released in VHS in other countries including England and Germany, but i believe this future release(April 2005), will be the first time it will be readily available in the U.S..
Stillman's first in his trilogy, this sets the standard for the offbeat banter and dialogue of the two films that followed, "Barcelona," and "The Last Days of Disco."
METROPOLITAN has really aged well - I first saw this when it was released, and watching again a few days ago, it really stands up as something unique.
At my first viewing, I didn't really want to like these characters, who all seem from another world - rich, young and good looking, carrying on through elaborate, banal, pseudo-intellectual conversations with a deadly confidence about their place in the world.
The cast is OK (Roy Dupuis was almost a star here in the early 90s, the VFX impressive (for the most of them), and - as some viewers wrote earlier - the first part very promising.
This was Whit Stillman's first of three similarly themed films; the second, "Barcelona," is subpar, but "The Last Days of Disco" closes the trilogy with a delicious return to form.
This is the first of a trilogy, all of which take a slice of life of young people coming of age, but in the cusp of a dying culture, with a new order and new responsibilities baring down on them.
He likes her as well, but for her it's "love at first sight".
This is Franklin Pangborn's first movie and he plays a very effeminate wimp who also happens to play the rugged hero in the company.
I have just finished watching this movie for the first time on TCM.
Perhaps due to her stage training, her acting is so nuanced and subtle you might think that she was an actress from the last half of the 20th century instead of the first half.
It fittingly features Beatrice Lillie, renowned as a Broadway performer, in her first film role, alongside a supporting cast of colorful, but certainly less than marquee-status players.
OF COURSE most viewers will track this one down for the first screen appearance of stage comedienne nonpareil, Bea Lillie, and Lady Peel gives an absolutely beautiful performance (pretty enough to win an English Lord, as the actress did in real life, yet able to walk a perfect comedic tight rope between insouciant self-confidence and nagging insecurity), but there is even more to recommend this charming backstage comedy than the star performance.
Set (and beautifully observed) deep into the tour of one of those third tier "acting" companies (heavy on the melodramatic programming and light on competent management) that lived on "the road" and which helped bring about first the rise of powerful central booking agencies and ultimately the formation of Actors' Equity, the film seems to say these are a memory of the past even in 1926 .
And isn't a montage usually place toward the end... not in the first 20 min?
At first Micheal thinks that it was just a hallucination but when he hears about Debbie's death & that of another one of his friends at the sÃ©ance Peter (Mario Ivan Martinez) on the news he becomes convinced that his vision was real.
After many years, I caught this movie on Mexican cable and I'm glad that I liked it better than the first time I watched it.
I first saw this movie back in the '60's on TBS.
This was my first introduction to the art and science of codes, ciphers, and such.
Also, in the opening scene, Elsie's mother is played by Nance O'Neil, who had played Mercedes in the first full length version of Count of Monte Cristo 1913 (and was a close friend of Lizzie Borden...) Interesting outdoor scenes of Spain, which probably are not authentic.
However, they did marry and they did travel with Buffalo Bill, though they first traveled with a different and less famous show.
She was the first 'Alice Kramden' in the Honeymooner's segments of "The Jackie Gleason Show".
The fatal script shortcomings of "Our Mutual Friend" appeared to me even more striking by contrast against another recent BBC release Â "Under The Greenwood Tree" (2005) Â which I had just viewed for the first time a short while previously.
Although I enjoyed the first few installments, slowly but surely a slight feeling of discomfort came over me.
All in all, a bare 8- out 10 (for what is possible in the genre see the first rate mini _Wives and Daughters_ (1999) directed by Nicholas Renton.
The movie is in two parts, the first being about a quest for paradise and the second one being about the price of paradise.
And while the first one is good, it is the second one which makes this movie worth seeing.
If you disliked it the first time, you might give it another try.
Although, this isnt the first crazy trend he's tried to start, he really did confuse me in the Beach, I liked him in Titanic better.
***Spoiler follows*** watching Leo spear a dozen fish on his first try followed by a macho, "I provide!"
At first they are welcomed into the group and spend their days leading a seemingly idyllic lifestyle, consisting of a small amount of time spent in fishing and large amounts of time spent in playing volleyball or beach cricket, lazing about smoking pot, or (for some obscure reason) translating various English phrases into Serbo-Croat.
I watched the movie first and then read the book.
When I first learned that it was indeed a Danny Boyle film I was a bit disappointed that it didn't have any of his "original" cast members... the people that he always works with.
The first time I saw this film, I completely despised it.
He asks two strangers, FranÃ§oise (Virginie Ledoyen who was really great in her first big American Film and good looking too by the way) and Etienne (Guillaume Canet) to come and join them.
When I first saw The Beach, back in 2000, I thought it was OK, not as bad as most people said it was.
For much of the first half, the audience is given the idea that a deeper plot might bubble up, but it never comes.
I liked this series when it first aired on TV.
The first three seasons weren't badly written.
Although a bit more contrived than season one, the second season of "24" follows the same formula as the first season with 24 virtual hours (16 viewer hours) jam packed with twisty-turny crisscrossing subplots, suspense, action, drama, and, of course, those countless looks askance.
If you haven't seen this incredibly popular Emmy winning series, rent the first DVD in the first season first and see if you don't suddenly find yourself a "24" junkie lusting for more.
I've seen the first four seasons and I must say it's one of the finest TV series I've ever seen.
I was watching the show right before it (I want to say it was "Family Guy" but I really don't remember), and the previews for season 5 hyped up the first 10 minutes of this new season.
If you want to try the show, my advice is to rent the first disc of season 4.
It is also the best indicator of what "24" is like, and if the first two hours do not get you hooked on the show, then nothing will.
You might have to force yourself through the first couple of hours, but you will be greatly rewarded with the drama that follows throughout season 1, and every other season.
During this summer, we watched each of the first four seasons together.
She and I watched season 4 together, and we watched the first 12 hours of that season in one night.
Each season is about different terrorist threats that face the United States (bar the first season) and the CTU's efforts to thwart them, all unfolding in real-time, as each hour-long episode of the show represents.
I only started watching 24 recently, treating myself to the first season.
When 24 first premiered, I was quite skeptical that it would last an entire season, let alone 6.
I saw the first few episodes and didn't think much of it.
I bought the first season DVD over the summer and watched it all.
The first half of the season was solid, but then the second half got predictable.
It's only recently that I started watching "24" when a German TV station announced a rerun of the first season.
I only saw bits and pieces of the first season and I liked what I saw but did not stay with the show for various reasons.
While watching "24" for the past two weeks, I kept on thinking about the first time "The Fugitive" appeared on television in 1963 and how that show was called innovative.
Now I've watched all of the first two seasons, half of the third and the first four of the sixth, I figure I should write a short comment.
Throughout its four seasons, 24 provides a cliff hanger at the end of most episodes to keep you attached and has provided some of the most unpredictable twists that I have ever seen, including the ultimate shocker at the end of the first season (which I won't go into because somebody may read this before watching the first season).
However, a friend lent me the first season box set last week, and I started watching....up to the "13th hour", so I have tried my best to give it a chance, when I actually exclaimed, "enough"!
The only purpose Kim had in the first season was to be kidnapped and serve as the bad guy's bargaining chip against Jack.
These guys couldn't catch a drunk first grader if he came up and bit them in the ass.
I bought it on the big DVD pack with the complete first season, because it isn't available in German television right now.
This is the first time I decided to write a review.
he was the first director to make the camera move like a ghost, and act like a ghost.
Especially since, according to another commentator, this was actor-director Welles' first venture into colour, he has used the unaccustomed medium masterfully both in his interiors and exteriors, and with the addition of the strident and insistent cicadas and refreshing dawn chorus has rendered the subtropical oriental night and its golden dawn beautifully realistic.
I saw this film for the first time yesterday on the local Spanish channel which runs a series of classics in the original language, so that I saw it in French.
He uses color very well here, too, as it's his first time using shades of brown and gray for the Macao town parts, little flourishes of color that become darkened when around Clay, and the characters of Virginie (Moreau) and the Sailor (Norman Eshley) who compared to Clay are vibrant in appearance.
There is also, in Welles' first non-black-and-white film, a gorgeous use of deep colours.
The first was through channel flipping and then projecting multiple things on screen and not being able to focus on just one thing.
I thought when I first saw it that it would be perhaps a satire of the media and how it shows violence but it's not.
When it first came it brought up a lot of debate.
Some say it is just violent, but I clearly see a anti-violent message in there along with criticism of the media making heroes without thinking about the consequences first.
The first 45 minutes of the film shows us how Mickey and Mallory meet, and shows us their murderous rampage across the country.
Like Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange, the first act of the film is the most shocking part.
Most people who have turned off either film has done it by the end of the first act.
The two films share many other things in common; at the end of the first act our antagonistic protagonists are caught and sent to prison, they both have "graphic violence" and are hated by politicians and mother's groups, and both have much to say about our society and the mindset of it's outcasts.
My point is, rather, that this is a film that dealt with such an important, realistic issue that it should never have been controversial in the first place.
Firstly, it is my opinion that audiences who need everything to be carefully spelled out for them in a film in order to get the message and morals right are probably devoid of morals in the first place (no offense, Crash (2004)).
When I first saw Natural Born Killers, I thought there was something wrong with the movie because of the editing.
After viewing this film many, many times since I first saw it I came to the conclusion that this film basically put on screen my feelings as to why I disliked and still continue to dislike the 90's/Post-Millenium American Pseudo-Culture.
At first I did not understand it (the metaphors and such) but having viewed it countless times over the past few years I have developed an understanding of this truly remarkable film.
So I watched it again, just in case it was merely a case of me having a bad day the first time I watched it, or perhaps the film all came together after I had quit watching it.
I have to admit the first installment THE DOLL'S HOUSE started off a bit slow but the other stories moved smoothly and made up for it.
I actually know some of the folks in one of the vignettes and while they did a great job with what they were given I must say the first segment was truly - not good.
The overall movie was put together very well, and it actually made me visit New York mind you this was my first time visiting.
Another thing I did was went to the spot where the movie first comes on from the blimp look.

It's also the first time Rosie Perez has ever looked genuinely sexy to me.
Then you're exposed to one of the most beautiful scenes and sounds in the movie (which was so initially shocking to me the first time I saw this that it brought tears to my eyes), followed immediately by something that attempts to convey something only the educated will understand.
Although not all the stories are equally developed or intriguing, the whole production is characterized by first rate ensemble acting and direction.
In the first scene of the film, the bespectacled hero, a pallid imitation of Miller, picks up a girl in a cafÃ© and, after sex, gives her all his money, can't get any more credit at the restaurants, and is forced to raid his own garbage pail for leftover nuggets.
Here are some of the perplexing things for me:  --Joey complains that Nys could have left him a few francs after he first met her and gave her his money, but Joey actually INSISTED she take all of it to begin with.
The first time I heard of this movie was in College.
Hailes Sankofa is the first and best movie about slavery ever made.
-The first cowboys were Black, odd how that's completely forgotten.
the movie looked like it was shot on the first take and it seemed like much of the audio of the movie was re-done in the studio with the editor forgetting to put back subtle audio effects like background sound effects for the environments etc.
In my opinion the story bares some resemblance to that of Moby Dick, in that the main character is the Capitan of a ship and is bent on finding a sea creature for, at first, revenge... but draw your own comparisons.
I recommend seeing it even if your friends say that its bad, i only rented it in the first place because it was all they had at Video Connection one lonely Friday night and i needed something to watch, and all of my friends, none of whom know what their talking about, trashed it never the less i found it beautiful, hilarious, and over-all an absolutely stunning work of art by Mr. Wes Anderson... also, if you saw it and liked it, you should check out the Royal Tenenbaums, also directed by Anderson, it is almost as good as the Life Aquatic.
The story, an romantic comedy about a black college student whose love life is rocked by the antics of her famous musical family stars the very funny Reynaldo Rey and Shani Bayete (The fine sister from Nothing to Lose) I first heard about the film in April issue of Suede Magazine, as one of their video picks of the month.
The first half you expect for a lot of possibilities the subject could be developed, but it never does.
When I first watched this film in 2005, I loved it, although at the time I was perhaps ready to agree that the second half of the film stumbles in a lot.
Excellent Candela PeÃ±a, very hard work to create the character, you can fall in love with her in the first scene.
I think everyone is being a tad harsh on this film, there is no way they could have kept the pace of the first half of the film up it would have been exhausting.Seeing this film in a packed cinema @ cornerhouse certainly helped, seen Candela Pena in two films recently she shines in both.As for the second half of the film & the transition from comedy to drama the laughs didn't dry up they just were a bit more subtle i thought he bergman stuff especially carrying the sithe on the rollercoaster & playing chess on the pedolo was hilarious.
We first see Alfredo trying to sell books door to door without much success.
The first part is extremely funny.
Oh, I love that movie, now I know why I felt so sentimental when I watched that movie first time - it reminds me my childhood so so much.
This game is a bit old - it first appeared in 1990.
Humour has always been the main thing with Monkey Island and the classic laughs of the first game still work well.
In 1990, Ron Gilbert released the first and best of the Monkey Island series, "The Secret of Monkey Island" Being a fan of Ron Gilbert/Lucasfilm Games (Maniac Mansion for example) I found this game extremely fun.
The fight is not over for everyone, and sometimes it takes herculean efforts to get what should be everyone's rights in the first place.
I'm not normally into made-for-TV movies, but while I was visiting a friend tonight "Iron Jawed Angels" came on the television and within the first 10 minutes I was hooked.
Along for the ride is Ned (Wilson), someone who may or may not be Steve's son; Jane (Blanchett), an up-and-coming journalist doing a story on Zissou; Klaus (Dafoe), the eccentric German first mate; a Portugese, David Bowie-covering weapons expert; a no-nonsense tech expert; a usually semi-nude female crew-member; a band of unpaid interns; and several other quirky personalities.
I would also advise rewinding it, and viewing it again, as my second time through was just as delightful and revealing as the first.
I'm ashamed to say that the first time I rented it I popped it out of the player after only a couple of minutes.
The first time I saw it, I only saw the last 30 minutes and was completely engaged.
The first while was a little slow, but sets the stage for the climax.
I will be honest, when I first saw the previews to this film I was worried that Anderson may have gone the way of so many other directors who have developed their name in Hollywood.
One of my favorite lines and scenes in this film that I have raved to everyone as the epitome of an Anderson film was when Zissou first takes Ned to the island and Eleanor tells Steve that one of his cats died.
A tabby I thinkÂ" which isn't funny at first, but then you realize that all he has on the island are Siamese cats, which only make me laugh harder in my seat.
title "Puzzle" fits the film just as well, as this is indeed a highly compelling and intelligent puzzle, which is capable of stunning the viewer from the first minute.
This is only the first step into his mysterious past, however...
This fine Giallo tells an unusual story in an unusual way, and even though not much happens in the first half of the film, director Tessari manages to grip the viewer's attention from the beginning through stylish directing and really thrilling and creepy moments.
He finds out about his wife and travels to Italy in order to meet up with her; although she has chiselled out a new life for herself which involves a male friend named Reinhardt, and a young kid with a crush on her...  Director Duccio Tessari uses the first half of the film to get the plot basics in place, and as a consequence it's not always exciting.
While the plot does take a while to get going, once it does the film becomes a real thrill ride, and this both offsets the sombre tone of the first half and is hugely entertaining.
Once I had raced Sonic through that synonymous ochre and brown chequered landscape for the first time, I was hooked.
The first thing that struck me, as I believe would have been the same for anyone else playing the game for the first time was the astounding quality of the graphics.
The first level, clearly inspired by San Francisco looks beautiful, running at 60 fps, not a hint of slowdown and speeding along faster than Sonics 2-D games, which I feel is some achievement in 3-D.
The inspired design of the first level has been given the trademark sonic flavour with everything synonymous with the character- loops, ramps, speed boosts, vertigo inducing drops etc.
Even in the first game on the Megadrive, Sonic Team (the developers) would strive to create an 'alive' gameworld, with sparkles in the water, moving clouds and tiny multi-coloured flashing lights in the floor.
The climatic Sleeze Sister concert and the inevitable parting of Nikki and Pammy is true for all first loves when people realize that they have to let go of someone because they are growing apart.
I first saw this movie on late night television in the fall of 1986 on an independent channel which had a policy of showing a movie after midnight would guarantee that nothing would be censored such as adult language or nudity.
I saw this film years ago, when it first came out at the cinema.
Even after the first 10 minutes I found myself laughing at the apparently serious film.
As their romance begins, Pammy's first feelings for Nicky are expressed in a poem she writes in her journal (which Nicky steals): "your ribs are my ladder Nicky, I'm so amazed, I'm so amazed."
The original script had several scenes and plot elements that developed the sexual tension between Nicky and Pammy, including a scene of their first meeting in the hospital, in which they have to undress in front of each other; two scenes where they take off their shirts and play together in their underwear in the river (the clip of which remains in the film's trailer); a wrestling scene; a scene of the first night that they sleep (sleep, not f***) together and a scene of Pammy dancing topless at the Cleo Club.
At first, Pammy seems alarmed by Nikki, and her wacky habits (she casually eats flower petals, while Pammy looks on in bewilderment).
It's obvious watching this movie the first time that something is missing.
(Then again, many didn't realize the gay-themes that were so blatant in "A Nightmare On Elm Street 2" when it was first released five years later.)
I formed my first band the very next morning...
The first time I saw this movie, I saw the surface stuff; "No Sense Makes Sense" and "they" think that bad girls are crazy.
You first realize how strong and together Nikki has made Pammy by the end of my favorite montage sequence.
Moyle artfully connects us to Pammy for the first time by allowing us to see Nikki from her POV.
The hospital exit scene only works credibility-wise because the first scene set us up for it.
The film starts off well enough and I really liked the first half.
You'll find the first one simply brilliant--and probably better than anything Fred Astaire ever did.
That was my reaction when I first watched the gorgeous Sheeri Rappaport in this B-Witch movie.
You'll be hooked after the first 15 minutes.
The creativity and uniqueness is not apparent at first, but brings belated fascination.
Watch "Day-Time Wife" first (both can be found on DVD together on a 10-movie set of Ty's.)
So yes you can say I was very presently surprised, I remember first hearing about this film and the quality reviews it had been getting and I was a bit reluctant when hearing just who was included in the cast.
A seriously understated Christian Slater stars as Bob Maconel, a frustrated office worker whose first words in the picture have him counting the amount of bullets in his gun and who his intended targets are going to be.
Similarities seem to end fairly early in the picture after Bob first becomes a hero and a media darling.
Slater was pretty good in this film; his performance here worked from his first seconds on screen, his character of office drone Bob Maconel combining elements of the main characters from the films I mentioned earlier and hitting all the right emotive notes.
If nothing past the first fifteen minutes of a film is 'real', and the main character dies at the end of a film with the realization that the things you just saw were all some literature professor's self-referential wet dream of metaphor and allegory, then what is this film worth?
We are first introduced to Bob (Slater), a man on the verge (or possibly in the thrall of) of a total breakdown.
Fortunately for him, another man in his position takes aim first, and Slater takes him down with the bullets he had originally meant for his coworkers.
At first glance this may seem like no more than just another passable western, but it's got some meat on its bones.
The relation between that seems at first odd, but later kind of charming.
His ambition is to portray, portray philosophical aspects of life and he uses first a layer of abstraction, a net of relations that correspond to the philosophical aspects in question and then a colouring and flavouring of the pieces in this net.
The likability of the outcome depends mostly on the last step, whereas the first step is the foundation of any real artistic claim.
It is 3 hours long, and some parts may seam overly long at first, but the second time you watch it it all seams perfect.
This film is only let down by one minor complaint about the way it is filmed, with a Digial camera, though the shots are beautifully clear and so sharp they suck you in, there is moments of shaking and easy moving camera that at first I disliked, but it grows on you.
This was my first Lynch film, and as such I had no expectations whatsoever.
Director David Lynch refuses to give clear explanations on his movies(with the exceptions of The Elephant Man and The Straight Story)and he prefers the spectator to making the homework of taking out conclusions.I like a lot the films he does but I do not try to find in them a clear explanation.I just enjoy the extraordinary talent Lynch has of creating emotions and producing feelings without a too coherent story.He uses all the instruments to give us something unique which we may not understand it immediately but something which we will never forget.Inland Empire is a very interesting experiment and we can see the same surrealistic style he used on most of his movies.After Eraserhead,his brilliant first film,Lynch continued with more normal films,like The Elephant Man or Dune.But,with Blue Velvet,he backed to show the oneiric feeling he had shown in Eraserhead (although on a lesser degree).With Inland Empire,I had the perfect sensation I was in a dream(or,best said,on a nightmare).But this film is not for everyone:its running time is of 3 hours.Lynch plays with our perception in the time and the reality to create a very interesting experience but which will not satisfy to the people who are looking for a clear story.Lynch makes us taking out conclusions all the time.The film is made with a digital video and that thing helps because it creates more mystery.Laura Dern brings an amazing performance.She always acted well but I never thought she had so much talent.I do not know if I can recommend Inland Empire to everyone:I liked it pretty much and I think it's a very interesting experiment.But I understand some people will not like it.Inland Empire is very interesting and it makes us taking out conclusions.And I always appreciate that.
At first, Lynch's decision to shoot on cheap digital video seems to prove distracting, as if the comparative nastiness of the image quality will detract from our ability to invest in the story.
If so this might be the first.
And, for the first time, accomplishes the same for "Place" as well.
She'll be able to catch a glimpse of herself as the stupid clown she really is, and go backwards into room #47, her blind spot (the second half of an AK47, the first half of which is echoed backwards in the letters written on her fist).
It's like someone's excised the first few layers of her face with a scalpel and left the audience to soak in this teeming deformed mass of expression, tic and utter abandon.
I would say that in the past, David Lynch's directing and visual style has come first, followed always by a solid score, and memorable songs.
However, in this movie, the first thing I noticed was that we would be introduced to a pretty bland scene where not much happens, only to be shaken by the overly loud and intrusive score.
The first scene Lynch filmed was the one with the Polish actor coming out of the house with a light-bulb in his mouth.
However, I must say the first 90 minutes of "Inland Empire" ranks as some of the most boring and pretentious film making in the short history of the art.
Inland Empire at first is reminiscent of some of Lynch's older short films because of the way it is filmed.
It is gritty, shaky, and even gives a documentary feel at first.
The interpretation offered below is not even an opinion -it is simply a facile, creative construct I use heuristically for talking about the film after my first viewing.
There is the disreputable husband of the disreputable monologist, who joins a Baltic circus.There's a woman played by Julia Ormond, who's first seen in a sleazy backyard with a screwdriver in her stomach, and later reappears as Billy's wife.
he exclaims) for the first rehearsal he risks losing the job but is saved by nerdy writer Benjy Stone (Mark Linn-Baker), who must act as his chaperone for the rest of the week in NYC.
Directed by Richard Benjamin,My Favorite Year is a film that I saw for the first time a few months ago and loved instantly.
This was Richard Benjamin's first and probably finest film as a director.
The first time I saw this movie I laughed from beginning to end.
From the first shot of him, waking up embracing what he thinks is an unremembered lover from the drunken night before, and staring in bewilderment and near terror as he realizes that it's not a girl at all but a furry THING (a teddy bear), to the last shot of him as he accepts an ovation from the studio audience in probably the only truly serene joy he's had in decades, he is utterly perfect and utterly compelling.
It was quite a coincidence that today April 3, 2005, I first saw this great piece of comedy "My favorite Year" as so happens to be the birthday of Anne DeSalvo who played Alice Miller.
I Had seen the great Rupert on a religious channel that has been showing all the great Christmas movies like scrooge,and the bishops wife.and i loved it.its somewhat a Christmas movie about a family led by the great Jimmy Durante.and a squirrel named Rupert that shares the same household.the great Rupert also stars the dazzling and beautiful; Terry Moore(mighty Joe young)who i think looks great in this movie,playing jimmy Durante's daughter.if you like sentimental comedies,you will love the great Rupert.i totally recommend it.if you spot it on DVD buy it.i hate myself for passing it up as a dollar movie a while back,but i see it again I'm grabbing it.although I'm not sure its a public domain movie,its well worth repeated viewings,I'm not giving away the plot.no spoilers here.all i can say is watch it,you will love it.and its the first movie produced by the late great George Pal.10 out of 10.
I spent first 20 minutes itching to turn it off since the animation style didn't seem all that pleasant, but then things just kept happening and before I knew it I was really immersed in it.
At first I thought the title was bad, since it didn't say anything about the film, but in the end I realized it does.
The first thing about the movie to note is the animation.
Nihaal Singh on reaching New York agrees to identify Romeo but on one condition - he will first bring Romeo to his hometown in Punjab to clear his name, bring back his lost glory, redeem his family Honor, and then hand him over to the American authorities.
Sunny Deol tries comedy for the first time ever in Jo Bole So Nihaal, and he is successful at this, as he gives witty remarks and street talks the FBI (which he calls 'Fully Bewakoof Insan')!
I believe this the first movie in which the audience actually audibly groaned at the jokes that it tried to 'imply'.
I'm not saying this game is flawless.There are a few flaws.The graphics are very gorgeous,but looks too much like "Final Fantasy VI" or "Romancing Saga 3".And the game can be hard at first for beginners of these type of games.But other than that,the game is beautifully crafted.I wished Square would have just gone ahead and released it,if it weren't for the censors.
It was my first Japanese import game I've played.
I love 2Pac as rapper and this was his first movie I've seen and I have to say that the film did fulfill exactly what I thought it would be, when talking about it's quality.
The first is the story told by the murderer, I believed it.
He reminded me of Ivor Novello in Hitchcock's first masterpiece The Lodger and Norman Bates in Psycho.
From 1949-1950, the Master of Suspense took a temporary break from Hollywood film-making and produced two UK productions, the first being 'Under Capricorn (1949),' a fascinating but relatively unengaging melodrama with superb camera-work.
For the first time, Hitchcock {and cinematographer Wilkie Cooper} integrated these techniques into a more traditional film-making style, and multiple sequences play out in a single take; my favourite shot follows Cooper (Richard Todd) through Charlotte's front door, and smoothly rises with him as he ascends the staircase.
And though Dietrich's acting seems unconvincing at firstÂshe's best as a cool and implacable diva, not a distraught widowÂwhen you learn that the first scene was a lie, everything truly falls into place.
At first, I thought the acting was overdone, but 30 minutes into the movie, I didn't even notice.
Jane Wyman makes a lovely heroine for the audience to care about, and Marlene Dietrich is a riot as the stage diva, although I was a bit skeptical toward her at first.
This sort of dismissal happens because of financial failure upon first release.
We never made it through the first 20 minutes before we had to shut it off.
If I wanted to make a film taking place in Iceland I would first show off the Icelandic landscape, create interesting characters who have motives, and then show more of the viking culture itself: the weaponry and armor, the religion, the sailing, the long-ships, etc.
Since that first time, I have watched this movie at least ten times and it is STILL as great as the fist time.
My first reaction when I finished watching this movie for the first time was, "Woah, Irish ninjas versus vikings?
The intrigue be a little hard to follow a first.
Since that first time, I have watched this movie at least ten times and it is STILL as great as the fist time.
When I first saw this marvelous film in 1999 in Russia, I could not believe my own eyes - in fact, I had never seen a single Icelandic film before that, this was the first and what a great sensation!
i've seen this show first through a music video and fell in love with it right away because of the good storyline and the worked out characters that are complicated with many problems and dark pasts.
Spike Lee cinematographer Ernest Dickerson (he shot Spike's first 6 films) makes a stylish, dark debut with the 1992 teen drama "Juice".
Great actors as well, "DULLE, DULLE, DULLE" ;)  I envy all the people who haven't seen it so far, because they can experience it the first time.
When I first saw "Absolute Giganten" it instantly became my favourite.
I can never forget how I felt when I first saw Tupac as an actor; it completely blew me away.
Certainly when I first saw this upon release, having seen Lester's early b/w films, I was expecting another slightly arty avant-garde outing.
Tonight was my first ever viewing of this film by Richard Lester.
The first scene is just flat out bizarre: A dance for car accident victims being held in the lobby of a posh-looking San Francisco hotel.
Nothing is as it seems at first, and there are plenty of surprises in store.
Lester's use of flashbacks and forewards is a little confusing at first, but it's also a vital element in what makes this film so worthwhile.
Maybe someone will do a Lester retrospective (he also did the Beatles' first films)so that this masterpiece can finally find the audience it deserves.
The film is also considered important as one of the first to use a vertical wipe, in this case creating a cartoon-like effect, as Mary Jane nudges the audience as she holds a can with 'PARAFFIN' written in huge letters (a joke borrowed by Beckett over fifty years later in his 'Act Without Words').
The story, which isn't that interesting in the first place, unravels at the pace of a dead man running a marathon.
To be honest, for the first half hour I could've sworn I was watching a satirical comedy about zombie journalists.
He never played a role like this one before, and he certainly does it very well, in my opinion it would be worth his first Oscar this year.
But I suppose that's the point, and Chris says it somewhere in the first act: that when the founders of the Constitution wrote "the pursuit of happiness" into the text, they only promised the pursuit.
I'm also a Tupac fan and I can honestly say when I first saw this movie..
I was involved with one of the first test audiences almost a year ago, and came away quite impressed with the acting performances and heartfelt punch of Pursuit of Happiness.
after the first five minutes i considered throwing it into the fire and paying the fine just so nobody else would ever have to go through what i just did.
You're about ten minutes in before you hear a single line of dialogue, and the first twenty minutes or so seems to consist mainly of people running around and hiding in the bush (actually, there's a great deal of that throughout the movie).
There's a lot of stylish camera work (most of it done very simply with home-made wooden rigs and clever editing Â watch the "Behind The Scenes" featurette for a lesson in independent film-making) and a generally creepy overtone, but not a lot in the way of plot or character development for the first half hour or so.
Check out both the first and last scenes that Koteas shares with Hogan, great stuff that seems to have been forgotten due to disdain shown for this particular film.
I just want to say that i will be the first person to step up and defend Kevin Costner.
With that said i would also like to say that i love Tombstone, and bought it right after i saw it the first time.
With two movies coming out about the same true story back to back, and with the first release (Tombstone) being such a big success, comparisons are inevitable.
It is there he first makes a living skinning wilder beasts with brothers Ed (Bill Pullman) and Bat (Tom Sizemore) Masterson, then he builds a reputation as a good lawman, grows his moustache, meets partner Doc Holliday (a near show-stealing Dennis Quaid) who is slowly dying of tuberculosis, and makes sure all townspeople do not have any guns.
I just watched Combat Shock for the first time in 2008 at 28yrs old.
The first scene shows the main character having flashbacks of Vietnam.
For the first couple minutes the baby is hidden and you're supposed to assume it's a normal non-mutant baby, but then his wife holds the baby in the light and you see that their baby is in fact a rubber doll with a monster face.
The first 10 minutes (first war scenes) or so was so boring I stopped watching at the first time.
This was also the first serious Troma-film I've ever seen (maybe the only one there is, I don't know?).
There isn't much explicit violence for the first hour or so (with the exception of some Vietnam flashbacks).
This was the first "Tromatized" movie I've seen, and it sure ain't like the rest of 'em!
I remember watching this at the drive in movie, it was second on the bill and it was the first really "adult" movie I had ever seen, thus it stayed with me.
I first saw this film just after I left the Navy in '73.
The first of which focuses on a young man named Ponce de Leon Harper.
At first the weirdness kept me watching--the characters act strange and things are shown at different angles.
When the first victim is found dead, principal Roddy McDowall can only comment on what a great cheerleader she was so it's obvious pretty much from the get-go that we're in an altered state of reality here.
I first found out about this classic on You Tube by seeing the 4 and a half minute clip on there, and I was intrigued enough to get the movie.
Pretty Maids was a mega flop on first release, and it permanently damaged Vadim's career.
You'll ask yourself the whole time how a movie like this could be made in the first place!
The way the camera takes in the female form in this film shows that this guy truly enjoyed this cast of beautiful high school girls who are dropping out of school in the most unfortunate manner: they are being murdered.Â The first body is found by student Ponce.
When I first viewed this film as a teen, the director's constant zooming in on the breasts and buttocks of female high school students was a bit shocking, but had a point to it.
I mean, high school is a particularly sexualized place being that many students are entering in relationships for the first times in their lives.
Telly Savalas is the state police detective called upon to solve a series of murders of young girls at the high school, the first of which is charmingly named "Jill Fairbutt."
Nice job by Keenan Wynn is the wheezy geezer local sheriff assigned by Savalas to direct traffic after incompetently touching every bit of evidence at the first murder scene.
My wife and I saw this flick when it was first released in 1971 and found nothing outrageous about it.
The film begins with a wrangler with only the first name Ken (Maynard) fighting off ambushers in Tombstone Canyon.
Having never seen the first movie the storyline became apparent within the first 10 mins.
The plot is a bit weak in that supposedly Mike from the first movie has a birth father who is some hugely rich tycoon and he is willing to pay any amount of money to get Bridgit to recant that Mike killed her husband and raped her.
I rented The Last Seduction II from Blockbuster when it was first released back in 1998 or 1999.
Initially, I was disappointed but my disappointment quickly evaporated after I heard Severance speak her first line.
In The Last Seduction II, Bridget Gregory (Severance) flees New York City for Barcelona, with Mike's father (Mike was a character in the first film) hiring a bounty hunter (Beth Goddard) to find her.
None of the actors are present from the first one, but the storyline appears to continue from the end of the first movie.
Gone is the plot, mystery, the dark aspects of the first... a sham.
Dolph lundgren is a badaass in this and made me remember how much i love him sure he was never as big a star as most of the action hero's of the 80's but as he proves here, he's the one who's ruling the genre now cus he plays one mean mofo here, the story has Dolph's wife and kid murdered by the Russian mafia, he moves to los angelos and seven years later he is asked to go back to Russia to bring back somebody's daughter back, he refuses to do it at first until he realises it is the same gangster that killed his family seven years ago, so he goes to get his bloody revenge, the mechanik is violent and dark but its great entertainment and delivers the goods, sure the story has been done many times before but the way it is made and its style just make the mechanik an action classic, Dolph lundgren also directed it and does a brilliant job crafting one of the best action/thriller's for the past ten years.
It has the same storyline as the first two.
This movie is good, but disappointingly is nowhere near as good as the first airbud.
Not surprisingly, director Bill Bannerman, on his first turn being completely in charge (he has a lot of previous second unit experience), wasn't quite up to the task.
Unlike the first two films, a dog playing a sport is almost an afterthought here, and when we see him, it's in very quick glimpses; every once in a while, these snippets appear to be even aided by computer animation.
this was a handsomely filmed but thoroughly nasty wartime adventure thriller i first saw when it was released way back in '79 about a german scientist (james mason) being smuggled across the swiss alps by a basque guide (anthony quinn) whilst being hotly pursued by a sadistic ss nazi commandant (malcolm mcdowell in a truly hilarious performance).
I remember when I first saw it I was horrified.
The first segment with Vanessa Redgrave shows the problems gays have, because there is no way to have a legalized partnership... they are talking about it, but we still don't have the rights every married couple has... it probably was the best segment of the whole movie!
Well the first time I saw this film was more than enough for me fall in love with it...
As much as I enjoy the first two pieces, I love the last one with Ellen DeGeneres and Sharon Stone.
The "2000" part was good also but the script wasn't as good as the first two.
The first segment with Vanessa Redgrave moved me to a point where I could not look at the screen.
The first of them is actually the only one worth watching.
The other two segments just cannot compete with the first one.
The first segment was almost unbearably sad; the second had you willing the central figure to defy the attitudes of her equally lesbian friends and keep dating the woman who was expressing her individuality a different way, which was anathema to the others because it had "male" characteristics; the third portrayed a loving partnership's efforts to get one of them pregnant, and their joy when they finally managed it, extremely well.
What a waste of an outstanding actress in the first segment The first segment had so much potential but then they moved on to the next segment... Miss Tree put the bird back in and the home was empty.
Vanessa Redgrave is excellent in the first part, which thereby moves you although you never feel there is never any scope for anything other than the eventual ending; the other two tales pass without interest.
As for the rest, the first installment with Vanessa Redgrave contains more holes than a golf course; while the second with Chloe Sevingy and Michelle Williams feels too hip for its own good and sits uncomfortably with the other two parts.
The first, set in 1961, and the best of the three, features an outstanding performance by the marvellous Vanessa Redgrave as a retired school teacher who suddenly loses her lifelong companion.
The first part is moving, brilliantly acted and very, very sad.
I love the first segment of this movie.
The first segment took place in 1960's.
This segment is a big contrast to the very first one.
In the first of the three mini-movies, Vanessa Redgrave gives a stirring performance as the survivor of a lesbian couple in 1961.
The message of this first movie serves well to remind people of the tragedy that ensued when one's life long partner passed on previous to the 70's.
"If These Walls Could Talk 2" is a cinematic achievement and may very well be the first movie of the new Millennium which accurately shows where there is love and truth, gender is nothing but an afterthought.
Nick refuse first , but change his mind when he discover that the girl has been kidnapped by the "godather".
Second film as director , first masterpiece , after a very good first movie .
It packs a rhythm, inventiveness and humour almost absent form the first two films of the prequel saga.
My first complaint is, of course, there is not not a lot of action in this compared to the Star Wars movies.
The humor present in the shorts is curious and deadpan, much unlike the mugging presence of Jar Jar Binks in the first film.
Star Wars: Clone Wars chronicles the adventures of Anakin Skywalker, his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi, the beloved droids Threepio and Artoo and the rest of the characters from the first two films (fortunately for Jar Jar Binks-haters, he is nowhere to be seen) during the events of the Clone Wars: full-scale battles between the mechanical Separatist and the Army of the Republic (clone troopers).
If you (especially newcomers) are completely confused with the chronological storyline, it's best that you watch everything from the original trilogy and the first two episodes of the prequel trilogy before tackling with both the Microseries and the upcoming movie.
Most of the characters and background settings are painstakingly caricatured/reproduced from the first two movies despite their radical looks (which in fact giving a comic book feeling to the series, thanks to the truly talented Paul Rudish of Dial M For Monkey fame, the short-lived segment of Dex's Lab that heavily inspires Clone Wars).
Also, many fans will take a first glimpse on one of the most dangerous villains in the Star Wars universe: General Grievous.
II, like the first one, is no different, except for its extended running time and some minor changes (Anakin's hair is now longer and he wears an outfit similar to Darth Vader's, the first appearances of Grievous' bodyguards, clone troopers now bear their resemblance to stormtroopers, etc.).
There is more action crammed into this one DVD than the first two prequel movies , nearly all the characters are used to their full potential and you really want to be a jedi as you you see them unleash their awesome power whether it be Yoda , kit , or Mace they all impress .
Dolph's first directing effort, The Defender, was a nice little action piece.
Realizing later (years later, more like 14 years later)that this movie has Absolutely NOTHING to do with the first Beyond the Door movie.
With its ridiculous plot, a fair amount of cheesy gore, and loads of really shonky model effects, Amok Train (AKA Beyond the Door III) sounds like a bad-movie fan's idea of heaven; the first few scenes certainly had my hopes fairly high, for they feature a completely gratuitous shower scene and a dwarfÂtwo of my 'essential ingredients' for a fun, trashy movie.
I first saw this movie when I was about eleven years old.
I must say, now at an age well thrice as old as the first time, I could take a second look and found it was really as bad as I remembered it.
When I first read the German reviews, I thought they were writing about another movie.
At first he is uninterested...until he learns the identity of the kidnapper, the head gangster he didn't manage to kill.
I was hoping for a nice, solid portable Grand Theft Auto ever since I first played Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas a while back.
Anyway, my logic aside, if you love the first GTA's you'll love this.
After the launch of the PSP, this GTA game marks the first hand-held game of the series and was one of the perfect buy for Christmas 2005.
I recently got a PS2 which came with a controller,memory card,3 PS2 games and 1 PS1 game for a good price.I didn't play the GTA series when it first came out starting with GTA3 in 2001.I started loving the series in 2005 when I got GTA Vice City for Christmas.I loved it.I then got San Andreas and thought it was the greatest video game of all time.I had GTA2 as well.Now with my new PS2 I play Liberty City Stories which was originally out for PSP.This game costs $30.00 and it is definitely worth it.Remember this is a PSP port and PSP is not as good as PS2 so the game is definitely not as good as GTA San Andreas or even Vice City actually but it is still a good addition in the series.Liberty City Stories takes us back to Liberty City(where GTA3 took place).The year is 1998 and you play as Toni Cipriani.During the game you do various missions for different people just like in the other GTA games.When you are not playing missions you can steal cars,kill people and just plain be a cold-hearted criminal.The storyline in all the GTA games are good with Vice City having the best one.The storyline in this game is pretty good as well.There are some parts of the game that are not too good.First of all the soundtrack.Just like in Grand Theft Auto 3, aside from the classical music station and the 1980's station the other music is re-created.Not real music.It is re-created well but we want music that was popular for the time.Actually out of the whole series, this game has the worst soundtrack.Flashback FM is the best radio station in my opinion but there aren't that many good songs there either.Even in GTA3 the only good station was Flashback.It had some good songs from the Scarface soundtrack but there were so little songs.I like 80's music and GTA Vice City provided the best radio station with actual songs from the 1980's.San Andreas had classic rock from the 70's and great rap and rock songs from the early 90's.If the soundtrack was better the game would be on-par with GTA Vice City.Anyway Liberty City Stories is a good addition in the GTA series but don't expect that much since its a port from PSP.
who this time uses his special skills for vengeance when his family is wiped out by Russian mobsters however this is just the first fifteen minutes as Lundgren wastes literally no time in delivering payback and it is when he finds out that the mobster lived that it becomes apparent that he must return back to Russia and even the score.
I love Adam Sandler, but this is too much, I can't understand how he agreed to do this garbage in the first place.
The first time we see Sandler naked, it's a forced chuckle.
At first, Zohan has no luck getting a job with Paul Mitchell, much less cutting hair.
It gets a four because while it mostly reeks of bad, it still has some good jokes in it, the beginning to film promises a very odd and refreshing new comedy and the first 5 minutes will tickle your spine.
Sometimes and I say maybe sometimes such a joke is funny the first time, but not a entire movie.
However, I was pleasantly surprised, for the first time in my life I see a movie that does not picture Arabs as animal-like, heartless, brainless killing machines.
For the very first time, someone has discovered that Arabs are human beings too.
The first time in the movie it was a little funny but after it was in every scene, it became tedious.
This guy has played football (twice), gone on fifty first dates, paused and sped up his life, and married Kevin James.
He passed away in September 2002 on the first anniversary of 9/11.
Other reviewers have already commented on the superb photographic artistry, so I'll just say that, more than 20 years after first seeing it, what still stands out in my mind is its ending.
Additionally, he deserves credit for making the first and only film I can think of to portray the service of women in the Vietnam War - the acclaimed TV series "China Beach" is the only other portrayal of similar subject matter.
The noise that the ghost makes (sounding something like a kid doing an impression of a frog) is creepy at first, but it's also massively overused and soon becomes old - though it may well have been an inspiration to the noise that the ghost in 'The Grudge' makes.
When people saw the film "Day of the Dead" for the first time, some said that it should be burned on a pyre...
Now, the first two murders in the prologue of the movie were actually quite good.
I don't exactly know why, but since I watched this movie first in 1988, I've seen it about thirty times.
Most of all, the radio signals built up the suspense by the first very vague but thrilling impact they had on Mark and Martha.
The first time I saw this movie, it really creeped me out.
I loved it from the first time I saw it.
An elementary school burying a time capsule that features drawings from all of the children in class and a page of numbers from young Lucinda, who came up with the idea in the first place.
Lets start with the first contrivance of a distant introverted young girl, Lucinda, in 1959 who hears voices.
He sends his son to bed and in a inexplicable drunken rage deciphers most of the numbers, starting with the first number, picked at random: 911012889.
After half a glass of whisky he found the first date from the first set of numbers he looked at, after a whole bottle and a sleepless night he found the rest, but it took his trucks GPS product placement ad to find out the rest of the numbers are latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates.
For the first two thirds of the film I was waiting for some clever twist or original storyline that would bring together all the disjointed pieces of the film but instead it ended in the most anti-climactic and least original way - aliens!
The second worst cop out in history - the first being 'he woke up and it was all a dream'.
The first thirty minutes are okay, but it just plummets from there.
But after the first half-hour, you say, "I never want one of those things!"
The soundtrack has a nice feel but is used to unsubtle effect; the film touches on America's racial divide, but quite shallowly; the teenage fashion on display has period interest for those who remember it at first hand.
Shade is one who you can't understand at first but once you get to know her you can relate.
One is with the younger daughter bringing home purely by coincidence the ex-lover of her mom for a supposedly blind first date with the mom.
Their conversation in bed after the first time doing "it" was a gem.
The first point I want to discuss about this movie is that of the great story behind it.
I recently saw her very first movie, Fast times at Ridgemont High.
My friend and I saw Eddie Macon's Run at the theater when it was first released.
Eddie Macon (John Schneider, in his first film starring role since coming to prominence on 'The Dukes of Hazzard') is an honest-to-God good man who ends up in jail after losing his cool with his sleazy employer.
All of these elements will keep you entertained during the first portion of the movie, "Gizmo" especially, but it's when the Gremlins arrive that the real fun starts!
As mentioned, the first segment is still entertaining.
It seems to me that by re-enacting the tragedy, with the neighbor's little girl and at the scene, Keane makes the first step toward recovery.
Perhaps Keane doesn't have the necessary strength of character, which may be what got him in trouble in the first place.
Though I didn't have the patience to review both versions in toto I'd say Soderbergh made a snappier version, and I can see why he would have done that because the original version's first 30 minutes seem interminable, I thought I'd watched an hour and it was half that.
"Keane" is a highly unusual film in that, for the first half of its running time, its focus is entirely on this one character as he roams aimlessly around the city, muttering to himself in barely comprehensible fashion.
Indeed, at times we begin to doubt if his daughter ever even existed in the first place, which only increases our curiosity and apprehension regarding who Keane really is, what his real problem might be, and just how much of a threat he poses to himself and those around him.
After the end of the film my first thought was "What's the point?".
Shedding itself of any accompanying score or conventional direction, Keane tightly and uncomfortably focuses on the title character's obsession for the first and last sections of the film.
I have actually just seen this movie for the first time this afternoon.
Within the first 15 minutes you get the sense there's something wrong with Keane.
Our first encounter with him is at the New York Port Authority Bus Terminal.
Keane by Lodge H. Kerrigan leads from the first moment into the world of a mentally disturbed person.
Never before in my 22 years of film reviewing have I had the experience of having a fellow audience member turn to me as the first end credits began to ask me "What do you think happens to him?"
I was completely absorbed in the film from the first frame through the final one.
Despite my first comment that 'Keane' is a film without artifice, there are elements to the structure and editing that show the director/writer had made extremely subtle uses of film technique to compress, heighten and intensify William Keane's psychological character.
Furthermore, we get to see Inuyasha's mother (last seen in the first season of the anime) and (finally) his father, the Great Dog Demon.
The music is amazing, I was happy to see some of the old stuff from the first season mixed in there.
Although Tenka Hadou no Ken is the third Inuyasha feature film, it's the first of them to actually have the scope of a full-length feature.
Most of the acting was great despite the fact that many of the actors were first timers.
I just watched Brooklyn Bound for the first time about half-hour ago and this film doesn't waste a minute of the film as every scene of this film are shot very well.
That's Devaney's first achievement in this movie.
6) You may also feel the worst person on earth, just for having seen the first twenty minutes.
Let me give you one instance of how this film fails at every turn: When Hannigan first meets her beau's best-est buddy, Monk is shown diving into a pool, coming up on the other side, showering off, then washing a car in her too-tiny bikini and even pole-dancing with the shower.
Sophie Monk was the only decent actor and put on the American accent well in her first movie role (despite being cast as eye candy for the male audience).
Oh where to begin...first of all, the plot is stupid.
I remember the first time I ever saw this great film was at an old drive in theater in my area when I was very young and to this very day, it remains one of my favorite films of all time.
It was comical for the first thirty seconds, but after that you start to impatiently wonder when this scene is going to end.
But it's even harder to cleverly satirize movies that are funny in the first place.
The first question that comes to mind though is who the hell came up with the idea.
This is a question I wondered when I first heard about the movie and now after seeing "Date Movie" I know it can't be done and shouldn't even be attempted.
I despise everyone who was involved with this movie from the entire cast who somehow read this script and said this is going to be good to the interns who didn't walk off the set after the first day of shooting.
We went to the theater about 15 minutes early and when we first came in we were the only ones there, which surprised us.
The only (barely) entertaining parts of the movie were in the first 10 minutes.
Perhaps just the first teaming of Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin makes this worthy enough to watch.
However, there are not many movies which force me to turn them off in the first quarter.
When she first sees Conner (Matthew McConaughey)at his brother's wedding rehearsal, she comes across as a nagging wife to him before the audience even knows they have a history.
I was sick of the whole story before the first ghost even showed up.
Allison was Connor's first sexual score.
We learn that Jenny gave Connor his first camera, and Connor's pursuit and initial loss of Jenny prompted him to seek advice from Uncle Wayne.
About two months ago my friends and I rented this movie and we only watched the first 5 minutes of it because we got bored so we took it out and watched another movie.
After being the root cause of his kid brother's wedding being called off, Connor Mead (Matthew McConaughey), a noted womanizer who sees male-female relationships as a strategic game to be enjoyed without becoming ensnared, is visited by the "ghost" of the first girl he ever had sex with.
Now, as Connor settles into one of the mansion's rooms, he is visited by the ghost of his now-deceased, lothario-like Uncle Wayne (Michael Douglas), as well as the ghost of the teenage girl who was his first "conquest", and an angel-like spirit from the future, a la Christmas Carol.
Men, when you're dragged by your fem-boss like the vagina-whipped pussy you've become, to see GHOSTS OF GIRLFRIENDS PAST, at least take solace in the film's educative axioms during its first act.
It really could have been so much better, the plot was intriguing (or at least that's what I thought after watching the trailer), the idea of the ghosts of these girls finally giving a lesson to this full of himself guy seems to completely vanish after the first one.
When she gets her first glimpse of him (after years of silence), she is all glassy eyed and love struck.
The first 45 minutes were OK starting with a few funny lines and getting a taster of what was to come of the main character.
However the movie became a bit of a shambles as soon as the first ghost came along and the movie never really engaged me from then on.
I really think that Joanna Cassidy knew the first time she saw "katherine", she knew even from 16 years ago that she was not her original adopted daughter.
I first watched "The Dirtwater Dynasty" on Channel 7 with my father.
I watched this epic when it was first released on Aussie TV.
It was my first introduction to Hugo Weaving, way before the Matrix.
Holy crap when i was a kid and saw this movie...well the first time i saw it i was 5. didn't think it was scary at all and loved it, until that night when i went to bed..i had nightmares for the rest of elementary school.
Watch it and enjoy it, but first turn off a portion of your mind.
I like the fact that the Wild West Show that becomes part of this story first takes place in the changing West, to keep it a western and not have them running around in the East playing at being westerners.
Ben Johnson first arrived at Hollywood by bringing in some horses for Howard Hughes and decided to stay and watch.
There are so many good actors in the movie that I have to stop but first, let me mention Pat Hingle, another great actor.
The first time I saw this I caught the last 15 minutes and that (combined with a great song by Bjork/David Arnold) convinced me I had to see it again.
You HAVE to remember that he made this at a young age and little examples of first class directing shine through.
Its first twenty minutes are so painfully nonsensical and over stylized you can't help but cringe in anger, yet after those initial phases of ridiculous OTT poppiness blow over, the project reveals itself as quite enjoyable.
It's also proof positive that first impressions can be deceiving, so please, don't despair, stick with it and you will be rewarded.
I enjoyed the movie the first time through for the visuals and the characters.
The gremlins are the scene stealers here, at first they are very cute then all of a sudden when they start causing carnage they are quite the opposite.
Zach Galligan is bland at first, but as the film gets going and you know more of his character you warm to him.
Billy being the typical person that he is breaks all the rules At first gizmo multiples creating 4 more Mowgli who then eat after midnight turning them into Gremlins viscous nasty goblin like creatures With help of his mum Billy succsefully kills off three gremlins except there leader Stripe who escapes to the swimming pool and jumps in all hell brakes loose I'm not really sure why i like this movie probably because of the music and because of the gremlins them selves there cool
The first two Spider-Man games based off the films were flat out awesome!
It get's boring quickly, unlike the first and second games.
I loved the film, but, this is the first game in the Spidey franchise that has left me disappointed!
I LOVE Spider-Man 2 for Gamecube and the first Spider-Man Movie game!!
The Swinging and getting up buildings quickly will be hard to grasp at first, but after an hour or two, you won't wanna turn off your ps3.
So overlay this is another great spider-man game but it doesn't compare to ultimate spider-man and spider-man 2 game.And the spider-man 3 game is better then the first spider-man movie game so i recemond this spidey game is very fun.
Sandman for instance appears out of nowhere on your first mission using the black suit and you almost wonder if Spider-Man is having a nightmare.
Unlike the first two games where we see the detailed and sometimes emotional transformations into their villainous persona's such as Norman Osborn into Green Goblin or Octavius into Doc Ock- the villains here appear in the blink of an eye and are long gone before you realize it.
At first, it seemed a little dull and boring, but as the game progressed I got more interested in the game and so I kept playing.
New York City is my first major complaint; the city is supposed to be bigger, but it felt small and unwelcoming.
In the end, this was a false statement; you can only follow the game, not choose any story lines, and I was a bit worried at first that I had accidentally chosen the wrong one!
The first credited Merrie Melody is a poor effort.
Historically important since this was the first Merrie Melodies short after a year of Looney Tunes with Bosko as the star.
What I got instead was a well written and developed character for the first hour or so, and then a cheesy but extremely fun finale that reminded me of the best low budget horror films I grew up with.
This breeds more of the little critters, and they are harmless enough at first as well.
Ultimately though it is the performance of Diane Goldner, the real heroin of both this film and the TV show, that made this the first big hit of "Project Green Light" and I eagerly await her return... in the up coming "Feast 2: Sloppy Seconds" (still in production) as the Biker Queen this time instead of the Harley Mom in "Feast"(2005).
The first 10 minutes where you are literally 'introduced' to the main characters is a fantastic hook and I knew then that I was going to enjoy the film.
This was the first film I saw legendary cult actor Dick Miller (a favorite of director Joe Dante) in, and he's remained an entertaining actor to watch.
The real fun starts just a few minutes into the first act, and keeps on pumping throughout the film, with just enough lulls in the action to reset the audience for more.
And it gives a introduction for each one of the characters even if they won't last a minute, which at first I found to be a bit annoying but once action gets started, you actually really start to appreciate the introductions it showed.
The movie started off with some funny promos at the beginning introducing the characters and letting us know who will probably die first.
The movie also gives brief biographies of each character, but this becomes redundant after the first 3-4 and by the time they are all done, you're wondering why they did so many.
It's the first horror/monster movie that I have seen in a really long time that was actually good.
I just saw this at the first annual Fantastic Fest Film Festival in Austin, Texas and I liked it so much I felt compelled to write a review of it.
It was the first "scary movie" I saw as a kid, and I think that may effect why I love it so much today.
So at first you are surprised at how this cute little furry creature who sings a little song could produce other mogwais whom are not so nice.
A great movies for adults to watch with kids for their first "scary movie".
This is the first film that I have seen from the "Project Greenlight" series.
Plus, although at first I liked Sylvia Sidney's character for believing in her man, after she knew he was a murderer and STILL followed him, she just seemed totally stupid.
The first one Fury was a tale of mindless mob violence against an innocent man caught in circumstances not of his own making.
For one thing I'd like to know just what Fonda had done before that made him a three time loser in the first place before the action of the story takes place.
His film library was the very first A-list library to be sold to television.
There are so many shots to savour, I'll name just a few which caused me an admiring intake of breath;- for example the scene early in the film with a reflected image of the at that point still optimistic newly-weds sitting by the frog-pond, the expressionist use of shadows seemingly radiating out from Fonda's cell as he paces it in frustration and what may have been the first cinematic use of the three possible "Hold the front page" headlines in the press depending on the outcome of Fonda's trial plus of course the rightly famous eerie smoky set-piece where Fonda panics and shoots his friend the prison priest.
His jailbreak on the eve of execution is punctuated by his first murder, necessitating his going on the lamÂan initially voluntary choice recast as mandatory destiny.
I first saw this film when I was 5 and I am ashamed to say that it scared me.
This was one of Joe Dante's first movies and you can tell that everything he grew up with and movies he studied as a child are on-screen in Gremlins.
He finds a job as truck driver, but is unfairly fired on his first day.
The first attempt to destroy the same complex using a giant truck bomb, killing and injuring several, took place in 1992!
In fact, another of the first film's highlights was the way it made its creatures dark, hurtful, and just plain funny.
There are moments in the film, especially when they go upstairs for the first time to look for the alien where the suspense is almost unbearable.
Spielberg got a then up-and-coming screenwriter named Chris Columbus to write the script (Columbus would go on to become the director of the first two "Harry Potter" movies as well as the first two "Home Alone" pictures), and Roger Corman protege Joe Dante to direct the picture (Dante directed 1978's "Piranha", a witty spoof of Spielberg's first smash hit "Jaws", and a segment of Spielberg's "Twilight Zone: The Movie" a year earlier).
Sure, there was some things wrong, but the first time I watched it, I didn't notice, so its not bad.
I saw the movie and I first thought it was real too.
I first watched this around 5 years ago at 11pm with the lights off and a storm outside, Scary no?, Thus making me lose 2 nights sleep...The ways the Aliens were conveyed were okay, and the "powers" they had were a tad far-fetched but still a great movie to watch alone and in the dark, the bad thing though is if you watch it for a second time all the scary moments just aren't there leaving you to sell it or watch as your friends are scared by it just to play small jokes on them for a day or two(worked with my brother, so meh).
Seinfeld tells his joke, it is funny, clean and he gets the punch out the first time around.
anyway i thought this film was real when i first seen it and i couldn't go anywhere alone i became paranoid that the aliens were gonna come get me.
I first saw this movie a few years back on sky movies.
lol - be kind , this is my first review.
I missed a bit at the beginning as the first scene was of the 3 men walking outside to find out what happened to the power (as it went out).
this is the first film i have ever said was terrible (check my records) and i can't understand why anyone over 10 would think this was real or any good at all!
If you were watching her carefully, you would have seen her drawing aliens, even though she never saw them (correct me if I am wrong, as I said I missed the first 20 minutes).
I first saw this movie on Sky Digital here in the UK..
I first saw it under the belief that it was supposed to be an actual incident - and this is how the film was intended to be seen.
I first heard his monologue on CD, and that was side-splitting enough.
Being a golfer and a fan of the sport for many years, I was very interested in seeing this, which I did when the VHS first came out.
Predating the same mistake they made with Seinfeld's second season (specifically, the last four episodes) by 25 years, NBC aired the first episodes of Star Trek out of order (the approved pilot, Where No Man Has Gone Before, was broadcast as Episode 3).
In that sense, the first Trek series is the science-fiction equivalent of Seinfeld: watch a random episode, and you'll enjoy it just as much as if you were viewing them in the correct order (the feature films changed that a little, but it's another story).
In short, this may not be the proper first episode of the series, but given the standalone nature of the original Trek scripts, it works pretty well as an introduction to Gene Roddenberry's seminal TV universe, a place "where no man had gone before".
The very first episode of the original Trek series to air, though this was the 6th one filmed.
We learn how intensely Kirk feels when he loses a crewman - check out the first killing here - and he has to go thru it a few more times in this episode.
At first I was disgusted, but then when I started to get to know Art (poor big, rich teddy bear character), I couldn't help following his plight and unbalanced relationship which develops with his co-star (West - twisted, disenfranchised, sociopath) until the film presented a resolute conclusion.
I missed the first advance screening of this film, so I was sure to be one of the first in line for the second one!
The entwined undertones of the movie kept me from fully enjoying it during the first pass through, because of having to think a bit too much to decipher the true nature and purpose of the lead actors' (West + Art) dialogue and conduct.
The first thing you'll notice are the unique dialogues between West, Art and the other major characters of the film, but especially between West & Art (the main 2 characters).
I have to admit that the first time I saw this film (the color version) I wasn't too enthused with it, probably because it was 3am on a Sunday morning.
They seemed a little different at first, but then they seemed just right by making their points to the story.
I saw "I'm Telling You For The Last Time" before I actually got into the series itself (I was young when it first aired and so now I am feasting off reruns).
On a first time viewing the sheer despondency of these characters seems to overwhelm the humor, but watching the film again, the humor seemed far more blatant.
At first, I was taken back by the film's unyielding, in-your-face, wicked humor and plots, however, upon completing this remarkable piece of cinema, I was able to digest and grip what the main characters' (West, Art, 'Nancy' - boy is she a hoot -) social positions in our/their world must be like.
At first you have no idea that this is real, non-scripted footage, but at the end of the film, the producers prove it to you.
I really liked this film when I saw it the first time in the 80's on television.
I was a preteen when I first saw this movie and I can remember going into my mother's medicine cabinet and taking some of her Alka Seltzer just to try it with chocolate sauce... After growing and having kids of my own...
This tightly handled low-budget French / Italian co-production is an improbable, but an oddly bold and stimulating teaser that seems straight forward at first, then suddenly it leads you down many knotty paths (with Hitchcock shades) before breaking out the truth of the matter.
The performances outside the central turns are finely tailored with the likes of Annie Cordy, Ellen Bahl, Jean Gaven, Steve Eckardt and Jill Ireland in one her first roles starring alongside Bronson.
I was only 14 the first time I watched it so one of my favorite parts was watching the french babe in her see through top...
It always takes me a few viewings to fully grasp the concept of most films but already by watching it this first time I'am really convinced that this could be his best outing (with the exception of the first Death Wish and Cold Sweat).
I first saw this movie when I had a trial subscription to Showtime, and a brand new VCR, and I recorded it in VHS.
They must do things differently in the United Kingdom because I thought they would have had to have a license first.
On of the first movies to be filmed entirely in Cambodia and in Vietnamese in many years.
The film is one of the first full features made in Cambodia since the 1970's when the Khmer Rougue Regime took over.
"Snaker" is the first disappointment in the territory.
***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** OK, first of all, i didn't actually catch this during the mtv movie awards, i found it during a random downloading session.
I mean, for instance, what the hell makes Columbo suspect the stage magician in the first place?
Anyways, it's kind of hard to find at first but its worth the extra remote clicking.
O man I love this show I first watched it at the beginning of SERIES 2, it was Saturday and I wasn't going out anywhere, so I was flicking through the channels and i caught a glimpse of PAULEY PERRETTE'S character ABBY and i was like OMG she's so gorgeous and i watched it for the entire episode and became a devote fan, I have all the DVD's.
Being a fan of "JAG" and its topical stories, I knew that this show couldn't be that bad, but due to my work schedule wasn't able to watch it when the first season debuted.
Falk asks, "What was the first name?".
The first time I watched this show I was flipping through the channels and it looked interesting so I watched it and I have been hooked on it ever since and have never missed an episode.
I think this was the first series I followed good (mean that I watched everything) And in the last episodes in season 2 it was really dramatic.
I love this show, since the first episode.
When I first watched it I felt that the characters had promise, which is why I watched a few more episodes.
Well the above was written after watching the first 2 series of NCIS, so now I thought I would comment on what I think of the show in series 3 and 4.
Time for another update as season 5 comes to a close in the UK although we are getting to see the first episode of season 6 a few days after it airs in the US.
At first, I did not like Tony; I thought he was an ego-centric, male chauvinist pig, but there's more in there than the id-controlled Mr. DiNozzo, I'm discovering.
The first season was a bit of CSI style, everyone was just cool.
I'll get the superficial stuff out of the way first - every camera angle on Michael Weatherly is gorgeous, and he plays it so well as Anthony DiNozzo.
The first reason I tuned in was simple - Mark Harmon.
Michael Weatherly has matured as an actor - I first noticed him in Dark Angel - and he has wisely chosen to let his character on the show, Anthony "Tony" DiNozzo, to mature at a natural rate.
Tim McGee (Sean Murray), who joined the team in the second season after making various guest-appearances throughout the first season.
Has been mercilessly teased by DiNozzo when he first joined the team, getting the absolutely-not-flattering nickname 'Probie' ('Pivello' ('Greenhorn') in the Italian Version).
From the way Columbo first zeros in on suspect(without spoiling it - it revolves around the way the body fell and therefore how the murderer entered the room) to his piecing together means, opportunity and motive I found this one extremely intriguing and engrossing.
At first I was put off by the back and forth breakup of the shots but soon began to conform to the format.
From the leading roles to the most minor of characters the acting is absolutely first rate.
I saw this for the first time when I was 13, and have been watching it ever since.
One thing that makes this fun and smart show stand out even more is the fact that the show was cast first and then a pilot was written based on the personalities of the primary actors making their characters even more funny and human than any others on TV.
And isn't a montage usually place toward the end... not in the first 20 min?
At first Micheal thinks that it was just a hallucination but when he hears about Debbie's death & that of another one of his friends at the sÃ©ance Peter (Mario Ivan Martinez) on the news he becomes convinced that his vision was real.
After many years, I caught this movie on Mexican cable and I'm glad that I liked it better than the first time I watched it.
Foricienta is a greaaaat story, not only for kids.. i'm 20 years old and i loooove it.. the story of flor is lovely she is a person full of love and compassion who, without even really wanting to, changes the life of Fede, and fills it with joy and fun and makes him alive again.. makes him love her.. at times hate her lol.. but fall absolutely in love with her... i used to think this was just some kids stuff.. and then a friend of mine forced me to watch it and i became an addict... i love the songs, the characters, the charming prince.. maybe you wont like it as much cause of all the things she say may not be so understandable in other languages, but it's a very enjoyable show what so ever.. flor is the best... the one bad thing is the end of the first season =( (i won't say what it was) but it's 100% worth watching..
And when her former bridesmaid, Mary McCoy, has her brains accidentally blown out by another IRA bullet, she recruits a friend and they begin to lobby, first in churches and town meetings, then on TV, for a cease fire.
I haven't seen the first part of this series yet, and I'm looking forward to it.
I saw this movie for the first time many years ago.
The Doom Generation completely blew me away, from the first kinetic moment, to it's supercharged and ultra-violent ending.
Two teenagers, Amy Blue and Jordan White lie in their car pondering the meaning of love and life when Xavier Red jumps into their car and starts the first of a string of violent happenings.
This was Roses first major staring rule, and playing a confused and bewildered teen seems right up her alley.
Originally planned as the first of a series, Young Sherlock Holmes was a bit of a misfire at the box office.
At first, Watson and Holmes have fun getting up to mischief on campus but a series of bizarre suicides soon distracts them.
In the 80s, Chris Columbus penned a string of imaginative movies from Gremlins to The Goonies and later he directed the Home Alone films as well as Bicentennial Man (yes, I like it) and the first two Harry Potters.
You may not believe it but YSH was actually the first ever film to feature a fully CGI character (a stained-glass knight who comes alive), created by Pixar.
As one of the first PG-13 rated films, YSH has a bit of a savage edge, a hardness unfamiliar the condescending kids' films of today.
Please dont be disgusted, during the first viewing, instead look between the lines, where you will find the truth.
If you do watch this movie and don't like it the first time I suggest you watch it again, i promise after the initial shock you will see the art behind it all.
I wasn't able to get into the Evil Dead trilogy at first because I watched them all out of order.
The first half is basically a one-man comedy show starring the amazingly talented Bruce Campbell, who makes an idiot redneck into one of the most memorable movie heroes ever.
For example, they could have done without the tiresome sequence of the girl running into the woods and the others coming after her (and no shock factor like in the first movie's version).
Because he lost great first love, killed by his arch-enemy.
In Conan Doyle's original, Dr. Watson makes it clear that he was meeting Holmes in London for the first time after retiring from service as a surgeon in the Indian Army (Imperial British military during the Raj).
The sequel to the gory, atmospheric horror flick The Evil Dead is really more of a (black) slapstick comedy... something there was a hint of in the first.
The better part of the film is basically a remake of the first... new characters and new plot points, but the progression and such is the same.
The situations are the same, but the ways in which we get to them are different from the first film.
It's a fine idea, and it works great, too, because the outcomes of the situations are different, as well... meaning, you see a scene and go "Oh, right, I remember this from the first... oh yeah, now he... what the ...!?"
The acting is the same fairly low standard as that of the first.
The characters are equally ill-developed(though this time, I *could* tell them apart... they were easier to tell from each other, however, so maybe I wasn't the only one who couldn't tell those in the first apart?).
The editing is excellent, just as the case was with the first.
The special effects have improved... harder to figure out than those of the first, and that says quite a lot.
I recommend this film to any fan of Sam Raimi, gore, the first The Evil Dead, slapstick and/or Bruce Campbell.
In the middle of the movie,some totally new characters show up and it's pretty obvious they're only there to get killed by the demons.But then again,what other purposes can characters in a horror movie have anyway?This second movie in the "Evil Dead"-series is kinda different actually,it gets more surreal here,mainly because Ash has really lost it here in the first half,and the demons appear to be even more over-the-top and more evil.However,they both grab themselves together near the end for their final showdown.Ash is accompanied by a bunch of idiots but as they're idiots,they don't help much and get killed in some rather original ways.I'm not sure when this movie is situated,but I'm guessing this movie acts like the first one never existed.Not that it completely retells the story,it merely summarises it.And as I took this walk on gross-out lane,I found myself very entertained,somehow shocked but I don't have a clue by what exactly and I did laugh along with Ash and the deer head I must say.That scene really puts a spell on you.Almost as great as the first one
The first worked so well because it was such an unrelenting and grueling experience and was the finest horror film since "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre".
While he was a meek and unwilling hero in the first film, he is a completely over-the-top bad ass in this one!
While its not as successful as the first installment, "Evil Dead II" is still a lot of fun and one of the best combinations of horror and humor.
When the first EVIL DEAD came out in 1982 or whatever 80 something it was gore after gore after gore in such a small budget and it became known as one of the most shocking films.
Then when EVIL DEAD 2 came out director Sam Rami give it a new turn on the first one.
Ash (Our well known hero) is back on the road to the cabin in the woods with his girlfriend Linda (The one with the missing head) this time and all too soon they came upon the book of the dead and release the demons upon the woods and same as the first one Linda gets killed in the same style and new characters and scenes came along, Annie along side with her boyfriend Ed (Soon to be Evil Ed) comes to the cabin to put the missing pages together and the redneck Jake and his girlfriend comes for the ride.
In the meanwhile, a young woman, her boyfriend and two hicks (one of which - a girl - is going to A) get raped by vines and B) choke to death on an eyeball, while her boyfriend is going to leak some massive blood) have arrived in the cabin too, and as it turns out the whole blame of the situation stands on the parents of the young woman, herself, and her boyfriend, because it's them who looked for, found and tried to translate the Necromicon (yes, THAT book) in the first place...  Bloodier and also funnier than the first one, 'Evil Dead 2' manages to be as good as the original, but in a different way.
there's not one single boring moment in the movie, it's pure terror from the first minute to the most unexpected and unpredictable end!!!
All of this happens in the first ten minutes or so into the film.
He also creates some innovative camera shots - uses a lot of the same shots from the first Evil Dead - and paces his film with a high energy that will make you jump a lot.
as far as I'm concerned) but I must admit that the first time I saw this view of the character I was a fan right away.
for the first time at the boarding school where both are students was a great idea.
he wont have any trouble getting real money for #4, which he didn't need in the first three to make them so truly great.
Its the centrepiece of the Evil Dead Trilogy and yet it feels a little like a remake of the original, it does follow on from the events of the first film but the similarities between the two are very apparent.
Once again there is plenty of horror, gore and chills; but this time there is even more humour than in the first outing, and once again it is a great film.
7/10 I still prefer the first film, but in truth they are about as good as each other.
Essentially, it's a sequel/remake of the first film, and Ash (Campbell) is once again battling the forces of the dead, which have been resurrected by the reading of passages from the dreaded "Book of the Dead."
But unlike the first movie, the "Three Stooges"-type humor is rampant and outright, and it makes this entry deserving.
In Bride of Frankenstein, the film starts with a prologue that recaps the events of the first film, however, completely contradicting the entire ending of the film which is where the sequel starts.
I understand that Raimi was going through legal issues, so he was forced in this position to contradict the first film, but he certainly used the way that made Bride of Frankenstein the classic in remains.
EVIL DEAD 2: DEAD BY DAWN is really a re-telling of the same events from the first story, but in this case, only Ash and Linda (Bruce Campbell and Denise Bexler) come to the cabin and less than 10 minutes into the movie he has played a recording from a professor who mouths the infamous lines from the Necronomicon and unwittingly brought his girlfriend to an untimely death, though she herself becomes re-animated and returns to torment him as a severed head and a body with a chainsaw in its hands who unwittingly slices itself in two.
Sole survivor Ash (Bruce Campbell in the role of his life) returns to the cabin in the haunted woods and faces the same demonic forces he dealt with in the first film.
The first half is kind of like a one-man horror comedy show that provided Campbell with his constantly growing cult-icon status.
This movie is equal to the original Evil Dead, here we have ASH the lone survivor from the first encounter with the evil dead, fighting off the deadites yet again.
The ending to this film sets up the third installment ARMY OF DARKNESS, which is a total turn around from the first two.
Evil Dead II (1987) After the huge success of the first film, Sam Raimi and  Bruce Campbell reunite for this Quasi-Remake/Sequel.
The marketing on this film was terrible causing many to pass it by when first released.
I remember the day I first watched it.
Sam Raimi perfects his shaky cam shots and first persons and makes for the most enjoyable experience in a long time.
Director Sam Raimi expected this to be R rated and figured most people never saw the unrated (meaning it was X) first one.
So, he decided to just redo the movie--just quicker, less gorier and with STRONG doses of comedy (the first one was dead serious).
So it was released (with the gore never put back in) and, like the first, didn't do too well.
And, like the first, it quickly acquired a following and is now considered a great movie!
After recapping the events of the first movie (telling the story somewhat differently, even eliminating three of the characters), this movie has poor, tormented Ash (Bruce Campbell) constantly being harassed and tortured by sadistic demons - including, in the movie's most memorable sequence, his own possessed hand.
"Evil Dead 2" manages to be even more entertaining than the first movie, a goofy and fun horror/comedy with a chaotic finale that I would recommend to any fan of this genre.
I first saw the movie Young Sherlock Holmes several years ago and totally enjoyed it.
What I mean is that his father (as expertly portrayed by Samuel Froler) is such a monstrous egotistical hubristic sociopath that I almost couldn't continue watching as he defined for the first time the ground rules of the Bergmanesque hell we would all become so familiar with in the future.
Also he gives Anna's brother his own actual first name, "Ernst," though I have no clue what that signifies.
Like the locomotives one sees so often steaming through the glorious landscapes of this story, this movie starts chugging slowly at first - although never boring -- and barrels full steam ahead during the second half.
It's basically in two halves- the first dealing with Karin Akerblom (Ghita NÃ¸rby), Anna's mother, and her dire attempts to keep the two away from one another.
And at first Anna agrees, but soon the attachment to one another can't be broken, even through an early affair Henrik has with a waitress and Anna's tuberculosis scare.
The first 30 minutes could easily be eliminated, the whole Ila Arun track is superfluous and that elephant vs Akbar scene was a damn bore.
The first winner of this movie is writer-director Ashutosh Gowariker.
He brings in different shades of connections between the two like the first time Hindu vegetarian meal for Akbar, a sword fight or a confession of love in a room lit by setting sun.
But as a movie critic when I got an invitation to watch first day first show with a guest, my mother convinced me to go and take her too.
Jodha(almost all historians agree thats not her real name) was not his first wife nor his last.
It was never the same Akbar from the first scene.
And to leaders out there, there's a scene which while it's something that's not new, is always apt to remind them not to sit on their ivory towers, but to walk the ground and hear the grumbling first hand, as nothing beats ground level intelligence.
Rahman is top notch as usual, and dances here happen naturally as part of the narrative flow, with the first song coming out only just before the hour mark.
Let me get rid of the flaws first: Ashutosh Gowariker is not an action director, so the battle scenes and even the action sequences lack panache Â when they could have been executed brilliantly Â especially since Hrithik Roshan can do action fabulously well.
The first battle scenes are reminiscent of The Lord of the Rings, down to the swinging of the swords in linear movement, much like the Elves did when the Orcs attack.
I don't understand why there is such sexism in Hindi cinema, the males always get their critiques or praises first and then the females.
Well Aishwarya is first here!
It's also something of a gamble: Gowariker has never treaded the historical epic in his earlier features, especially one about India's first attempt at religious pluralism.
And speaking of cutting, she's first rate in the five-minute sword fight between Jodhaa and Akbar, a scene which goes from swordplay to foreplay.
Jodha-Akbar is a motley of exceptional love,Terrific Action,Soulful music and splendid cinematography.It is one of the most uncommon films and a must see one if you want to witness something special.The film got combative stunts and it has everything to please everyone.But on the other side,the film is slow and lengthy.The first half of the film lasts more than 2 hrs yet the twists and turns will glue the audience to the cinema.Hrithik was awesome as Akbar and Aishwarya was majestic as Jodha.Direction was at the best.Ashutosh proved yet another blockbuster which falls in the same line of Lagaan and Swades.May be he need to concentrate on the duration of the film by chopping off few scenes.Jodha Akbar is basically a love story instead of calling it as a War based film.The film lacks pace and slow narration of few scenes and the frequent usage of Urdu language made the audience ambiguous and also boring.But at the other end,even though the film lasts for more than 3.30 min,it is gripping enough and very much bearable.The Director need to edit the film and make it as a 3 hrs film so that the audience will like this film even more.The huge star-cast of Hrithik-Ash playing as Akbar and Jodha might have evoked a lot of curiosity among the audience before the release but i must admit the film almost lived up to the expectations.The love part was dealt exceptionally well and it is the forte for the film.The film depicted the Legacy of Akbar.The film also shown that Akbar did lot good for Hindus.
The first half-an-hour had some war sequences which were shot wonderfully but got kind of stretching-too-long after a while.
In the book Athos and D'Artagnan first saw each other in Monsieur de Treville's office and also in the book D'Artagnan was a Gascon (Basque) from the Southern part of France and Athos,the Count de le Fere came from a region not far from Paris.
Milady's son was by her marriage to her second husband Lord de Winter and his name was John de Winter aka Mordaunt and a "worthy" descendant of Milady de Winter he was an assassin and spy also and had his mother's appetite for revenge especially against his Uncle,his mother's executioner and the 4 Musketeers for depriving him of a mother.For more on Mordaunt read the novel and sequel The Twenty Years After and try to get a decent movie version of the novel.French and Russian versions of the Twenty Years After are the best and so is the BBC version.Richard Lester gave the Mordaunt character a sex change in his version and the Italian version is very loosely based.D'Artagnan was the shortest of the Musketeers and was olive skinned read the very first chapter of the novel and he was eighteen years old Aramis and Porthos were in their 20's and Athos in his early thirties.
For physical descriptions of the Musketeers they were fair and handsome men read the first part of the novel and the chapter the Antechamber of Monsieur de Treville.
When D'Artagnan first sees Milady in the beginning of the novel which started in the year 1625 and ended in 1628 Milady was twenty to twenty two years old and towards the end of the novel Athos in the chapter called How Athos found his outfit Athos when he finds out that his wife is still alive describes her as beautiful,tall,well-made,blue-eyed with a strange look to them (which might have inspired the screenwriter of this adaptation to make it appear that Milady was a demon possessed secret Satanist) and blonde who would be 26 to 28 years of age.
In his first at-bat as a movie star, Joe Lewis shows glimpses of some genuine acting ability.
Allow me to belabor this point: Lewis, the first full contact heavyweight karate champion of the world, apparently took his acting lessons as seriously as he does his martial arts- and it shows (again, briefly, in glimpses).
You've got Christopher Lee, Donald Pleasence (fresh from "Halloween"), Barbara Bach (former Bond Girl), Woody Strode (those who've seen "Spartacus" aren't likely to have forgotten him), Capucine (Inspector Clouseau's wife in "Pink Panther"), even the legendary director John Huston (not his first useless supporting role; remember "Tentacles"?).
must have seen this over 10 times in 5 days.movie grabs your attention form the very first frame.three things that stand out, the haunting theme song,the very lovely waitress in the restaurant and beautifully photographed budapest.also the very impressive performances by the three male performers.
The first three-quarters of the movie is a wonderful Holmsian adventure, full of deduction and growing friendship, as we see young Holmes exercise his slightly arrogant intelligence to put an insufferably superior student named Dudley in his place, assist an eccentric inventor, find tentative Victorian love with the inventor's niece, discover a pattern of assassination in the deaths of four elderly men, deal with a lazy Lestrade and a friendly fencing master, and establish a friendship with his young follower, Watson.
The first part of the movie is so good that it just about disguises the calculated playing-with-the-audience build-up to the conclusion.
We can imagine an elderly Watson looking back at this first case with affection and appreciation.
So ended my first adventure with Mister Sherlock Holmes.
Strange as it may seem the whole theme of the film revolves around a plaintive tune which first gained popularity in Budapest, later in Europe and then the whole world.
Rolf SchÃ¼bel's first feature (he did documentaries before) uses backdrop of Nazi-occupied Budapest to deliver a meaningful "menage-a-quatre", wrapped in a free interpretation of creation of famous suicide hymn "Gloomy Sunday".
For the kids, there's a mystery figure cloaked in black, as well as the screens' first completely computer generated character (If they tell you he looks fake, just say it was only 1985).
At first you think it's rife with symbolism, that useless tactic that can be "figured out" and then explained as great movie-making.
What can I say, I just watched it once as it first aired decades ago, but still had positive memories and thus watched it again a few days ago.
No, it's just pure stupidity that as a director you allow your film to premiere at such a big event, with a packed house filled with celebrities, but you can't seem to make/take time to check your print first before screening.
I was present at the showing at the Dallas Film Festival, where the attendees were privileged to be one of the first audiences to view the movie.
The first episode featured Conan running cross country and then forgetting the key on the window sill - how much more clichÃ©d can you get?
If you don't like it at first then wait and watch another episode.
Conan's first episode as host of the Tonight show was, to say the least, hilarious!
I surely hope that she will grow to be a first class actress, because we really need some!!
Charlie at first seems harmless enough but as things start to happen at the country house that border on insanity and later even cross over to murder the "fictictonal" Charlie is someone that's not at all to be ignored.
We at first have no idea just who Charlie is and like David and later Katherine we assume that he's only a make believe friend that Emily conjured up.
Rober De Niro gives a very controlled but effective performance as David Callaway the befuddled father who can't grasp what his young daughter is going through and feels at first that she's the one somehow responsible for the carnage that's been going on in and around the house.
Where he first met and got friendly and involved with the unsuspecting Emily and much later the rest of the unfortunate people that he came in contact with in the film "Hide and Seek".
it was the first 15 rated movie i saw and it was really good !
It's the first horror/Thriller movie I watched with Robert De Niro, and he is great in his role of David Callaway!
DeNiro should have looked at the script and then decided to burn it after reading the first 3 pages.
Can't believe it has been 18 years since I first viewed this little gem, and it was as good today as in 1985!
I was anxious to see this film, and I honestly enjoyed the first hour of it.
At first, her father sees Charlie as a way for Emily to express her feelings.
When I first saw the preview for Hide and Seek, i thought that it was just another creepy kid movie.
I loved the first hour of this movie.
I suggest watching the first hour and then leave or change the channel (if you're watching it on TV).
Have you ever turned on the TV and found that there was a film on and even though you've missed the first twenty minutes you decide to keep watching?
I first this film on video in my young teenage years.
Other black performers I'd like to mention include: Isabel Sandford as the first madame that Holiday encounters as we see her tell Billie she can keep the record she keeps playing.
#2-When she first lays eyes on Billy Dee and is carried out of the nightclub.
I have watched this movie a few times, the first time when it was first released in 1972 and I was barely 4 years old and it has left an indelible mark on me ever since.
In addition, for it to be the only screenplay that she has ever written, Suzanne DePasse (who was a Motown A&R executive at the time and was the first and remains the only Black woman to be nominated for an Oscar for writing) created a great story even if it presents a slightly less gritty portrayal of the troubled singer's life.
The first question that would run across the mind of anyone who'd watch this movie is: "Can Diana Ross act?"
And I think that's what the director wanted to clear up right from the very first scene, with a flash forward to Billie Holiday's drug bust while the credits were still on.
This is a great fun, adventurous, mystery movie, with also supernatural elements in it, which focuses on a very young Sherlock Holmes, solving his very first crime.
For instance some of the sequences and moments in this movie really reminded me mostly of the first two Indiana Jones movies, which he already had made before this movie.
The movie further more also features the very first to have a completely CGI character.
The first thing we see is "New York City Â 1936" in large letters across the screen; as such, the writers managed to commit a factual error within the first five seconds of the screenplay!
Billie was first arrested in 1949, for which she spent one year in jail.
In the autobiography for which the film was named, Billie describes her first encounter with McKay.
For years after my first viewing of the movie I wondered why that song didn't have a bigger impact for me the first time I saw it.
No wonder I hardly noticed the song when I first saw the film.
At first i thought she was 'reserved' because sh was supposed to be a prim,proper doctor, who had no time, even for having a manicure, for any social life.
When young John Watson starts mid term at a London Prep school, he is greeted first by a tall slender lad of about sixteen.
At first reluctant to involve himself in Holmes schemes, Watson finds himself up to his neck in a series of murders, as he trots beside the lanky Holmes.
That is only the beginning of an adventure that takes the boys to the notorious Wapping district where a nefarious cult of murderous religious nuts, led by the cruel and mysterious Eh Tar (Higgins), is doing heinous things to young ladies, including - to his horror, Elizabeth Hardy (Ward) Sherlock's first love!
I saw "Double Harness" for the first time yesterday.
At first, I was expecting what I call the usual 30's drama, with lots of tuxedos and evening dresses and maybe some weak humor.
The alert film buff will realize that this story is strictly from "la la land" in the first scenes, where the two sisters Colby are viewing bridal dresses for the younger one, Valerie, who is about to be married.
He watched it twice the first day and has seen it several times over the last couple of weeks.
Just saw this on TCM and I have to say I was floored by Harding's performance, who I saw here for the first time.
This was the first Filipino movie I came across, and it instantly struck a chord.
Personal note: I have been in love with Maryska (literary homage by Hrabal to his mother)since the blessed day I read the first lines in the book... some years ago.
I've already watched this movie twice and found it to be very entertaining the first time.
Well this is the first time that the best parts of a movie are not in the trailer.
I will be the first in line to purchase the DVD!
At first glance, you could imagine Emma Thompson giving a very over the top performance, given the warts, over-sized nose and tooth.
Halfway through the show I realized this wasn't the first time I had seen this one.
We also see his love for a first woman, who dies in a car crash (note that nobody actually goes to jail for that "accident" -it was during a car race, and Delon and his wife find themselves right into it without not even knowing it-).
A "fair" cop who was in his first arrest ten years ago finds him in Montpellier and immediately believes that he is running after mischief.
Gino, as an ex con, is forced by French law to take residence anywhere but in a city and so he settles with his young wife in the country, where fate turns against him, as first his wife is killed, then he is hounded by his former crime gang to return to his former lifestyle and also one of the arresting officers from his case years previously, the now chief inspector Goitreau is in charge of the area and has a grudge against him and becomes even more suspicious when he finds out Gino's new girlfriend Lucie is working in the local bank With the help of his now good friend Cazeuenve and his new girlfriend Lucie (Mimsy Farmer) he tries to battle his demons and fight against the troublesome cop.
While inside he penned the script for Le Trou, French slang for prison literally meaning "The Hole", a script that would gain him one of his first steps into the film industry, when it was filmed by Jacques Becker, who turned out one of the best prison films ever made.
They stay in the poshest hotels, take first class trains and dine in four star restaurants.
If you have to watch this I would suggest you TiVo it so you can just fast forward through the Ulles adventures in banality in order to pick out the 15 minutes or so of what you tuned in for in the first place.
It is great to see many of these places that I may one day visit but now, I have to make up for the ignorance and feigned appreciation of the Americans who ventured there first?
After the first 10 times you'd think she'd learn.
For the first time I know off, all the regulars stepped down to support a guest role.
Although the violinist helps the resistance in an auxiliary capacity, he's a performer first, who succumbs to the lure of a captive audience, as in the scene when the old man puts on an outdoor recital for the laxing soldiers.
All the characters are annoying caricatures that'll be grating on your nerves after the first 15 minutes.
When I first saw this film, I was struck by its cold, depressing tone and I admired it for its recognition of real problems associated with aging.
The elderly, who at first illicit pity, soon turn into cold killing machines - very much like what they attack - a huge conglomerate business and "progress."
**SPOILERS** Garishly photographed in intense blue and red colors the movie "I Know Who Killed Me" gives us a clue to what's about to happen within the very first few minutes of the film.
Lindsey Lohan in what may be, I'm not really sure, her first adult acting part is surprising good as both Aubrey Fleming and Dakota Moss.
I wont go into the detail of her life and what we see of it, because you can see that in the movie and read about it in the plot summary... some of the shots in this movie were spectacular... especially in the first half, and the final sequence in the water.. but there were points where her ranting and raving became almost painful to endure.. contradictory, angry, and occasionally insightful, Estamira is a rather unique and confusing person and her story is heartbreaking, although it is difficult to empathize given her temperament.
I really was touched by the emotions generated by the parents of Lindsey's character and those of the first murdered girl.
Im not a Linsday Lohan fan, the fact is this is the first movie i watched for her, i must admit that this was a really nice and cool thriller, very very enjoyable movie.
Acting was very good from most of the cast, as i mentioned before this is my first Linsday Lohan's movie i saw and i thought she did a good job.
Do not be dismayed by the first and last songs that bookend this film.
I was focused on how it all happened in the first place and the girls.
From the little promotion we got, we basically were told that this would be Lohan's first "adult" role as a leading lady.
And, if all that weren't enough, I figured out who the killer was almost from the first moment the character is introduced.
You don't really know what to think or expect for the first hour or so, as the story is pieced together linking Aubrey and Dakota, and whether or not they are in fact one person.
I joked to the person beside me that I hadn't laughed as hard since the first time I saw "Borat".
The first thing I realized was the script was by an amateur.
Like other reviewers, I knew who the torturing villain was within the first few minutes.
When they first meet they both know that they have something special, but before long when Charles is off in the navy she gets engaged with hardly any thought.
Does anyone know what was the opening music, in the first minute or so?
There are three main reasons for this: first off is the catchy and outrageously memorable music: "Summer Nights", "You're the One that I Want" and "Greased Lightning", to name but three, every song in the film has enough snap to get you singing and dancing.
I saw Grease for the first time last summer because I was curious about the movie my mother loved so much.. Well, I loved that movie myself!
Grease was the first movie that I saw when I was a kid that caused me to go back and see it again and again.
The first time i saw Grease i fell in love with the movie and i fell in love with John.
This is one of a number of movies I saw back when they were first released, misguidedly enjoyed at the time, and now find I have major issues with.
The first day of school arrives and little does Danny know him and Sandy would soon be reunited.
Mahima Choudhary acted very well considering that it was her first film.
Try just about any other one first.
I was going to only see about the first 30 minutes of it but this movie was so good that I watched it all the way through.
Michael Caine is the first to point out some of the terrible films he's made so you can't really have a go but his accents are hideous.
... above is my email address so as to enable you to contact me if you want to - I know a great deal about figure skating history because I have learned so many details during the time my mother was the first female figure skating sportscaster for the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation ORF.
Although she was - at the first go - the best European skater, she did not win the European Gold in 1948 because non-Europeans were allowed to participate, again for political reasons.
Some months before my birth in 1962, my mother ended her skating and became the first female sportscaster of the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation (ORF).
OK its not a oscar winner.its a Michael Winner.but this comedy has a great double act in Caine and Moore infact this is the first time i seen Moore do a comedy and he is quite excellent.a good supporting cast the script is more carry on than anything else and whats wrong with that.id sooner watch this than Trainspotting.
The demise of the first of the six students is also strikingly sudden and somehow out of character.
I still remember after seeing the movie I was shivering all over,and couldn't get the crazy scene out of my head~it was like the first time i felt that way after seeing a horror movie,kind of cool in a way!For those horror-movie lovers out there,I'd say this one is a must see!
However, it's a promising first film by Alejandro Springall and will undoubtedly delight fans of the "Like Water for Chocolate" school of magical realism.
The first forty minutes or so of this movie coulda gone by a lot quicker.
Art of the Devil 2 is not a sequel, in that it has no relation to the first (which I am now intrigued to watch as it stars Chai-Lai Angel Supaksorn Chaimongkol), although they deal with the same supernatural forces in Thai lore.
The gore grips you right from the start, giving you a hint that if you can't stand what you've just seen in the first few minutes, you won't be better off for the rest of the movie.
There's a slow start, the first ten minutes or so featuring Franklin Pangborn as the Fuller's landlord and his battles with the Fuller family dog isn't very good, but it's not long before Benny and the material start to work the situation for real yuks.
Also this is historically important as one of the first movies to deal with people moving from the city to the suburbs.
This was also my first exposure to Jack Benny.
Perhaps it's because I saw this one first, or because it came first.
When I watched it for the first time, I was mostly interested in what would happen to the characters, after which I concentrated more on details.
Katie O'Neill (Susan Hayward) first meet Paul Van Riebeck (Tyrone Power), a leader of the South African Boers, when he comes to Ireland on a horse-buying trip...
Hot Bubblegum is the third entry in the Isreali Lemon Popsicle series.There are nine films in the entire series.I have seen the first three because they are on youtube.Part of the fourth film is on youtube and the whole film should be up soon.Anyway Hot Bubblegum is not as good as Lemon Popsicle 1 or 2(which was the best one), but it is still a funny 1980's teen sex comedy with a good mix of drama and romance in it.My only problem with this film is Bobby and Benji are always friends even after the events of the first and second film.In those, they always fight and never become friends again, yet in the next sequel, they are best friends as if nothing has happened.Also Nicki from the first film(played by a different actress) returns.Benji and her date and talk as if none of the events of the first film happened.Also in the first film, she seemed like a nice girl, yet in this one she's a b**ch!
If you share the same sense of humor I also recommend you "Lemon Popsicle" part shoot at the Army, and two first parts of PORKY's ..
They reception they get from the native people on the arrival is however not as friendly as it first seems.
The legion of superheroes falls flat for two key reasons: The first is that the legion was poorly depicted in JLU anyway and that many like me expected supergirl to appear in the legion series as to continue from the JLU.
I like the first 2 seasons and I was expecting more of the conclusion of season 2, since it ended completely with a cliffhanger.
Well after viewing the first season I can say that ALL my fears were baseless.
I had my doubts at the first episode, I will admit, although I stuck through.
But most cartoons that I've actually wanted to check out, I've been happy after the first episode.
(Oh, by the way, the first season finale was AWESOME, and season 2 looks like it could be just as much a winner.)
There's a noticeable amount of cheap "bouncing cut-outs" in the first episode (I'm guessing Ep1 is partly cobbled from recycled in-house promotional materials) -- but the second episode is a knock-out.
Rest-assured: Clark will get blasted, fried, squished, stomped into the concrete, you name it -- all in the very first episode.
Jeff Wincott stars as Harlan Quinn a hit-man who wakes up to find that he's been declared dead and that he's been recruited to work for the CIA in killing anybody who's a threat to the government, this has all been set up by the mysterious Mr.Green (Michael Ironside) and his first targets include a homosexual advocate, a muckraking journalist and a female professor with information that the AIDs virus was manufactured.
The first time I saw this flick, I was disappointed; disappointed because I'd expected an adventure tale of King Soloman proportions, an Aladdin's cave full of gold, and bloody Inca battles in a Peruvian jungle setting.
With Michael Craig, Leonard Whiting and Nigel Davenport in the wings, it's an ensemble British cast of true quality, and the performances are first rate.
However, this is the first time that it is ever mentioned.
The secret of the sword is unforgettable to me for 2 reasons : Beside to be the first movie I have ever watched on a big screen, until Ratatouille, i wasn't found no one other cartoon like this one.
The Secret of the Sword movie first introduced us to She Ra.
I popped it into the player to watch the film for the first time in more than 21 years, prayerful in my hopes that it would live up to my fuzzy memories.
Adults who first marveled at "The Secret of the Sword" as kids can now enjoy it on multiple levels.
I was seven when I first watched this movie and am still captivated by it as a 26 year-old.
The film has the distinction of showing Liam Neeson and Gabriel Byrne in their first movie roles.
And for a high school student just researching the realm of mythical and fantastic literature, this movie was addictive when it first came out.
Way back in 1981 I saw this film at the cinema for the first time.
Tonally the film (purposefully) wanders wildly from darkness to light; the acts are very clearly defined; first the Kingdom is established and flourishes; which leads to betray and the emergence of evil in the second, then in a blistering third act there is a muted sense of forgiveness and resolution.
The first act is very entertaining and full of familiar stories (the Sword in the Stone & the Knights of the Round Table) the second act where Lancelot and Guinevere get their rocks off is all about the melodrama and the third act is a searing blend of startling imagery, fierce battles, sorcery and redemption that really does mark out Excalibur as an extraordinary piece of cinema.
Excalibur is the first, and so far, the only film, in my opinion, to come very close to the brass ring.
The Disney cartoon "sword in the stone" was one of the first in a long series of extremely offensive attempts to take inspirational and tragic stories and turn them into something banal.
Thereafter the first, and one of the greatest, attempts to bring the stories into a novelistic form was written in the late 1400's by a knight, Sir Thomas Malory, entitled La Morte d'Arthur ("The Death of Arthur") which is probably the most famous work of English letters proceeding Chaucer but before Shakespeare.
I remember how suddenly I found myself immersed in this world when I first saw the film, and even now the hairs stand up on the back of my neck thinking about it.
You get this series, the first and third series if you can get ahold of them, a lot of movies (Though I only like a few), 2 manga series (One hasn't completely been out yet though, and there are others that haven't been released in English) as well as Lupin the first stuff (Novels from Maurice LeBlanc that Lupin III is based on, as well as movies based off those books, most being hard to get ahold of though), some people don't make their Lupin stuff very Lupin-ish though, so even if you don't really like what Lupin is, there still is probably something with the Lupin name you'll like.
I'm kind of upset because I really, REALLY liked the first hour but by the end, it was kind of mixed up and left me going, "I REALLY hope this isn't the end of the movie" and it was.
DO NOT READ this comment IF YOU WANT TO WATCH THE MOVIE>>>>>IT will spoil it for you  This Movie was very good for about the first hour and then the end was like OMG!
At first I thought the movie was setup to make it hard to follow what was happening.
TBH, I enjoyed it at first, but at the end, I felt like I had just wasted that time.
We really enjoyed the first part of DANIKA, but it got more and more confusing as it went along.
Reading some of those comments made me in turn annoyed enough to post here for the first time.
Those who grasp it will be those who tend to think a bit deeper than the first layer of the onion.
I remember the first time I bought this gem of a game it was Christmas of 2003.
The first time I played it it started of slowly I had no idea where to go or what to do at all.
It was the first appearance of Professor Quatermass a flawed genius who is in a way the precursor to Dr Who.
The first is the amazing sense of transience about the military effort there -- you don't feel it's an army defending a homeland.
At first I couldn't understand his smile when looking at the picture of his dead lover.
For the first 30 minutes of it, I had a disbelieving smile on my lips, and really wanted to joint the Israeli army - mind you, I'm neither Jewish, nor Israeli, and they would never take me!
Rent it first if you like, you won't be disappointed.
The first is Lior Amichai, affectionately called "Jagger" for his love of the noted singer.
The idea of tenderness in the midst of so much rottenness (literally, in the first segment!).
That's why I didn't want to see "Yossi and Jagger" at first.
It made me want to go out an rent the first movie, All About You.
Eugene O'Neill remains, some fifty two years after his death and some eighty seven since his first plays appeared on stage, America's greatest dramatist.
The cast on the whole is first rate, from Barrymore and Spring Byington as the parents (note the business about the problems Barrymore has eating certain types of fish) to Wallace Beery as the inebriate uncle and Aline MacMahon as the spinster aunt.
He goes through the forms of saying he doesn't want Norma's gifts, but he takes them, claims to be surprised on New Year's Eve when she throws a party just for the two of them, but surely he has known from the first that she wants not only a writer, but a young man to reassure her that she is still attractive.
Sunset Boulevard is a movie about movies; one of the first called FILM ever made by Hollywood - because it's a state of art, a piece in art form... an authentic gem.
The obsession with the car is witty and when he first appears on screen in dealing with the finance agents is cool and collected deceitful, establishing the character's core exceptionally well.
Even their titles suggest this: "Eve" being the first bearer of life and "sunset" being the approaching night.
Despite the fact that the beginning reveals the end, Sunset Boulevard still manages to keep you hooked from the moment Holden sits at his desk for the first time right up until the movie's cruel, haunting, tragically human conclusion.
must have been close to the twentieth time I've seen it, I'm just as stunned and captivated by it as the first time I saw it.
Hard to imagine Gloria Swanson wasn't first choice to play the part of Norma Desmond with Pola Negri (too much Polish accent), Mae Murray, Mary Pickford (too sweet) and even Mae West all considered for the part of Norma Desmond.
On my first viewing, I wasn't particularly impressed with this movie but I liked it a lot more on the second and by the third - when it's magnificently transferred on DVD - I was fan, too.
Anyway, a young William Holden, in his first starring role, is okay and also provides the narration.
was not the first film to look at the uncertainties of cinematic success and fame.
such a tremendous hit and classic from it's first appearance in 1950?
It boiled down to this: the personal poison of the great fame of the silent screen star Norma was not mirrored precisely in the fall of say Norman Main (although their two first names bear an uncanny resemblance).
He had been her first director and husband, and he is also (in his over-devotion to her) feeding her ego by writing hundreds of fan letters to her to keep her emotionally happy.
But from her first entrance, you were in the presence of a great actress.
Audiences were captivated and irresistibly charmed by this still-stunning-looking yet down-to-earth "young fellow" -- over fifty years after she first took the world by storm.
I was in first grade when "Sunset Boulevard" was released.
Although this movie was made 8 years before I was, I saw it for the first time yesterday and I was blown away!
The narration of the movie by the head character was probably done by this movie at the first place and this influenced so many movies afterwards.
Some stand alone episodes in the first season were very good but the ongoing saga between Jack and Sam was very suspenseful and the character of Jack was truly scary.
The same dark tone and humorless approach continued and kept fans of the first season happy.
The Sam/Jack story was wrapped up in the first two episodes, those two were pretty good but the overall buildup to the climax was always going to be a letdown.
Ally Walker was pitch perfect, at least for the first two seasons, as Sam Waters.
The two first seasons were terrific, the third one was solid but the fourth was not good.
All in all, Gun Shy is probably the first good comedy of the year 2000 (which is not the new millenium, that starts in 2001).
The contrast is played up well, especially in the first scene at the psychiatrist's and the scenes where Charlie is caught between Fulvio and the Colombians.
I went in with middling expectations and had a blast the first rental.
At first the storyline may seem   disjointed, but wait; the threads are woven together and culminate  in a lovely ending which I found refreshingly sweet.
This was the first movie that I had watched from this genre, so I'm not knowledgeable enough to give a full, professional review as I am not a movie critic, producer, or director.
VIVA is the first great feature from underground queen of the B's (and Bees if you've seen her work!)
Anna Biller,in addition to acting as the film's central female lead,Barbi,also wore several hats in the production of this campy period piece (she wrote,directed & edited the film,in addition to set design & even supervising a brief animation sequence,where Barbi is experiencing her first real orgasm, while on some kind of psychedelic drug).The plot concerns a young,suburban housewife who's loutish husband ignores,and eventually abandons her,only to leave her to experimenting with her new found sexual self,including swingers,hippies,etc.
The first few minutes are simply exhilarating.
The first thing that swept me away was the set design / art direction: right from the get go I had the feeling I was back in the 70's except it wasn't through the usual played out typical Hollywood re-interpretation of what the seventies were supposed to have looked like, this film elicits a "Holy S*** the filmmakers must have gotten their hands on a warehouse full of actual items from the 70's" sensation (and apparently they did collect props for years).
thus I venture to guess that Anna Biller may have very well created the first "post-feminist 70's era B flick exploitation homage film" - anyone know of anything else out there like this?
The other good match or the best match was the first Team Angel/Eddie & Chavo the crowd were very dull and started to say "boring" to this match but they were all wrong cause the mat tallent of these guys was excellent and at the very amuzing end the crowd was cheering and really enjoyed the match.
It was Goldbergs very first match in WWE...
Now to the first title match for the Womens title featuring the Champion Trish Stratus and her opponent Jazz accompanied by Theodore Long.This was a one-on-one rematch from Wrestlemania,not so good though.
The next 6 Man Tag Match featured 6 former World Champions the first team of Booker T, Shawn Michaels and Kevin Nash against team 2 Triple H,Ric Flair and Chris Jericho.The match quickly took action as all 6 superstars got involved as fast as they could at the end Triple H (shockingly) pinned Kevin Nash after a pedigree.
One of my decent prayers to our Lord: The day of resurrection of this lovable study on DVD cometh.I enjoyed it first some 13 years ago in MÃ¼nster, Westfalia.Since then ,I have seen it probably 50 times or so.
This is one of the Great ones: In terms of French cinema in the first full decade of Sound it belongs right up there with Marius, Fanny, Cesar, Quai des Brumes, Le Jour se leve, La Femme du boulanger, La Grande Illusion and you can't put anything higher than that though Duvivier's own La Belle equipe and Pepe Le Moko both come within a whisker.
Living by a lake a widow comes face to face with what today we would call a mid-life crisis; vaguely melancholic and slightly wistful lest she did, as she suspects, marry the wrong man, she allows her thoughts to drift to her first dance and the names on her very first dance card who, on a whim, she decides to trace.
It was a nice touch to find that the first name on the card is dead - but try telling that to his mother, the great Francoise Rosay - as if to say right from the word go that love dies, baby, if you neglect it.
And held together musically by Jaubert's haunting theme melody, which I can still hum in the nostalgia cupboard of my memory fifty years after I first heard it.
Actually it is a series of vignettes, strung together by the bittersweet pilgrimage of a woman who sets out to find again the men who signed her first dance card.
With all the negative news about LIza in the past decade or so, some people tend to forget that in the two decades after CABARET Liza was indeed a superstar of the first magnitude - if her movie career never really took off (remember duds like LUCKY LADY and A MATTER OF TIME?
I saw her on Broadway in CHICAGO in 1975, and caught her first "Post-Betty Ford Center" tour in 1985, and she was still brilliant (That's when she starting singing "When I gooooooooooooo - I'm NOT - going - like - El - sie!")
i saw this film for the first time 1946, and was completely spellbound.
Anywho, my advice to everyone is that if you want a good laugh check out the first one (LOTR) and if you seek torture then by all means, see the Return of the King.
The primary failure of this movie was that it (A) Assumed you hadn't seen the first movie and (B) Assumed you had.
Regardless, the movie fails in its attempt to complete the story, which isn't surprising considering the quality of the first movie.
In 1978, Ralph Bakshi attempted to bring the first half of "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy to the big screen in his lushly animated epic.
Voice actors from the first film returned and some of them worked: Orson Bean was fine as Frodo, Theodore was again great as Gollum, Theodore Bikel did a fine job as Aragorn, and Roddy McDowall was wonderful as Samwise Gamgee.
(even if it got worse here when the skeletor-nazguls showed up) Still, The Hobbit (1977) worked in my mind (I gave it an 8 vote here), Glenn's songs were great there, the voices were very good, the story was a children's story, my 4-yr old girl loves it (I saw it for the first time just a month ago).
It also failed to include this final chapter of the story -- Bakshi had hoped that if his first film made enough money there would be impetus to finish it.
So Rankin/Bass was given the sloppy seconds, and they produced a sloppy film that probably doesn't really represent the scope of what they had hoped to do with "Lord of the Rings" themselves in the first place.
Those who've read the books will know what's going on, but those who haven't -- even those who've seen the first 2 movies -- won't have a clue!!
It was the first time that Rankin/Bass had dared to take on a two-hour special.
Many are the tales told about how Bakshi was only given enough financing to see us through most of The Fellowship of the Ring and approximately the first half of The Two Towers.
Ned, portraying Elmer with a gruff stodgy almost constipated voice, was supposed to be comedic and for the first 3 lines it was a cute gimmick, but he continued on with monotone recitation without any screen presence or semblance of acting.
When I first viewed this TV concert in 1972 I thought it the best TV concert ever.
This is important as one of the first movies to deal honestly with racism and the self-hatred of fair-skinned black people.
A radiant Claudette Colbert stars in this first version of "Imitation of Life" along with Louise Beavers.
KEVIN: This surprising eleventh-hour addition to the list left me wondering what could possibly compel us to skip it in the first place.
This is the one film that dives in head first with the hard questions for which there are no easy answers.
I saw this for the first time on TV when I was a child.
I remembered liking it a great deal-I think it was the first time I'd seen Liza Minelli.
I watched it first and fell completely in love with it.
This other woman discovers and exploits Delilah's knowledge, first on a small then on a very large scale.
I first saw this film on the big screen about 20 years ago at a now-defunct repertory cinema in Chicago.
Playing a tenderhearted maple syrup saleslady who first employs Miss Beavers, and later befriends her, Miss Colbert adds a distinct touch of class to the film.
I first bought her Liza with a Z CD to listen in the car.
As I've mentioned, the first segment is the best; but Woody's sexual take on the classic B-movies of the 50's isn't far behind at all.
I knew of this sequence before watching the film, and I was afraid that Woody might not have been able to carry it off, but now I really don't know what I was worried about; Woody is, like in the first sequence, at his best in the scene.
The highlights for me include the climactic (err, maybe pun intended) end sequence showing the inner workings (with Tony Randall and Burt Reynolds present in the control room) of intercourse; the faux game show involving sexual questions (and yes, that is Regis Philbin) with a truly belly-laugh of a finale involving a Jewish mother; best is the Gene Wilder sheep scene, which was my favorite when I first saw the film as a kid.
TV programme; and, best of all, the final sketch where Woody is a sperm about to be fired into a woman on a first date.
This was the first time I have seen it since I was 13 and I am amazed at how well the film still holds up.
Anyway, I remember that I was impacted, I fell in love with Liza that very first time, what a woman, Energy, Charisma, strength, voice.
With Woody taking a small role (literally) as an anxious sperm awaiting for his first and only mission, the segment is silly, yet true enough to almost be worthy of inclusion in a basic biology class.
It is curious that Woody would eventually embrace stylistics that he had first found so easy to ridicule.
Also Carradine's mad scientist who brags that he was the first to discover the correlation between masturbation and political careers (how true)!
In the first Allen plays a court jester who uses an aphrodisiac to seduce a queen (Lynn Redgrave).
The only reason why I picked it up in the first place was because of its cover.
I have read the other posts and say they concentrate on too many things besides first person viewing.
I "heard" a lot of the same comments when "Evil Dead" first hit the scene, but they were smaller in volume due to the inability of a--holes to be able to post their remarks everywhere!
All of the characters either fell face first into their stereotypes or were unrealistic beyond belief.
Zara Light, his minion, does not seem to be an important character at first.
OK, first of all, I consider myself to be a fan of B Movies, so I shant write this as if I actually intended to enjoy the film in the least.
But rent Predator first.
This was one of my first "Disney Midquel" experiences, the very first being the Fox and the Hound 2.
The thing about the first 'Bambi' was that there was very little dialogue, letting the drama (or humour or whatever) in the animation speak for itself.
And finally, the fact that 'Bambi II' is set _during_ the first film doesn't do anything to help the drama, as we know that Bambi must survive any danger he faces, which is more than a little cheapening.
And hey, toddlers will probably pay attention to this one much longer than the first.
In the sequel, there are five or six funny bits in the first fifteen minutes alone.
"Bambi II" is about the long unexplored gap of the first "Bambi", covering the events between his mother's death and his growing up to adulthood.
Fortunately, Bambi will find some support from his friends, Thumper (Brendon Baerg) and Flower (Nicky Jones), but he'll also have to meet his soon-to-be rival, the mean deer Ronno (Anthony Ghannam), for the first time.
Brian Pimental (one of the writers of the 90s classics "Beauty and the Beast" and "Aladdin") takes his first chance as director giving life to this story and he doesn't disappoint.
Most of the current direct-to-video sequels by Disney have distinguish themselves for a considerably lower quality in the art department, but "Bambi II" is truly an exception, as it seems that the animators really tried to stay true to the first film's style (although of course, there were some modernizations), as even some backgrounds were reused to keep the same art direction.
Without modern slang or self-referential phrases, the cast gives an effective (and welcomed) sense of continuity between this film and the first "Bambi".
The use of a couple of pop ballads may prove damaging on the long road, as while the songs are really good, they take away that atemporal characteristic the first film had and will definitely make the movie outdated a lot sooner than expected.
The sequel answered the questions I didn't know to ask as a kid about the first movie.
The animation is superb, and you can tell there was a huge amount of effort into making the scenery as great as the first one.
This sequel returns all the original characters from the first one and they all play off each other nicely.
However, although "Bambi 2" is quite better and more "logical" than most Disney sequels, it suffers from the same "syndrome" of the rest of Disney sequels: it doesn't fit well on the first one's story.
I'm sure everyone can remember the first time they saw Bambi, I'm also sure that most of you have cried while watching Bambi, it's one of Disney's most touching films.
Disney didn't try to use all the same old jokes and funny lines from the first movie.
I'm an 18 year old guy, and I watched Bambi for the first time when I was 3 years old and I still remember how sad I felt when his mom died.
I would definitely advice others to get this movie, even if you have not seen the first one.
lol) Even if it is very child like in manor, I felt just as touched by it as I was by the first one.
When I first saw that they were making a new Bambi movie, I was really torn.
That was one of the most wonderful things about the first movie ...even more than sixty years after it's release, the songs were so well written that they sound just as good now as they did then.
(3) Retain some of the same soporific and uninteresting elements that made star's first "comedy" a success, but this time fold in some of the "dumb" humor that was prevalent in such concurrent "kiddie comedy" series as "Full House" and "Family Matters" and gear it toward the older set.
So if you're smart, and I know you ARE, please - DON'T put this show on DVD, especially since you recently stated the sales of Newhart's first "comedy" series on DVD were below par - thank goodness - and that more contemporary and MUCH funnier comedy series of yours like "The Simpsons" and "My Name is Earl" on DVD ARE selling!)
Now, I'm not saying the shows were identical by any means, but they share a lot more than you would think at first glance.
Audiences knew Bob from his Grammy winning comedy album, guest appearances on every variety show of the day and his two sitcoms: the first being a standard gentle comedy from the early sixties and the more famous and beloved one from the 1970s filled with winking innuendo, and was pretty racy by television standards, even though Dr. Robert Hartley and his beautiful wife Emily were married.
Also, the characters that first season were more pedestrian and the alternating heartwarming/difficult story lines flip-flopped between borderline 1950s trite or 1980s mean!
It is so breathtakingly unexpected, yet perfectly fitted, it's almost impossible to think that it wasn't somehow planned from the first episode!
Bob Newhart followed his first series becoming an Inn Keeper in Vermont.
Between the downtown setting of the first show & the country setting of this show, Bob Newhart never missed a beat.
Sorry, I don't see how the first half and second halves of this film tied together.
While in the first half of the film he seems to know exactly who/what he wants - in the second half of the film he is lost & confused, frightened by his Desire.
The first half takes place mainly in the city and the second half is mainly jungle.
Now this may be a problem on my behalf, but I'm not really sure I completely understood the link between first half and the second half of the film.
This is an unusual film, as the first part is treated naturally, the second, with its own credits, is a haunting fantasy.
The first half of the film is relatively straightforward and rooted in reality, as a soldier stationed in the jungle goes on leave to a bustling city and falls in love with a young man who lives and works there.
All sense of time and space, is swallowed by the jungle, and implicit politics of the first half are turned inside out in the second half; it is literally cat and mouse, with the possibility that the cat may want to be eaten by the mouse, or vice versa.
To paraphrase a description by director Weerasethakul it's like "a silent film for the first people on earth".
I wished I would have paid more attention to Weerasethakul "Mysterious Object At Noon" the first time I had the chance, he has a talent for experimenting with narrative and style that is missing in many films endlessly praised these days.
It is very slow moving though, the first hour will give you no hint of the second half (other than a few visual ones, look at the various statues in the backgrounds, etc), but for the bold and the patient, there is lush hypnotic reward to be had.
The visual impact of this part is astonishing - the tiger appearing for the first time, the branches shaken by the wind, a tree lit up by fireflies: the beauty of the imagery is almost epic.
Someone decided to cut some action and plot points into the beginning of the movie, giving away most of the story line in about the first 5 minutes.
So first it confuses you and then it puts you off.
The problem with this movie is summed up in the very first scene where Rubin " Hurricane " Carter fights Emile Griffith for the world welterweight championship in 1963 .
I spent the first 15 minutes laughing so hard I just about died.
This is Cena's first major role and unless they make an official CRITTERS remake, I don't see him doing any more movies.
Looking over the posted comments here regarding this one, I can't help but feel that Television has wrecked havoc with the taste buds of most viewers- because MIGHTY PEKING MAN, more than anything else, reminds me of an episode of a really bad television show (take your pick, from day first to this- and they're still being cranked out with mind-numbing regularity); nothing more, nothing less.
Go watch the first tree you find down the road, and that's Cena's performance in a nutshell  dialogues: ... movie's in dire need of some irony, but like I already pointed out, it tries to be serious.
Also being a Marine, I was at first blown away by how pathetic the "Marine" background footage was that they gave Cena.
first.
At first glance you might think this wouldn't be a Paul film, but when you consider my love for picnics and the outback, maybe you'll realize this has many of the ingredients i love in a movie.
I was skeptical at first - the idea of a computer virus that can also infect people seemed a little ludicrous to me.
Although it's been years since I read the story the first time, the differences between the novel and the movie are humongous.
'so you're saying that the software virus has become a real virus that can kill people - that may be medically possible but not possible from my system'   'i'm having to write some new virus software of my own to trap it - it may take some time'  'but it's not going after software, it's killing people'  watch out for the 'i'm into virology' love moment and perhaps first ever film plot to feature death by braille keyboard
There is a lot about this film that is cheesy, especially in the first half.
1898 Ociee Nash sounds like a California Valley Girl, the adult actors literally sound like they refuse to even try, and it looks like the editor took whichever the first shot they finished was and just threw it together, cutting only sufficiently enough to look like it was planned.
If that's all you need then tune in, but when it first aired in America, few did, and it ranked 152nd out of the 156 original series produced for network television in the 2005-06 season Â and was then dropped after eight episodes.
I mean, a two color musical, the first ever made for Warner Brothers!
It's funny, and I laughed, but only the first time.
The first half an hour was one of the most boring i have had to face since i've started watching movies.
The action even starts early, no waiting an hour for the monster's first appearance.
I really wasted forty-three minutes of my life watching the first half of this crap, highly indicated for torturing enemies.
As the first movie I know it managed to combine some of the best elements of genuine german film-making and big Hollywood cinema.
Carlito says he wants to go straight and lead a clean life and win back his estranged wife and child... but insofar as Mike and Carlitos are back into the drugs and whores on his first day out of prison...
This may be unfair because we only watched the first 25 minutes of this movie.
I am the kind of person who NEVER turns off movies I've paid for, but this was a first.
The viewer can decide what sort of leauge it is.First things first,some reviews have given the impression that the bad girls/innocent boy scene is more graphic than what it is.It's a scene that's more like 50% visual-50% imagination.The newspaper in the film states that the young man was attacked,it doesn't use the r word.Some reviewers are stating an act happened that the law says is not possible.At least that was the law when I was an adolescent more than 40 years ago and spent time researching important information like that,I'm still trying to figure it out.
I came along this movie and at first the cover was pretty cool and it had Gary Busey in it.
Female Yakuza Tale is my first foray into "Pinky Violence".
And if anyone wonders where "Star Wars: Episode One" has got their racing theme from just look at FGP :) In the racing scene you first have an outstander that want to be racing in his own machine.
OK first off this is a bad film.No way putting that more straight forward.This movie has no story,no good characters,no good dialogue,nothing cool to wow,the effects are the same effects we've seen in zombie films of the 70 and 80,and this film also had special effects on a computer that looked completely fake.This terrible amateur film that never should have seen the light of day.Also this film has a terrible soundtrack.And to end my tyrant of hate for this films let me end with this that i hate that people don't understand what make a good,fun,scary and entertaining film.You have a good story,fun characters that you invest with,good effects not sloppy things like in this film,and slow moving zombies.Zombies shouldn't be running or walking like orcs like from the damm Lord of The Rings films i mean Jesus.Watch Night Of the Living Dead,Dawn of The Dead also the remake,Day Of the Dead,Land Of the Dead and Shaun Of The Dead.Also Zombie 2.These are zombie films not piece of garbage and just to take it as a B movie is not right.Its not even that funny its over the top nonsense.
I didn't look at all the votes only the first ones and those said it was good.
The first thing you notice is the acting (or lack of it).
So, one day, Wong is a sweet cabaret dancer and the next she's expected to carry out a plan for murder--and at first she agrees wholeheartedly.
One of Anna May's first vehicles upon her return to the U.S. was DAUGHTER OF THE DRAGON, which was also one of the first screen adaptations of a Fu Manchu story from Sax Rohmer's long-running series of books.
This 85-minute film was intriguing for the first half hour.
(They never said his first name.)
Anyway, in this first segment that plays out like a longer boring version of 'Tales From the Crypt", Jessica Valdemar (Adrienne Barbeau, of "Swamp Thing" and "Escape From New York" fame, and NO I will NOT even mention "Maude" it was a horrid horrid show) wants to off her dying sugar daddy with the help of her hypnotizing Docter lover only to have the old coot come back.
The first half of the film blew me away!
I didn't know who I wanted to slap out first, Him or his cutesy little son who never got dirty inside a supposed harsh and un-human environment of a concentration camp.
The first half was set around the town square.
The first hour of the movie was terribly boring I was waiting for the movie to end.
The first half of the film contains little more than over-acted clowning.
I only hope that young people, facing for the first time this page of our History, will prefer to read books and watch documentaries or, if they like modern movies, Spielberg's "Schindler's List".
At first, I thought it might be interesting, but after the rather hard-to-follow introduction, it just kept going down in my view.
The script I'm sure disappeared on the first day of shooting, the acting is even worse and the special effects look if it had a budget of a couple of pounds.
Why they made this sequel is anyone's guess, the first one was not exactly a huge hit or anything.
Well they go in pursuit and go through some jungle adventures and some traps and the movie has the same fast pace as the first movie.
Where the first film had the director of The Guns of Navarone and the original Cape Fear, J. Lee Thompson, to keep things professional enough, this has to settle for the director of The Black Hole, Gary Nelson (with 'additional scenes directed by Newt Arnold'), who is singularly unable to motivate his cast and crew.
I can see the first film as a parody of the INDIANA JONES series, but this one just bad because... well, it's bad.
But if your looking for an old-fashioned adventure romp, even like those in the same league as its predecessor KING SOLOMON'S MINES, your find yourself yawning after the first "action" scene unfolds.
When campers pick on him, we root them on and I really wanted him to be the first to die.
What made the first film effective was that Angela, who got picked on the very same ways Alan does in this film, doesn't deserve it.
The killings were basic repeats of the original primarily the first killing.
I first watched this movie when I was about five years old (already at that time it was old) and I've seen it many times since.
poor dialogues, poor acting and very very poor makeup... the first 10 minutes can't mistake you, it's going to be that bad!
The first thing that gave me a hint that this movie was going to be bad, was the fact that the so-called jokes and humorous situations, were completely unfunny.
Felissa Rose, who originally played Angela in the first movie, came back reprising her role.
On the other hand, if you are sensitive, please refrain from watching 'Return to Sleepaway Camp', because it's a major disrespect to the first film and it hurts a lot to see a sequel that is so incredibly inferior in every single way.
I really like the first three.
Both Felissa Rose (as the shy, confused teen) and Pamela Springsteen (as the one-liner-spouting 'moral' killer she'd eventually transform into) were both great fun in the Angela role and helped make the first three films very enjoyable.
His first gig goes really bad.
The film's pacing and plot change gears so often and so poorly watching it is like riding with a student driver first learning on a standard transmission car.
And that's the first 35 minutes of the film!
I'm not planning on summarizing this movie, but I just want to say that whoever is thinking of buying this should consider renting it first, it was a disappointment On a bright note, the acting was very well done
I remember first seeing this movie at a showing at Rockefeller in Oslo, Norway.
When I first heard of this film and around the time I have heard of The Coen Brothers, I had no idea this film was directed by them.
This is my first time seeing this film so I need to see it again sometime.
And the first word is "Of."
So after the first half-hour, An Everlasting Piece runs out of steam and attempts to reach the finish line with smoke and noise.
Luckily, 4 years later, first time writer-director Terry Loane's "MICKYBO AND ME" (2004) filled the gap with style and higher production values despite being made on a fraction of EVERLASTING PIECE's budget.
Ever since I watched it the first time as a 7 year old, I have loved this movie.
It was a dance film first, developed character story second.
Where was the same Kid & Play that I remembered from the first House Party?
Due to his death, he brings nothing new to the table, yet this entire sequel seems to be focused around those few short words that he used in the first film.
When the ultimate PAJAMA JAM finally does occur (one hour into this short film), we are hit with an barrage of repetitive scenes of aged rappers and comedians from the original who do nothing but repeat their lines, actions, and emotions from the first.
In House Party 2, I do believe that the sound guy was extremely drunk or possibly working his first day in the booth.
After the first twenty minutes of this, it because increasingly annoying to the point of insanity.
Acting on par with that of my first play in elementary school.
I first saw this movie when i was 11 years old, and it was love at first sight.
The DVD double disk version brought me right back to the first time I saw "BjergkÃ¸bing grand prix" (as it is called in Denmark), in the cinema.
The time of Detective Riley's first appearance in the movie was identified as March 1965, slightly more than a year after the Beatles first appeared on the Ed Sullivan show, shocking most adults with their not-quite-shoulder-length hair.
I thought this movie was stupid when I first saw it when I was 14.
The first time was funny, shocking when you first see it.
After hearing nothing but praise I finally got to see the first season of Deadwood.
Meryl Streep is invisible in a role for the first time that I can remember, and truly gives the appearance of phoning in her role.
Were it not for Meryl Streep playing the quintessential Jewish Mother (reminded me of my Grandmother) I probably would have turned it off after the first 3 hours.
When I first heard of this movie I couldn't wait to rent it because the previews made it sound hilarious.
I was enjoying it for the first 20 minutes, and then I was put to sleep.
I first saw this when I was at Universitet i Oslo and I went to the film festival in about 1990.
Caught this on PPV, and was bored out of my skull from the first 10 minutes!
One point for having Sonny Chiba in it (there are other elements in this movie that show up in "Kill Bill," in whose first volume Chiba has a small honorific role).
An example being the sequence at the girls house after the first date to the bar, which was rather lame as far as the story and especially the acting goes.
It's high time to stop living in the first half of the last century.
Adam Resurrected is a first rate bore.
I remember when this came out it was the first kung fu film ever seen around our way and we were all excited about seeing it for sure .Although the action was mediocre at best it gave us our first taste of kung fu and our first taste of bad dubbing as well as bad film making or more precisely the way Chinese people were making films at the time .
I remember seeing it when it was first released, but seeing it again as an adult revealed lots of details:  1: Look at the eyes of the moose when the main caracters are watching tv.
This is not a great film, and certainly not a worthy sequel to the hysterical first film.
The lack of any other characters from the first is a killing blow to this film.
I thought the film would be good first 10 minutes in but after that it became more and more painfully obvious this one was going to blow.
Van Wilder 2 does not have the character 'Van Wilder' from the first film in any scene.
What is notable about this film is that it is not only bad, but it is as bad in relation to the rather low quality first film as this fact would imply.
Van Wilder 2 is a clear cross between the first "Van Wilder", and the classic '80s college frat film "Revenge of the Nerds".
I laughed at the first few sex jokes, but by the end of the movie, I was really tired of hearing crude jokes.
I enjoy Kal Penn, and was hoping that he'd be able to continue his humorous Taj character from the first film.
The plot was very, very similar to the first film.
Everything that made Kal Penn of "Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle" so memorable in the first "Van Wilder" has been sacrificed and Penn cannot rival Reynolds' comic timing.
Like its predecessor, "Van Wilder 2" does feature a collegiate setting, several bare-breasted babes, binge drinking aplenty, risquÃ© sexual epithets, with a scatological skit or two, but nothing like the crude shenanigans in the first movie.
The first time it's pretty funny, the thirtieth time not so much.
The most amusing scene comes somewhere in the middle, and that's just because it's ripped of from the first one.
As much as I enjoyed Kal Penn in the first Van Wilder (and Harold and Kumar), he isn't given much to work with here.
There are completely nonsensical subplots thrown about that reference secondary characters that you forgot were introduced in the first place, a silly competition that never makes any sense and an embarrassing turn by the bulldog that made his infamous scene from the first "Van Wilder" look like high art.
Not only is it not funny at all, but again there's the completely stupid British stereotypes flying around as if people even found them funny the first time round.
Just whistle the first few notes of the tune and people above twenty whistle along.
I admit, I've never been shot in a battle, so I cannot tell what a person would normally do under these circumstances, but my wild guess is that having sex with a comrade (while the enemy soldiers are searching around) would not be the first item on the list.
My personal favorites were the first one and the one where they go to Japan.
This is a terrible film and this was obvious by the first scene.
The first ones?
I was 12 when I first watched this and I thought it was awful then as well.
I saw the first time as a kid, and I can still watch it over and over again without any loss in pleasure.
The first two movies were cute, the third was...blech, but when a movie stars Hulk Hogan.... slow up on that, you've already lost all the money that you put into this flop; and then some.
Alizza is out with her chimp, and she runs into Spike, played by the always good acting Bruce Willis, and for the first time, you hear him talk.
okay this is a very funny show i remember when i first saw it i could not stop laughing but i after a while i had hear all the jokes and it was starting to get lame.
I just bought this and watched it again for the first time in 10 years, such great memories, it is truly a timeless piece of art by Caprino.
Plot comes first, it seems, when others write.
Bad in ways you would want to eject the tape during the first 20 mins.
Pioneer work, first rate stop motion animation.
Within the first five minutes of the film, I was able to predict the editing.
First I will admit, I did not watch the whole mini-series all the way through and jumped around bit after the first part because I was so disappointed.
I would have preferred that they had just made a 2 hour movie perhaps compressing the first two books, than the radical changes and alterations that were made for the mini-series.
Now I'm not a fan of Le Guinn, I've only read the first 'Wizard' book, not even the series.
I first read the Earthsea books by Ursula K. LeGuin back when I was probably about 9 or 10.
On the other hand, things that aren't do, because if everybody's first impression would be their most lasting, it would not be a good one.
So the hype was there to provide this good first impression to buffer what was to come.
But for the first half hour or so, I couldn't make heads or tails over what some of these people were saying.
3) The witch of Ten Alders, Ged's first teacher is not a motherly good witch type.
Two-thirds through last night's show--the first half of EARTHSEA--I muttered to my wife, "This is so bad."
His desire to impress arises from his interactions with a witch's daughter, leading to his first summoning of the shadow (not to mention the fact that the daughter plays a key role later in the story).
2) There is absolutely no sex in the book, but you get a nice bedroom scene in the first 5 minutes of the movie.
Michael did it first and Hollywood thought it was such a good movie, they packed it with so called top stars and remade it with bigger special effects.
At first it's very entertaining to pick out all of the production bloopers, and make fun of the horrid acting (including a person making a "squak" noise for Hulk's parrot instead of having the parrot actually squak.)
At first I thought that the movie was a creation of my own tired, over-imaginative mind; OK this is a dream, I'm dreaming this, I can handle this, I ought to lay off the peanut M&Ms.
OK first off, I would like to say that Hulk Hogan has appeared in some amazingly bad films since he became famous.
Anyway the movie was the first for the director and I am happy that he at least put himself out there and made the movie.
After just watching this film for the first time, I have decided that not only do I want my money back, but I want the one hour and forty five minutes of my life back.
First things first, Sly Stallone is NOT funny.
One of the few movies I was tempted to leave after the first twenty minutes.
The plot is poor, there's some crap about a zombie cult which in a way exonerates the racists & what they are doing, the character's are poor, the dialogue is rubbish with every other word being a profanity because that's as imaginative as the writers can be & the film never elaborates or builds on it's central premise & the issues & ideas it first brings up.
We will not watch another of his films without reading reviews more carefully first!!
My brother and I watched the first 15 minutes of this movie and both decided it was boring and we were getting nothing out of the movie, yet we decided to give it a while longer to see if it got any better.
Then about 5 minutes later she makes out with a girl on who's experiencing her first trip on ecstasy for about 5 more minutes.
Kate is told by Dr. Barker that her Great Great Grandfather was a direct descendant of Countess Elizabeth Bathory & that she must accept her ancestral blood drinking heritage, at first Kate is understandably reluctant to believe what she is being told & thinks everyone is crazy.
At first Kate refuses to give in to the Brotherhoods tactic's but how long can she hold out with the constant bombardment of brainwashing?
Proulx's writing style, while unique and engaging for athe first hundred pages, quickly becomes cloying and irritating in the last 200.
And I'm glad this was not the first one I saw.
The first 20 to 30 minutes is bearable then this movie is LIKE a DRAG!
It is at this point, around the 8 minute marker, that this little short finally feels like its taking off the ground but by the time you end your first laugh, our hero is ducking behind the big 8 Ball and "The End" is scribbled across the screen.
as soon as he gets tortured for the first time and they take his sense of taste away the viewer instantly knows what that is: his senses.
While Saw (at least the first one) had an intelligent twist to the whole thing, this movie tries to disguise the whole torture thing with a social commentary, that just doesn't work ...  What I didn't know, but read here on IMDb, is the fact, that this was based on a novel.
At first, she seems like the perfect older mentor for robin, as she enjoys spending time with her after school and showing her how to bake and do other rather useful things.
The first thing I thought after seeing this movie was "How is this possible that 'The Believer' actually won a price at the Sundance Filmfestival????"
The first 5 minutes is all I recommend you sit through, as it is the only thing that contains anything related to a plot, and you get to sit through a rockin' song!
well thats my first review, you can guess!!
A soulless and oddly voyeuristic white boy's visit to the South Side Â seemingly for the first time Â "Crips and Bloods: Made in America" offers few insights and much editorial gimmickry in an extended, ninety-three minute rock video which ultimately concludes that yes, THEY are human.
The first 20 minutes of this film is fighting, for absolutely no reason.
This is how they put the first bomb in WTC and carried through their second assault.
Terry is suspicious about his neighbor from the first time he sees him, though for no real reason except overexposure to news media.
In addition to this, in the scene where Joana and Ian first met, the former said:"pwede ba tayong magpakuha ng stretcher?"
CSI has been my favorite show since it first aired.
Some scenes that are supposed to be serious, comes out like the first read-through of the script, except that they're actually on set wearing costumes.
You've just ruined your first western - arguably the easiest movie genre to produce, direct, star in, and market.
Even my own first self-rejected and childish screenplay was better than this!
1) FOOLS RUSH IN, and that's because I'd had NO sleep the night before and shouldn't have been there in the first place.
Just from slightly different angles, but it was amusing when we first saw the exterior of the police station, and then later the cop is driving to the Natascha McElhone's apartment and WOW, it's the same building.
I even stomached stuff like DAY OF THE DEAD back when it first came out and people were hurling in the aisles.
The number of bloopers is just astonishing SPOILER**Just as a for instance: When McElhone rushes into the psychiatric ward of the hospital to talk to Dorff (with no explanation WHY he's in a psychiatric unit), is directed to his room "first door on the left," she is instantly there, finds him having a full-on seizure (with no medical people in attendance, mind you), and suddenly -- when she, oh, so frightfully conveniently gets a phone call -- NOW she's got to go out the door onto a stair landing and through yet another doorway before she's back in the same corridor!
Usually one can at least learn something from a genuinely bad movie (which this is) but with this one, for the very first time, I wanted to go back to my film rental store and demand my $3.50 back on general principles.
I'm glad I didn't follow my first impulse to shut the show down at the end of the "first reel" 20 minute period, because I can quite honestly report about this disaster of a movie: Dreadful!
Fear dot com wasn't his website, and the relevance of the girl, his first victim was unclear.
But then after the first major death scenes and Dorff decides to check out the website himself, the movie starts to go downhill.
(though I don't think that there's anything to spoil here...)   I really don't know, how could I force myself not to turn this movie off after the first 20 minutes or so.
In the first 1-2 minutes, I was hopeful, i thought, that it can't be a bad movie, because it has Udo Kier in it!
In the first scene, the man who gets hit by the train, first off, he was clear of the train, pressed against the wall, but suddenly for no reason he leaps in front of the train at the last minute.
He was also one of the first to pack his films with gratuitous sex and violence, and you have to give him credit for that.
It's not a badly made film - in fact the acting is first rate, and the photography quite stunning - the major problem is the sheer drudgery of it all.
Vigil's greatest value may be as a study in Vincent Ward's development, which burst open to reveal his wonderful talent in the remarkable gem, The Navigator, two years later, the first of some first-class movies from New Zealand, such as The Piano, Whale Rider, and of course, The Lord of the Rings.
Our favorite looney tune is cruising somewhere on the pacific ocean, finally hitting some beautiful peaceful island... until a Japanese soldier comes up and they have a fight, first on the ground, then up in the air.
Through the first third or so Kid Breslin wasn't really funny much at all.
Because it's like gazing at a mirror which people living in a insular country like Japan lack and no matter how exaggerated or bad or untrue the stereotype may seem for the first glance, there is still something that holds true in it, something that reminds of part of self that we've been succeeding at hiding from ourselves.
You begin two people who at first don't like each other, but then grow close, but never quite fall in love.
I do understand what it was trying to say, but I just think that the whole of the first half should've been done with much more attention to the detail of the characters' feelings and dug deeper into their emotions further.
The film tries to drive some meaning into the reasons for these two to be out there in the wild for emptiness in significance of their own lives, but the cultural complications are brushed aside because the filmmakers do not quite get why there is any of that sort of experience in the first place for these characters who should not have had any need to spend any time out there at all.
The first part of it was boring as hell, then the second half was just plain God damn depressing.
The "death scene" did not even seem convincing, at first I thought the guy was playing and going to pop up and scare her or something.
It was only after I did some research on-line and read other reviews, that someone said it's dangerous to dive head first into a "billabong."
That character just dies awkwardly after diving into a shallow pond head first while the story was a positive note.
I am Australian, I'll just clear that up first.
The main flaw of such crappy film is that, Sandy and Hiro should have never met each other this way in the first place!!
'The Situation' is one of the first movies about the Iraq war and is not a bad one, but not a good one either.
This is a difficult film to review as it's really the first of it's type.
Norm starts to put the squeeze on the two blackmailing sleaze balls by first planting a bomb in their car, thats not powerful enough to kill them, just to get their attention and then somehow gets involved with Lucinda.
There's so many false deaths in "Blackmail" where we're lead to at first believe that the person, like Norm, that was killed can suddenly and without any explanation what so ever just magically comes back to life that you start to wonder to yourself if even your alive or dead by the time the movie is over.
I saw an advanced screening of this movie and it definitely isn't as good as the first one with The Rock (Dwayne Johnson).
The first one was a really good movie.
I watched this movie out of curiosity, because i liked the first one.
If you liked the first one too, then you'll be disappointed with this one and it has nothing to do with the first one so I wouldn't buy this movie if I were you unless you find it on the clearance or sales rack.
I really liked the first of the new Walking Tall movies starring The Rock.
"Walking Tall: Lone Justice" updates the main characters from the first one without probing into the treacherous sidewinders that provided support to the villains.
This film is ostensibly about the overfishing of sharks and what that may mean for shark populations and marine ecology, but within the first few minutes of the film you realize that "Sharkwater" is largely about writer/director/producer Rob Stewart and how heroic and unique he fancies himself to be.
One of the first sequences is a long shot of a bronzed, shirtless Stewart strolling along a tropical beach, fresh from a snorkel, while the narrator (Stewart, naturally) describes how he's always loved sharks, always been fascinated by them, blah blah blah.
The first half hour of the movie serves as a broad introduction to the theme of "sharks".
I can only figure that they were in too much of a hurry to use a tripod, because the constant blur does't add anything to the dramatic impact of the film after the first few minutes.
In your first day in the Philippines you will effortlessly be able to experience all of the above, except you will not be dealing with kidnappers.
This is one of 5 Chaplin that are on the first DVD of Chaplin's Essanay Comedies.
It's like the first five minutes of Chaplin's later Essanay short A WOMAN--but instead of then transitioning to a plot, this film just stays stuck in slapstick mode.
Chaplin's first park comedy for Essanay is a rehash of more of the same we've seen before in his park comedies for Keystone.
The screenplay is the first major flaw in this movie; it didn't fleshed out the characters into believable human beings.
I first saw this movie when I was about 7 and I really quite enjoyed it!
"Flowers in the Attic" was the first of her books I read and I was watching the VH1 TV show "I Love the 80's" and they mentioned that this was made in 1984.
I saw this movie when it was first released and I was so excited about it because of the profound effect the books had had on me.
This is a fine, above-average first effort from director Jill Sprecher, who wrote the screenplay with her sister Karen.
I gave the first four books very high ratings on Amazon, though they disturbed me greatly, and in a way, I hate them for that.
The first half of the film is feverish, and weaves us into a plot involving a wife who sets up her husband to get murder so she can elope with her lover.
Sadly, any energy or suspense in the first half of the film dissolves into a slow-paced, lethargic love story that distracts greatly from livelier main plot.
At first he thinks that all they really want is money, because they use him to loot a savings account left behind by his father -- one that holds $ 75,000, a most princely sum -- but eventually he figures out that they want him to be a mule for a terrorist bomb attack.
Most of the time the cell phone tormentor is speaking Tagalog, or a mixture of Tagalog and English, and the subtitles for that seem to fly by ... meaning, once again, that it is impossible to grasp the size of the problem facing Adam ... because we know after the first four times that the caller says he is going to kill the mother and the sister that this is a bad hombre.
Was Madonna's crotch shot in that first chase scene intentional?
When I first realised the quality of this film, I wondered whether it was a form of self-parody.
At first I hated the Fanny performance - and then I remembered that I hated Fanny, so she was also perfect.
When I first saw the cast list of the two movie 1988 Little Dorrit, I was really excited and expecting a sumptuous feast of Dickens.
I would imagine that he cringed when he watched this for the first time.
The conversation between Adam and the girl about her not wanting a "Muslim" baby made no sense and was out of place considering their first conversation on the phone.
first of all this movie is terribly written, nothing in the storyline holds together and all that "save the world" bull**it is getting a bit tired, the acting is below average, and the special effects are horribly out dated.
Why was it ever made in the first place?
When I first watched this short, I actually was enjoying the new footage and when I saw the reused footage, I was quite dissapointed and when I saw reused footage from another episode, I was even more dissapointed and I think this short is only worth for the first 5-6 minutes and I understand that Curly was ill during this time and I think that Curly was more sick than usual in this short although Curly seemed more healthier in the next two shorts 'Uncivil Warbirds' and 'Three TroubleDoers' although his condition went even more downhill in the two shorts after that.
This film was so dull, that for the first time, IMDb has said my comments were too brief even though I can't think of what else to say.
The first movies in this series all had a focus in Sweden, and in Swedish culture.
When I saw it at a theatre the audience was quiet--at first.
After the first two nude scenes people started to walk out.
The first few minutes are good enough, with a good film score.
The sharks that surrounded them while they were afloat would have ripped them to shreds at the first sight of food - THEY WOULDN'T SWIM AROUND FOR DAYS AND NOT TRY TO EAT THEM.
I wasn't even sure what happened to the man, at first.
The first time I became aware of "Open Water" was driving home one night in 2003 stuck in the usual traffic jam when i noticed a huge bill board advertising the movie.
For the first 25 minutes, I could have been watching my girlfriend and I go through our daily ups and downs.
After watching Saathiya (Shaad's first direction), I had high expectations from this movie.
Okay the plot is okay 2 people want to make it big but can't because they have no money and their scenes at the start are nice but the robbery part is so stupid  How does Rani, Abhishek get the expensive clothes for the first crime?
Kept me yawning through the first two thirds.
For the first half of Legacy it feels like some teen comedy like American Pie (1999) with college kids getting up to various risquÃ© things like one guy filming him & his girl having sex & showing to his friends or a girl jacking a guy off & then rubbing the cum on her fingers over a fat geeky girls lips all set in the usual clichÃ©d sorority & frat house with the usual clichÃ©d character's like the air-headed bimbo, the geeks they pick on & the jock style lads who think about nothing but sex & beer.
When I heard about this movie some time ago, I was the first to admit, this idea has been done before many times, in sketch shows, and cleverly in a Cruel Sea video clip.
The premise could have worked if the irreverence of Crackerjack had been carried through, but it seemed more like a cynical money-spinner with few genuine laughs (some great concepts) and a somewhat rushed story line - a little strange that in the first half hour Robbins convinced a bunch of people he apparently hadn't seen for years to drop whatever they were doing in their own lives and join his quest to live in the past.
When I first saw the trailer for this film, I was excited.
Any evidence of a proper story is left for the last 20 minutes of the film and is so obvious that the audience knows exactly what is going to happen in the first ten minutes.
With a tremendous legacy to Australian comedy with his appearances on the The Late Show and on radio Mick Molloy appeared headed towards a promising movie career with the release of his first film Crackerjack, an enjoyable F.O.W romp with an outstanding ensemble cast and a handful of legitimate laugh-out-loud moments.
The film is at NO point scary, exiting or anything - it starts out "ok" (first 12 minutes) by leading up to something that could be a nice movie - but fails to deliver IN ANY way or form.
It is never explained why the girl is tied up in the first place (she does act like an animal and the audience is left wondering if she were some sort of mentally handicapped kid or a hybrid human-canine, or even a werewolf ...but none of these are ever explored in any depth).
Except for Homar, the rest of the supporting Spanish cast seemed like amateurs doing their first movie.
This movie is the first English language movie for Virginie Ledoyen since "The Beach" and I think it is fair to say that she will always be known as the girl from "The Beach" because she is a bland and boring actress.
Also, Serra uses the camera techniques of 70's directors which is OK at first but when he does this all the time it is distracting and does not serve any purpose except style.
It's a mysterious package with a ringing cell phone (think of The Matrix when Morpheus contacts Neo for the first time).
Fortunately I have seen it first as a (by then openly gay) movie-addict in my twenties, so I could dismiss it as only an embarrassingly bad film.
Since this is pretty psychotic it creeps her out- OK.. we get that in the first 5 minutes.. where is the rest of the idea?
I gave it a 4 for the first minute or so of the movie - after that it's probably a 2 or even a 1.
The excitement of a great robbery plot that takes the viewer in the first thirty minutes of the movie, falls down progressively all along the action slowdowns to finally drawn into inertia.
Well, I happen to own the first stick Wayne Gretzky used as a pro, which - according to this stinker - qualifies me to be Commissioner!
But this was my first Brittany Murphy movie and I'll go out of my way not to see her again.
After all of the hype for this movie, I really thought that it would be good, but the first time I tried watching it I made it through about 15 minutes before realizing I wasn't paying attention to a word they said.
The movie wants to be brisk but it ended up losing the first forty minutes to nothing.
I was predisposed to liking it, because I was a fanatical G&S enthusiast first, but it was a relief to discover that this film was a worthy tribute to their legacy.
It seemed silly at first, but I later discovered that the print had been shown "double system," with separate hour-long reels of 35mm magnetic sound tracks.
The first ten minutes are shock cinema at its finest, but after that it's a more realistic-than-thou, account of an end of the world scenario.
The final scene of the train in motion, suggests, things get better, but as to why is just as mysterious as what caused the catastrophe in the first place.
The last 5 min of the film are the best and are probably worth suffering through the first 108, at least I thought so.
Imagine going to a contemporary art gallery for a reception, and you are the first one to arrive.
In the first scene, a man is murdered in cold blood, and his family seems hardly ruffled by this inconvenience, instead carrying on with the same grim determination that has gripped this film since the beginning of time (or, at least, the opening credits).
Now, first of all, who serves detention at night?
Good thing about this movie is it forced me to register with IMDb , this is my first review comment in life
The first thing we are treated to is the title screen followed by A SHOT OF RUNNING.
at that point we get the first and most exhilarating kill of the movie!
medicine 101. after this starts lover girl's first of fifty million unbearable screams throughout the film.
first off, this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen.
where was the first kid who got killed?
and in the scene after the 2 girls have their first encounter with farmer brown and knock him out by gently tapping his shoulder with a shovel, they wander BACK into the farm house to... well, i don't really know why... to investigate, i guess... they end up in a bathroom where they find news clippings and blah blah blah.
In the first series the main focus the conflict between Swearengen and Bullock over Garret's gold claim, one wants to protect her, the other wants to take it off her.
The first is that in the show there are so many subplots that they end up unresolved and sometimes hard to follow.
The first death, cheesy, gory, I like it but how is he gonna die from his arm being "grated".
Also, you never find out what happened to the first teen that was killed.
Voyager has the strange distinction of being the first Trek series that I didn't like.
The first season wasn't bad, though it did rely on time travel too much, but then the writers got lazy.
Although by the first regular episode they were having power problems (though conveniently and stupidly the holodecks ran off incompatible reactors), potential problems were never really dealt with.
We were supposed to have the first female lead, a female captain which was a wonderful idea, but we got that annoying midget of a woman, with a grating voice-pitch and schizophrenic personality.
This movie is all wrapped up in about the first hour and half.
Let's put it this way: when it was shown on the cinema, it was a tie between the public, because half of them were children who loved the show, ergo they loved it, and the other half were the parents who went with them, and they probably fell asleep after the first ten minutes.
This movie portrays Mewtwo's encounter with humans for the first time, its reaction when its being controlled and its actions after it escapes.
I mean first they acknowledge that fighting is bad, and then they go back to fighting because they have no problem with exploiting these poor creatures.
But one thing is certain: With all the resources given, the movies of Project Greenlight need to get better than the first two.
I didn't see the first season of "Project Greenlight" but I did watch the product of it "Stolen Summer", a mediocre, bland, and safe offering from Damon and Affleck who don't want to take a risk considering their history for risky and edgy indies like "Mallrats", "Chasing Amy", and "Gerry".
Then it's never explained why Kelly falls in love with Tabby in the first place, and we never really get to know Bart outside of his conceptual design as a neat dresser and proper yet friendly guy.
From the first action scene on, and all the way through the laborious tunnel sequences throughout the film to the final scene, the movie shows signs of some of the worst pacing and cohesion in recent memory.
It is amazing how dull the film is for the first 3/4.
They have a camp in the middle of the jungle and the VC attack, right from the first tent.
Sure, these things do happen but its hard for anybody to believe all of them can happen to these related persons at the exact same time.... Actually the film managed to keep me interested for the first 65 minutes or so.
I first watched this film dubbed as American Streetfighter 2 like most of you seemed to have.
It was the bonus movie on the other side of the DVD of the first American Streetfighter film.
Well if you watch American Streetfighter 2, you'll not only notice it's horribly edited, but it seems to be missing numerous scenes, makes little sense, and has nothing to do with the first film.
This is because this is actually the movie "Full Impact" ripped apart with crappy added flashback scenes from the first movie, and called American Streetfighter 2.
In the meantime after losing his job, Jared Taskin has become a bounty hunter, which is displayed in the hilariously terrible first scene of the movie.
However, it looks to me like this is the same actress that played the first murdered prostitute in the movie!
The first and only time I saw this film I was naively expecting something on the "comic duo" lines oft employed by Francis Veber in such films as "La ChÃ¨vre", "Tais-toi", "Les Fugitifs" to name but a few.
If you really liked Kein Ohr Hasen (a better film, watch it first if you can), then you might like this, but otherwise stay away.
I actually had to start this movie twice because I stopped it at the first try after 15 minutes not being able to concentrate on the "storyline"(there actually is not really much of a storyline to begin with).What I am trying to get across is that this is just not a movie that captures you in the first couple of minutes and also this is definitely not a horror movie.
", must have been his first.
The retard should have been treated when he first struck but then the movie would have ended half an hour after it started.
The first half contradicts the back with no hint of resolution offered.
And what in the hell was the telephone doing on the first floor?
The very first thing that turns me off from documentaries are biased perspectives.
(1) One and one-half years (2006) ago one of my first cousins who had been profoundly deaf for at least 25 years had a cochlear implant.
Of course everything breaks into pure hell...  Boll spends some time with the characters first.
That makes everything he does in those first 25 minutes absolutely illegal - stalking; breaking and entering, assault, harassment.
Several of my friends that saw the first tour said it was good, but when they saw the next tour they felt that the Get Back Tour was just a rehearsal for the one in 1993.
This being Bergmans first effort as a film director, it has been criticized for being overly melodramatic.
A well done first try in film-making.
This film is so uncannily like my own high school years, I was half convinced it was a straight up documentary for the first ten or twenty seconds.
The first review I saw on this site about this movie was someone calling it a masterpiece.
The father, whose job is merely a convenient excuse to get the family in the house in the first place, bobs randomly in and out of the movie, saying little and contributing nothing.
When the evil is encountered in the cellar, you will be amazed to find how much its motives for being down there in the first place have absolutely no baring on anything else that has taken place in the movie!
There were at least 10 characters (3 or 4 of them enemy) that had some sort of character development and that takes place in the first 45 minutes of the film.
It was slow at first, but once the first person enters the tunnel you'll feel like you're right there in Nam INSIDE THAT TUNNEL!!!
After watching the first 3 in a two period to see what was so good about the series, I decided to watch this as an off-chance.
I feel like this horrible film tainted my eyes after watching the first 3, which were full of movie magic.
The first half hour was promising, but it rapidly collapsed into a hopeless mess.
I understand that this was TLJ's first feature directing job.
Well , "Rocket Power " was the first in start with this stupid tendency , and maybe for that reason it is the most annoying and boring cartoon of all the time .
Gold the first time, old the second.
Come to think of it, whoever first said that "Strangers" would make a good movie was speaking nothing but truthiness.
This was co-writer Brent Friedman's first screenplay and he went on to do quite a few horror films including the superior SYNGENOR, THE RESURRECTED, NECRONOMICON and TICKS.
I put this on my list with some decent excitement thinking I was going to get a low budget good indy film and after the first shot of Conrad playing mood to show how lonely he was in front of the TV-- well I knew it was going to end in pain... for me.
At first seeming to suffer from amnesia, the stranger has a mysterious quality that comes more into focus when he performs certain miracles.
I WAS SHOCKED......the first thing I thought, "What IF?"
Nothing about will shock you like it wants to, after the first victim is swallowed by the CURSE, you'll know every line, every plot point, everything that's going to happen.
This being director David Keith's first directorial effort I was willing to be a little forgiving in it's production.
In my opinion only Cooper Huckabee performs above expectations and Kathleen Jordan Gregory gives a fine, if a bit over the top, performance as the mother, the first person to be infected.
At first, Zach (Wil Wheaton sadly of Star Trek: The Next Generation fame) and his sister are the only two people in a very religious family that suspect that the meteor that recently fall from the sky is affecting the water in detrimental ways.
When controversial German director Uwe Boll (HOUSE OF THE DEAD) first announced that he wanted to shoot an absolutely uncompromising, blunt and brutal movie about the cruelties of the Vietnam War, not just a few critics shook their heads in disbelief and predicted a major failure on all levels as they just couldn't imagine that infamous filmmaker, who once knocked out four internet bashers in a boxing challenge, to tackle such a serious subject with the needed amount of tactfulness and sincerity.
It's just plain bad and embarrassingly forced silly, without the fun and entertainment level of the first sequel.
The first movie "Basket Case" was still a horror movie, while "Basket Case 2" was more like a horror comedy.
The original BASKET CASE is one of my all-time favorite B-movies, and has been ever since I first saw it as a kid on cable over 20 years ago.
It was a fun watch, though it didn't quite hold up to the grimy urban 'horror' feel of the first movie.
"Part 3" was even more genuinely needless which didn't seem possible after the first sequel!
When I first saw it as a child, I thought it was great too.
I consider myself somewhere inbetween, as this was one of my first Ernest films.
Lets face it, the character got his start in commercials as a rather annoying individual and it was funny to see him torment Vern, but more funny to see Vern get back at Ernest for bothering him in the first place.
Granted if you have seen them I am sure you saw this his first movie.
When I first saw this movie, I didn't think much of it.
I know the man by reputation alone and this is my first venture into his film-making domain.
Initially, the first tunnel is a bit of a disaster.
Then there are a series of ridiculous plot twists that leave us guessing (guessing why we ever watched this in the first place).
I have to admit that nudity would really have helped me enjoy this movie more since the first forty minutes is boring as hell.
Although much of the film (especially the first half) is slow-moving, I wasn't discontent at having spent the time to view it.
They also feel that the FNG's aren't worth a salt unless they've proved themselves in combat, but that's hard to do sometimes as that they'll probably be killed in the first week, so why bother getting to know them.
I saw this film for the first time at the tender age of four...and absolutely loved it.
Well since Rodan, Godzilla and Rodan did it by themselves in Ghidra's first appearance, what's the likelyhood that he can beat all of them?
This was my first experience with one of those Japanese Godzilla movie, but I wasn't too exhilirated about it.
(No one seems to object her joining the group, guess they got tired of the sausage fest)  6 - The good guys (now 3) encounter a fourth acolyte (also a kungfu master) who's kinda mean to them at first, but now he's nice.
For years I been hearing about how original and good is this show, but after watch the first 4 Tv movies I just a found just a few pieces of trash with nothing new except there is anything less science.
The story of sweet home Alabama girl Reese and her desire to divorce her first husband in order to marry JFK, Jr. lookalike Patrick Dempsey is flawed from the first frame.
Her expression is even happier than Ed Wood's in GLEN OR GLENDA when he first tries on an angora sweater!
If only the tightly done and well scripted first fifteen minutes could have continued with the development of Laura's sexual 'awakening!'
Forget all about the first part of the movie.
From the first scene, the film gets right down to business and doesn't really let up until the gripping and downright mortifying ending.
But I don't want to give away too much, although I'm sure most of you will be able to pick up on every little thing that will happen plot-wise after the first twenty minutes.
Within minutes Frank (Edwin Owens) has become the tarantulas first victim, shortly after Gloria (Penelope Windust) has become the second & Dr. Hodgins (Pat Hingle) soon realises what's happening.
The reason, I think is that I know more about and care more about London, and much as the first film was almost gleefully depressing in its portrayal of a dead place under the Conservative party, I know the predictions were wrong.
From watching the first 30 minutes only (or maybe even less I cant recall, but I do know I could not go on any further) I know that the acting is absolutely atrocious, as was the script and the whole set up... Who in the hell distributed this mess?
Too bad that the first "Appleseed" (although not too great in itself) did circles around this utterly meandering story.
I have to say that there were a couple good ideas in it, but its really just a couple: the first one, at the very beginning of the movie, and the last one, let's say the two final minutes.
I watched the first 30 minutes with genuine interest and curiosity, wondering what was going to happen next, and even thinking that this movie was promising, very different from most that I have seen.
The acting and outline of a movie should be put to the very first, and I think the main problem with the movie will not be just an " old piece" but the attempt to be realistic and natural, and the whole thing just get mixed up, I think Harley will be another Sean, But not that luck under the atmosphere of destruction, and nothing to give him but to be yourself, not to be too real, After all you are acting, people rushing into that theater not to see your lives, but to see your understanding of the particular line of the story told by the diversity of all the human beings existing and living in the planet some E.T.
Remember Billy was only fifteen years old and was experiencing his first sexual encounter.
There's SO much wrong with this movie, I barely know where to start first.
Amber then rejects the possibility of an abortion, portraying herself as a caring, nurturing person, but is now ready to deliver a second illegitimate child (after the first, whose father was improperly identified for years).
RECORD's only saving grace is its bright start - the first act is actually excellent and shows the American counterparts how character development and setting the mood are supposed to be done - but, other than that, this is a very poor movie.
Although not the best-ever episode of "Marple" (that honor falls to "A Murder Is Announced", from the first season), "Nemesis" is a very solid, engaging entry in the series.
( By the way , the movie is about a contraceptive gone wrong ) The first half had some light watchable and listenable moments , but the second half was Ufff .... TOO MUCH SHREIKING for my pleasure .
all the time was funny at first, but it became very old very quickly.
Except first song, rest all songs are forced.
Davies is awkward, forced, and pouting as a wealthy New Jersey belle; at first, her character is uninvolved in politics - but, she becomes instrumental in founding the triumphant new United States of America.
This movie was the first zombie movie which i stopped watching because i was bored and resumed later on, just to see that the end sucks too.
Well, first of all the producers might have taken a little more care in providing the correct uniforms for Sister and the others shown.
Judging by the stills on the back of the VHS-cover and based on the narrative during the first half of the film, I would unhesitatingly describe "Delirium" as a crude and misogynistic slasher reminiscent of "Maniac" and "Don't Go in the House".
Whilst the roommate of his first victim teams up with the incompetent police force, the maniac Â Charlie Â gets killed after a failed attempt to make another victim.
The first slasher half is rather exciting, with a couple of truly nasty murder sequences and the most laughably inept police investigation ever, but the second half is painfully tedious and derivative of much better films.
How is it that Defoe was beaten by Liotta the first time, but the second time Dafoe suddenly gets fighting skills and beats Liotta to a pulp?
The first direct to DVD sequel to The Art of War was surprising enough, but this third instalment, featuring the original character from the first two but with a different actor playing him in the shape of the far less charismatic Treach (Today You Die), came out of nowhere.
Liked the DTV sequel to the first Art Of War?
(they stop by the house because it is the first right not the second, huh?)
Overall a flat story with a couple of scares in the first half and a moderately enjoyable ending will leave you wondering why you bothered with The Amityville Curse.
When I first read the "sisters" would become nuns, I was open-minded since it could have provided a way of tightening the story.
The production is much worse than the previous films (at least comparing with the first two movies).
Certainly, this isn't the first time I've asked myself why a film was made - I've seen 'Children Of The Corn VI', but 'The Amityville Curse' is definitely another head-scratcher.
This is the first British comedy - indeed, the fist "British" film of any kind - I have ever walked out of.
About the only things NOT in the first 3-5 minutes of the film were mummies or zombies and I held on---waiting to see if they, too, would be in the movie!
The first entry about Waldemar was Â¨The mark of the Wolfman (1967)Â¨ by Enrique Eguiluz , it was such a box office hit that Jacinto went on filming successive outings as Â¨Night of WalpurgisÂ¨, Â¨Fury of the WolfmanÂ¨ , Â¨Doctor Jekill and the WolfmanÂ¨ , and once againÂ¨The return of the WalpurgisÂ¨, Â¨Howl of the devilÂ¨, Â¨The beast and the magic sword(1982)Â¨ that is filmed in Japan and for the umpteenth time Â¨Licantropo(1998) and finally even directed by Fred Olen Ray in Â¨Tomb of the Werewolf(2004) with Michelle Bauer.
At such a distance it is easy to forget the impact that Naschy's presence as either Daninsky or his werewolf alter-ego made on the movie-going public when it first appeared (proving obviously popular enough to generate the myriad sequels, or variations on the same theme, which followed) for, even if the monster gets a fair work-out here (scenes from this film were actually lifted outright for the abysmal THE FURY OF THE WOLFMAN [1970]!
Ideally, it would never have made it into the video stores in the first place.
*possible spoilers*  Some plot questions to ponder: Upon seeing Charley for the first time in the empty coffee shop, Eban goes over to Charley's table and asks if he can sit there.
When Wittgenstein wrote his famous first philosophical piece the tractacus (sp?)
first of all, this is snipes.
The script is COMPLETELY unrealistic yet it is written to take place in the real-world, the editing and lighting effects are worse than most first projects in film school.
So now, for the first time, my Snipes-Method of film recommendation has failed.
I should first have come here to see these reviews.
I feared that the shaky, blurry, pseudo-documentary, "unconsidered" directing and editing style (first brought to my attention by the Paul Greengrass-directed "Bloody Sunday") might propagate to other films.
Avi (Naseeruddin Shah) cheated on his wife for the first time.
If, perhaps, the filmmakers had re-edited the movie (removing the first day at school business, the Davinci stuff and the ending) and called the movie "Skydiving: And Lots Of It!"
The first few seconds increased my adrenaline four fold â why was I watching this tosh?
So yesterday afternoon I was looking at a blog about faces that are begging to be punched, and while I didn't think too much of it at the time, I kept coming back to it later that night as I watched the latest (and my first) episode of TBS's sh*t factory otherwise known as "My Boys."
With the exception of Gaffigan, who gets a pass because I like his stand-up and he seems to be the only actor on the show who isn't as awkward as a boner-afflicted 14-year-old at a jr high dance, there isn't one person on My Boys who does not, within the first 30 seconds of being on screen, make me want to punch a wall or kick a dog (and i love dogs).
I'm guessing that the guy who plays the loudmouth jackass is probably a monk or a stenographer in real life, because he sure as hell doesn't know the first thing about being a genuine loudmouth or delivering his lines in a way that doesn't sound like he's repeating testimony.
I have just finished watching the first series on DVD and it is easily one of the best TV series I have ever seen.
This prompt sequel to unforgettable STV action film Snake Eater has the same lead star, later Renegade star Lamas, and follows much the same formula as the first film, which is to say it delivers much the same results.
The evil was heaped onto Charlie Strom, Gary Oldman's character, so heavily in the first half of the movie that it's difficult for him to escape from underneath the mountain of badness that he is under even when we see the reasons for his actions, but the good guys in particular, are not as good as they seem.
It was the first slasher movie to include a Santa-suited psycho, before Silent Night-Deadly Night, Psycho Santa and Christmas Season Massacre made the costume a slasher clichÃ©.
His first recording was a song called 'All Shook Up', which of course became a massive hit for Elvis Presley that same year.
Despite loosing about six of their colleagues in the first thirty minutes, the remaining victims fail to acknowledge that there is a maniac stalking the campus.
The first impression which is going to be created in viewers' minds is that why is this film named "Matchbox" ?
'Cuz i was freakin' bored for the first time too!
Nice early touch on how the first toy appears differently to our kid protags and to their mother.
The first thing I noticed is how much Kay Strozzi sucked in this film!
And, to top it off, within the first ten minutes of the film, three different women fainted--talk about a load of malarkey!
At least, don't if you're a kid or if you liked the first Babe.
This one is nothing like the first.
The first Babe felt real; this is a dark fantasy.
The first one was open and upbeat; this is dark.
The first one was kind - kind animals, people, plot; this one is just mean.
This was the first film my brother and sister ever watched and to be frank, what an awful introduction to cinema.
I loved the first one.
But "Babe 2" was the worst sort of sequel - not only was it just disappointingly bad, it actually ruined the pleasure you got from the first film.
One of the greatest thing about the first film was Babe's relationship with Farmer Hoggett.
And in the first movie, Babe the pig had a unique mission, making his triumph truly sweet and heartwarming.
And the first movie dealt with some real-life issues (at least in the animal world), which gave weight to the notions of fate and destiny, which was nicely intoned throughout the movie by the narrator.
The first movie was about Babe's courage and originality.
I had to watch the first movie over again, just to cleanse my palate, but I'm still in mourning.
I found it so painful to watch that I had to turn it off after the first 45 minutes - and I enjoyed "Seven"!
At first Keefer is somewhat sceptical as is his right as the local law enforcement officer but soon has to change his doubting mind when the bodies continue to pile up & he sees the 'terrifying' creature with his own eyes, it's up to Keefer & Annie to save the local residents from becoming fish-lizard creature food!
The doctor refers to it as a "carniverous lizard man of the Triassic age" and says it's a nocturnal eater and light sensitive, which doesn't really explain why the first two attacks take place in broad daylight.
Ashame that the biggest scare was at the beginning, when we get our first close-up of Lizzy, making you hope for more intense scares in the climax.
Shameless asrtoturfing in the comments section, obvious in the first quarter of the film, warranted an IMDb registration.
A program designed to make Vampires not want to drink human blood & be there if they need help or are having trouble, the first step is apparently to 'admit you have a problem' & ends with 'smile, your a winner!'
But if you've got other choices, go there first.)
It would seem that Charlise Theron climbed onto the ugly-Oscar wagon, but Grace Kelly got there first.
Williams is excellent in his first lead role.
A first time offender getting ten years for a small amount of weed.
I did not watch this when it started as it seemed to be vulgar and violent in the first few episodes in the bits and pieces I saw.
In the first part of this chilling opus, an annoying narrator waxes poetically about the vampire culture on earth, as we watch a bunch of half-doped vampires attack some stage extras with toothpicks instead of teeth.
The parents here, along with their victimized daughter, all moved more slowly than postal workers on Valium for the first 1 hour and 50 minutes -- then screamed like Banshees on "Speed" for the final 10.
Despite all its hype in India (may be because it's one of the first times a movie is without songs and all of sentimental flicks here and there), I can't rate this movie at par with Italian, French or Spanish classics.
But still, I will rate this movie good, because it is of one of the first and boldest attempts to revolutionize the trash-can Bollywood stories and movies.
At first, when I saw Black, I was really impressed with the movie and the way Sanjay Leela Bhansali made it.
At first I thought the smart boys in Hollywood remade Bhansali's film.
There are moments of pure magic -- like when Noah, the ten-year-old boy, learns sounds can affect how a spider builds its webs, and when Emma, his five-year-old sister, sets the "spinners" going the first time.
Oh, the kids -- Chris O'Neal and Rhiannon Leigh Wryn -- do a good enough job of acting, especially considering how young they are and it's the first time they've been in front of a film camera.
The first thing is the bad script.
Evolved is so bad that I finally stopped it as the evening wore on because I wanted time for an antidote, something ELSE to watch before bedtime so I wouldn't think my entire day had first been wasted by work and now THIS.
After the first few minutes you will want to slash your own throat.
When one character tells a cannibal "I am going to kill you", the cannibal replies "Not if I eat you first."
Throughout the showing i was surrounded by nothing but drunkards laughing at inappropriate times, this was annoying at first, but by the end, i had joined them...not because the movie was entertaining in any sense, but they seemed to have found the only way to enjoy it, and i wanted to try as well.
I don't know where to begin with this abysmal blunder, first off though (and most obvious) Nicole DuPont CANNOT ACT.
Listening to her botch her lines in an over-exaggerated manner the entire film was simply painful...I WAS CRINGING BY THE END.Not that her lines were any good in the first place, which brings me to point 2, the writing was terrible, and despite the best effort of Ryder Strong, Michael Madsen, and Rachael Miner, the film was intolerable.
At first it starts telling about how we all were doomed cause we ran out of gas.
This movie was so boring from the get go I almost fell into a coma during the first hour or so.
But somehow I found myself losing complete faith this movie due to terrible writing after the first 5 minutes.
Soon, the group fall one by one to these madmen, as their leader is the first to die, leaving them to fend for themselves with little hope of survival.
Michael Madsen, who at first appears to be the leader of this group, has a minor role as the cannibal "Jackal" who whistles towards his quarry before using a two-sided ax to do his damage.
Going into Tooth and Nail, I was excited, Horrorfest is an opportunity to get away from the typical Hollywood narratives and enjoy some good old fashioned gore, and I have to say I was impressed with the first half of the film.
Director Ilkka Jarvi-Laturi was trying to present this as a lighthearted romantic comedy and international thriller, but it was marginal on the first count and a disaster on the second.
It was sort of like watching somebody's first attempt at a video production using CG.
This movie is a major letdown from the first movie.
The first Zenon movie was hilariously kitschy.
The movie is almost saved when Margie (the hilarious anti-hero of the first film) arrives on the scene and makes Zenon's life a nightmare...unfortunately she becomes Zenon's friend, mistake #3.
And oh yeah, they rip off the ending of the first movie, having Protozoa and his band Microbe play a new song, Galaxy is Ours which is alright but weak compared to Supernova Girl.
The first movie was creative and cheesy.
Let me be the first to ask, why was this "zequel" ever made?
To his credit, Altman had been making on average a movie a year for about ten years by the time "A Wedding" was released, and it was the first out-right bad movie he directed.
There's the senile bishop who conducts the wedding, the death of the family matriarch, an unexpected pregnancy and an unexpected love at first sight moment, but there really wasn't any one central point here.
The movie is too long, with a running time of a bit over 2 hours, and while the first hour seemed pretty well paced, the whole concept got a bit tired after that.
I want to be your friend," in "Dillo con parole mie", perhaps the first post-"Kids" movie that doesn't go through the motions of treating an underaged girl's sex drive as being the least bit shocking.
As aunt and niece depart from the boat in the harbor, Stefania first learns about Megghy's plan to lose her virginity with some random guy, because the former girl scout who ditched her troop at the bus station, wants to be practiced for that other first time; with some boy she is actually in love with.
Hasnain Hyderabadwala & Raksha Mistry after copying COLLATERAL and making THE KILLER(2006) remake again This time their film THE TRAIN is a remake of DERAILED a film which wasn't that great in the first place  The film looks similar to Emraan's own ZEHER in fact the promos and also the songs plus the adultery theme is so much ZEHER  The film could be a decent thriller but sadly the film comes too late even the chemistry between Emraan and Sayali Bhagat is bad The sub plot of their daughter is good but the rest film however isn't as engrossing  The problem is predictability and also the feeling of deja vu plus the villain's characterization isn't too convincing and the final twist is predictable too  Direction is okay Music is a winner, especially ZINDAGI NE, MAUSAM, WOH AJNABEE Camera-work is good  Emraan is good in his part and is getting more dependable though the role is too similar to ZEHER Sayali Bhagat is weak while Geeta Basra is better much has a way to go Aseem Merchant irritates Suresh Menon is as usual, Rajat Bedi fills the bill
(1) and (2) are self-evident at first glance.
It seemed at first it would have a plot.
No, HAINES still comes off as a 'Prissy Ham' with none of the charm he showed in SHOW PEOPLE (1928), the first of his films we had seen.
I caught this for the first time today on TCM.
Hmm, which came first...chicken or egg here?
It's a comedy that isn't funny first of all.
This was the first movie I was inclined to leave since "Hoffa" (I fell asleep in that one).
The Butler Adolph Hatler, a weak impersonation of Hitler is funny the first time he shows up... and that's that.
It does start off in a rather amusing fashion, the first seven minutes (which also include the starting credits) promise a funny spoof in the tradition of ZAZ films like "The Naked Gun".
But then the realisation hit me that there is a major difference between ZAZ films and "Der Wixxer": In a ZAZ film much of the slapstick will happen in the background, something which does not necessarily have to be noticed the first time you watch the film but which is funny nevertheless.
When I saw El Charro, the first thought that popped on my mind was that this movie should be named "The Curse of What Could Have Been".
=) The first Exorcist was a masterpiece, but this... donÂ´t see it!
Normally I enjoy movies like "The Silver Chalice"(Paul Newman's first feature), in which actors I usually enjoy show that they, too, can be in movies that stink.
I don't know why we need this movie as a sequel for the excellent first Exorcist.
There is nothing to do with the first Exorcist.
When you see the first one, you will realize there is nothing related to the first one in this movie.
Get the first one and just think there are no sequels for the Exorcist.
So if you don't try to think of it as a horror story it isn't that bad and atleast it gives you some sort of closure to whatever it is that happened to Regan in the first place.
Linda Blair, who did a great job in the first "Exorcist", is just annoying here.
I mean the first movie made a big success.
The first Exorcist movie was sheer cinema magic.
And that was when the first cracks in the band's image as a band of the people, only out there to provide alternatives, appeared.
Whilst I would be the first to protest that there are many problems a hundred million dollars cannot cure, the willingness of the band to rub their possession of such money in the face of their audience says a lot about the true nature of their problems.
The first failure is that the filmmaker does nothing to justify the making of this documentaryÂthe film is so devoid of background information or historical context that, for someone without extensive prior knowledge of the Pixies, there is nothing to suggest that the Pixies are important or interesting enough to merit documenting their comeback.
The story is not only as cheesy as the Sherwood is green, it is so predictable that you have uncovered the plot after 10 minutes... if you haven't fallen asleep after the first 5...
The film tells very little about their first period of activity and focuses on Act 2 of their career.
Let me first say that I tend to enjoy movies that go off the beaten path - even if they are depressing and dark.
And that's really disappointing, because when I first heard about it, before there was a trailer, before the characters were nailed down, when they were still talking about one of the Olsen sisters as an actress, I was thinking this film was going to be great.
Well I just saw this film first thing Friday (opening).
There is no justification for the use of a camera in the first "coup" scÃ¨ne, other than the set up of how this very particular innocent girl is being recruited by this band of criminals.
It's a re-watch indeed, but I don't remember ANYTHING from when I first saw it a couple of years back on TV so I decided to re-watch it again.
Gormsby's dialogue wears thin after the first couple of lines.
When I first saw the "Picasso" in this film I was so shocked and disgusted I wanted to quit and not watch it any more.
The couple dancing in the dark at night in the street, the little boy (Modigliani as child), Picasso being the first one to recognize Modi's talent (He applauds first), the punchline "I 'll paint your eyes when I know your soul"...I'm pretty sure the director lost a bet and had to include as many clichÃ©s as possible.
This show definitely had a lot of potential during the first twelve episodes, which focused mainly on Shinn and all the other new characters.
This series revives many the characteristically flashy visual and musical elements that gave the first SEED its barrages of pink laser fire and pervasive J-Pop background.
Despite its promising start, this series spirals out of control with the reappearance of Kira Yamato from the first SEED.
My first true experience with Gundam was through the Wing series when it was shown in the US via Cartoon Network.
This film is one for the history books, and if you had the opportunity to see this film on NBC when it first aired, you would have probably seen the Apple Computer "1984" commercials a few times too.
I believe it was the first RKO widescreen film.
In the first party scene of this film, the actress is dressed and has her hair done exactly like Sand in a well known painting.
I can't believe she was 15 and that was her first lead role.
Now this sentiment is all very well & good but it would have helped if there was a decent film behind it & then there's the fact that Contamination .7 is far from the first film to tackle this issue.
At first Cathy is spooked to find a Negro in her garden - in fact she is surprised at least THREE times to find a Negro in her garden.
In 1600 the world population, for the first time in the history of mankind, reached 1 billion people.
The first question has to be: what the hell are Martin Sheen and Miguel Ferrer doing in this?
The first couple of minutes between Alf and Beverly Archer(Harriette Byrd in past episodes) was funny but then the film isn't about Alf so much as Military abuse of authority and the love story of two young Doctors who befriend Alf while he is in captivity with the Alien Task Force.
I watched the first episode on On Demand last night and I have to say that I was not impressed at all.
It was difficult not to change the channel on this show in the first ten minutes; I cannot imagine plodding through an entire droning, silly season of this.
I loved the first season of the Tudors.
But the brief respect the writers gave their gay/bisexual men in the first season did not carry on into this one.
Up until that episode I had been only half as invested in the season as I had been in the first.
Showtime's obviously expensive production of "The Tudors" has got its first season into circulation as a set of DVDs.
I have seen some advertising on this, and my first reaction was that any series portraying Henry VIII as a lean man with black hair can't be all good.
At the end of the first season, Woolsey is arrested and conveyed to the Tower, where he commits suicide by slitting his throat.
I had hopes, when I first heard that this series was coming out, that it would have the good sense to dramatize the background to Henry VIII's reign.
It has to be said that the first episodes manage to balance the two fairly well (we get a decent examination of the birth of realpolitik) and do a good job of making 500-year old court intrigue actually look interesting.
The first 30 minutes are plausible, if slow and poorly written, but then the story becomes a muddle of flashbacks, flash forwards and God knows what else.
After the first 20 minutes of the film, you have already lost interest.
The general idea of this film is a good one: In the run-up to the Great Depression and stock market crash, and then in their throes and wake, high-level executives have been cutting corners and cooking the books at a financial firm, first trying to get rich and then trying to hide their titanic losses.
The irony of the first legendary "POTA" movie was that everyone had to object to the way the humans were treated, when we did just as bad or far worse to our captive animals.
Scenes that take place in Provinceown, when they first live together, rival similar scenes in Love Story and carry the naturalness of the escaped lobster scene in Annie Hall.
This movie has the feel of a first year college want to be director.
My wife had the good sense to roll over and fall asleep after the first 15 minutes, the fact of which I am certainly envious.
The first hint that it is prob going to be dumb is the fact that a room is haunted.
It makes it seem like a first graders scary movie.
The first half of the film amounts to a bad retelling on the shining.
The first hour is supposed to be light comedy; it must have been very light, for I can't remember a single truly funny moment.
That first hour sort of breezed by, and in spite of a lack of humour it had a sort of semi-cheerful late 60s feel to it.
Then Jones meets the airhead, mysticism-oriented, brunette hippie girl who jumps into bed with him the first night - i.e.
The good: the first two minutes of the movie, when I thought this is going to be a reality style horror movie shot on video instead of film.
I mean, if a ghost wants to haunt the room they are in, one person needs to leave the room first.
I don't think that the first one really needed a sequel, but "City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly's Gold" is OK if we just accept it as completely ridiculous.
Remember all the things you loved about the first one?
While the first one was about a search for one's self, the second one was about money.
The gags are more crude than subtle, and stretched till all the stupid people get them, to the point of discomfort, and redoing the VCR gag that was great first time round was a crime against comedy.
I loved the first film and after waiting 15 years to catch CS2 I have to say I was disappointed.
Not only is the basic plot structure the same, but all the clever comic moments from the first film are carefully milked again here.
Writers Billy Crystal, Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel are never able to capture any of the hilarious moments that made the '91 flick so successful, yet they did commit the same error that the original movie's writers Ganz and Mandel did in the first, letting proceedings get clumsily sloppy at the close.
I'm willing to forgive the fact that Billy Crystal declared this movie better than the first one and overlook the very contrived inclusion of former cattle drive participants as well as an evil twin.
We get to hear the same boring, recycled jokes from the first movie beginning with the birthday morning phone call, to the dialogue about setting VCRs, to the same dumb joke, "He's behind me isn't he?"
It just goes to show if a joke doesn't work the first time, use it again, only louder.
I'll admit that I did like this movie when it first came out, but I've since graduated from Junior High.
This movie was an overall eye-rolling train wreck which was only made to capitalize on the laurels of the first one.
Blood Shed/Crazed/slipping Into Darkness was the first movie I ever reviewed on IMDB.
While I do understand that first it's a "Hallmark" (as in greeting cards) Production, so right there schmaltz and rubbish and that it was also a "Mini-Series", it seemed as though the producers were looking only to fill time and in a feature package... (DVD) meant for one complete viewing... it came across so God awfully long and boring.
If you enjoy the first five minutes you will love it, otherwise it may have you climbing the walls.
After the first two films, with their lavish sets, excellent acting, and state-of-the-art CGI, this comes as a massive disappointment.
A great shame, as the first Stuart Little in particular was a great hit with my daughter, and one of the best children's films of recent years.
I saw my first episode last week and was totally amazed at the amateur hour presented therein.
I have just watched the movie for the first time just this past Friday, I was blown away and touched by it.
Seeing it for the first time in nearly 30 years, a few retrospective thoughts:  1.
Interesting that Jaclyn Smith was front and center for the first act since she had the least amount of acting experience going in.
Aside from a brief shot of Jacklyn Smith in a bikini and the requisite "Charlie Girl" snippets, there was little of the cheesy T&A exploitation that the show became known for (particularly in its first season).
i really cannot believe that i made it past the first hour... but i have a thing against walking out on movies.
Okay, first off I noticed this movie is insanely high, it's in the top 250 (I forget where) and I really did not like this movie.
The alien in this case being a rare human ready to become the first human champ in some time.
Starts off with a sex scene, of which there were eight total I think, three of them in the first half hour.
He might as well as never been hired in the first place.
This so called "sequel" to the first film have nothing related to it.
It's more of a serial killer film than a supernatural thriller like the first (probably because they didn't have enough money for visual effects).
Might as well make a generic serial killer movie not related to the first film.
Instead, watch "Jeepers Creepers" (the first or the second), which is a far better, far creepier horror movie.
Well I have to say the first one was great & the sound effects were superb comparing with this one.
Boogeyman 2 has nothing to do with the first movie.
the first movie was with a real boogeyman, and this one a human trapped inside a mask trying to be boogeyman.
I can not believe they called this boogeyman '2', did the director even bother to watch the first Boogeyman?
This film has absolutely nothing to do with the first one, its a different reality entirely.
The first one was deep and twisted and really made you think about the world and colliding realities, it was such an inspiring film and it still gives me a cold shiver thinking about that little girl saying 'you can't save me, you can only save yourself'..
The first boogeyman sucked, no denying.
When I sat down to watch this movie, I expected there to be, at the very least, the real Boogeyman from the first movie making a comeback.
With only a passing reference to Tim, the main character in the first Boogeyman, this film should not be classified as a sequel because when a second (or third) film in a series is made, there should be something there to make a positive connection.
Just been watching this movie Boogeyman 2 and for me it was not anything I will watch again.Alltough I must say the good looking cast was OK and some of the gore scenes fine.Much more gore than I expected as the first Boogeyman from 2005 is pretty dry.Plot is OK..but nothing more.Starts with two children watching the Boogeyman killing their parents and then go forwards 10 years and they both at a clinic to overcome their fears for the Boogeyman.Some scenes really bloody and not for the sensitive ones.Maybe worth a rental but not a film I will buy to my DVD collection.If you like your film bloody and a movie not any different than many other horror films coming out these days maybe this is a film for you.I give this film 3/10.
Boogeyman 2 is the sequel to one of the worst horror films I have seen during the last 10 years.This sequel is better than the first part...but it also is a pathetic crap.Besides the good presence from Tobin Bell and ReneÃ© O' Connor,there is nothing to recommend in Boogeyman 2.The screenplay is horribly bad,the characters are completely generic and the movie is tremendously tedious from its first scene to its last one.Jeff Betancourt,who was the editor of some very competent movies (like The Good Girl or The Ruins),made his first work as a director in this movie,and it would be better if he goes back to editing movies,because the direction from Boogeyman 2 is pathetic for many reasons,but mainly,because it never finds a good tone and it is very chaotic.Boogeyman 2 belongs to the worst kind of horror cinema and I suggest you to avoid this big piece of crap.As I said,it's better (or,more properly,less bad) than the first part,but it's still unbearable and painful to watch.
1 for Tobin Bell whom I thought had a good character (And the only reason I watched it in the first place).
It snowballed and the movie ended leaving me more disappointed than the first one.
From my point of view the first film was way better than this one.
The first puts the accent on the horror part, this one emphasizes the bloody, cruel and disgustful part.
this sequel is nowhere near as good as the original.there is lots of blood in this one,courtesy of the fight scenes.,which is a good thing.the fight scenes themselves aren't too bad.however, if found the plot to be lame and uninteresting.this martial arts movie did not really engage my interest very much.this movie lacks the depth(i,i said depth and martial arts movie in the same sentence)of the first film and even the following two sequels.the worst part of the experience is the song selections and choice of band.who picks this crap.these guy don't even rate as flea bag bar band.and the songs are pathetic.the only good things in this movie are Sasha Mitchell,who makes a credible hero and Dennis Chan,who plays the wise oriental sidekick.i suppose i could eke out a 5/10 for this movie,since it is watchable,but the music just sucks so damn bad,i have to give "Kickboxer 2" 4/10
Wagner wins his first few fights, makes some money, & asks Sloan to come to his championship fight.
Sloan agrees & takes Mrs. Wagner along to see him fight for the first time.
As the first movie pointed out, there was only two brothers.
The "brother" subplot was used in the first one, even if they did have yet another brother (man what a cheesy, excuse to do a sequel!
), they obviously don't care too much about him as they said in the first one "there's only you and me".
...........sadly this film is not it.While I admit to watching this film several times,I really think that like most sequels to stand alone movies it suffers from lack of a good plot device,when the main character of the first movie is conveniently disposed of in flash back and quite easily at that and a new hero is introduced as a previously unmentioned brother you know that you are in trouble.
I really enjoyed the first film I thought it was great,definitely one of Van Dammes best,and I wonder how this would've been had he returned for it but alas he wasn't offered enough money and passed on it.
He's been a hack since his first feature and continues to be with this film.
I knew things were going down the toilet after that first scene with the son in the bathroom.
The film has one of the... no... it has THE most sickly, honeyed endings in the history of cinema, followed by a second ending, just as ridiculous as the first one.
What else can I say... there are four principle characters, two of which are totally implausible two others which don't quite manage to live up to the standards set by the first two.
Of course he makes a mockery of his first session, making up a preposterous story about being wrapped in deli meat in order to be satisfied.
I kept (back in 1999 when I first saw this movie) seeing a mad Ross trying to be bad whenever I looked at him, but now looking back on it and putting Ross out of my head (I really dislike the show anyway), Schwimmer does an effective job... however he doesn't really have dimensions and depth.
That was the first indication that the director would be asking the viewer to suspend one's disbelief.
I personally love to play chess, but if you were to force me to sit and watch people do it, I'd feel like committing suicide after the first thirty minutes.
But, I was very disappointed the first time I saw SLEUTH, and subsequently have seen it four or five more times to no avail.
A killer guy in a raincoat goes on a killing rampage is the stupidest idea in the first place.
No-- I didn't liked the first movie, I'd think the entire thing about the man in a raincoat with a hook is so stupid in the first place.
I liked the first movie.
The first one actually occasionally made the viewer frightened and feel some suspense.
I was hoping for this film to recreate the kind of claustrophobic terror that was the only reason to watch the first film, but instead, the entire film is an excuse for Jennifer Love Hewitt to show off her body.
I think I gave a 7 out of 10 for the first film, but this one doesn't deserve more than a 2 out of 10.
On the plus side, it has more scary moments than the first one (if you can get through a dreadful first half).
I should have (still) known or remembered what a poor movie the first 'Summer' was.
I'm going to get revenge on the people (a pair of whom are dead) that hit-and-run me two years ago by sending them on a bit of a vacation first.
The first one was good, but what the hell happened when they made this one.
I read The SPOILERS*   Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt, who is as one-expressioned and scenery-chewer in this as she is in 'Ghost Whisperer') has changed college from the first movie, and is still obsessed with The Fisherman (Muse Watson, who has been given way better material in 'Prison Break' and 'NCIS'), who pays her a visit in the Campus' Disco (hey, Fishermen just wanna have fun!).
One of the disadvantages of films no longer having all the credits at the beginning is that you now have to wait till the end for clues that the film in question may suck - the appalling film of "The Saint" a few years ago had Leslie Charteris' name nowhere in sight, and similarly "I Still Know What You Did Last Summer" credits neither Kevin Williamson (writer of the first film) nor Lois Duncan (author of the book that it was based on), although they could both lay claim to having originated certain characters.
And I can't blame them if they did - the first film was no classic but I can see why it was a hit (it did have some real jolts, it was less self-referential than other recent fright flicks, and the pairing of Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sarah Michelle Gellar was a gift to guys everywhere, even if SMG did get killed).
Karloff's presence notwithstanding, the entire film has only two interesting scenes: in one, a murder takes place in front of at least ten people, yet nobody notices it at first and they go on playing a guessing game as if nothing had happened; in the other, detective Wong gathers (indirectly) all the murder suspects in his house and explains his various theories in detail, in a sequence that plays very much like an early version of all those "and now all will be revealed!"
Of course they have all of New Zealand law enforcement chasing them soon enough without at first Robertson and Garrett knowing why.
Before I start my review, I must first of all mention that this is not a B.movie, this is Z-grade film-making at its most ridiculous.
I suppose if I HAD seen any SG-1 episodes apart from the very first, I would know what the hell anybody was talking about!
The first battle between the remains of SG1 and the Ori troops found me cringing with concern in the corner of my couch as perhaps one of the most poorly matched orchestrations ever showed itself.
Pretty standard stuff for Warner Brothers at first.
That's the first half, the second half deals with a group of monks who find a half dead Robinson who wandered to their door and they nurse him back to health.
We're first made to think she's pulling the doublecross of all time.
Yet in the first five minutes Linda the publisher tells us, not once, but twice that she introduced the bride and groom.
IF the publisher is telling us the truth, doesn't this just kinda rule Max out of the contest for the first person to kiss the bride?
is pretty far from the first thought that comes to mind when seeing that).
Clearing an end-game instance is fun the first time, after which it gets repetitive.
When I first saw this I thought this was either going to be educational or exploitive.
First things first - this is barely real at all.
If Jill Hennessey wasn't the good looking, headstrong woman she is, this show wouldn't have lasted it's first full season.
It is the first television miniseries (save for the Sopranos) that leaves me wanting for more and truly sad to see a season's ending.
The Miser brothers seem almost in the story because they were in the first one.
They sing their song in their first appearance in the film, it seems almost to get out of the way.
And to be honest, most people are going to watch this movie because the loved the miser song from the first one.
And I would have been among the rioters if that had not been in the movie but it didn't fit into this story as it did into the first one.
I watched this on TV last night, and I just want to say first and foremost that I am a die-hard Rankin Bass fan.
The first will always be better; great original Christmas specials can never be made better.
The 'updating' of the concept fails where so many others fail equally, by trying to make something sooo modern and sooo faux-clever or jaded that they miss the mark by miles and fail to realize what made those Christmas classics into holiday staples in the first place.
If you've ever seen the first one, you will understand when I say: STOP RUINING A GOOD THING, Hollywood!
David Schwimmer was good, and Mili Avital was impressive(first time I had ever seen her!).
When a "Christmas movie" contains the line "Santa, you suck" and M-rated video game carnage in the first half-hour, you know it's time to check out.
The first Heat Miser/Snow Miser scene was well done, but then again it's the only thing left over from the original.
I haven't this was the first =D=D=D=D=D.
If you're a little teen liking seeing horror movies for the first time in your little life then OK, I do get it.
The rumor I heard was that the head of ABC actually canceled the show BEFORE the first episode ended.
at one point it even tells new-yorkers that they should be more concerned with doing the "first-strike" because they would be the first target if "someone" acquires "weapons of mass-destruction"( so wait... this actually must be about Iran since everyone knew, by the time this feature was produced,that Iraq had no such "evil" things?).
first of all this show has loads of humans in it who don't need to be there and one in particular completely ruins this show.
Well, it's not unlike the games in the first episode; Sonic attempts to rescue a random character (in this case, Cream) from Eggman's clutches, dodging robots and generally filling up time with heart-pounding action sequences.
Sonic was my first game ever.
Don't get me wrong, I'm extremely happy that they made a new show in 9 years (I was 15 when this first aired) I believe.
When I heard Gamma's Voice for the first time.
That few action-packed moments I did see had the main character taking unthinkable risks, and falling in love with the female lead within moments of first seeing her.
Brian DePalma, not anywhere to be found on my favorite director's list, really did a top-notch job with the first movie...if people complained that the first movie was too hard to understand, they will be pleased to know that the second movie throws not only logic out the window, but also any sense of adventure, suspense or fun...it's a big disappointment...i can't think of anything else to say because i am still dumbfounded by how LAME this movie is.
I used to be a fan when he put the moviegoing audience first and he gave us some great actioners when he first arrived in Hollywood (e.g.
And for the first 20 minutes, in the initial scenes and those in Seville, it seemed like Mr Woo was back on form.
It even has Smith 'regular' Jason Lee in the cast alongside David Scwimmer, who is surprisingly good, and unknown beauty Mili Avital, who is very impressive in the first film I have ever seen her in.
I liked the first and third but the second was awful.
Now here is the antithesis of the first movie: 'Mission: Impossible II'.
The first film was a tight, smooth thriller that barreled along at warp speed, and was a nice break from conventional Hollywood action thrillers.
Almost nothing from the first film has been picked up here: Tom Cruise?
I thoroughly enjoyed the first Mission Impossible.
The first five minutes, which should be attempting to capture our attention, consist of two camera changes of a car driving down a dirt road, followed by two guys walking in the woods carrying rifles.
One example is that in Babar the Movie, Babar is a very young, and apparently reluctant, king at first, seemingly thrust into the position, and without Celeste as queen.
Moreover, the "war" with the rhinos in Babar the Movie is more violent, so it is not as good for really young children, and it is inexplicable and apparently senseless, unlike the fight in Babar: King of the Elephants or the first books.
The first half hour shows promise, but goes laughably downhill immediately after the real story comes to light.
The first part was more like psychological thriller - the rundown kind that has no twists and genuine scares.
The second part, however, turned into a supernatural slasher and I was actually quite thrilled, because the first part of the film had been really bad.
5 was the best ending when they planned to end it the first time.
It is never acceptable simply because the student makes the first move.
Located as an extra on the Special edition DVD of the movie "Vamp", this 22 minute short is what got Wenk the job doing that film in the first place.
It looks an "amateur" story, not directed by a famous director as Tornatore, but by young director at his first movie.
And don't tell me it was his first thriller: if somebody is not able to direct a thriller, just don't do it.
By the time the film is finished one knows no more about these characters and how they feel about anything or what their hopes, dreams and heartbreaks are then when we first meet them.
i rented it and couldn't wait to go home, i opened it and i couldn't believe my own eyes..  this movie has nothing to do with the first it was really bad.
The major flaw of this movie, which struck me after the first 20 minutes is that it is somehow artificial.
OK, first off, Nell's lakeside idyll is a TVA lake, made for generating hydroelectric power in the 1940's.
It seems that the shock and psychology of the first gave way to boring dialogues and less-than-effective acting.
Perhaps the producers were hoping to cash in on the cult-following of the first "Henry".
Actually, when I first saw `Portrait of Serial Killer' (at much younger age than generally recommended) and not knowing who Rooker was, I really was convinced he was a real madman!
Many things are missing from this film that made the first one so memorable such as the original director and Michael Rooker.
Unlike the first film, we never get a glimpse into his sick and twisted mind.
I say this because I was the first guy to die in this movie.
First things first: this movie is one of those In Name Only sequels... and has practically nothing to do with the original classic.
Then as you watch it you may be pleasantly surprised for the first half hour or so and think this isn't so bad.
It may be the first time in my life that I actually felt sorry for the actors, who really were at the mercy of this doomed screenplay.
It may be the first time in my life that I actually felt sorry for the actors, who really were at the mercy of this doomed screenplay.
I thought this movie was almost a waste of my time and give it a 1.5/5 mainly because I am usually a fan of Susan Sarandon (She was the only reason I was interested in seeing this movie in the first place !)
I haven't seen the first one, but 'Why Change Your Wife?'
which was funny the first time he did it.
It's become his calling card now -- it's like the first thing he says when he walks on camera is "You talking' to me?"
So Milch turned to a more contemporary point in time in which thousands of imaginations snapped toward The Black Hills, impassioned by an American Dream of personal wealth (The Golden Rule) and beat an amoral path to get (and keep) theirs' first, in yet another time of violent transition.
Custer died the day the telephone was first publicly demonstrated.
That should have been the first clue.
Watched the trailer first.
I started to watch the film, found the first 5 minutes totally incomprehensible then decided to watch the trailer.
Right from the first line you know that you are in for a bad experience.
I just watched this film for the first time after recording it recently on the Sleuth channel.
In his first scene, he's listening to Insane Clown Posse (Because obviously in the future everyone loves rapping clowns).
The first trouble that is instantly apparent is the weak, weak acting.
I saw this film on TV a few nights ago for the first time and was quite literally stunned at how bad it really is.
The first half hour does not reward with much but a headache.
That movie gave me a headache too, but I was able to sit through it, because it had the one thing going for it this one didn't, at least in the first half hour, i.e.
If I can skip the first half hour, I may be persuaded to sit through it to catch Terrence Stamp's performance, but I'm afraid of what lurks behind that curtain.
If you're bored, it might be worth watching but try and find something else first.
At first, I thought it was a movie about college, since all the actors were so old and just walked in and out of classrooms at their leisure, but then I was stunned that they were suppose to be high school age.
(Apparently Kate O'Mara refused to appear topless, which makes you wonder how she got the part in the first place, but never mind.)
He does explain why, indirectly: When seeing her for the first time in a while, he comments, appreciatively, that she's put on some weight "in a couple of places."
In their penultimate Frankenstein entry, the Hammer folks return virtually full-circle to the first film in the series (The Curse Of Frankenstein).
I read the books first prior to watching the movie and it does follow the book closely with a few minor chnages.
It starts off well enough and plays through the first 30 or 40 minutes as a black comedy... Then things get darker and not so funny anymore and that is when the movie begins to fall apart.
They miss people cheating in the contest, they miss Benny deciding to drop out, they even miss the most vital moment of the contest, when the first runner-up takes their hand off the truck.
let's start off with the first big problem of this movie.
He doesn't lock up our heroine at first, only threatening her with a tazer.
Insdie St. Joseph's the teens start to be stalked & killed one-by-one by a hooded figure that could very well be the Grim Reaper himself as he search for those who escaped him the first time round...
Only good thing I can say about this movie is Cherish, she looks beautiful (in the first 10 minutes).
The first problem is that almost all of the acting (perhaps with the exception of Darnay and Dr. Manette) is remarkably terrible.
It was very intriguing watching a new movie produced by the famous Konchalovsky (Runaway Train, Tango and Cash)  The first 15 minutes are interesting, then trouble begins: ridiculous dialogs, unreal situations etc...
When I first saw it in the theater (if you have seen it you won't believe I just admitted that) I was 8 years old and it was so cool at that time.
The first half of the film is trite but tolerable.
She's not "rebellious," she's a brat: arguing with her father in a business meeting (what on earth was she doing there in the first place?
This movie has no pace, no acting, no plot, no breathtaking scenery, no likable character, not even the urchins in the first episode.
The first scene shows some dire, deserted interior, with piles of rotting material scattered everywhere, the most attractive fixture being an overweight sewer rat gorging itself on some unidentified revolting substance.
It's just simply that there's no point in this film, no argument, except the possible reference to life, death and the after-world... And this is the first film I remember that four different photographers are involved in... something that shows pretty well... not favourably.
The first entry in the endless series is surprisingly light on the smutty humour and harmless innuendo that later became the franchise's stock in trade.
The idea has potential, and for about the first half, the movie is fairly entertaining, but it goes downhill from there.
In conclusion: coming from the director of "Caro Diario", this movie is a disappointment; but it might still be worth seeing, at least the first half.
Bruno Bonomo is at a loss, maybe he wants to assert himself and then the Berlusconi biopic project lands in his life where it doesn't belong but it is very difficult to understand why he would be interested at first since he doesn't realize what the project is about.
(Thank you...I had to get this out of my craw first in order to prevent serious gagging after reading 'vranger's arrogant drivel.)
Man... Well, first off I promise I'm not a 'Troll' and I'm not going to say something brainless and general like 'worst movie ever' because it isn't : ) However... after thinking about it honestly, I THINK what this film is, is a good example of what probably could have been a good film and I don't know WHAT the hell was done to it, but man oh man... the result is literally STUNNINGLY awful.
It's so startlingly, unconscionably bad that after the first couple scenes, I was fascinated with the depths it was willing to sink too.
It was the first and last job i had in the film industry.
I added the extra 1/2 star since the film did end correctly, that is, that school comes first.
Lets see, in "Satisfaction" we've got the usual group of teen girl stereotypes with Julia Roberts in her first credited roll as Daryle, (the Loose Girl), Trini Alvarado as Mooch (the Tough Girl) and Britta Phillips as Billy (the Crazy Girl).
Julia Roberts made her first credited film appearance in this late 80's girl band movie.
And as fast as it starts out it even gets better as he meets Melissa Strickland and they start the first of their many clunky diolog scenes together.
I can not believe he stayed in the first place considering the look on the face of the parents.
drowned out the first measure of the fourth, fifth, and sixth renditions of the song.
Combine all this with horribly stilted dialogue (it feels like almost 3/4s of the film is pauses, either between lines or between words) and pacing somewhere between "cold molasses" and "glacier" (not to mention the fact that the first verse of "Amazing Grace" is used about 20 times in the film) and you have a movie that doesn't even manage to be affably mediocre or so-bad-it's-good, much less scary.
I saw this movie back when it was first aired in theaters, and it is the only theater movie I've seen that was roundly booed by the audience well before the ending.
I like ENTERTAINING fluff, but PC take no chances we don't want to offend anyone and use jokes and clichÃ©s that were old when Atok made his first comic cave drawing is a colossal waste.
First of all there is a never ending list of invented names: kings, kingdoms, cities, knights, princes... After the first minute you don't know where you are, whom you're watching and even in which country you are.
But with the first knock on the door and a voice whispering for help, he opens it and has failed the test.
(Only exceptions are Jeroen Willems as the Lord of the Toll and the first Broeder Martijn.)
There is big hair though and to further confirm the fact this flick was made in the 80's, has a soundtrack that was almost surely made entirely on one of those big ass sampler keyboards you used to play around with that were on display when you first walked into Sears circa 1984.
The first disappointment of the movie is too brief to cover the whole story within 116 minutes.
I would also say that it is far too short, it only lasts what and hour and a half where it could have easily been streteched to 2hrs at least with maybe showing van Zan killing his first dragon or whatever.
On a lark, I decided to watch my first Tim McCoy film and found that it really wasn't any different.
When things get too scary, the women will be the first to scream their heads off and they will need extra comforting.
whenever I think of that film after all these years and I saw it twenty plus years ago--The awful monster noises not the appalling characters that invarably pops up in my mind first.
The first time I saw this I REALLY thought it was a spoof!
This is the very first movie ever to be shown on Mystery Science Theater 3000.
In which we first learn that the characters will be searching for a certain "jewel," then half way though the production, the problem is solved, and a new one then opens: a villain named Omar wishes to take over the world.
Meanwhile Jack and DeVito's character learn of the Jewel of the Nile from this people and mistakenly think it is some kind of real jewel worth money like in the first movie.
This movie just didn't appeal to me though like the first one...who knows; maybe I prefer jungles to desert.
In all honesty I loved the first film, Romancing the Stone, so I when I heard there was a sequel to this I was excited to see it.
I figured it would be at least an entertaining fun movie, especially since it had the stars back from the first film.
The plot is shallow, humour is dry, and the whole atmosphere of the first is just not there.
I wish those responsible for its production could see that and realize that this was not meant to be as memorable as the first.
To the point whereby when my brother recorded this for me at it's first showing, he entitled the cassette "The Murder of The Murder of Roger Ackroyd".
For the first few minutes I couldn't decide whether I liked the film or not.
This is the first review I have posted, and that's because this is the only movie I have ever felt angry about wasting my time trying to watch.
Furthermore the actors are so obviously playing to a camera and getting cues that even if the first 2 problems with the character depiction weren't there you'd still have the realism of the typical elementary school Christmass play.
I finally got hold of a very cheap video, renamed as CLASS REUNION MASSACRE, and watched it for the first time.
The story begins in London in 2008, when a tunnel crew unearths a massive underground chamber containing a dragon who, like most of us, is a little cranky first thing in the morning.
maybe that's how this movie got made in the first place.
This is Dan Fogler's first major role, and he hasn't been around long enough to establish a signature comic persona like co-stars George Lopez, Patton Oswalt, and Christopher Walken who parades around in some of the most outrageous outfits this side of Elton John and Elvis Presley.
Reading a plot synopsis of this film, it certainly sounds promising, but experience it first hand and you can really get an idea of how it can't deliver.
This movie was the first movie I've ever walked out on.
At first I didn't want to walk out.
The first being how a script so utterly bad was green lit and produced.
I was only two when the original miniseries came out, but ever since I was in about grade 5 or 6, and first saw it, I've absolutely loved it and even created a webpage dedicated to The Thorn Birds.
For instance in the original the first time Ralph sees Dane is when he is a teenager.
The first step in the wrong direction was not casting Rachel Ward as Meggie...what were they thinking?
In short, it should not have been attempted in the first place.
I have recently bought both series on DVD as I had seen the first one in the past and liked it very much.
While the first mini-series was fantastic, the second one was just awful.
I could only watch half of it because it seemed to have little in common with the original "Thorn Birds"; it simply lacks the romance and the characters do not possess the emotional depth of the first series.
Fee Cleary, the tough, quiet woman we all knew from the first series, couldn't stop talking in this one.
Also, the dialogues are pathetic, it almost seems like a parody of the first mini-series.
Hercules yells at Lucy screaming that her first born will be cursed!
If that was meant to be bad, Mrs Steamcarrot must have been giving birth to Godzilla with our first born.
Why didn't she do that when she first arrived?
The title refers to the baby's reluctance to come into this world; having been thrust into this vale of tears against his will has obviously had a deleterious effect on young Nicholas's character, as in the first few weeks of his life he proceeds to slaughter everyone who comes near him, including both his parents, his nanny and the doctor who delivered him.
As they travel, he learns more about his aunt's life as she tells her story in flashback, including when she first met Mr. Visconti.
Katharine Hepburn was the first choice for this role.
From here to end of movie car chases, guns, and explosions in random order until everyone ends up in another mysterious underground chamber just like the first one (they built a spare?)
I just finished watching "High School Confidential" on TCM, and it's even worse than I remembered it was when I first watched it 50 years ago at a Drive-In theater.
I wonder why they wanted to adapt the book in the first place if they felt that so much of it was inadequate.
That's the reassuring part: he confided that this was a first effort which started as essentially an "acting experiment" and only later took the form of a feature film.
I watched "Chuck and Buck" last night for the first time.
Chuck may be able to fend off the guy at first by simply going back home to L.A., but when Buck moves there and injects himself into Chuck's daily routine, he becomes harder to avoid.
They could have had an interesting story arc if Sam had at first allowed Buck some latitude then got cold feet later, but they didn't do that.
I wasn't very excited to watch this movie when I first saw the commercials.
It looked, to me, as if it would basically be the same story as the first movie with a couple changes.
The rest of the story was worse, as we watched the Cheetahs go through a lot of the first movie again, Galleria gets big headed and just wants to do Cheetah stuff all the time, and the girls have other interests to pursue, so finally Galleria gets mad and leaves, yet she comes back to them by a song.
This was basically the same story as the first movie, but with a better location and a few new characters.
Instead of the "evil" producer guy from the first movie trying to break them up you have the "evil" mother of the competition.
I actually enjoyed the first Cheetah Girls Movie.
The plot is exactly like the first movie, with Galleria becoming controlling and the others go off and do other things.
I have seen the movie last week, and I enjoyed watching it more than the first movie, this one had more depth, more challenges, I believe at some point it reflected the life of fame for kids and teens who are seeking fame, that its not easy and that its takes hard work and dedication.
At first, we see through the eyes of the monster after her.
The creatures are kept off screen during the first half, to only be heard and getting some POV shots.
The first half of the movie is a series of skits and gags which were all done in anime (and I assume in the manga from where this all sprang).
At first a few small odd things occur--such as the guy getting a milkshake that has worms in it!
(Sorry, cinema, you were my first love, but... that was before I knew!)
Watching it this way first allowed me to see some of the more gruesome parts the show edited.
Squirm is a film that I first saw on Mystery Science Theater 3000 and I absolutely love that episode.
When I found the Alfred Hitchcock version, I didn't agree at first with how harsh Maxim always seemed, but the movie really did the book justice, the setting and lighting.
And, sigh, at a certain point Frith's villainy became a bit over the top, and he habitually hit the same note again and again, the same facial expressions, the same sneer, the same smarmy charm, all of which was very effective in his first scene, but didn't wear well with repetition.
Candyman 2 is a very unworthy sequel to Candyman 1.The beginning scene where the fat guy gets slaughtered in the bathroom is basically the only good part of the movie because the way to destroy Candyman was very cheesy and stupid,and the end was crap.SPOILERS,they killed Candyman by breaking a mirror,that was bad.Most of the movie wasnt interesting like it can be lead to believe,and the whole thing where Candyman can only be destroyed by breaking a glass was very half assed.Seriously,the only thing that this movie can deliver is mediocre acting,and a straight gore fest from beginning to end.I tried to like this movie,I tried,but it just want good enough to surpass the first one.Its not scary or anything.A very bad,and very cheesy movie.4 out of 10.
In fact, apart from Tony Todd's titular character (who's even less scary here but, at least, he's intelligible), Michael Culkin's ill-fated professor is the only link to the first film.
I think it will keep those that liked the first entertained, though they will more than likely enjoy the original far more.
FAREWELL TO THE FLESH is for anyone who wanted more gruesome acts than the first.
The continuing story gets a drastic change in geography this time around as it is transferred from the bustling streets and skyscrapers of Chicago, Illinois to the muggy, bourbon soaked south of New Orleans, Louisiana where the towering hook-handed would-be-urban-legend character of "Candyman" decides to wreak havoc by slicing and dicing through the family of his unwitting and white great, great, granddaughter (I believe it was) who, much like the first film, makes the lame-brained mistake of repeating his name into a mirror five times on a dare.
Not very I imagine---and in particular the plot itself tends to confuse the audience as it has virtually no connection to the first (which sequels really should have, though a number of them rarely do)!
Apparently the screenwriters unwisely chose to base this one on a small section of dialog that was spoken between characters in the first film which most people --myself included-- didn't even bother to pay any real attention to at the time due mostly to the simple facts that it was just plain trivial, and not exactly pertinent to the plot.
It was like I said a part of the first film that should really have been overlooked in the first place, and certainly not made into an entire feature-length film that wound up being both unintentionally laughable and pretty darn awful even by crappy horror-sequel standards!
Overall, this flick doesn't exactly come highly recommended in my book unless you were a die-hard fan of the first film, and or need a good hearty laugh to cheer you up which this film, if nothing else, is sure to provide.
Also what may be of some notice to a few audience members out there is that this flick was the first legitimate cinematic directorial debut by now-respected director Bill Condon, who later went on to great success with a couple of somewhat controversial, and rightfully Oscar-nominated if you've actually seen them, films entitled: "Gods and Monsters" (1998), and "Kinsey" (2005).
There are several differences between this film and the first one that make it inferior.
Creators of the first film were smart to realize that the audience didn't need all that exposition to make the story work.
Most of the scenes are filmed on obvious set pieces, which greatly limit the ability of the film to build masterfully like the first one.
Real locations helped pull viewers into the "myth" in the first film.
This is a sign that there really isn't much here to scare us in the first place.
The first film had little, if any of this; the story propelled its scares naturally by good plot development, not loud cue music.
Fourth, the biggest reason why this is inferior to the first film is that Tony Todd appears much more frequently in this film than he does in the original.
The violence is not that disturbing here as in the first film, but part two also definitely has its cruel and nasty moments.
Its her first talkie.
In her first scene as movie star Betty Grey, Brooks is presented with a publicity poster of herself and delivers her first line in a talkie: "Oh Mr. Snell, I think it's great!
Check out Kate's entrance when she is first created!
At first I thought that all the talk and set up would shortly be followed by the blast off.
Verne's 19th century take on space travel turned out to be more accurate than most of the speculation during the first half of the 20th century.
Everything is changed, from the type of aircraft, from what happens to it, from the characters that end up in it, from why people decided to get into such a canon ball in the first place when, in the original story, nobody was supposed to fly in it.
I saw it for the first time when I was 11 and I must say I liked it.
It's amazing that this first 1950s Hercules film was the stimulus that led to bazillions of Hercules and Maciste films over the next 15 years.
The story and characters were not progressing any further after the first 20 min, and the movie just kept eating up my time...
I cite V's first speech as a striking example.
One of the first trendy restaurants, The Pharmacy (located at A and 9th) was well established by 1982, for crying out loud!
Akitas are LOVELY dogs, and animal abuse is sick and gross; Pseudo Bon Jovi was a recovering addict, yet everyone was overjoyed when he and perpetually jonsing Mimi become a couple--and given it was a previous girlfriend that had gotten him hooked in the first place--Maybe NOT such a good coupling; I noticed as they all patted themselves on the back at the bar (I frequented the real one, it looks nothing like that inside)for their avant garde status, they were completely loathsome to the wait staff...dudes, chances are the servers are boho, too---THEY just take responsibility for their lives.
Perhaps if I had entered the room with different expectations, or been given the realization that this movie was truly a first time effort or compromised somewhat by low budget I would have been able to be more charitable - and possibly derived more enjoyment from it.
At first, the film seems utterly predictable.
I saw the movie for the first time less than two weeks ago and saw it for the third time tonight.
I watched this because of the same reason I watched the first three, they were on basically...
Second, I thought it was a little too much like I thought the first three were going to be like (basically soft porn).
And finally, the fact they said at the beginning this was the true sequel to the first film, even though it pales in comparison to the films that came before.
What actually happens in this movie is unclear, and not made any more clear by the jagged, amateur editing and directing which (maybe for the best) distracts us from the first half hour of the film.
No connection to the first movie what so ever.
The first 'Troll' is hardly a masterpiece, but unlike this film it was made by a competent director with a cast that actually had training.
I first saw this film back in the early 90s.
The film itself has NOTHING to do with the previous film, so if you have seen the first film, and expect to see the 2nd film deal with more Trolls you would be disappointed.
it has no relevance to the first one.
I saw the Troll I and II double feature at Blockbuster and my first thought was "AWESOME!!!"
The plot is bad, the dialogue is cringe worthy and the acting is so bad I wished everyone death in the first five minutes.
First, there is absolutely no connect with the first Troll movie.
This is probably a good thing since the first movie wasn't even funny in an awful way, just horribly lame.
The first time I saw this, I wished I had been wearing a nappy or sitting on a very big sponge, it is that funny.
It's physically, mentally, and emotionally exhausting to watch this film -- I recommend doing it alone, at least the first time you see it...that way, you can concentrate on its truly majestic badness -- and on feeling your brain cells die off, one by one, until you are no longer able to speak.
Taste the Blood of Dracula marks a first for H.G.
IF i had the unfortunate karma to view this (expletive deleted) in a theater, i would've walked out of this horrendously bad film...it is the second worst film that i have ever seen, beating out the venerable Zabriskie Point by Antonioni (which i walked out on the first time i saw it) which is now the third worst film i've ever seen....but i must admit that there is some pretty horrible (expletive deleted) out there which have forced me to appreciate Zabriskie Point more now...
The US, mindful of Iraqi business, supported them for the first few years, but then sold weapons to Iran to counter Iraq's growing success.
This is one of the first movies that I have found that are about black people being successful, and it was funny too!
Mummy's never really scared me.And this one definitely wasn't scary.I first saw this on MST3K years ago,then I saw it again the regular version.Wow!What a boring movie.Bland characters,stupid monster,bad plot.The only way I'd recommend seeing this is to see the mistied version.
A strange mummy is discovered in the tomb of King Tut, apparently having been overlooked by Howard Carter the first time around.
This is a perfect example of the kind of low-level, low budget, crummy movie that really should not have been made in the first place.
The first half is promising; Majors makes an affable protagonist; Saul Rubinek is quite good as the harried eccentric who first discovers Mitchum's conspiracy (although his open contempt of his boss makes his continued employment at the agency another implausible factor).
No matter how many times I watch it it's like the first.
There is not single aspect I can start you off with, it's bad globally: every line is a clichÃ© stolen from Buffy, Blade, or some other B vampire movie (and the ending is a word-for-word rip off from the first Blade -- I can't spoil the movie with this, it hits the bottom on the first line); the image is terrible, either they used magnifying glass for a lens or rented a wrong camcorder, because this is not shot on film with an HDCAM, not even on HDV or DVX from the looks of it; the cinematography is ...well, I don't think they thought about lighting; the set pieces and the makeup is admirably expensive for such a low budget, but the actors wearing the suits couldn't act their way out of a noose on the day of their sentence.
At first I actually thought I was watching a rerun of a Buffy episode, but then I realized that even Buffy wasn't that bad (and there weren't any commercials!).
Obviously, this film was a first for everyone involved.
The point is that "The Best Man" emerges as a polished mainstream comedy where the characters are first and foremost people with all of the foibles and frailties of mankind.
Chicago author Harper Stewart (Taye Diggs of "Go") has just written his first novel.
Once safely in New York and checked into the Plaza, Dracula goes about trying to find Cindy by first sending Renfield to Cindy's agent (Susan Tolsky).
There is a very prudish character who at first glimpse looks a lot like Margaret Hamilton from THE WIZARD OF OZ.
This has to rate as the worst film on the first year of my course, and one of the worst films ever made.
However, other than for laughs or curiosity or a hatred of Mr. Cambridge, I just can't see why you'd want to see this until you've first seen and enjoyed GOOD blaxploitation films!
This movie is visually beautiful, the character design catching the atmosphere of the first manga's of Osama Tezuka-san (they remind me of early Disney animations as well...) The backgrounds are done in CGI.
I saw this on television when it first aired , and remembered it as being terrible.
A bored housewife who falls in love after a car wreck; it was upside down but she was intact enough to have sex with the first stranger that passes by.
Everything about this film just says, "Film school, first attempt."
Note: I can only really comment on the first hour of this movie, since that's all we stayed for.
People moaned enough about the early 70s Hammer studios obsession with combining blood and breasts to earn a profit, and whilst this has no blood to be sure, breasts are 'spilled' within the first few minutes no doubt as a Confessions-precursory 'More Than We Could Get Away With on TV' draw.
The first of 3 diabolically unfunny films which were spin offs of an equally atrocious television show.
I think this is the first good black movie I have seen that didn't need to be but simply was.
Ten years ago, when I first heard that TNT had made a new version of Charles Dickens' timeless Christmas story, I got very excited, and looked forward, with great anticipation, to Patrick Stewart's turn as the miserly, cold-hearted Scrooge.
All-in-all, this movie isn't a bad way to kill a couple of hours, during the Holiday Season, but watch the 1935 version first, then this one, and get them out of the way, before you see the much better ones.
The first time I saw Lola, Sam, and Ella all together as a trio i loved them.
9 also why was everyone so shocked when she sang for the first time?
As an avid moviegoer, this was the very first Black movie made in recent decades that was done right.
As a first major endeavor for Malcolm Lee, my hat is off to him for portraying young, successful, upper-middle class African-Americans in a solid storyline that was at once heart-warming, funny, serious at times, but light at others.
It felt more like a Hilary Duff film and I was not surprised to learn the part of Lola was in fact offered to her first.
But if you can get past the ham-handed sanctimonious cheese of the first few minutes, the film isn't all that bad.
This is a film that was put together remarkably well, especially for a first time, independent project.
I thought that I was going to be a little bit thrilled like the first XXX movie I saw.
XXX the sequel is not really like the first film because XXX played by Ice Cube is not a daredevil and doesn't do all those x-game type of stunts with snowboards or motorcycles.
FINAL VERDICT: Awful, Vin Diesel is not back which is what was good about the first one.
I realize that this isn't the first movie to include these icons of our society in danger, but we never really believe any of this is real and that's the problem here.
If you must watch this movie, then you might not want to invite any new people over just in case of the whole first impression thing.
One thought Jackson would have learned something from the first three-letter movie, but no: He's back, and more pointless than ever.
-the first XXX wasn't that good in the first place and this sequel is a lot worse than that.
Compared to this mind-numbingly awful piece of dreck, the weak first film was a masterpiece.
I thought the first 'XXX' was OK, but the plot of 'XXX2' is so unoriginal and narrow-minded it makes the first one seem like an epic.
Overall, I think that Ice Cube's character lacks the edge of Vin Diesel in the first installment.
Overall Entertainment Value: 4/10,..I feel that the movie would have been better if they eased up on the whole government agency conspiracy aspect and focused more on stunts, which made the first one much more easy to watch
I had not seen the first xXx movie when I went to watch this so I basically had no idea what was xxx all about, except for guns and high-speed cars of course.
The plot is as ridiculous as in the first movie.
It's still a lot better than the first movie though.
I found the first one to be complete garbage, while this is still at least somewhat entertaining at times.
Sitting through the first few minutes I saw names that I liked--Ice Cube and Samuel L. Jackson--and decided to give this one a shot.
I didn't see the first XXX.
Early in the film, you'll see Jackson dual wield guns ala John Woo (to live up to his position in his agency and survive) but I find his role in the first movie better.
I did notice however that the action in the sequel are more military in nature when compared to that of the first film wherein its action is more related to extreme sports.
I walked out after the first 40 mins.
I have a very high tolerance for "bad" films(I really dug the first xXx) and have only walked out three time before (Dungeons and Dragons, Bad Company, and The Musketeer).
Opening with an impressive first 7-8 minutes, this film moves into cookie cutter territory at a frightening speed and continues to derail any opportunity for the audience to engage in the ridiculous plot or heavily computer generated action sequences.
The first xXx was at least assure of itself, popcorn action with the acknowledgment that it was bang for buck and nothing more.
Up to the first half hour it's great.
But Gen-X Cops is so mean spirited, that one wonders why such a lovable character would be killed off in the first place.
The thing just is that you can't make a nuke from plutonium like that - the plutonium has to be enriched first in some weapons facility.
Whose idea was it to make a sequel to a bad movie in the first place?
The plot was OK at first, but people start to do things that don't make any sense given their motives.
The first 10 minutes is interesting and intriguing although poor acting is obvious almost from the beginning.
Watching the cast of Deadwood converse with a combination of old world English laced with profanity straight from the gutter is incredible and feels right for the first time.
People always want to think that they were the first to do something, when things like profanity, substance abuse and prostitution have been around since before man walked erect.
During the first season, Dark Angel was on my weekly "must see" list, and not just because of Jessica Alba.
On one of the second season episodes, they even had Max sleeping and dreaming - where the first season stated she biologically couldn't sleep.
At first I thought this show might be a more energetic approach to discussing pressing issues.
The first 15 minutes are spent with a drive through Paris with constant cuts of different news clips saying that Derrida is a modern genius, thinker, etc.
it is so distracting you have to close your eyes to focus on the v/o (which are very difficult to understand in the first place - very very very VERY difficult).
One redeeming quality of this movie was that I got to see and hear him speak for the first time.
If you've begun reading Derrida for the first time, there is nothing in this video for you.
It is incomprehensible to me why some "writers" feel the compulsion to totally mess up a classic story by changing everything about the original that made it worthwhile in the first place.
The derelict wound up causing The Phantom's death in the '63 film-- but, absurdly, in this one, he not only rescues the composer from the fire, he takes him down to the underworld in the first place, gives him the mask, shows him the maps of the catacombs-- in effect, this guy who never utters a single word of dialog CREATES the Phantom!
Looking at their book they knocked up a first draft in a month or so and were shooting I think two months after that.
They should have got feedback/reviews and done subsequent drafts and sorted that problem out first IMHO before shooting.
This film is not about World War Two, it is how we can talk about it without caring to know anything at first.
The first comes five minutes into the film when a damaged B-17 is landing with one landing gear down.
So there I am, in line at the theatre those many years ago, ready to see this new film about one of the most dramatic events of the Second World War: the return to base of the first US Army Air Force bomber crew to complete a 25-mission tour.
The cast sounds first class - it is, they're great - and well, there are airplanes!
The year 1866 ,the location is southern Indiana, this is the true story Reno brothersÂ¨: Frank,Simeon,John,Bill exception by Clint, a respected farmer(Denver Pyle),it's a retelling of the wild adventures that made the Reno brothers clan legendary among outlaws passing into American folklore.They were the first train robbers in American history and killing and looting.This famous gang rode through the middle border states,setting the model for the future noted bandits bunch as :Doolin, James,Younger,Dalton.. Forrest Tucker and J.Carroll Naish are the leaders of the Southwestern outlaws gangs pursued by lawmen.Reno brothers join forces with town authorities,judge and sheriff(Edgar Buchanan and Ray Teal).Fim starts with a fateful raid but they have been betrayed and kill burning to agent Peterson for revenge.Then ,a special agent(Randolph Scott) along with a supporter(Kenneth Tobey) are assigned in order to get the bad guys simulating the train robbery,besides the protagonist falls in love with gang's sister(Mala Powers).
This film was directed by Eric DelaBarre and for his first effort its adequately made.
You'll notice during the opening credits; the camera work is very shaky for the first five minutes or so.
This is the true story of the Reno brothers....Clint, a respected farmer, and Frank, Simeon, John, and Bill...who were the first train robbers in American history.
Now we're on to movie 15 of our 50 chilling classics and let me just say first of all that THIS IS IN THE WRONG MOVIE PACK.
Robot Wars is the first Italian science fiction film I've ever seen.
Even Italian children, no doubt the film's target audience, must have felt insulted after the first couple reels of this low budget non-epic.
It's plot attempts to parallel the first "Star Wars" movie with truly hilarious results.
If it came down between this film and the first installment in the film series "Christy," I'd go for the early series, which starts off exactly like the book.
If you've read all the other reviews you will notice that the first ones - the negative ones - came from people who saw the 1994 series first then experienced the 2000 PAX remake with shock and horror.
People tend to like the version they saw first but if you haven't seen any certainly the series is so much better in every way - acting, tone, pace, story line, cinematography, casting, directing, orchestration.
One can review the remake from the perspective of seeing it first or seeing it second.
If you've already seen it, I can't do anything about that, but if you haven't see the series first (and best yet skip the remakes).
The first of the three PAX movies plays like a parody without jokes.
Bits of pieces of the year long series are randomly tossed into the first hour so all that exists are the famous scenes poorly executed without any build up or understanding of why they are there except for viewers to go "oh yeah, I remember that scene, it was in that story about..." They are presented here as punch lines without the build up.
This device would have worked great to recap the story lines for the first film IF they had followed the original story lines.
This is the first time, the VERY FIRST TIME, I've ever, EVER, given a movie I've reviewed here a 1.
I'm taking it back to the library tomorrow first thing: it's drawing too many flies.
This was the first Australian haunted house thriller I ever watched (at least I think it was, unless overlooking another one), but unfortunately I can't claim it was a very good or even remotely memorable experience.
But the movie lost me with Linney's very first scene in which she introduces herself as "Mrs.
As I watched this film for the first time, I couldn't help but feel that I had seen it before.
The basics of the movie is a college grad flops in her first interview and becomes a nanny by accident.
SPOILER ALERT: In the novel, Mr. X is cheating on Mrs. X -- and we learn that SHE stole HIM away from his first wife the exact same way.
Given a title that promises biting wit, bitch fights, and outrageous behavior, one wakes up the morning after watching the film curiously empty; not only does he not remember a single scene from the film, but he forgets he saw the bloody thing in the first place.
I saw it when it first aired, but I couldn't watch it again since it brings back such bad memories, plus it's so biased.
I hope when he is set free the producers come back to Baltimore and do a sequel to show just how wrong the first movie really was and show that he is innocent after all.
Do yourself a favour and press STOP after the first two minutes and you will have a far more enjoyable cinematic experience than continuing on to the establishing scene.
There are, however, two first class (and totally forgotten) songs.
There wasn't really anything in the first hour.
I admit, I've never been shot in a battle, so I cannot tell what a person would normally do under these circumstances, but my wild guess is that having sex with a comrade (while the enemy soldiers are searching around) would not be the first item on the list.
The first time I saw it, it threw me for a loop, because it violated so many of the conventions of intelligible moviemaking that I almost felt shell-shocked.
You start to get bored with how not funny the movie is after the first 20 min.
Don't make it your first choice.
("Speedway Junkie" in 1999 was the first change of direction for JTT) This movie is a must for JTT-Maniacs (like me), but not for normal people.There are many ways of wasting your time more enjoyable!
I loved the first Sonic Adventure game (Gamecube remake) and I only expected this one to be as good, if not better.
Where's the dynamic gameplay of the first game?
The first time I saw it I was about 10 years old, and it scared the snot out of me.
It was made at the height of popularity for the 'shaky camera' videography technique (watch reruns of the first season of NYPD Blue and you'll know what I mean).
It makes you wonder why they didn't just smash the mirror in the first 5 minutes.
I watched the first few episodes of this miniseries and I can tell you that it's not religious at all, except for the quotes of the bible.
Screenwriter David Seltzer went on record as not really believing in the stuff when he wrote "The Omen," but this tale of the End of Days is truly lacking in conviction from Joseph Vitarelli's clichÃ©d choral theme onwards (whatever you might think of "The Passion of the Christ," you can't deny that Mel Gibson genuinely put his money where his mouth is); instead of being thought-provoking and chilling, the first four hours are nothing but build-up with nothing going anywhere, and when it's not teasing you it's being ridiculous (ominous supermodels dressed in black hanging around?
My first instinct was that NBC has gone evangelical.
I have to admit when I first saw Fred Durst, I wasn't really sure if that was really him, I think I spent more time trying to figure out if it that was really him or not than I did trying to figure out how this show would end.
Now the original inhabitants of Palestine / modern Israel may have been Hamitic (black-skinned), but the Isrealites who left Egypt pretty well wiped out much of the aboriginal population of that first area (Refer to the Book of Joshua in the Old Testment).
Michael Massee has gotten better since even the first episode, but for someone supposed to be so evil, he's really not all that horrifying.
Despite Wesley's jealousy, it is ridiculous that he would be much quicker to believe Jim over Charlotte, but then again, the first time Wesley expresses his love for Charlotte is during a period of sex.
The first has some creepy moments (although they have little to do with the show's '60s incarnation), but the second quickly deteriorates into a simple-minded impending-disaster-on-a-train scenario that just left me cold and probably belonged in another movie.
The effects were cheesy, it was PAINFULLY slow, and worst of all, Roy Thinnes has a total of about ten minutes screen-time across the first part and then vanishes.
The reality was that the only hint of a tie-in was the presence of David Vincent for what amounted to a cameo appearance in the first and second part.
It was part of an unfortunate trend in the UK for shows where you always knew what the first words out of a character's mouth would be, followed by an explosion of canned laughter from what I can only assume was a lobotomized audience.
Being carried out by various fools in a Nazi-run slave brothel during WWII, these experiments consist in the first place of observing how German soldiers couple with female prisoners in transparent waist- high water tanks, or on white-sheeted beds.
Sergio Garrone's "SS Experiment Camp" is a total failure on every possible level.This film was banned in Britain as a video nasty,but it surely isn't as outrageous as many people claim.In fact it's pretty tame even by today's standards.There is some torture and humiliation and lots of nudity and soft-core sex.Some scenes are pretty mean-spirited for example one woman who refuses to go through the experiments is put into the tank.The temperature is first put up to almost boiling point and then the dial is turned the other way making it icy cold.Still the film is extremely dull,so fans of Italian exploitation may be disappointed.Avoid this one like the plague-watch "Beast in Heat" or "Gestapo's Last Orgy" instead!
Funny scene #1: In the first scene we have one of the Nazi studs returning to the dorm and saying how much he is looking forward to banging some hot women in the next experiment.
When a stud-soldier unexpectedly falls in love with his mating partner, his body is used for another Â much more vile - medical experiment, namely the world's very first testicle transplant!
Too bad that first elevator operator wasn't around long enough.
Of the first 25 votes cast for it, fifteen were a '10'.
Or at least more inventively, the survivors of the first film had flogged the story of the first film and then admit to the new members of the cast that 'it actually happened and to us and that's why were in trouble because we decided to shortcut through the same bit of desert and got stuck'.
When I first recorded it off of ABC or Fox family, something like that; I watched it at least 2 times in a row.I'd love to own it on DVD but they don't even have it @ Best Buy and they have EVERYTHING there!
It's mostly just a rehash of the first film.
I couldn't stand it...at one point we are treated to a flashback from the first movie...as remembered by the FAMILY DOG!
In some ways it felt almost as a parody of the original and that surprised me, as it is made by the same man who made the first one: Wes Craven.
From some freak co-incidence one of the feral cannibals has survived from the first movie, even thought we saw em' all get killed, and this time he's accompanied by his uncle, which was something of surprise, as he wasn't mentioned in the first film and the daddy of original head of the cannibal family mentioned only having two children, a daughter who died and the bloodthirsty psychopath son.
Not that the first one was any brain food, but this is one is just one huge cashing in attempt.
Somehow Pluto (Michael Berryman) is still alive after the first movie.
This entire movie is mostly flash backs from the first movie.
Anyway, this sequel is really quite lame as these things go (especially given that the original director is involved): apparently, there was so little plot to work with that the makers felt the need to pad out the running-time with gratuitous recollections of some of the highlights from the first entry Â including an outrageous (hence, justly infamous) dream sequence by Beast, the heroic Alsatian!
), and yet another relative (brother to Jupiter from the first film and, thus, Pluto's uncle), dubbed "The Reaper", and who appears out of nowhere.
In fact, just about the only characters to engage our interest are a blind girl and Janus Blythe's Ruby herself Â who has been domesticated in the interim (at the end of the original, she had saved a baby from a fate worse than death and, as seen in an alternate ending on Anchor Bay's SE of the first film, had even joined the surviving members of the cannibals' victims).
That didn't turn out to matter though, because nearly the entire contents of the first film have been conveniently spliced in to this flick.
For an example; every character has a flashback within the first twenty minutes of the film and to make the movie more inept than it already is, even a dog has a flashback!
If you're looking for any incestuous, inbred, radioactively mutated hill killer like the first film this is certainly not the place to look for it; especially when the mutants in this film can drive motorcycles (stylishly so).
This film has no character development, bad acting and a story copied and pasted from the first and slasher formulated Â this is Friday the 13th mixed with The Hills Have Eyes.
Also, whatever happened to the other characters from the first film?
The film has cheesy special effects (just look at the cover) and the script is the exact same as the first.
Michael Berryman is still good as Pluto (though the character is nowhere near as scary as he was in the first film).
Gernerally regarded as being one of the worst sequels ever committed to film, this begins with about five minutes of flashbacks to the first film, followed by a cheap shock (guy sneaking into girlfriend's room in a mask) , then more flashbacks.
After which a group of dirt-bike racers (using some type of gasoline created by survivor of the first film, for the obligatory cameo) leave for a motor-cross competition in the desert.
They stupidly decide to take a shortcut, and when their bus breaks down, they end up in the same area where the first film took place where they're set upon by two survivors of the cannibal family.
Bad references to the first film scattered throughout the early scenes don't help, nor does an uneven pacing, but it's well photographed in the desert, capturing the desolation and isolation of it, and the low budget sets (Ha!
More of a plot, and a better ending (like the first film, it doesn't explain how the hell the last two characters get out of the desert, nor what happens to Ruby) would have helped considerably.
What this sequel mostly does wrong is relies too much on its first movie.
It needlessly features same characters and actors from the first movie and the movie is filled with countless flashbacks of events that happened in the first movie.
This is a real cheap way of film-making of course and quite annoying if you have already seen the first movie.
People say that the first part was a great classic, and that the sequel was bad.
The first film was a piece of excrement, with flies on it and all, and the sequel should not even be described using words because no language has words bad enough to describe it.
I'll jump over the laughable effects, colourless blood, and beaten to decomposition (not just beaten to death) clichÃ©s, and go straight to how annoying the flashbacks from the first movie were.
I don't think I've ever seen a sequel that had as much content from the first movie.
After the prologue, Bobby has flashbacks from the first movie; now, this scenes have background music.
I just watched The Hills Have Eyes2 1985 and the soundtrack sounds like Friday the 13!Someone tell me if they think so too.I was just sitting around and thought I'd watch part 2 of this little miniseries and I'm a big trivia buff.I told my husband and son this should be good like the first one right?Wrong think again.This was so corny and i kept getting the feeling the music in it sounded so familiar that i gave some thought to it.i don't wanna give any major parts away but like save your time effort and money because it is definitely not worth it.I love most 80's movies and music mainly because I was a teenager to all that corny,quircky but amazing stuff.
People have mentioned the barrage of flashbacks in the first twenty minutes, I was dumbfounded.
This Movie seems to have increased in showing frequency since it first aired.
The characters were just ridicules and not to mention that he brought back characters that either died in the first film or would have no purpose in this sequel.
Not to mention the characters from the first film have flashbacks from the first Hills have Eyes movie, but also the dog has a flashback as well!
We have a group of teenage friends on a bus just going across the country, one of the girls happens to be Ruby, the little cannibal girl from the first film that saved the baby, somehow she's established herself into a model citizen that has a bubble gum personality, until she bumps into her old relatives at the same site with the group.
They didn't explain some of the deaths, they never explained what happened to the rest of the family from the first film, we only see the brother, and he has a pointless role because you don't see him for the rest of the film.
That didn't turn out to matter though, because nearly the entire contents of the first film have been conveniently spliced in to this flick.
A gaggle of kids - standard slasher movie characters, all of them - who are associates of one of the first film's survivors, go to the desert to race their bikes and test their experimental fuel - and are menaced by the surviving mutant (Michael Berryman) from the first film, as well as a new ugly thug, "The Reaper" (John Bloom).
The first film could have been seen as a statement on the breakdowns of family units, but writer / director Craven obviously didn't care about making Part II particularly intelligent.
Cast is nothing special at all, though it is amusing to see Penny Johnson (Jerald), recently of the TV series '24' (she played Sherry Palmer), paying some serious dues, and to see Janus Blythe reprise her role from the first film.
It has been a favorite of mine since I first saw it on ABC Family Channel when it first come out.
While the movie "Inside" at least had suspense in the first half of the film, in the end , the movie Broken is just another excuse to show how much the human body can take getting ripped apart and how much an audience can stomach it.
But someone came up with a great first 10 minutes and last 5 minutes, and then promptly did a runner, leaving their abandoned 5 year-old daughter to finish it off.
the first 15 min.
After this first test the man then chains her to a tree & makes her clean his pots & pans & tend a little vegetable patch in the middle of a forest, as you would.
Nothing is ever revealed about the man, his name, his origins or why he is doing what he is or how he even managed to kidnap Hope in the first place or why he choose her & the list just goes on.
She totally deserved to die, and in a perfect world, she would have died in the first 3 minutes into the film.
The first scene had a woman go through torture to stay alive only to kill herself when she got through the hard part.
A poorly developed action adventure film shot largely in Mexico, this affair begins in promising fashion, but after its first of several changes in direction occurs within the plot line, little remains that will interest a viewer.
At first, it seems ludicrous and inept.
You first get the impression that Yule has something to do with Tom and their acting, secretly, as some kind of tag-team of sleaze-balls and later feel that there's a falling out between the two.
I watched it twice and still wondering if it's made by the same group that did the first movie.
It's strange to talk about character chemistry in an animated movie, but I found Lion King II lack the kind of chemistry the first one had.
The same basic characters as in the first one are in it, like Timon and Pumpa.
It's just that I love the first one so much that this one just doesn't compare at all.
It also doesn't have the same emotional feel that the first had (with the father dying and such).
The first one always made me cry even when I was older plus the music and visuals were cool so it made it a really good film but this one isn't.
This is not so bad as it allows for a different plot from the first.
We thought this could match the first.
Her love scenes with that idiot are just a cheap copy of her parents beautiful and innocent love scenes from the first film.
The whole story is just a bad try to imitate the first one.
I saw this movie in video club, I rented and my first thought was: "oh, this must be a special edition in DVD of an old movie" and then you check the box of it and it says that this movie was made in 2003.
Do the horror first.
I hated how Nadja looks & was literary praying it would finish within the first 30 minutes but never let it be said I don't give a film a chance & I (just about) stuck it out to the end which was also crap.
mali svet is one that belongs to the first category.
I will admit that I was finishing an "art" project for the first fifteen minutes or so, but even then, when I wasn't really paying attention, I could tell that this was going to be a terrible movie.
I laughed a lot when I saw this movie the first time, and I will definitely watch it again.
This is the first and most coherent of this unfortunate quartet of pictures.
The first forty five minutes move very slowly and nothing really happens.
The storyline is amazing, thus the characters are chosen so well, and the actors are the best Yugoslavian actors there are today in the acting business.The whole storyline is carefully planned, although it might seems a bit confusing at first, you get used to it, and after that it's just a Joy ride from than on.
The only truly pressing question raised by "Firewall" is why anyone even bothered to make this film in the first place.
The movie has some positive points that I should highlight first.
I will first point out that I do not go out of my way to watch this show but when I do sit down and watch I find it quite enjoyable and at times very funny.
I first picked up this movie purely because of the cover.
I was kinda forced into watching this film having started reading through 'American Silent Film' by William Everson (a very good book, I hasten to add on, er, well the title says it all) and encountering an entire chapter on, first, 'Birth of a Nation' (which I duly watched) and, then, 'Intolerance'.
This is a film from Chaplin's first year in films.
I guess what I'm trying to say is that if you liked the first movie....... then steer clear of this one.....
First of all, they lost Lambert, Ashby, and Tagawa from the first movie.
James Remar (who seems to have no idea why he's here, and that Raiden is supposed to be comic relief ala Raiden in the first movie) is no Chris Lambert.
They played fast and easy with the "rules" in the first movie, but any sense of coherency is totally lost with this one.
If the bad guys don't give a damn about the Elder Gods, why the heck did they play by the Gods' rules in the first movie.
Undercutting your first movie's basic concept just doesn't help you.
Apparently Boon and Tobias, buoyed by the success of the first movie, said to themselves, "Cool, now we can throw in all the faceless villains the marketing guys they told us would be too much for the audience in the first movie."
It's like we had one good human villain (Shang Tsung) and one good F/X villain (Prince Goro) in the first movie, so they decided, "Hey, lets put in two human villains and two F/X villains in this one."
There is none of the care that obviously went into the first movie, which whatever its deficiencies, at least gave you something good to look at.
The lessons of the first film, which was actually rather good, seem to have been forgotten with great fight scenes, pumping music and a sense of humour curious only by their absence.
Most of the notable musical themes were taken from the first movie.
The first movie was quite fun to watch.
The plot is, besides non-existing, stupid stupid and stupid, and the fighting scenes were already made in the first movie (except when the only two female characters of any significance fight in a pool of mud).
Christopher Lambert, while not being an excellent actor, was still VERY cool in the first Mortal Kombat.
I really liked the first movie.
The story itself (based off MK3 and MK4), was shaky, the techno music was nowhere near as good as the first film, and the whole movie seemed uneven and a waste of film.
It lacked the feel of a movie, and earned the second 1997 award of a "film that I almost walked out of in the first fifteen minutes."
Watch the first film.
Too bad MK:A didn't live up to the first one.
This movie obviously had more money than the first but it was no where near as good.
Even the soundtrack was not as good as the first movie even though KMFDM were involved in both.
It's a shame because i really enjoyed the first Mortal Kombat film.
But i killed you in first tournament - No, that was my brother, Sub-Zero.
The first movie beats it easily.I quickly hit IMDb to check the scores of both the original and MK: Annihilation...  A dismal score of 5.0/10 for MK, and an even lower 3.0/10 for MK:Annihilation.
OK, the first movie wasn't THAT good, but it was a 'heapload' better than the sequel, which IMHO should never have been made, I mean...they can't even use "We needed to make money" as an excuse, because I'm sure even the caterers who worked on this film have never been able to find work since.
Ah well, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, it's like the biggest disappointment to me, as for years I was like "I have to see MK annihilation" because the first one in my mind was embedded there as something "good".
Suffice to say I found the first Mortal Kombat, to be fairly entertaining.
Carried in the first film by Lambert and the chap who played Shang Tsung (don't remember his name but he was in Rising Sun).
If i could give this movie a Zero , i would.. this sequel was TOTALLY unnessasary ...   First of all , Christopher Lambert wasnt in it as "Lord Rayden" and i dont even know who the heck the actor was that portrayed Him..  >>>>>SPOILER AHEAD>>>>>>> then secondly, "Johnny Cage" was a different actor too, not Linden Ashby.. and i didnt know who that actor was either.. and then right near the start of the movie, "Johhny" gets killed .. im sorry i ever rented this stinker in the first place.. i was expecting it to be similar to the first one.. Oh was I ever Wrong!!
so just pass this turkey by in the video store and rent the first "Mortal Kombat" its Way better than the second one.. i DONT recommend this trashy movie at all ...
I made the mistake of going to see this movie, first show, first day, in the theater, in 1997 when it was released.
The first movie wasn't bad.
Sheeva: Has a few lines early, Liu Kang kills her in under 10 seconds in her first fight.
On top of these character issues, the entire movie seems to have been filmed on the first take.
When we first meet His Jaxness himself, he punches into a wall trying to kill Cyrax.
It would have been better if they kept it superficial, the way they did in the first movie.
I really enjoyed the first Mortal Kombat movie, I like action flicks that aspire to be more.
This sequel has diminished the image of the first movie, Mortal Kombat.
All in all, I would recommend the fans of Mortal Kombat to avoid watching this movie if they want to maintain their good impression of the first movie.
The first five minutes basically drops a piano on the head of the first movie - new bad guy, Johnny Cage dies, new heroes appear, minimal explanation.
Having gone to the movie with a guy who didn't play the games, I had to explain what the hell was going on for the first half (like why is that guy fighting him?)
The original MK was, reasonably, based on the first game.
For example, (spoiler), in maybe the first 2 minutes Johnny Cage, a main character and semi-hero of the first movie, is summarily and unceremoniously killed off.
In fact, there will be several so if you continue, do at the risk of ruining the wonderful cinematic experience that is MKA), robots from game 3 come in, negating the fact that their sole purpose in the games was to hunt Sub Zero, a character killed in the first movie.
Leading the attacks by these fiends and others is Shao Kahn, who in the first movie appeared as a giant demonic face in the sky and here appears as....a masculine human being.
Now, I thought the first MK was an OK film, great soundtrack, OK acting and plenty of fighting.
I was expecting to see a REAL sequel to the first movie, which I found fairly entertaining.
I thought the first film was very good and does the game upon which it is based some justice.
The first problem is that they tried to fuse too much of MK2 with MK3.
Then, if you're going to replace a character with another actor (Christopher Lambert), then at least make sure the new actor does a batter job than the first.
The first Raiden was a hard-ass, and you knew not to mess with him.
The actress who portrayed Sonya Blade was nowhere near as good as Bridgette Wilson (the first Sonya).
Stick with the first.
For example, the film begins with the images of the set up for a bank robbery, which is very confusing: screenwriter analyst Linda Seger says that the first images from a film have to transmit us the main concept of it, so the viewer can figure out what is going to be told.
But during the first half of the movie we see various shoots from the bank robbery, when the robbery itself has little importance.
Is all I could think about during the first 20 min (that's all I could do) is how much wasted money and energy went into this horrendous film.
I saw it for the first time not too long ago, and I must say I was somewhat disappointed, though my judgment is biased.
Since the time of The Day The Earth Stood Still, when all Klaatu wanted to do was give the Earth leaders a groovy gift and got thanked by having it shot out of his hand, and in a multitude of other films since, Hollywood has taught us that when we are confronted with something of superior intellect, or of mysterious origins, if we don't understand it, if it doesn't look like a fluffy kittie, we are to shoot first, and ask questions later.
I give credit to Andrea Bianchi (at first I thought it was a female director, the one lone one among the pack of the Giallo, but digging deeper Andrea is apparently a male name), for trying to put a couple of crazy twists: the killer looks like a cross between a dominatrix and a hardcore biker out of Mad Max, covered in total black leather with a big black helmet, there is a moment or two that do startle with the killer's presence.
And since the device could wipe out a civilisation just a few years before it was able to deactivate the artifact, surely that would be counter-productive (to whatever motive the aliens had in the first place).
This mini-series actually got quite a few good reviews when it first appeared on TV.
I was intrigued ,when I first read the plot outline and saw the ratings here on IMDb , so I decided to watch it.
I didn't think much of this when I first saw it and don't think much of it now.
It obviously won't stand comparisons with the likes of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968), though still valuable for being one of the very first films to exploit the 1969 landing on the moon.
The plot is stupid, the dialogue is silly and the acting is horrible, the actress is ugly and the male lead is total a jerk.i am wondering why this kind of movie could be released in the first place.
This movie gives all it has to give in the first 10 minutes.
The first third of this film was promising, but it got so badly out of hand by the end that I can't seriously recommend anyone bother watching it.
(Spoiler Alert) actually just before the ending the fight with Mr. Psycho...it just didn't seem truthful, but I do like the fact that she took off and didn't get "saved" by her cute man and yet the emailing alludes to the possibility of them hooking up, even if at first he seemed creepy....so what I'm saying, rent it, but don't expect truthfulness to the situation...
We first see him sexually harassing a young girl (and succeeding!
At times, the creature looks like a poor man's griffin; at other times, it morphs into a bad copy of Inhotep from the first two THE MUMMY movies.
Despite having some really good original TV series, I always think of the network first and foremost as the "Disaster/Monster B-movie network".
The story of a woman and her down syndrome child should have been moving, but there are no surprises, and the whole two hours dwindle away to a conclusion that will make you wonder what the point was in the first place.
In typical slasher fashion, The Last Horror Film opens with a nekkid blonde being murdered in a hot tub, but, in the first of several plot twists (there is a double whammy right at the end), this death is quickly revealed to be a scene in a film that is being watched by Vinny Durand (Joe Spinell), a sweaty, lank-haired, delusional low-life who, infatuated with horror-star Jana Bates (Munro), travels to Cannes to try and convince the actress to appear in his non-existent movie.
Picking up where the first Ultimate Avengers left off, UA2 finds the Avengers not getting along very well as they encounter the Black Panther and continue to deal with the alien invaders of the first feature.
The first Ultimate Avengers, while not perfect, was still a solid introduction to the characters, their dynamics and their personal issues.
Similarly, the marital problems between Hank 'Giant Man' Pym and his wife Janet 'Wasp' Pym are revisited and shown to have gotten worse, as Hank is made out to be an even bigger asshole with an over-sized ego here than he was in the first film, but as with Captain America's problems, the manner in which it is concluded - with Giant Man dying in the final act in what is apparently meant to be his redemption for being an egocentric jerk for most of the story - is not a satisfying one.
I didn't check the "spoilers" box because the entire plot is revealed in the first 15 minutes.
I immediately recognized as 1 of 2 movies that I saw when I was a starving (pretty much literally) student living away from home for the first time, in 1973, and couldn't resist picking it up and giving it a look, that many years later.
The fox appears docile and is amiable to being petted, so Siegler takes him home, but the fox soon turns on him, Bishop becomes infected and is the first to die.
Their first result using nerve gas that was originally for the war in Iraq?
A poor storyline, a rubbish script, and another low budget film where everything goes well for the good, and the bad get punished or learn a "valuable" lesson (even though really it was the leading female characters fault for closing down the research in the first place).
Possible spoilers due to references to other literatureÂassuming you can't guess the ending within the first few minutes.
After the first hour, the movie really loses its way.
The writers seem more interested in bashing on the military than continuing the story they began in the first half.
of Homeland Security, in which Lawless briefs a panel wearing full dress uniforms while she is dressed in skin-tight jeans; the inevitable expression of remorse from the entomologist, prior to his bloody demise; the scene in the Pittsburgh office, with the b-day party being interrupted by a picture window full of bugs (plus the revelation that the office hunk is even wimpier than Lawless' bf); the scene in the chopper when Lawless declares she's hormonal due to her pregnancy, and just might kill everyone in the chopper if the DHS doesn't change its drastic plan; the climactic kiss that is interrupted by the buzzing of the swarm; and just about every scene in which people are warned about the locusts' pending arrival -- first, they're in denial; minutes later, they're running for their lives.
That was my first mistake, after the pilot I hoped it would get better, that was my second mistake.
It's not even halfway up to par with the rest of the SH games, even the first, which I've played countless times.
The first sign that this movie going down hill fast is when James Brolin asks Hal Holbrook 'how many people know about this' and Hal replies something like 'only a few' but we have already seen about 75 people involved which later turns into about 750.
This preposterous sci-fi flick deals with the first mission to the moon.
The film is of historic interest as it was one of the first (perhaps the first) of many Sci-Fi movies about space travellers who encounter a "lost" civilization of nubile young women, not only in attractive dresses and perfect coiffures but also speaking perfect English.
If you haven't seen "Midsommer", then I recommend you to see it first (if you can) before "Solstice".
Not being the first to slate this movie I feel confident that my opinion is valid.
I remember when I first saw this and thought "Whoa, Rutger must be pretty embarrassed to have done this", well, he did get to do a pretty hot chick in this one, and it's surprisingly graphic, with only penetration the only part of the act not directly shown!
"Yeah, right," was the first thought that came to mind.
At first I half expected to see Leslie Nielsen appear, then it gradually dawned on me that this was supposed to be taken seriously.
This program first aired in the Uk about April last year (2006) and i sat down with a few friends, one of which was a major in the British army another is a TA officer (Uk equivalent of the national guard) who served in Iraq during the initial invasion.
All three of us had high hopes for the series having been impressed by the adverts we had seen on TV however the first action scene which takes place behind a large mound was so comical all three of us couldn't help laughing, they where only getting shot at from one direction and where barely outnumbered and not even out gunned yet they are behaving like they are all about to die!
I have watched quite a lot movies and can easily say this was a first.
I was a kid when I first saw it, but when it was on TV a couple years ago I realized how confusing it was because they're twins and you think both of them are equally hot, but Stew has the best hair, but Phil is better because the ranger girl wants to go out to the forest to eat worms (like the gross white maggot kinds!
Who said yes to this project in the first place?
The first rule of watching any sci-fi: suspend your disbelief.
I watched the first four episodes, because I wanted to like it, especially since Queer as Folk has yet to find a worthy replacement at the gay drama throne.
I don't know what the first few reviewers were watching, but this program is dreadful.
My partner and I forced ourselves to suffer the first season just to mock the characters.
Please, if this is your first foray into gay culture, run away!
The minimal cultural differences between Britain and the US begs the question as to why US actors were needed in this film in the first place.
ClichÃ©s galore in the first few minutes.
Whilst you can see the commercial logic in writing american characters into the lead roles, the unknown, ex-pat actors that Pratten cast, both deliver uncharismatic leaden performances and their characters are written in such a heavy handed, unsympathetic way that unfortunately this debut effort falls at the first hurdle.
Lewis made himself immortal among horror/cult cinema fanatics as "The Godfather of Gore"; a nickname he earned because he was the first one to direct horror movies where blood, guts and gore literally burst from the screen.
There's no actual story and particularly the first full hour of the film feels like a compilation episode of "America's Funniest Home Videos: The Bad Kids Edition".
At first their pranks are quite pitiable and laughable (wetting people with a garden hose, smearing pies in a salesgirl's faceÂ) but they gradually turn into harsh crimes and near the end of the film they even turned to gang-rape and murder.
And, like the first time, it seems to go on forever.
Also the movie has a deadly dull subplot involving Wilson and a high class call girl which just consistently slows the movie down, movies like Redemption need first of all fleshed out characters and lots of screen time for the important characters to the plot, however because the movie treats the main story like an afterthought the movie fails on its own ambitions and satisfies no one in the process.
Somehow we're meant to sympathize (since Sylvia does), but it's impossible to feel sorry for a silly fool's grand gesture over a cheap floozy who's not attractive or interesting enough to inspire such passion in the first place.
What can one say about a movie like this?I feel like I've been in a pillowfight,where all of the pillows were soaked in Ether.I can't believe anyone thought that this would be a good idea.Apparently some of those guys in Hollywood,drank too much wood alcohol during prohibition.I still can't believe I saw this.OK,imagine this,if you will:A Roy Roger's style western,complete with its stupid translucent plot line,extremely lame acting,pathetic special effects(assuming there are any),lousy stunts,silly slapstick comic relief,and horrific,lunatic singing.Now,shrink all of the characters down to 1/3 their normal size.And,Viola' you have,the Terror of Tinytown.Sort of a Roy Rogers on acid,if you will(or if you won't).Although, in all honesty, when I first saw the "cowboys" riding around on shetland ponies,I nearly busted a gut laughing so hard.But, other than that,its pretty much a waste of time.
The 100% midget gag wears pretty thin after the first couple of minutes.
I recommend watching the first two minutes and then fast forwarding through the rest.
After first seeing the very bellicose VALLEY OF THE DOLLS, I just finished watching THE TERROR OF TINY TOWN--purported to be the only all-midget Western ever made.
In a "Bevis and Butthead" sort of way, I suppose most people might smile when they first see the diminutive actors and actresses riding tiny ponies and acting like "normal" Western actors--though this enjoyment is a bit unsettling when you think about it!
This evaded me when it first came out.
The hero of the piece, Buck Lawson is played by Billy Curtis in his very first film role.
The first, and as far as I can tell / hope the last, all-midget musical western.
It's hilarious and jaw-dropping at first, making you wonder how the filmmakers got away with this.
The furnishings are nice - including the sets in the play within the play, the references to Goldoni, Pirandello and Heidegger obviously intrigued me when I first saw it, but the only reason to see this film is the appeal of the enthusiastic, vivacious, lovely, gracious Helene de Fougerolles - and it's not enough to watch this slow-moving unfunny dud.
While it may give you a high at first, the darkness of the inevitable 'sugar-low' is fast approaching and causing you to grab your stomach in disgust.
To make a deeply rooted character based film to work, you must first have exciting characters that you know your audience is going to want to follow.
is one such film, running at two-and-a-half hours, without any real purpose or entertainment value for the first two hours (!).
The first two hours of the film are a great displeasure to sit through, being dialogue-heavy with characters that are still "normal" in their actions and dialogue.
Dean, at first, feels that Lewis is terminal but soon reverses himself.
It was the first time I felt like I was watching a remake of a documentary!
Some people claimed that it was the first time this part of Lennon's life was shown in a documentary, but there was absolutely nothing in this film that hadn't been said elsewhere, be it on film or in a book.
A tribute to the smart people behind the movie, or to the gullibility of the public, always ready to reach for a Kleenex at the first hint of a troubled.
The first one was bad enough, and the short skirts, one take filming, and Jack Palance in funny hats just made me nauseous.
In this awful serving, which is a sequel to a film that I haven't(thankfully) watched(I actually saw the first movie to Cavedwellers, much to my horror), an idiot professor by the name of Tarl Cabot(what kind of stupid moniker is that, anyway?!)
And if this sequel is any indication, don't seek out the first "Gor" movie, not if you value your brain cells.
My theory: The producers of this film first made the movie "Gor".
This was the first episode that I not only didn't like, but actually hated.
Technially The Great American Snuff Film is pretty poor, the colour seems very bright during daytime shots which give it a distracting & unrealistic look & then there's the awful music which plays constantly during the first half of the film & to make things worse sometimes it's louder than the dialogue spoken by the actors which is not a good combination.
Horror movies buffs will be very disappointed with this flick.It is never never frightening,and the derivative screenplay borrows from "the exorcist" "Rosemary's baby" "the tenant" "the omen" and more.The first scenes ,notably the moment when the young couple enters their brand new flat (complete with a fountain in the yard) where a man committed suicide directly comes from Ira Levin/Roman Polanski 's story.All in all it is rather a -very soft -erotic movie where Lisa B. tries her best to be at once sexually attractive and threatening.The lines are very vulgar and use the word "f...." a lot more than they should.Do not bother.
Scare Tactics was entertaining for the first two minutes of each show when Shannen Doherty was on.
Rachel is apparently the one who caught Patrick Bateman and killed him when she was a young girl, something that was never mentioned anywhere in the first film.
And also, weren't the murders in the first film just a crazy dream the Patrick Bateman made up?
A fan of the first film and the novel that preceded this, I did not expect much from this film as neither the author of the book or director of the film was on board for this "sequel", let alone cast.
Related to the first film in name only, it has none of the style, the irony, nor the plot to say nothing of one shred of the acting.
She actually steals the first role from Denzel.
The way they attempt to link this movie to the first one should be a crime.
  This movie is absolutely nothing like the first one.
A sad, sad legacy for a very interesting first movie.
Where the first movie had humor (although a very dark kind of humor) and it's own kind of sick style that I think worked very well; this is just as weak as it can get.
All that differntiates from teen slashers is that we know who is doing the killings, but that was taken out of the "first".
Having not seen the first American Psycho, i thought this would be as good as the Psycho-series was said to be, but this was just a lousy sequel for a lousy series.
If I had watch it in isolation, I would have assumed that the first one was similar; but I assure you it is not.
In a work where it is used to serious effect we might tolerate the gross and extreme violence that begin with the very first frame ( a severed head ).
If you liked the first movie, don't see this.
It's the first time I feel this way about a movie, I just find it ridiculous.
For first it takes place in some kind of American college environment, and the head actress is Mila Kunis, that's the first warning sign.
The first thing that meets you in this film is a voice belonging to a darkhaired girl.
I guess they just wanted to make more money and fool people who liked the first.
Let this be a warning: If there is a sequel made by people who had nothing to with the first it's probably going to suck.
Let's first overlook the fact that the movie butchers physics- you would think they'd at least bring someone on staff that knows SOMETHING about wormholes etc.
There is nothing, I repeat, nothing connecting these two films together outside of a title and a slight beginning reference to a man that never should have existed in the first place Â one elusive Patrick Bateman.
Humor, satire, and violence here exist on a very elementary level--the "plot" (college girl kills to become a teacher's assistant) has no link, in tone or character, to anything established in the first film or book.
I'll rewrite the opening scene even if it contradicts the first movie .
The story centres around Rachael Newman who would have been about four years old during the events of the first film .
It's not even a plausible set up and it's not a plausible story in the first place .
If there is a book, maybe reading it first may give you some idea of what is happening in the movie.
The first time I see it I think surely its a set up that will pay off later.
I saw this only because it was Robert Altman's first film--he wrote, produced and directed it.
This is really of interest only as Altman's first film.
The first thing we saw was this freakin Chinese lady that was naked (she had pretty big boobies for a Chinese lady)she was dancing to rock music for like 10 min for the opening credits.
When I first got a copy of this film I was so excited.
At first glance he looks like the late Michael Hutchance from INXS.
I guess you could call this Nightmare on Elm Street meets Platoon, but that's an insult to Nightmare On Elm Street and I've never seen Platoon, but that's the first war movie that came to mind.
In the first scene, Cameron Smith has a red-hot metal rod pressed against his bare chest while he's tied between two posts, and in the second, Brian O'Connor -- tied between two trees -- has strips of barb-wire tightened around his naked torso.
This is not to say that the film is completely lacking quality - actually first time director Joby Harold does a decent job in directing a good team of actors that includes Hayden Christensen at his first major role after having taken off the Anakin Skywalker costume, fabulous Jessica Alba and super-gifted Lena Olin.
Hoping to do for operating tables what Final Destination did for planes, this first effort from director Joby Harold pivots on a blood-frosting conceit.
There are also minor back stories which your first instinct is to mostly ignore that become important later, such as his friendship with his surgeon (Terrence Howard) and his romance with a middle class girl (Jessica Alba).
The horror of being awake during anesthesia was done well at first.
I've been on the lookout for this film for over 25 years, since it was given the honor of inclusion on the first (and at the time, only) bad movie book, Harry Medved's The Fifty Worst etc.
There's a lot more I didn't like about the film, such as the countless times Menjou said to his talent scout "Basil, drop it" (it was funny the first time but not again and again) and the "Romeo and Juliet" song and dance number.
Since this movie was first made, it's been remade several times--and each time it is a total bore.
Laurel & Hardy, the two reasons why I wanted to watch this movie in the first place were buried under the amazingly childish story, bunch of foolish characters like Little Bo-Peep and Barnaby and a huge bunch of maddening songs.
It feels like a Tarantino rip off, and all but Tarantino's first couple movies are rip offs themselves (you can call it an "homage" all you want...the dude steals stuff and makes a few minor changes).
The first 45 minutes or so is totally pointless and is more akin to the movie Eurotrip than anything that would be considered scary (there's about 10-15 boob shots for every interesting part in this movie, if that).
The first half of the movie consists almost entirely of sex, talk of sex, drugs, and talk of drugs.
The last half or so of the movie actually starts to gain momentum, and the first half not been an entire waste of film, I could have walked away with more than a feeling that I'd just watched 15 minutes of an okay movie, and an hour and fifteen minutes of porn and senseless gore.
I am baffled as to why they decided to write the first half like they did.
They of course decide to go there and at first it seems the rumors were true.
Hostel is both longer and has, as it first seems, more story to build on.
This first section is littered with naked women, in what might just be the least sexy presentation of naked women anywhere.
The abrupt high-pitched finale recalls both Hooper's own earlier film and Wes Craven's THE HILLS HAVE EYES (1977) which, coincidentally, I watched the very same day as this one; as far as I'm aware, Michael Reeves' WITCHFINDER GENERAL (1968) was the first to use this highly effective practice Â concluding events on a downbeat tone despite the inherent happy endingÂ
The cast is forgettable as Mel Ferrer stars in his first of two movies titled "Eaten Alive" and Robert Englund makes his film debut as Buck who like to fu......fornicate.
The first 45 minutes of this was great, thanks to some wonderful cinematography, which is no surprise since it is directed by one of the best ever: David Lean.
I have had this film in my collection for a number of years and sat down last night to watch it for the first time - I should have left it on the shelf!!
I truly can't remember why I decided to watch this one; probably because it got regular attention when it first came out.
Had I not first seen the vastly superior original, I might have enjoyed this movie enough to sit through more than the first half and give it 4/10 stars.
Car Wash seems to have been an idea for a hit soundtrack first, the movie was an after-thought.
Maybe it was their first "romantic comedy".
OK, I admit that I only made it through the first half hour.
The movies first 30 minutes were so bad that I would not even give it the honor of having B movie status and the rest was so poorly acted due to the directing that you just wanted to shut the thing off.
What's the difference between Space Balls and Scary Movie 2, 3 and a lot of the first one.
BUT: why, oh why, can't they spend less on frills and more of the budget on a decent, respectable script; shouldn't that ALWAYS be the first priority?
The first film in 1980 was brilliant.
They were hired, in part, by Producer Michael Bay who walked out during the first screening saying there was 'too much sex'... LOL!
But he didn't know until the film was made and he was watching it for the first time?
But overall, if this were the first Ft13 that someone ever saw, then this 're-imagining' has left them confused as to what Jason's mother actually did and why Jason does.
I like nudity sprinkled into my slashers, but the amount of nudity and sex in this movie really makes you wonder just why in hell so much energy was put into the movie in the first place.
Killings are exaggerated, he/she would be dead when machete pierces their bodies in the first place.
The film is a remake of Friday the 13th, but effectively it's a mish-mash of ideas from the first few films of the series.
The plot involving Jason's mother is briefly skipped over in the first few minutes as the producers knew they couldn't market a movie without Jason Voorhees in it.
As well, the first 15 minutes of the film are strong, summarizing the plot of the first two films (Mother's massacre, Jason's revenge) and showing Jason as a stronger, meaner killing machine.
My first complaint lies in the structure of the story.
The first thirty minutes or so of prologue lend nothing but confusion as to where the story is going.
When we find out after the first group of murders who has been kept alive and how they are connected to the second story line (Clay's search for his sister), I had spent so much time being repulsed by the group of friends that I really had no emotional stake (re: I couldn't even remember the character's name) in whether the girl lived or died.
My second complaint lies with I expect that there will be the obtuse sex, drinking, and drugs in any "campy" horror film like this, but these first 30 minutes were so packed with inane boobs and weed shots that I was ready to consider this a comedy, not a horror film.
Lastly, although I could probably keep complaining about this film, Jason is absolutely NOT SCARY in the first half of this movie.
Essentially, the new "Friday the 13th" synthesizes Sean S. Cunningham's above-average original along with Steve Minor's first and second gratuitous sequels to deliver the maximum amount of mayhem.
Incidentally, the first "Friday the 13th" helped launch the slasher genre a couple of years of John Carpenter's mildly bloody "Halloween."
The problem with the new "Friday" is Nispel disposes of Mrs. Voorhees in the first few moments without giving the dame her due.
Our deformed killer dispatches them with extreme prejudice in the first 30 minutes.
The first Friday the 13th., 1980, was just an American re-hash of horror master Mario Bava's Bay of Blood, 1971.
Don't forget the original "Valentine's Day Massacre" just released, also uncut for the first time ever.
The first few minutes of the movie were incredible.
The elements that they took from the first four movies were there, and yes I said 'Four' movies.
So I guess it must be the screenwriter, and maybe the producers, if they agreed that the finished product was what they wanted in the first place.
Suffice to say: forget about the films in all cases, and Sr. PÃ©rez-Reverte himself is the first to veto these films.
- 1992 directed by Pedro Olea and worth a watch), El Club Dumas, La Tabla de Flandes, and La Piel del Tambor, as well as the 'CapitÃ¡n Alatriste' series Â all available in English (am not certain about the first title being in English) and probably in French and German, as well as other languages.
Naturally Danny DOES find it first, but his proved ability to lose important artifacts and not, you know, take basic precautions secures the fact that Sinclair gets it anyway and gets the powers and ahoy, the CGI demons.
Their interest is, however, scientific, except for the legionnaire buddy who is more interested in gold statuettes accidentally getting lost in his greatcoat pockets (Having mentioned the legionnaire, I must say that I admire the courage of the scriptwriter, who reveals to us -for the very first time- that Egypt was at the time a French protectorate, and not, as we've been led to believe by the official history, associated to the British empire)  The bad guys stick to the old, slow, boring system of studying the terrain and excavating carefully according to old Ieroglyphs, while our hero and his friends discover the tomb the legendary grave by happily throwing dynamite sticks at random: a new path is opened thus for archeology.
Every single action the agents make, for the first half of the film, is narrated, explained, praised, and explained again for good measure.
A first for me that he has not shone.
"The Survivors" could have been a really special film had director Ritchie reigned in and restrained Williams some and having the script go through major overhauls instead of looking like they shot a first draft.
Neverwhere is not as disconcertingly podunk as the BBC Chronicles of Narnia (think the letter from the wolf in the first installment), but it is in the running.
If that was true, why were they being paid to do it in the first place?
I was one who picked up the book first and then went to the series.
Well, the first few seconds were so excruciatingly bad, I was seriously hoping it was preview for something else.
I forced myself to sit through half of the first disk, since I pad good money for it, but that was it.
OK first things first, everything just looked so fake, it was the most pointless movie i ever had to watch , there was barley any story line and the main character looked about 40 at the start anyway, then wen she got changed to look older .
Though this certainly isn't the first film whose would-be couples are one-dimensional cardboard cutouts with nothing in common, this oral assault sequence that uses 'love' as a justification is something I find frankly disturbing.
At first the idea of of a world where "gay" is normal and "straight" is "perverted" seemed silly but interesting.
The first characters disappear without ever really showing us anything about their disappearance.
For his first two films Ken Curtis ("Gunsmoke") calls on special effects whiz Ray Kellogg (The Green Berets, The Killer Shrews) to direct his own story.
Lowest point of the film is when one of the town's leading idiots tries to sing a stupid song while pathetically twanging a ukulele, first for a crippled little girl, then for a group of moronic teenagers.
The film looks as if it was made by a group of high school students after they had got their first movie camera.
The transfer to DVD is rather basic - no letterbox, a bit dark and very little in the way of special features - but despite disgust at the fact that the film hasn't been digitally remastered and given more than a bargain-basement DVD presentation, I love the film itself every bit as much as I did the first time I saw it.
It may have been the first noir, but that alone doesn't make it a classic.
Thanks to the foolish way the story is plotted we already know what happened in the first 5 minutes of the film!
And then it hit me, they must have shown them the preview first.
The catalyst for the film's intrigue, a couple of stolen letters that one of our protagonists pilfers from a rare books library, is only the first of many weak moments that in the transition from text to screen lose any plausibility.
"A Strange Adventure" was directed by William Witney, the first of a few J.D.
but this clichÃ© laden namby pamby cutesy thing is the first time I give a NEGATIVE number on the plausibility meter.
George and Evelyn and Michael are cornered in  the professor's office and George is the first to die as he martyrs  himself for his family.
Even the guy who has the first confrontation with the zombies looks like he is maybe going to have something cool happen, the zombie has his hands wrapped around the guy's face, does he crush his head, gouge his eyes, try to eat his brain?
I could have watched the first 5 minutes of this movie, then left and come back for the last 3 minutes and not missed a thing.
Rent it if you really want it but you will be regretting it if you buy this movie without seeing it first.
The second looks like it will be even worse than the first.
Particularly the first of the 3 episodes is dated and the SFXs are really not good.
Well, first, the cheap special effects.
at first i thought 'nasaan ka man' might be one of those progressive new filipino films.
first of all, since when is it okay to have sex with adopted family?
Well, the director, master craftsman Robert Anderson, who also has credits The Young Graduates and The Hoax (not the Richard Gere one, remember that for the exam), movies no one but his wife has probably seen, and so with Cindy and Donna, his first film, he puts everything he knows into his art... which means, basically, we get a scene like when Donna is totally 'doing it' with her pot dealer in the car at night, and Cindy is looking on but, you know, the angle of the car is so radical so that there's no way Cindy is looking in on the car that the angle of the camera is and... Maybe I'm getting ahead of myself, this is, after all, Grade-X trash that has basically no value; a Cinemax late-night flick probably has better production value, and maybe slightly worse music than the repetitive garage rock here.
In episode eight: Why did they give Mazamette's child a gun, and why did they originate such an elaborate scheme to arrest the bad guy in the first place?
At first, killing the graboids is relatively easy for Bassett and Grady, but after a little trouble, they enlist the help of gun fanatic Burt Gummer (Michael Gummer).
The first thing that is noticeable about Tremors 2 is that it has the look of a theatrical release.
This movie is witty and funny for the first half an hour, but afterward it is completely boring, it's the same action repeated over and over until the movie ends, only the prostitute in the scene is different.
The whole production, from sets to camera movement, to acting, comes off like something made by a few twelve-year-old kids with their first camera.
I could almost forgive him... almost... if this was his first film.
This was the first time ever I felt like asking Blockbuster for my money back.
At first I was impressed by his insight into his sexual needs.
As for where the film goes wrong, I suppose I'll start with the music first.
On first watch, the college-wide cover-ups of the death which led up to event like the reporter getting hooked me, and make me actually think that it was somewhat decent.
Who cares what happened to any of the characters; perhaps it would have been better if they all expired within the first 5 minutes and thus spared the viewer for lame dialog and a tremendously boring story.
first of all, i live in a town a stones throw from the ferry to shelter island.
The first Ginger was better written!
We know what's coming just by looking at the first scenes of the dinner party.
When Penn is first introduced in the story he starts to meander and mutter about "being good on the eyes" and then starts to really babble like an idiot.
In most of their scenes together they came across so absurd that you at first thought that the scenes were badly done out-takes that for some reason or mistake, or maybe even practical joke, ended up getting edited back into the movie.
If you are about to watch it for the first time please just forget about it.
The real question which buzzes in my head all the time and maybe I'll sleep better if I found its answer is WHY did they make this whole absurd movie in the first place ??
Mostly it is notable for what happened off camera as Lucy and Desi made their first connection.
During the first 45 minutes I thought that this movie wouldn't be as bad as most other movie of this genre.
You know exactly what will happen to everyone in the very first 10 minutes of this film.
The first part is very funny and original but by the time Inspetor Clouseau dies there is no comedy what so ever.
OK this is the 2nd appearance of The Pink Panther even though there were several other titles with that name it has nothing to do with it it was only in for a cameo where someone steals it and Cluesau is kidnapped (after the abomination of the first one I'm celebrating) and some journalist asks questions about Cluesau (Cluesau isn't in this one only in Archive Footage I know a complete ripoff even though so was the rest of the series) and they ask even Charles the real "Phantom" makes an appearance we see Clueseau's childhood and all this other crap which has nothing to do with anything if the journalist was really an author writing bio's about detectives who are so stupid it isn't funny (the only other thing in that category is FAMILY GUY) OK Clueseau isn't found.
NOTHING at all was funny after the first half.
Before the first half were admittedly some funny parts, mostly left over material from "Strikes Again" (I thought the car lighter scene was funny and also the scene on the plane).
The first half which Sellers is in excels (even though one can easily tell that all his scenes are just deleted scenes), but once he's gone, every goes downhill.
Oddly enough, this was the first Pink Panther film I ever saw.
Although this film was clearly a bad idea from the beginning, the first half actually isn't too bad.
Somehow it didn't stop director Blake Edwards from coming up with a hapless idea in making a series of posthumous flops, the first being the Trail of the Pink Panther that I comment about.
Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Lom)is at first overjoyed - he may finally be rid of Clouseau - but soon enough he begins to suspect that he will see his former colleague again, and his debilitating obsessions return.
The first half of the film, prior to Clouseau's disappearance, hang together well-enough - but it is very clear that we are seeing a film which has been loosely cobbled together from a collage of material.
To make matters worse, David Niven (who starred in the very first Panther movie) is back despite the fact that he's almost dead!
This film is made up of bits and pieces of film that they found on the cutting room floor, that didn't belong in their first movie, and don't belong in this one.
Supposedly, for the third time in the series, the actual "Pink Panther", the stone that Claudia Cardinale was struggling to hold onto in the first film, is the center of a robbery - a successful one.
Martin will shortly be seen in a sequel to his first "Pink Panther" film.
For the first half of the film, as it actually attempts to make some sort of a story involving the theft of the Pink Panther, this movie almost works.
From the first scene in the movie I knew I was in for a bad time.
Other than these two leads being so weak, the story is such that anybody with any sense at all can tell who the killer is within the first 15 minutes.
I say this because I told my brother the whole plot ending at the first commercial break when we were watching the original 1966 broadcast as pre-teens.
For one, the film's audience must accept that adopting a child or inseminating a young wife are less harmonious actions to a newlywed's continued happy home life than the notion of pushing a husband (who truly does not desire to remarry) to marry an additional wife for breeding purposes with the resulting children being emotionally commandeered by the first wife while the biological mother (second wife) still lives on in the home with no deep attachment to either children or husband.

Both "Legend of Boggy Creek" (1972) and the first film entitled "Sasquatch" (1978) have become minor cult classics, but neither were very memorable.
"Harry & The Hendersons" (1987) was the first big budgeted film to use Bigfoot, with a terrific creature design by Rick Baker.
He should be as there is no action to speak of for the first hour of the film.
The first 5 minutes of the film is either blurry or shaky or out of focus!
Alright, about my rating first: I realize that this movie is not 10/10 quality, for it is a good one, but we have all seen better.
And it actually generates some suspense at first.
I remember when we got the first photos back from the set we were all talking about how much of a shame it was that this creature was in a movie that would probably be pretty poor.
Obviously you didn't have to be a genius to figure out who would be pulling off all their clothes by the middle of the movie, or who'd be the first unlucky soul to get mauled by Mr. Sasquatch.
From the powerful eroticism of their first coitus to the awkward moments that follow to their comical character flaws to the poignancy of their revelations as the night comes to an end, the film does not judge its characters nor indulges itself in haughty romantic notions or cheap sentimentality.
Brigitte (Emily Perkins) destroyed the werewolf that was her sister at the end of the first movie.
I was tired of him in the first 15 minutes and i was tired of this unoriginal plot.
  At first it might not have seemed like such a bad idea to remake this movie again.
I insist that we read the original play and watch the 1962 version first.
first of all, i was expecting way more gore.
It's a darkly lit room and only takes place in one room with no additional scenery so it has a little of a claustrophobic feel to it at first but the fairly weak script is delivered well in word and expression from it's two talented and attractive cast members Blanca Lewin as Daniela and Gonzalo Valenzuela as Bruno.
The first film I saw from him was the eighth part, Hellworld, and I don't rate it too highly - however, it's certainly the best one he's done.
Hellseeker sees the return of Ashley Laurence to the series in the role of Kirsty, and the good news is that she still has the charming good looks that made her role in the first two films so good.
The plot sees Laurence killed in the first few seconds, and we then follow her husband (played by someone called Dean Winters) as the world around him is turned on its head.
The problem with this film is that its lacking in what made the first 2 films popular.
This is my first "review" here, so I apologize if I start to ramble.
The acting is subpar at best, even compared to B-movies, even Ashley Lawrence, who did an excellent job in the first two films, delivers an underwhelming performance, let alone the job done by the protaganist Trevor.
I am a huge Hellraiser fan, I own the first 5 on DVD, but I somehow doubt that I'll be purchasing this one, maybe ask for it as a gift (but only to complete my collection.)
I kept doubting it, and I guessed the ending (mainly because a flashback in the first 20 minutes showed it)and was happy she lived.
I'm a GIANT fan of the original story by Clive Barker and I think the first two Hellraisers were the greatest horror films ever to be produced.
The first hour of this film is a series of hallucinations and illogical dream-sequences.
If you manage yourself to struggle through the first hour, you'll see a more or less satisfying ending.
From being two total strangers having sex at first (They can't even remember each other's names!
The talk starts sloppily at first, but soon they get all the big topics covered.
Vega Paz is more clearly understood, and she doesn't speak a word of English for the first half of the movie.
The first is to show the plight of Mexican immigrants in their effort to realize economic betterment while concurrently maintaining their cultural identity.
Let me tackle the problematic second part first.
This leaves us with the movie's first agenda item, the fearful assimilation of immigrant Latinos.
This will not be the first thing we're gonna watch of him, so lets put all eyes on, he have such a great talent!
Who said that one must have a screen play first and then add the images to make a film?
How about having visual images first and then thinking about what narrative can build out of the images?
Well, the Mexican director JonÃ¡s CuarÃ³n's first feature AÃO UÃA is exactly such an experiment.
Viewers have to remain patient for the first few minutes (as the film begins slowly with a sequence of his beautifully shot photos) before the story gradually unfolds.
In one of the early episodes (maybe the first episode), Oral and his family are on their way to church, listening to some kind of supposedly Christian radio station.
"When first I became one of the New Anarchists I tried all kinds of respectable disguises.
When on my first appearing in episcopal gaiters in a drawing-room I cried out in a voice of thunder, 'Down!
-- G.K. Chesterton, _The Man Who Was Thursday_, Chapter II  See also:  Chesterton fans will probably remember when Chesterton's priest-detective, Father Brown, first interacts with the great criminal Flambeau, who was disguised as a priest.
I bought into the hype and watched Moral Orel when it first premiered.
Crush and Smash start the match and get the first pin on Bret making it 1-0 to Demolition.
The Hulkamania thing became stale from here as we enter another 'clash of the titans' type match featuring the typical Hogan can't slam big guy the first time but does the second time type thing.
There's lots of high contrast light and moving camera, which is pretty standard by the late 40s, but is one of the reasons to watch in the first place.
I wondered whether perhaps it was all a big joke at first.
Following the first half hour, we still had no real clue what was going on, we thought maybe it would improve and that we had not lost the plot.
Valentine instead looks dozy most of the time and says the first thing he can think of.
You would think all this would bring you a half way decent western, but I think the Bakersfield Ca sun got to them first!
Indeed the point of the first two, is their wanting to maintain that distance.
From the first second to the last the movie was a continued and foolish cut and paste of scenes that always seemed disconnected among them.
Most of the first hour or so of this movie was dull, boring and unnecessary...if not for my wife asking me questions, I think I would have fallen asleep.
I know this film got superb reviews, which is why I rented it in the first place.
There are some nice Gore effects in the werewolf victims, but it's never on a 'Braindead' level, so it always looks realistic, while Bridgets transformation is as great as Gingers in the first 1, kinda reminding of The Fly, not the original but the gory remake.
overall together with the first one my favorite part, i mean normally i'm not a fan of little girls in movies, and i hate it most if the director wants to force you into still liking her after she killed humanity or some sort of that, like the children in 28 Weeks later who have just wiped out our world and humanity, hated them right from the beginning, while i even liked Ghost after we learned about her, i mean it's quite a feat playing at the end a little murder girl and still appearing genuinely innocent, but i think it's the way her illness makes her into believing what she does.
I found this movie so disappointing that it inspired me to write this, my first review.
However, considering the repetitive nature of this film, only the first murder could really be considered "shocking".
As a great fan of Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell's original graphic novel and an admirer of the Hughes Brothers, I had rather high hopes for "From Hell" when first I heard of its production.
So again we sat back and waited for that moment to come again and we figured wow if it was so interesting for the first Â½ hour it would no doubt be even better later on!
I like Randolph Scott Westerns, but I am the first to admit they all were not gems.
Why didn't they run with the first three shots?!
Within the first ten minutes of this movie I was bored, insulted, and disgusted by the crude (even for a made-for-t.v.
I have watched this movie and in the first 10 minutes Nina(the lead actress) utters "KALI F*****G Maa" about an Indian Goddess..hows that justified..no1 can address a goddess like that..and most of all not an ABCD like Nina..  Have had no idea what Mr.Krutin Patel had in mind while adding that part to the screen play..
If it is aimed at first generation immigrants, then it would only scare them by preying on traditional fears of westernization.
You'd think after the first one crushed it, he would at least withdraw his leg but NNOO that would ruin the joke!
I guess he just had some bills to pay so he took the first script someone showed him.
However, from almost the first few minutes this movie is a bomb!
The best part of the movie happens in the first 5 minutes.
Apart from the basic premise of why the time travellers were coming back in the first place - which is pretty good SF notion.
Things which seemed odd the first time round becoming obvious the second.
I was very disappointed with the movie when I first saw it (but not as much as now) as there are few movies that come from true sci-fi writers (Hugo winners and the like) and I was really looking forward to it.
The movie captured me when it started but when the first plane crashed, the movie crashed.
The short stories first, you will be blown away.
The first two Texas Chainsaw films are great, and I really enjoyed them.
It isn't the first time I've been disappointed in HIS opinion - or what he's paid to say.
I couldn't decide from the first few minutes of the film - is this a trailer for a movie or a very long flashback sequence?
From the very first scene, less than 10 seconds into the movie, you know that you're in for a wild time of melodrama, overacting, bad script, and really bad set design/location and costume.
At first, I thought this film was a comedy, then I realized they were trying to be serious.
From the first scene, it felt like something I would see if I handed a camera to a couple of horny old men and watched them go into my backyard and starting filming something which I cannot put into words.
So, although I love John Sayles (Matewan and Eight Men Out were unbelievably terrific movies), and although this movie did come first, I would avoid it like a dead skunk in the middle of the road.
If this was his first movie, it is a tribute to Sayles that he learned many important lessons from it.
John Sayles has written and directed some of my favourite movies, but his head must have been in the toilet (along with that plunger in the tedious first scene) for this one.
When i first saw the tcm i was on the edge of my seat.
For me, that was the first glaring mistake.
When I first learned of "The Bribe," I was very impressed with the cast.
First, approximately the first half of it is told in flashback with near-constant narrative by Robert Taylor.
So, with practically no help from the dialog, Perkins carries the entire first half of the film as the lonely, doomed Brigitte, bereft of Ginger, and bitterly fighting her own animalistic changes.
The difference in Brigitte's character after the traumas she suffered in the first movie are both believably sad and shocking, showing that Perkins is an actress of the highest caliber.
I watched the first episode and couldn't believe my eyes.
First there was dragonball, then came DRAGONBALL Z which showed(I don't know if it was a first run or a rerun) in my country in 2000.
People's minds tend to get clouded by the fact that Dragonball Z was so influential or might have been one of the first anime they ever watched(and thus introduced them to anime in general) that they remember only the good points and overlook the numerous jarring flaws of the series.
Whether it's the first victim twitching uncontrollably after being clubbed on the head with a lump-hammer, witnessing the next being hung on a meat-hook or watching poor old Sally being held down to be 'whacked' by a cadaverous old man, the nightmarish images of Hooper's movie will stay with you long after the film has finished.
If this woman were your marriage counselor, you'd be looking for a new one mid-way through your first 45 minutes.
I felt this way from the first episode.
A genuinely first rate supporting cast has been assembled around her from the always charming Clark Gregg as her long suffering ex husband, Richard Campbell, to Hamish Linklater as her refreshingly laid-back brother/nanny Matthew and even the fresh faced Trevor Gagnon as her (thus far dramatically unchallenged) son Ritchie Campbell (destined for a lifetime of therapy with this horror of a "mother").
She almost saves it from being an unalloyed half hour exercise in unfunny misogyny and the only nearly unwatchable entrant in an otherwise first rate Monday night comedy lineup on CBS.
"Christine" has been something like a female Kramer, embodying the worst nightmares of any acquaintance we've ever had from the very first episode.
To the extent this ...CHRISTINE remains on the CBS schedule, it may be the first commercially successful right wing attempt at "satire."
It started off pretty lame but left some hope for improvement at first.
Over-the-top sex farce by John Waters is funny throughout the first half of the movie but loses the story and just uses sex pranks and disgusting stuff to fill up the last half.
If you are already offended by a naked breast in a movie, than you certainly shouldn't watch this one, because it will probably give you a heart attack from the first minutes on.
Any self-respecting black tribe in Africa will bow down at the first white person who walks along.
I remember watching this for the first time and how utterly freaked out I was.
It went beyond most slasher films, especially the first two deaths, a couple called Kirk and Pam.
Happening upon the dreaded house almost by accident, first Kirk goes inside and is immediately murdered with a sledgehammer to the head.
This was the first movie in a long time that I was sorry I went to.
Some people, who have never seen it before, wonder what's so great about it after watching it for the first time, well, this is probably because TCM is the most copied movie of all time and TCM will look too familiar to newbies.
Here's the spoiler, because I have to identify it: once you see the first ten minutes you know how the film will end.
I think Freddie is great looking guy so for his fans yes this is a good watch, but if there is another movie on the shelf that you would also like to see, get that one first this can wait.
The plot and the jokes are pretty much recycled from the first movie.
The first movie was good, it was a cult classic.
The french translation of the first movie was a masterpiece.
I still say that the french translated version of the first is better then the original English version (both are good in their own ways)  Here tho we get a bad attempt from the dubbing company to recapture the magic of the original french translation but all we get is a badly translated movie.
I'm a huge fan of the first movie.
Maybe have them moving to Florida like the Newman made up in the first movie.
The Hanson Brothers were fantastic in the first movie and they clearly did this movie for a paycheck.
($100 dollar bills raining from the sky will happen first before another sequel ever does thanks to this one.)
Indeed the first shot proper that opens the movie, that of a rotten head and as the camera zooms out we see the whole dead body in a grotuesque posture like some sort of zombified jester sitting atop a gravestone, offers no clue and safe grip for the viewer.
The first encounter with notorious chainsaw-wielding Leatherface is as disorienting as anything that comes before it.
The first assertion is clearly wrong.
They are certainly not the model of men two fell in love at the first site.
Add to the fact that Franklyn is the the only character in the film to come close to communicating with, and in a sense, relating to, one of the Sawyers(Who starts up a genial, at first, conversation about knives and killing with the Hitchhiker); and it becomes more disturbing.
As that stands, it may not be the first slasher film, as it's often called, but the last, and best 'Old Dark House with a homicidal but oddly funny family' type of film ever made.~
As the first of its kind, this movie set the mold for the modern horror film, though none were ever to realize any comparable distinction.
Google for Jack and Jennifer clips (and Steve and Kayla) and you will come across a goldmine of clips that will tell you the entire story of the Johnson family - from Steve's arrival onto the show to Jack and Jennifer's first wedding.
It is a good idea for any director to first study the culture and mentality of a country before staining the name of a whole nation.
...perhaps in a first year film school nightmare??...
After the night in Brighton, the couples simply race home again, making the second half of the film just as unfunny and boring as the first half.
I didn't feel that way at first, though.
At first I couldn't believe how awful it was!
Many people refuse to watch this movie in the first place because of what they've heard and because of the title.
At first, with such horrendous acting and Bats getting crotch-zapped (while wearing a rubber suit?)
The first line of dialogue in this indie short is Batman saying "Not a good idea" and that accurately sums up the whole project.
I guess I can see the point this guy was trying to make, but first why did it have to be Batman who ended up making a mistake?
Not bad for Tobe Hoopers' first effort.
Well, that is if you squint REALLY hard and maybe get REALLY drunk first and hit yourself on the head with a frying pan, and,...
I decided to get this movie for my annual Hallowe'en scarefest, a week early...as the new one was out in theatres, I felt a need to see the original first, and bow am I glad I did...
I think Hooper must have had some divine inspiration, because each of Leatherface's scenes is exquisitely planned and executed, from the first guy who gets dragged down, to Pam, to the encounter with Franklin and Sally in the woods (how chilling and scary was that, and yet how clever, to chase someone in the woods equipped with...a chainsaw) to the end.
How it even got made in the first place is beyond me.
How come people are giving budgets to people to make bad films when there are plenty of creative talented directors out there struggling to make their first feature?!
The big part of the story is told in flash back Â in two episodes, each in first and second half.
There is not special in Ghajini.A copy of Memento Movie which far better with style.The Tamil Director has made the movie in the Indian way has the medical student searching for the character who has the problem amnesia.The flashback tells that the rich man who loves the girl till the end of first half does not tell her till he reveals the secret.The villain will come and hit the hero in the head when the heroine gets killed during the incident he losses consiousness.Avenging the twin villains will be done like Matrix in the climax Watch the English version better than this one.
I saw this movie and was impressed first only for one reason .The new concept of short term memory loss .But then later when I saw the original one Memento I was totally awestruck by how beautifully the screenplay was done ,you in fact live with the character ,which you can never feel for once in Ghajini .Well thats not the only flaw the whole brilliance and intelligence of Mememto is diminished in Ghajini .
For example, the animals charmed by Tamino's first outing for the flute look like mangy, rejected extras from Planet of the Apes.
Before I start I did watch this movie twice, i didn't like it at all when I saw for the first first then watched it watched it second, i did find it bit more funny then before.
But, as I was on my first (of several) viewings, those I have introduced to this movie have been bowled over by the quality of the film-making, and the filmic techniques (soundtrack, editing, startling images) used by Hooper to capture his "waking nightmare" on screen.
For a supposed action film, THE ROCKETEER features precious little action and spends way too much time on plot exposition during the first half of the movie.
What possible reason would Christie's character have for wanting to return to her dismal reality after her first time through?
Mo was unremarkable, but then that's just how I remember him from the first book.
Roxane (who is never even fleetingly mentioned in the first book IIRC) had black hair!
The script just rushed through the first 80% of the book in what barely seemed like half an hour, skipping anything that would have helped in either understanding the characters (or even the plot) or building up atmosphere, just to close with a completely tacked-on, contrived new ending that killed any hope for a (better) sequel.
The first scene in the film depicts a desecrated grave with a voiceover of radio newscast, immediately followed by an opening credits sequence set against a backdrop of roaring solar flares.
I went to see this when it first came out at my local cinema, I was excited about the movie it looked like it could have been great.
The people I saw the movie with knew what kind of ending they were in for from the first 10 minutes of the movie.
It should be noted that the first Inkheart book is by far the weakest in the trilogy and after I finished it I was on the fence as to whether I was going to finish the series.
I really, really don't care and they shouldn't went on TV to air their dirty laundry in the first place.
STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning   Six years ago, I wrote my first review of The Maury Povich Show (or Maury as it is now known) and the main thing I could think to write of it was 'sad.'
This has gone from being a 'sad' show to a truly pathetic show and it says a lot about society that six years after my first review it's still going on and it will nearly have been on air for twenty years!
The first, and most popular form, is the paternity test/ baby daddy drama type episodes.
These reared their ugly head slowly at first, coming on the show once a week.
I was not sure what was wrong with the guy for the first half of the hour long movie, than just waited for him to snap.
I realize the main character had problems, but really... who goes skinny dipping just after meeting their fiancÃ©'s parents for the first time.
I did like the way the characters were introduced and at first I had no trouble getting into them, but again, as the movie progressed, I couldn't understand what the characters were trying to do.
2) Owing, in part, to the first reason, it is boring.
you can be fooled by your first impressions.
as in, the first time i saw this movie i was bedazzled by the idea of it (first of all, i love black comedies).
While at first I thought I would miss Ginger, I realized her parts in this were pretty superfluous and could've been left out, since Bridgette was very capable of handling the film on her own.
This one was much more depressing than the first, which in my book is never a bad thing.  
It's not nearly as original or powerful as the first version.
Throughout the entire movie I kept thinking that it reminded me of another project, but couldn't put my finger on it...and then it dawned on me that the whole thing has the feel of a 1950s TV Western...it especially reminded me of the way the first season of "The Rifleman" was shot.
I saw it tonight for the first time, but just wasn't very impressed.
Themes include: crime does not pay; the inability to get a job after being released from prison (Travis was not guilty of the first crime); overcoming adversity to do the right thing (the hero must and does get rewarded for his efforts); and loyalty to friends vs. duties to family.
When a film is titled "Dracula's Widow", and we see the title character seducing and killing a guy within the first 5 minutes, what's the point of having nearly half the running time taken up by a police investigation that can only eventually lead to what we already know from the start?
This was the first "Dracula" attempt by a Coppola family member, Christopher's famous (and usually brilliant) uncle Francis came along with a kitschy and over-hyped mainstream Dracula film in 1992.
Robert Blake, George Peppard, Rip Torn, Harry Guardino, Woody Strode, Martin Landau (his first role), Gavin MacLeod, Harry Dean Stanton, Clarence Williams III - if made ten years later, this film would have cost millions more and in truth been impossible to produce.
If you want to have any hope of enjoying the movie, DO NOT read the book first.
They were the first guardians of our National Parks like Yosemite and the Presideo at San Francisco, where many are burried, in honor.
The military is the first called for disaster relief and humanitarian aid missions.
When the tsunami hit Indonesia, devestating the region, the US military was the first on the scene.
If you've never seen "It Happened One Night"... go see it first!
But if you happen to see "Eve Knew Her Apples" first... just don't, okay!?
While protagonist Darkside is an empty focal point who is easily disregarded following his first few lines, the growth and depth of Mai, Selia, and Tatsuya is relatively decent given the plot's short time span and this almost balances the story's lackluster qualities.
With the lacking script and C movie performance (I thought at first it might be a porno film) it took me 3 days to watch.
Sure, the Eastwest "pan and scan" person probably was asleep when this cropping atrocity was perpetrated, but that doesn't explain the poor dubbing, poor acting, poor plotting, silly exploration of the landlady's attic by first a cigarette lighter and then a struck match (what DID happen to Julie's landlady, and, more importantly, WHY?
I think I've voted on over 100 films here, this is the first time I ever gave a "1".
I fell asleep watching this thing and don't know how it ends, but I'm sure the last half hour was as bad as the first part of the film.
When I first saw the raptors, I was immediately reminded of Turok.
it don't make sense i mean I've seen some goofy special effect tricks in my day but this has to be 1 of the worst ones I've ever seen man its just stupid i mean even i could tell it was fake when i saw the first Raptor man i mean i know all effects is fake but when u can even tell its fake first off then ya thats bad  another thing that i laughed about this movie is wat one of the other guys said about SEALS pose to be a crack shot and then in this movie they don't even aim at nothing and half the rounds they fire r misses man ?
An added bonus is George Shibata, the first Japanese-American graduate of West Point, who plays Lt Ohashi.
Actually the first sign that we're in heavy clichÃ© territory is the score which could be swapped out with almost any other similar film with no loss whats so ever.
Firstly, I have no recollection of this being set in America (in fact the first book in the series is set in Cornwall...
I don't care, that is the first thing that has ruined it for me.
Secondly - and in relation to my first point - This is set in the country side, in a little village (again in England) which gives it that fantastic air to it, of seclusion and intensity.
This is my first comment on IMDb and I felt I had to do it as a public service.
Probably the first time I ever felt I wanted to leave the cinema during a film.
I just hope that people new to this series will want to read the books if the first taste they have is this abysmal looking film.
I first came across this sequence of books as an eleven-year-old boy myself, in 1980, 7 years after the book on which the eponymous book was published.
As Executive Producer Gregory Peck is said to have had the original 20 minutes of the film cut from the theatrical final version because he wasn't in it and felt too much time would be spent before the star of the film makes his on first screen appearance.
This one doesn't have the sustained thematic focus of the first, but all in all it's as twisted, watchable, and occasionally amusing as fans of the series would hope.
As I said, it's not the out-and-out allegory that the first film was, but there are rich satiric moments, flashes of wit (Brigitte's discovery of her hairy palms comes to mind), and nice nods to werewolf-movie convention, with the finale taking place in a remote cabin in the snowy woods.
At one point, Will's younger sister discovers her brother's power first hand when she accidentally travels through time with him.
The first 20 minutes or so have hope and the promise of wonder, then the movie just kind of craps out and loses interest in itself.
I have not read this book, but I have a feeling that this adaptation is missing what made the story so interesting in the first place.
I was beside myself with glee when I first heard of this movie.
Although when i first watched the film i liked it.
Attempts at characterization include a black guy who dies first and a sexy/tough lesbian who masturbates while watching another couple have kinky sex through one-way glass.
The movie even eluded to how much it was going to suck by the first scene where the actor says "nobody watches shows about alligators" (paraphrased).
The only way my friends and I could continue to watch after the first hour was to MST3K it, shouting comments at our TV screen that at least kept us amused.
This film's structure, at least for the first half is very similar to the classic bad film, REEFER MADNESS.
About the only interesting things about it were how silly it all became and to see both a down-and-out Lyle Talbot as well as Jack Elam in his first film.
Except for Jack Elam in one of his very first screen roles; he actually was a rather good looking guy back then.
It's hard to take seriously today of course, and I really wish there were some folks around from the era who could tell us first hand how these flicks were received back in the day.
It reminded me of the very first and just about only time I tried pot myself.
There is not one single good thing I can say about this, which is honestly the first time I have been in this situation.
After I had finished DBZ I heard about DBGT and I was so happy that they continued after with DBGT, I then watched the first episode of DBGT...
I didn't really know what to think at first, I decided to continue watching until i had seen just about all of the episodes (and that was hard work).
Then the show hit and all the great things that the first two held was gone.
The casting is this movie's first major problem, and the writing is the second.
Like, in the end "I'm going to take you to your first night club!"
Also this is my first review ever.
The first murder-sequence also comes at the exact right timing and it's quite bloody, especially considering the tone of the film so far.
This first sequel isn't quite as good as the original, but there's still much to like about it.
The story follows Brigitte, the more weird and less sexy of the two sisters from the first film who is now changing into a werewolf herself.
Making a welcome return from the first film is the parallels that are drawn between turning into a werewolf and being a teenager.
One thing that this film definitely has over the original is the werewolf effects; they were terrible in the first film and really let it down, but here they seem to have taken influence from Dog Soldiers and look much better for it.
The tragedy of the first film was brought to a head by way of it's brilliant and heartbreaking ending, and this film would have to work hard if it was even going to attempt at topping it.
Akshay was too irritating after the first 15 minutes of his intro.
AWARA PAAGAL DEEWANA was a hit at the BO so The makers decided to make DEEWANE HUYE PAAGAL, and with the now famous Akshay's comic timing there decided to make a copy of THERE's SOMETHING ABOUT MARY  Took Suneil, Paresh added Shahid, Rimii Sen  Made a commercial comedy film  The narrator act of Viveik that starts the film drowns it first only, luckily the film gets interesting with Akshay's entrance and then a few jokes are nice but then we have so many stupid scenes  A boring leading lady whom i doubt any guy of her age will also fall for Sorry Rimii, But why did the director choose her for the role that required someone damn hot and beautiful to explain people like Asrani falling for Budget constraints?
I started watching this after seeing footage of devastation in the film's first 25 minutes thinking there's going to more, even it if was CGI or old archive stuff there would be more chaos--BUT I got instead was boring by the numbers human dramaÂHey this is not the Hallmark Channel; I was baited and then the emphasis of the movie switched--and I am still livid over it!
The biggest challenge in this film isn't finding beaver to trap and sell, it's watching the first forty five minutes without busting your guts all over the floor laughing!
The first part with the asylum and the experiments is the central idea of the movie which gets picked up at the end again.
Moreover, when Jed tries to flag Hunt down, the sheriff sees the jacket taken off his murdered deputy and shoots first before he can confirm Jed's story.
The first feature film 'Don't Answer The Phone' was awesome.
A side plot is thrown into the first fifteen minutes as a nun Angela volunteers to go undercover in order to expose the evil order.
The first few minutes really had me thinking the movie was going to be worth watching, but I couldn't believe I actually finished the movie because it really just had very little to offer as far as keeping me interested.
Now I have seen ALL of the Puppet Master movies and besides the first and third episodes the rest were pretty much crap.It's interesting however to see the Puppets start out as evil slayers for their master Andre Toulon, but then become more as heroes fighting evil in the 3rd & 4th movies.
Assistants, who first carve the 444 wooden pieces that go into a puppet, can be transformed by a lightening-like effect into the inner workings of a puppet.
The first three Puppet Master films were really good & I think they are all great although Puppet Master 4 (1993) & Puppet Master 5: The Final Chapter (1994) were pretty bad apart from some impressive stop-motion animation effects & the nicely atmospheric Bogeda Bay Inn setting which are both absent here from Curse of the Puppet Master as the ambitions of the filmmakers & the budget gets increasingly lower with each new entry into the franchise.
For some reason the puppet Torch is ditched even though he appeared in Puppet Master 5 while Leech Woman makes a reappearance for the first time in the series after having been burnt in Puppet Master II (1991).
It may be thrilling if you are 15 of age or a total entertainment-dependent junkie with an IQ of less than 70 - or it is your first movie you ever watched... for everybody else: HANDS OFF!!!
Within the first five minutes, your jaw will hit the floor.
Both actors were not able to evince any genuine feelings, which is due mostly to a plot that doesn't allow them to develop their characters in the first place.
Well, after reading the first 3 pages of comments, I can't believe anyone made it this far, but if you did, here is what I have to say....  "Sirocco" is a complete waste of time , unless you can learn what not to do in a film.
dull and drift-less from the first scene, "Sirocco" literally BLOWS, right out of the theatre.
I first saw The Zoo Gang when I was a child of about five.
This film is mainly about Brigitte, as the first one was mainly about Ginger.
Emily Perkins, in my opinion, plays Brigitte Fitzgerald far better in this movie than the first.
I would recommend this movie to whoever liked the first one.
I usually talk a bit about the plot in the first part of my review but in this film there's really not much to talk of.
The special effects are absolutely first grade level, as in any first grader could have done them.
The synopsis sounded promising being a Los Anglino with some history in the music biz and having some first hand experience with "Has Beens" colliding with "Soon To Be Has Beens" and their actress girlfriends and wives.
And (**spoiler, maybe**) when Ally Sheedy's character is talked into wearing a painters smock on a first date (she's a designer for God's sake!)
Gee, where to start... Well, first, this movie is awful.
At many points you can see him reading his lines off a card behind the camera, and what's worse, for the whole first ten minutes of the movie, he gets around only in a bad pair of white underpants.
When he starts seeing the Sandman everyone think he's going crazy.....at first.
In a movie with a runtime of 83 minutes before the credits roll, you'd expect the first main character would die a little sooner than 60 minutes in.
The main 'twist' is blatantly obvious from the point at which they give the first 'clue' (they may as well have had Bill holding up a sign saying 'I am the younger brother' for all the subtlety it contained).
This is the weakest, or perhaps the most disappointing of the four 8 Films to Die For from the first year that I've seen.
There are some very powerful scenes and some frankly unforgettable visual sequences - the scenes of the first world war for example, or the beginning of the workers' strike.
!The one thing I'm going to say is that this is the first movie I couldn't stand and turned it off before the end!
This is the first of the '8 movies to die for' that I have watched.
While Jim (dufus guy) was in the basement trying to fix the power later, there was no reason electrically powered dummies and items would be there in the first place.
The symbol of the boiled potato which at first barely fed two people, finally being shared by the communists is quite striking.
I first saw and read the cover and it sounded promising.It was nothing like "Joy ride"(which is my favorite movie)or "I saw what you did last summer" like it implies.If i rented it instead of buying the bloody amateur movie i wouldn't be as mad.There was nothing interesting about it including the ending.If the movie had a bigger budget for better effects and better camera's and actors it might be OK.It did look promising up until they all got to the motel.After that it was lame and annoying.The characters were so aggravating that you wanted them to get killed off as quick as possible.The part I hated the most was when the 3 survivors had a man trapped at his home and tied up.They all screamed at him to shut up like a bunch of psycho's while he was pleading "you have it wrong it wasn't me".This Gawddamned scene made my blood boil it was so painfully annoying.
I thought at first I just had a dud.I wasn't able to get a refund only an exchange for the same stupid movie, and the next factory sealed one also skipped in the same exact spot so obviously the master copy is bad and has been transfered to all of the discs.I won't buy or rent anything again by this no-name new filmmaker and hope other's don't make the same mistake unless you like bad quality, grainy B-rated films made by a guy and his friends with a cheap hand held video camera.It is nothing more then someone's student film.All the money was spent on deceiving us with interesting looking cover art and a nice animated main menu.This is the only reason I even gave the movie a 2 out of 10.That is all this movie has going for it.It's a shame because I wanted to like this film but could never sit through it again.Now i've lost 14 bucks that could have been spent on something else.I feel ripped off!
When I first found it, I thought maybe it was an "advanced" copy of the hell ride coming out soon, but I was very mistaken.
It's as bad as the "movie" being made by one of the students at the art school----oh, maybe that's it: Confidential is actually an escapee from a first year student.
The first twenty minutes had me laughing and engaged in the characters and story.
His roommate is a hilarious typical wannabe-gangsta film maker who should have had lines after the first third of the film but didn't, and they bunk with a repressed homosexual fashion major used for good cheap laughs.
The first 1/3 is a comedy with dramatic elements, the second third is a drama with comedic elements, and the final third is a bizarre dark fantasy that ends in a way I can only describe as "suddenly I am run over by a truck".
He falls much too fast from his ambition of becoming the world's greatest artist to someone willing to compromise his talent for the sake of coming in first in a college competition.
I was an extra in this movie it was my first and only stint in film, It was filmed inside the Albuquerque convention center and in white sands NM around 1993.
I'm in the first few scenes I'm a prisoner on the ship there is about 3 scenes were i can be seen if your quick with the pause button.
Title: Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed   Director: Brett Sullivan   Cast: Emily Perkins, Katherine Isabelle, Tatiana Maslany, Eric Johnson   Tagline: It only dies if you do   Review: After having enjoyed the first Ginger Snaps immensely I decided to check out the sequel which had the same to actresses who played sisters on the last film.
Hmm..at leas the first one showed the werewolf even if it wasn't the best looking one, it was there.
Sadly we only get to see katherine Isabelle in a small cameo, she was a huge part in what made the first one so much fun, here shes just a watcher, a character who really does nothing except comment on what she sees and torments Bridgette.
The chemistry between the two sisters which was in a large part what made the first one so enjoyable is completely gone!
Gone is the chemistry between Bridgette and Ginger and the punch that the first movie had.
I don't get whey there's so many positive reviews for this film it was alright, but sadly not as good as the first.
She plays an independent career woman who for some mysterious reason thinks she has to choose between an amoral married man (a strangely unsympathetic Dana Andrews) and a psychotic war veteran (Henry Fonda in one of his dullest roles) who wants to marry her the first day they meet (?).
Both the audience (and his wife) are supposed to conveniently forget that he planned her cold-blooded execution and only missed out on doing it because she abruptly left him first.
That basically means shoot first and ask questions later.
The visiting team always bats first and the home team takes the field first.
All well and good but if that happened, history would have turned out differently and the young Joe would never have met the spinster Mrs. Young in the first place.
The first thing that would have been different if it was a US production is that every women in the movie would have been under the age of 25.
When i put it in, the first five minutes were boring.
All i can say is the film's first half hour is boring, but it has a lot of action, so it is okay, the paragraph above is just to keep you entertained because there isn't a lot to say about this junk, just treasure how bad the film is.
She then marries again, while still married to her first husband, to the grounds keeper, Clancy Brown.
Then after a mail incident, her first husband finds her and comes looking for his wife, which of course he is still in love with.
I watched this whole story to find out the reasoning of a religious event that happens in the first 5 minutes of the movie with a sick child becoming well after a spring of water appears out of the ground, at the very end of the movie the spring appears again, when the lady who runs stops running, I don't see how the 2 relate to the story line that seemed to be full of holes, and how a woman can leave her child and have that child have peace suddenly at the end of the movie is a bit to far fetched for me!
Eventually Rose's first husband finds the family shortly after Rose has taken off with only the tersest explanation but he seems perfectly willing to leave things be.
Being that there are three versions of this movie this surely must be the worst (I have seen the first but not the last but if it is worse than this then I will be avoiding it like the plague) .
It is poorly directed(so what if its his first), has average actors and a shitty story line.
I took a certain delight in many of the scenes in the movie: the opening scene where the title character fights through Asian stereotypes while trying to audition for a commercial, the awe and wonder he feels seeing Shanghai for the first time, and his helplessness with the Chinese language as he tries to get back to his hotel.
The very first part is promising.
Then, "Cactus Jack" and Morgan Fairchild, who met for the first time a scant thirty second ago, kiss, because we all know in movies like this, nearly everyone must be coupled off with SOMEONE by the end of the film.
It appears to be a comedy at first glance but that is rather deceiving.
What first hit me was that this is such a brilliant movie.
It was Karen Black as stewardess, who was not able to land the Boeing 747, here it is an attractive female first officer!
But first before the curtain of celibacy falls, he wants to have a fling or two, so Jim is on the make for Bette and for the young Janis Paige.
At first I was intrigued by how mismatched Susan (Bette Davis) and Slick (Jim Davis) are.
So lame that it boggles the mind to imagine that this film was made in the first place.
When I first saw this chimp, he really looked creepy--and I assume it was just a midget in an ape suit.
Overall, a sorry mess of a film that is so inexplicably dumb that I can't believe it was made in the first place.
I first saw this movie while I was living as an Italian immigrant in New Zeland at the age of 10 in 1998...it was a movie that sky cinema proposed,so as a child I couldn't miss the movie of a chimp that saved a Californian minor league team.
But it seems they don't teach him how to tell right from wrong: first he attacks the burglars, but then he also attacks a policeman.
I liked the second part better than the first.
This made-for-video movie is actually the first two episodes of the TV series stitched together.
They cover roughly the first half of the 1983 David Cronenberg film "The Dead Zone," based on Stephen King's novel.
Now the lovable hippie school from the first movie has become a regular college, this accompanied by plenty of ominous voice-over about the endangered state of American universities due to rioting and violent National Guard suppression.
I saw this many years ago when it first came out.
You know the old joke about how you have to get the mule's attention by first clobbering him over the head with a two-by-four?
Amazingly enough, this was the third Billy Jack film (after The Born Losers and Billy Jack) and the first to bomb at the box office.
The first Billy Jack had a certain purity of form.
I remember seeing this short film when it first aired on Amazing Stories in 1987 and I thought that it was the funniest thing I had ever seen.
I was telling my friends recently about a movie i saw in '92 or '93 that had Jim Carrey as first bill but he didn't show up until the last five minutes.
I was prepared to enjoy the movie when I first got my hands on it.
He expendes another half hour explaining the roots of the betrayal for those daft enough not to understand it the first time.
There's nothing like taking a 60-minute movie and then turning it into a 90-minute movie by replaying clips from the first 60 minutes for half an hour.
first off, I'd like to say that one of my favorite movies of all time is Abel Ferrara's _The Addiction_.
Here you only get a vague hint of that for the first ten minutes, at which point the film settles into a slice-of-lowlife study of its downbeat characters and loses all forward momentum.
In short, the first half of the movie does not get your hopes up too high, yet the latter half is disappointing.
Even thirty odd years ago when I first saw it.
John Matthew Mathan debutted with SARFAROSH(1999) and people clapped and were amazed at how in his first film he did such a good job  Now he returns with SHIKHAR(2005)  We always say a second film is a judgement day for the director and John Matthew fails in it  The main problem is actually the storytelling, direction  The film has a decent plot but it's ruined  Ajay's role takes off well but his plan of making a city looks feeble also the film lacks the intensity because in between suddenly they throw in songs and other commercial ingredients  The comedy by Sushant Singh is poor  The film goes on and on endlessly in the second half and the climax spoils it further  Direction by John Matthew Mathan is bad Music is okay  Amongst actors Ajay does a cakewalk in a negative role but his role could be far more intense, the director wanted it to be on a lighter side mostly and even says he had cast Govinda for it before LOL Shahid too excels in his role especially in the second half Bipasha is okay, Amrita too is okay Javed Sheikh does well Sushant Singh irritates
SPOILERS  Brigitte is on the run from the events of the first movie.
The monkshood drug that saved Jason in the first movie is apparently not permanently effective, and she has to take it repeatedly to stop the transformation.
A werewolf is searching for her (presumably Jason from the first movie transformed from not taking more monskhood), and wants to mate with her.
This movie is very different from the first one.
Very close, in fact, to the first movie.
And, like the first movie, I was happy not to see a drop of CGI throughout the whole thing.
The first movie is better because...it's the first one.
Branagh's attempt of the science-obsessed professor Victor Frankenstein is first seen in the cold blizzards of the Arctic wearing a frosted fur coat.
He is taken aboard by Captain Robert Walton (Aidan Quinn) and begins to narrate his life, first as a youngster and then how he came to make his hideous creation.
The monster passed by the ship first, on a sledge.
His scene was the first unintentionally funny one - Cleese's dour character was straight out of about twenty Python sketches.
THe movie also lacks consistency and logic.SPOILERS How does a doctor who can bring a creature to life for the first time in human history study it for a matter of minutes before mistakingly thinking it is dead, and then just leaving the body hanging from his ceiling.
He also ruined the romantic relationship between Victor and Elizabeth, which in the book started as deep admiration and built with some suspense and tension until it finally culminated in their marriage and her demise, but Branagh decided to have them fondling each other more or less within the first ten minutes of the film.
The film operates with the worst clichÃ©s you can find in a film - repetitive jokes, whose are not funny even the first time, very shallow dialogues, typical costume film eras - dark middle age, renaissance, Fitzgeraldoid jazz generation, Nazi occupation (with the mistake made by the filmmakers, as Hungary happened to be a Fascist country in the Second World War) and so on.
It was the first case in my life when I left the cinema at the half of the movie.
The first 100 minutes of the film have no merit of any kind -- they're just setup for the big payoff.
At first, Jack is angry about him receiving the experimental treatment.
When I first heard about this movie, I thought that the plot sounded humorous, a war with canada could be pretty interesting.
I think that Moore should remember that if it weren't for the brave men & women that serve our country, his freedom to abuse the first amendment would not be so free.
If this was the first movie for any of these actors, none of them would ever work again.
I actually liked it during the first couple of minutes during the time, when the main character, Kenshiro (Gary Daniels) hadn't opened his mouth yet, but after he spoke and revealed, that besides the looks he hadn't slightest bit of acting talent I quickly stopped liking it.
Take for example, the first scene in the movie: a young man eats a bowl of cereal, and his actions are shot in the same manner as the cocaine/heroin usage scenes in Requiem for a Dream; i.e., as a series of quick, disconnected shots.
Yup an abandoned hospital, (The staff is about 5 people) and the serial killer comes back to life using his patented heart through the chest maneuver (hence the name) which looks silly the first time and gets progressively sillier as the movie goes along.
Nothing interesting happens in the first quarter of the movie then gorehounds get a good solid 10 minutes of splatter and gore then the story powers on to its conclusion with about as much intelligence as a lobotomised sheep and a plot thats about as interesting as watching your fingernails grow.
The agent takes her on her first job as a model at a resort home that is run by a group of witches.
One of them a perverted old man, another one is a lady that looks like a man but dressed as a woman that comes up creeping on the young girls from time to time, another is a geeky photographer trying to loose his virginity and another one is a man that wants to get the virgin first before the cult does.
The character development in this French/Dutch film is fantastic in that this is the first time I've ever been drawn to the evil character, but the lag time in the movie slows it down immensely, which is it's only problem.
The second part of the first act has a family killed at gunshot by a gang led by a man named Kevin (Jeremy Northam), who murders these people because they withhold a computer disk containing information that could put every member in prison.
After the first act setup, the characters' morals and intentions should be clear.
See the first "gloria" with Gena Rowlands - it is much, much better.
I just saw this for the second time* and I wasn't going to watch because it scared me the first time.
This sequel picks up shortly after the first film ends.
The first causes of things in horror films are facile glosses of cultural fears.
Or, did they have any power in the first place?
Which leads me to the most interesting thing about horror movies, the thoughtless choice of first causes.
The first film was about what happens when the powerless get power.
Something closely akin to morbid curiosity kept me watching it until the end, despite the fact that I knew within the first minute that it was going be nauseous.
The use of the bookends felt like it gave the film a more authentic feel at first, but when they were revisited at the end, I felt slightly cheated and still confused.
During a first time dinner where Everett attempts to pour out his story about his romantic death of his father, Elwes responds with a grunt of a "No way" or something along those trivial lines.
My first comment on IMDb ... after watching many IMDb Top250 ... After this I HAD to write something.
They behave towards each other like a young couple in their first few months of getting to know each other.
the entire first two acts of the film are great, setting up a tense situation where the viewer is intently waiting to see the dramatic climax.
and just why does this budding killer bury people in the first place?
Of the 122 films I have rated thus far, Nine Months is the first film I have awarded a 1 to.
My husband and I gamely watched the first hour, and finally could take no more.
Mr Grant never gets into first gear let alone out of it in the less - than - taxing part of the posh English shrink with a practice in San Francisco and a reluctance to have children without long and serious consideration,a remarkably sensible attitude that renders him an object of contempt and ridicule in this movie.He stutters a lot and closes his eyes to express deep emotion,furrowing his brow then,in desperation, resorts to shouting and waving his arms like everybody else.
first of all i don't believe in the conspiracy theory..but i can not understand the 'intentional' repeated view to the Arabic and/or Muslim as a prepared terrorist from the first moment in his life instead of crying to breath he said death to America.
At first this film does not portray itself as suspenseful, but develops tension so calmly that by the time it is over, you're left exhausted.
When Raymond offers a chance for Rex to see Saskia again, he must first experience what she went through, and you're left wondering "Where the hell is this going to take us next?"
After watching this movie for the first time I stayed staring at the TV screen completely numb with my mouth wide open by the sheer horror of it.
It's been a couple of years now since I saw this astounding film for the first (only) time; actually, I don't think I'll ever quite recover from the experience.
The fact that after I had watched it I felt disgusted and frankly scared that a film like this could be made in the first place made me dig a little deeper into the films background.
Start with an L Ron Hubbard novel (your first mistake) featuring a completely plagiarized dark-skinned, war-like and hairy alien culture with wrinkly foreheads (if this sounds like Klingons to you, I thought so too!
Finally, stay true to the idiotic gibberish you based the film on in the first place, and you've got the makings of a rolling-on-the-floor comedy.
The first stars Steven Bauer and Joan Severence and follows their turbulent sex-only relationship.
I can't understand how anyone could say the first 100 minutes of this film are of no merit whatever.
Since the presumable market for a film about that old villain Trotsky would have to be the European Left, why was this film made in English in the first place?
I won't bore you with the plot -- which has some relation to the first half of Psycho.
It's also clichÃ© in that everyone falls in love at first sight, somehow confusing lust for love.
I apologize if this is more about Meg Ryan than the movie but I just saw this flick for the first time tonight despite meaning to check it out for years frankly.
The first rule of film making...everything has to have a GOOD reason.
I have to say, I just saw this movie for the first time last night, and I think it portrayed the Cayman Islands as some drug infested little island.
This series is based of the "Little Princess" books by Tony Ross which was first published in 1986.
In a role originally written for Tom Berenger, Treat Williams here returns after appearing in the first sequel.
The first two were good.
The fight scenes in the first two were imaginative, but these are only the usual.
I will be the first to admit it, but you have to admire Frank Gerrish.
This fails to take into account, first and foremost, that there never was such a period.
It was good for like the first 15-20 minutes than the nightmare began.
This was the third movie of him that i have seen(the first and second being GWH and DD) and its probably the last one of his movies that i am gonna see.
Caught this during Showtime's free-view as the first of what (I hope) was an unintentional Ben Affleck Marathon, as this stinker was followed by another stinker (The Third Wheel), then one more for sh*ts and giggles (Reindeer Games).
Okay, first of all, Ben Affleck is one of the partners of a high-powered Hollywood agency.
The whole movie's emotional center is supposed to be whether he gets back together with her, but we have no reason to think they should be together in the first place (and no, the idiotic virtual CGI sequence of them scuba-diving doesn't provide that context).
I first saw it in 1990 in San Francisco.
This is the first film I have seen where there is no plot.
But because the whole thing is so dull and listless, any attempt at social commentary is wasted--if it was even attempted in the first place.
The plot starts off well, and is very intriguing at first.
Linda is an interesting character in the film, as the first time we see her, she's sitting nude on an examination table.
The first thing I noticed is that the film maker really intended this as a "skin flick" by inserting needless nudity.
I remember bullying my then-boyfriend (now husband, in spite of my demonstrably bad taste in movies by wanting to even SEE this) to go see this in '76 when it first came out.
I feel it is every American's first amendment right to say and do almost anything and that people who get offended should just learn to relax!
As I understand from popular opinion, this is one film that was fine the first time round, and not well received on the second go.
That may be unfair, ignoring as it does the sterling work of James Coburn, who plays the first half of the title pair.
), leading to the first of many situations which are intended to be frightening but fall flat.
I have not seen the American remake (oddly enough, both versions are from director George Sluizer) but I can all but guarantee that the original is what you want to go with first.
If your going to make a movie about WI maybe spend a few minutes there first.
It would have been a suspenseful scene if one of these oversexed morons brought the farm defending an infant instead of drinking and throwing themselves at the first attractive body.
(Note that the U.K.'s final episode -- not including "Lucky White Ghost" -- was the plot for the first U.S.
I first saw this movie visiting my uncle in Florida for the summer when I was 10 years old.
Of course, Curtis being a phony he seeks help himself, first from Stella Stevens' gypsy and then, deciding to fight fire with fire, Michael Ansara's medicine man.
I was a huge fan of this series when it first aired.
This movie was one of the first made after the MPAA rating system replaced the Hayes code, and people could make porn commercially.
I do want to see the Britsh version, but I'm glad i didn't see it first.
good Canadian movies are a hard jem to find ( as is any Canadian one) but this one is somewhat easier to find  after watching the first one i immediately needed to view the second and i isn't a letdown in any way to its predecessor.
if you thought the first one was to dark, then you may have to watch this movie of an extended period of time  any wean this movie is amazing in every single way buy it NOW!
The first hour of this film was enjoyable and engaging as a realistic drama.
The first 10 minutes of "Halloween" and the entire "Children of the Corn" series come to mind.
I have a some problems with this show, first:  1.
This episode in particular is particularly awful - the first half absolutely does not make use of its creepy setting.
The first 30 minutes are actually pretty good and are all about ambiance.
However, the downfall of the movie comes when the first laughably ridiculous decision is made: when a terrible thing occurs in front of one of the main characters, he just turns around and stands there thinking about what to do.
It was really funny at first, like every show is.
Of all the Vietnam flicks i've seen it's the first one that bored me!
I was literally fighting sleepiness throughout the first half of the movie.
You have to waste the first hour for a weak story to develop.
I LOVED the Apprentice for the first two seasons.
For the first couple of seasons, I thought The Apprentice was a highly engaging and exciting show.
For the first part the movie isn't really going anywhere.
He seems to serve no purpose in the movie, even though I was preparing myself for a big role from him in this movie, after he made his first (and only) appearance.
Paltrow plays an aspiring air hostess with ambitions to travel the world,rather than just domestically in the US,but is torn between love for her boyfriend back home (Ruffalo) and eventually goes back to him.And,er,that's it.A story so paper thin and obvious that it seems to have been written by an inexperienced,first time hack (as indeed it apparently was),with forced and shallow comic situations,dialogue and characterisations.Some surface attractiveness and slickness do not detract from it's persistent banality and lack of depth,and events did conspire against VIEW FROM THE TOP from the start.Filmed in 2001,it's original release was held back (due to the events on 9/11) until two years later,by which time it flopped rather dismally.
The nadir occurs when several of the students, including our heroine, first go to Sally Westin's (Bergen) house for dinner and we are subjected to a stream of jokes surrounding the homosexuality of Randy Jones (Josh Molina) that are at best unfunny and at worst offensively homophobic.
The first "Urban Legends" movies was fair (worth 5), because it was just like "I Know What You Did Last Summer" movie and at that time, that kind of movies was popular.
I did not even know there was a third installment to the Urban Legends series, but after loving the first two, for what they were, and this one being directed by Mary Lambert (who I adored for her work with Madonna and "Pet Sememtary"), I expected a descent movie.
while i really enjoyed "Urban Legend" and "Urban Legends:Final Cut" i can't say the same for this one.i found it boring,pointless,and annoying.the character of "Bloody Mary" is about as scary a "Tickle me Elmo" from Sesame Street.not only that,but this thing was predictable from the get go.the first 2 were not.at least i didn't think so.this movie does have a twist of sorts,and the only reason it may be unpredictable is that it is so preposterous that no one for a minute would believe it actually happens.there's no way things could have ended up the way they did.but in this movie,they do.the characters themselves are just silly caricatures.and lets not forget the ending.illogical and unsatisfying.i'd say the acting was bad,but i don't see how it could have been anything else in this movie.overall,this movie is awful.1/10
Makes the first two look like unsung masterpieces by comparison.
They should have watch supernatural first that bloody marry was fantastic  it was just Horrible, The movie didn't make it sense at all  The plot: On Homecoming night, Samantha (Mara), Gina (McCormick), and Mindy (Rulin) are having a slumber party at Sam's house due to being black-listed by the sexy football players.
Don't think it's anything like the first Urban Legend because it's not.
first of all it has no story to follow: instead of having a slasher who kills all the nasty rich kids one by one (copykilling after urban legends as usual), it's some voodoo-magic-zombie thing!
I'm sorry, I really wanted to like this movie when it came out, but my first warning should have been when it went straight to video and not in theatres like its former installments.
i loved the first 2 urban legends, i don't even understand how this movie got added to the urban legend series.
The first UL killer is still alive and has just gotten with the UL2 killer.
I would have had the girl from the first one and the girl from the second come back.
I really liked the first two movies.
Well, first off, it makes no sense.
The second addition "Urban Legend: Final Cut" was nowhere near up to the standards of the first, but it was entertaining enough and a decent sequel.
Going back to the true, original style of the first.
Though, I know it would have never measured up to it's first, I would have probably respected it a lot more.
And then there are a bunch of seemingly important characters introduced during the first half of the film only to be forgotten during the second half, as if they never existed.
But taking ideas from other films shouldn't come as a surprise for this series since the first two "Urban Legends" were ripoffs of "Scream" and "Scream 2" (what's next?
I have yet to see the first Ginger snap or any other Ginger snaps movies in the series.
OK first the camera work was shoddy.
The characters aren't very interesting in the first place --- just a bunch of dumb clichÃ©s.
Especially since it's the first few comments.
I pray this is the director's first film.
Okay, first of all: The acting, GOD AWFUL.
Okay, first of all, notice how all of the other reviewers who gave this movie a good rating are either: A) From Canada (where the movie was made) or B) Helped work on this movie or the second one ?
Their first result using nerve gas that was originally for the war in Iraq?
Steve Guttenberg is surprisingly good as the son of a doctor who can't get into an American medical school, or even a first or second grade foreign one.
The plot is as follows: After the events in Gatlin described in the first "Children of the Corn", the surviving kids are adopted by the people of the nearest town, Hemmingford.
The first movie was not as bad as most people think, it was actually enjoyable, but this movie does not keep the elements that made the first one a fine movie.
Gone are the eerie score and the creepy atmosphere of the first one.
The acting is bad most of the times, and even when the acting in the first one was no Oscar-worthy, John Franklin's Isaac is in many ways superior to Ryan Bollsman's Micah as the leader of the cult.
Specially when compared to the first one.
This movie fits poorly with the first and tries too hard to link itself with it.
Besides completely destroying the mood of the first film, this one adds sex and profanity.
The first one is better, much better.
The first movie did have some elements that were found in the book, this one only a few concepts remain as it does a lot of things differently this time around.
For one, you do not get the creepy abandoned looking town you found in the first movie, which is a shame as it is what made that film for me.
Also living in the house is the new leader of the cult who at least looks slightly closer to childhood than Isaac in the first film.
I love the first Children of the Corn movie.
There's also another thing I do not get about this film, a lot of those teens in this movie would have been like 7 or 8 in the first movie, so how do they remember all of this?
But then again, I completely HATED the first one.
I had no interest in seeing the rest of the series as I figured if the first was horrible, how well could the rest hold up?
However, just recently a friend gave the first three to me so I thought what the hell, I will watch them.
First off, I thought this Children of the Corn film was better than the first for a few reasons, the major one being this was rather funny (unintentionally of course).
I found this one more interesting than the first due to the preacher being creepier this time, and there were some surprisingly cool (and cheesy) deaths which kept pace relatively even.
The level of gore is increased from the first film, and it actually helps this sequel a lot.
Second in the monotonous horror series takes place soon after the events of the first movie, with reporter Terence Knox poking around as he tries to discover what happened in the empty town.
Strangely, although every adult and a bunch of kids were killed, no cops stick around after the first five minutes, leaving Knox free to discover bodies all over the place.
Although I am a horror fan I didn't enjoy the first Children of the Corn film much, so my view might be a little biased.
*spoilers*  The first death scene is quite surprising, I mean the guys are killed by corn, well that is dodgy.
Now that is quite original, and when I was first told of this by my Cousin I pictured it vividly.
The same cult that destroyed the lives of adults in the first film are "rescued" and adopted by a modern American housing estate town.
And if you're not going to have at least one good girl/girl moment then WHY bother with a women-in-prison setting in the first place?
As a matter of fact, it made me wonder if half way through the first scene of this piece of ****, if the editor got sick of watching it and quit his job.
Was the first one really that popular?
It's also a true bridge between the first film, which was sexless TV-movie camp, and the third one, which was mindlessly dull soft-core.
The first half is best and I usually turn it off about the time Xaviera gets kidnapped by Billy Barty (don't ask).
The draw of the first half makes it all worthwhile to me, it's just berserk: Rip Taylor screaming and throwing fake snow around while photographing a topless extra from "Jesus Christ Superstar."
Despite a preponderance of exposed breasts, it's very like the first film, all innocent fun, the sex is at the level of a geeky teenager, which I was when I saw this, so it suited me fine.
It's not great by any means but it's a definite improvement over the first film.
The first "Happy Hooker" movie was actually watchable.
On my first thought was film like this should be on TV instead.
Maybe you should hang up your film makers hat Mr Fabinaksi, your first two ideas for films have been zombies and werewolves, so your hardly original, you have 0 talent when deciding what angles to use and you cant write a script.
No-one puts any effort into anything & they just sort of either stand there or jog depending on the scene, the scene when the old man is first attacked by the zombies & runs through the wood waving his arms in the air letting out a little wailing noise is hilarious & the bit when a fat redneck guy comes face-to-face with a zombie & he says 'oh my god' like he was asking someone to change the channel on the TV.
What a disappointment after the first one.
What the first film does with so much fun with itself was taken to darker and bloodier heights in this solid but joyless and too bloody sequel.
Chuck Norris looks bored replaying his role in the first film (Col. McCoy) for vengeance when his pal's wife was killed by a merciless drug dealer named Ramon Cotta (played with surprising menace by THE UNTOUCHABLES' Billy Drago), who has been freed numerous times after being captured.
It was so funny that I haven't ever laughed as much as when I saw it for the first time.
This movie has very little in common with the first movie, the only real connection between the two is Chuck Norris is in both of them.
I do not remember this one being particularly horrible or anything, I just remember it not being as good as the original and that I got a bit bored during this film, another thing that did not occur during the first film.
In the end I think it is just one of those sequels that uses the success of the first film to try and market an almost unrelated film.
And it is no wonder--this was James Signorelli's first major film-directing project.
Of course, my first viewing comes in 2006.
This being an '80's film you know you'll see some fat guy ass sometime and what do ya know, it happens within the first 10 minutes.
Emily Perkins was simply amazing, the gore was beautiful and the dark humor and atmosphere were similar to the first one.
The makeup was better where as the first Ginger Snaps was more emotional.
Of course it wasn't as good as the first one but what sequel ever really is?
But if I forget the last 10 minutes, this movie was excellent and almost gave me as much pleasure as the first one.
Maybe we're not expecting first rate acting but a little competence would be nice.
Travis McKenna (who truly has a gigantic bottom) is more than just a comic relief; he "fills up" the first 40 minutes of this film with vulgar fat-guy behavior, like videotaping the girls sun bathing topless and "mooning" the entire camp through the windows of his van.
In case you're not up on your trivia, Leif was Brooke Shield's first boyfriend when she was a 13-year old sex symbol (although it was Dean Cain that got to break her in at Princeton).
I just watched it for the first time today.
I started to watch this movie, and sat through the first 48 minutes of it, hoping it would eventually get interesting.
It definitely do not deserve to be in the "Thriller" category, there is nothing thrilling about it at all(the first 48 minutes anyway, doubt the second half gets any better..).
The first 30 minutes or so are fairly engrossing (in a "Dark City", "Matrix", "Strange Days" sort of way) and the settings and characters are intriguing.
*****SPOILER ALERT   If you are watching the action fairly closely, you will see the entire plot of the movie foreshadowed at least three times in the first ten minutes.
Part of the problem is that most of these actors are so underutilized that you wonder what made them want to do this film in the first place.
I must admit after watching the first 100 minutes, the movie has an interesting twist, probably thats why i didn't give it a 1, but even the most twisted of twists could not save 100 minutes of nothing.
Some movies may seem complex on first viewing, but are rich enough to go back and examine until you get it.
When I first saw Shannyn Sossamon in 'The Holiday', I wanted to see what else she had done.
Here's the first problem with a slasher thriller.
If you can find other brands, you may want to try them first.
It was the first of director Ernst Lubitsch's dramatic films, after having started as a comedic filmmaker.
Pola Negri, in her first appearance as Lubitsch's star, performs some exotic dancing, too.
A poor storyline, a rubbish script, and another low budget film where everything goes well for the good, and the bad get punished or learn a "valuable" lesson (even though really it was the leading female characters fault for closing down the research in the first place).
Okay, so first of all, this movie was made in 2008.
Teens go to college, first everything seems to be fine, but soon they finds out the dorm they stays in used to be an asylum for mental patients that was tortured by an insane doctor.
When I first saw the cover of this video, I had the sneaking suspicion that it might end up being one of those "so bad its good" movies that I absolutely love.
Possible spoilers due to references to other literatureÂassuming you can't guess the ending within the first few minutes.
If I would've had to pay for it I wouldn't have watched it in the first place.
One of the things I did like at first was the rapid dialog.
I found it hysterical at first because it seemed almost natural the way it was spoken, but then it becomes totally repetitive and soon falls apart when the killer finally shows up.
At first it's amusing as if it were a spoof.
And how does Danny Trejo suddenly turn up towards the end of the film after being slaughtered in the first reel.
The first movie is one of the best movies I've ever seen.
I remember Tito and Tarantula and the Vaughan bros. playing in the first one giving it the GREATEST soundtrack ever.
This one is even worse than the first.
Unlike the first one, this one has Bad actors (Robert Patrick).
I am a really big fan of the first part of "From Dusk Till Dawn".
The first part is such an excellent, great, fantastic movie but the sequel is so bad.
Does he only want some more money, cause of the first success??

I really liked the first movie.
This gives no honor to the first in any way, they should have stayed with the first and the third to make the perfect duo.
The first is one of my favorite action movie but this one is just... awful.
When i watched the first FDTD, i thought it was far from a masterpiece but an excellent movie.
After the first hour, the movie really loses its way.
The writers seem more interested in bashing on the military than continuing the story they began in the first half.
In most respects, many agree that this sequel is in fact better than the first movie ... but they're both so great, I don't even feel the need to compare them.
I was a bit concerned about the fact that this wasn't written by the same team as the first movie (in fact screenwriter Megan Martin seems to have no other credits to her name), but it is actually an interesting twist on the original, written by someone who clearly understood what Ginger Snaps was all about.
There are two main formulaic werewolf plots ... the first involves our hero changing into a werewolf, which will eventually lead either to finding a cure or to their death (as in the first movie), and the second is about a group of characters being stalked by a werewolf, and for an added twist perhaps the werewolf is one of them.
Ginger Snaps is probably the first great werewolf movie to have a worthy sequel, and if that wasn't enough they had to go and do it again a third time.
He should have written a version of it get George Clooney and Julia back and get rid of Danny Trejo's character since he died in the first one and then he would of had a sequel worth seeing in the theater and not video or DVD.
First off, it wasn't anywhere near as good as the first From Dusk Till Dawn film and it had a bunch of shots that the director was trying to impress people with but it ended up making the film look cheesy.
His car breaks down on the road and he heads for the same club as the first film and of course is turned into a vampire and then comes back for his friends.
I'm a real dusk till dawn fan, since I first watched it on the big screen.
And for God's sake, how in the earth that the vampire from the first film (the barman) resurrected after the melting sequence?
The first film is so cool because the first half is a gangster film, and then it just changes into a vampire film.
The first 45 minutes are not so bad, but after the point where LUTHER (one of the robbers) becomes a vampire it really goes down!
I have to say it has a nice soundtrack though, especially in the first 45 minutes.
It begins with Chow Yun Fat, a newly graduated officer coming on to his first day on the force.
Since this seems to have been largely unnoticed by most of the previous commentators, I will just add a paragraph here to point out that this movie is an adaptation, of sorts, of one of the major hits of the Viennese musical stage during the first decade of the 20th century, Oscar Straus' Ein Waltztraum/A Waltzdream.
But this factoid is of interest in that, 3 years later, Paramount would try the same thing, once again with M Chevalier directed by Ernst Lubitsch, on another of the major hits of the Viennese musical stage during the first decade of the 20th century, and that time the result would be a smash success: The Merry Widow.
This movie didn't do much for me - neither does A Waltzdream, frankly - but it's interesting to see a first attempt at something Paramount, Lubitsch, and Chevalier would soon do so much better.
She's by far my favourite actress of the first half of the 20th century (Michelle Pfeiffer took her crown in the latter part).
She's overacting as if she's in a (talking) movie for the first time.
I only managed to watch the first 30mins of the first episode of this drivel, before I turned it off.
I just finished the first 30 minutes of the pilot.
There are but a dozen words in the first 20 minutes of the film, a trend that continues throughout and grows weary if you can manage to stay up.
A real desert would've killed the first generation in this boring movie and spared me 90 minutes of garbage.
The first mother came their with her husband but couldn't get out, that was kind of understandable.
It hurt the film when the lady that first played the Grandma was used to play the mother and the young woman used to play the daughter played her own daughter.
This plays like a long situation comedy, except that after the first few minutes any basis in reality, no matter how exaggerated, is lost.
Okay first I will give you a little run down I first rented this movie because I thought I heard good things about this movie.
I decided to smoke a little reefer before then started to watch at first I was thinking to myself okay not the best but maybe it will get better.
This film supposedly takes place during the first few days of Operation Market Garden, which was one of the biggest Allied assaults of the Second World War.
In fact, the first ten to twelve minutes of "The Last Drop" are really well done.
Or to be charitable, the first eighteen minutes, are quite good.
The first flaw in this rickety fictional adventure is that it has three flaws: 1.
This is my first comment on IMDb.
This is the first time I have given a 1 rating to a film.
the special effects are OK for most of the movie, except for the airplanes in the first half of the movie.
Now I have seen ALL of the Puppet Master movies and besides the first and third episodes the rest were pretty much crap.It's interesting however to see the Puppets start out as evil slayers for their master Andre Toulon, but then become more as heroes fighting evil in the 3rd & 4th movies.
Assistants, who first carve the 444 wooden pieces that go into a puppet, can be transformed by a lightening-like effect into the inner workings of a puppet.
The first three Puppet Master films were really good & I think they are all great although Puppet Master 4 (1993) & Puppet Master 5: The Final Chapter (1994) were pretty bad apart from some impressive stop-motion animation effects & the nicely atmospheric Bogeda Bay Inn setting which are both absent here from Curse of the Puppet Master as the ambitions of the filmmakers & the budget gets increasingly lower with each new entry into the franchise.
For some reason the puppet Torch is ditched even though he appeared in Puppet Master 5 while Leech Woman makes a reappearance for the first time in the series after having been burnt in Puppet Master II (1991).
of Homeland Security, in which Lawless briefs a panel wearing full dress uniforms while she is dressed in skin-tight jeans; the inevitable expression of remorse from the entomologist, prior to his bloody demise; the scene in the Pittsburgh office, with the b-day party being interrupted by a picture window full of bugs (plus the revelation that the office hunk is even wimpier than Lawless' bf); the scene in the chopper when Lawless declares she's hormonal due to her pregnancy, and just might kill everyone in the chopper if the DHS doesn't change its drastic plan; the climactic kiss that is interrupted by the buzzing of the swarm; and just about every scene in which people are warned about the locusts' pending arrival -- first, they're in denial; minutes later, they're running for their lives.
I know its a rare sequel that matches anything like its precursor, but man, they could have copied a little of the first one--even a sex scene for cryin' out loud.
The first reviewer actually said that Hollywood needs to adopt a Xenaphobic(!)
We learned in the first movie that Westworld was surrounded by the Mojave desert, so there wasn't an escape route in that world.
It was almost like the very first season of Dragnet, I mean the one in 1954, where cigarettes seemed to grow out of peoples faces.
Regarding Elizabeth Hurley, let me just first say that when I first heard that Tomb Raider was going to be made into a movie, Hurley was the ONLY actress I saw playing the role, since, a) she looks exactly LIKE Lara Croft AND b) she's ALREADY English!
From the first 10 minutes of the movie, you can fairly guess the end, and found myself predicting a walkthrough of the movie.
This surprisingly primitive 'streamliner' comedy from the Roach Studios -- with the collapse of the comedy short subject market in the mid-thirties, Hal Roach decided to go into feature production, first with films like the TOPPER series and later with second features that timed in at less than an hour -- contains all the standard cheap comedy motifs, including a Murphy Bed -- and runs through them in a rather mechanical fashion as made-it-from-scratch taxi fleet owners William Bendix and Joe Sawyer get tangled up with a girl who tries to kill herself and declares herself their responsibility.
My first reaction was to shut it off half way through.
Alex: I knew he was one of the Horsemen right when I first saw him act shy, blame his father for not being there for his mother when she was dying of cancer, taking care of Sean while his father is busy working, etc.
You are automatically thrown into mystery and suspense with the first body being discovered.
I know many people love this movie but I was bored silly after the first hour or so.
In it's first scenes I thought the movie was promising, and it kept me going for like 20 minutes, without complaining, but when the plot begins to twist, I began to think that it was not worth watching, and then that it's one of the worst movies of the year.
I first heard that song during the opening credits of the much better movie: 'Dawn of the Dead' (remake.)
During the second half of this movie the only thought in my head was "please don't let this be the twist, please tell me that writers are more imaginative than that, please don't let me have to watch the second half of this movie only to find it was what I guessed after the first 20 minutes".
Naturally they have a run in with the toney head cheese of the school, who somehow allowed them to attend in the first place, and there's a 'climactic' competition between the two groups at the end of the film.
It was the first movie I ever saw where i was about to stand up in my chair at the cinema and scream out loud "Can anything happened soon?'.
From the first scene to the last you can almost predict everything.
Writer/director/producer Greg Lamberson's first stab creating his own low-budget horror film comes across as a cross between "Street Trash" and "the Stuff" while being not quite as entertaining as either of the two aforementioned movies.
With an obviously low budget the film looks very cheap throughout & loses the fantastic Gothic horror film inspired production design from the first two & replaces it with cardboard sets & cheap props.
The first five minutes shows the worst acting ever portrayed on television along with the worst animation.
See the first two Addams Family movies too, relishing every moment.
I would've loved to have heard Curry sing, for he has a great singing voice, because Raul Julia sang a Mamooshka in the first movie.
I'm generally a big fan of The Addams Family, whether the Chas Addams cartoons, the original television series with John Astin and Carolyn Jones, or the first two movies with Raul Julia and Anjelica Huston.
Saban feeds on the leftovers of another steam-free franchise; the first two movies were no great shakes but they were better than this low-rent DTV mess.
This 3rd Addams Family film seems to be a movie adaptation of the 1990's cartoon series as opposed to the Original Black & White TV series which the first two films were based on.
This movie has "comedic" elements which give it a completely different style to the first two movies.
The premise of this film, a family reunion of the Addams family, is utterly preposterous considering there was a family reunion all the way back in the first Addams Family film, when Uncle Fester had a party thrown in his honour.
Now I know they had to get rid of the kids from the first two, because as you can see Wednesday who was played by Christina Ricci in the first two is now an adult, making movies like Sleeping Hollow.
Uncle Fester who in the first 2 was played by Christopher LLoyd(and brilliantly may I add), now they have some hyper active freak who goes around yelling and screaming like a two year old doing stupid pranks...It was then that it hit me, this new movie was not intended to be a sequel to the previous two.
The first two Addams Family films were true to the original Addams Family comics.
The humor of the film is as bad as it gets; whereas the first two had great black humor, this one is reduced to childish humor, which just every once in a while has a bit of 'blackness' to it.
I mean, honestly, the effects look worse than they did back in the first film.
This one's not the usual gore-fest, there's a cool scene when someone messily melts into ice cream but why did the previous two victims not melt in this way especially the first one who one moment is standing there & the very next he's melted to nothing within a split second?
This method of murder gets boring right from the first time it's shown in the first few seconds and Forsythe's performance is nowhere near as creepy as it could've been.
I have to say when I first saw this actress I thought she looked truly amazing.
But in this one, we are greeted to a wonderful film picking up exactly where the first one left off: now with Bridget trying to stop herself from becoming a werewolf, and escaping from the rehab center she has been placed in.
This is my very first IMDb review, and let me tell you why I choose "the last samurai", and no other.
At first, I was disappointed.
This is the first movie I've seen in a while with no redeeming qualities.
Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) is placed in a foster home after the incidents of the first film had his mother committed.
Chuck is back and still after Andy is now placed in a foster home after the tragic events of the first film since his mother was committed.
In an attempt to save their reputation, the manufacturers of Chucky reconstruct the killer doll, to prove to the public that nothing was wrong with it in the first place.
The first Child's Play has scenes of actual suspense, but this one is more jokey than anything else.
Stick to the first one only, if you are going to watch any of the Chucky films.
Unlike the first (great) and the fourth (bad) this movie falls squarely in between somewhere.
I think just for the sake that I saw the first one and something must have been special because I am curious how the series goes.
All Chucky fans remember that he was burnt to a toasty crisp in the first movie.
First things first, the original Child's Play is a campy classic, Child's Play 2 is not.
If there is anything good to say about the film it's that it retains the originality of the first, only to be ruined by your typical worse-than-Hell horror movie sequel formula.
Childs play 2 is good if you see the 1st one you can compare it but after you see the first one you will notice that don Mancini has mucked the story line up.
It's recommended to watch the first two films in a row.
Although the first film was bad, the sequel was actually entertaining.
The scant few teenagers who went to see "976-EVIL" in 1989 probably had no idea who Sandy Dennis was (just as the kids who first saw "Carrie" didn't know who Piper Laurie was), but the veteran actress manages to bring a few minutes of class to an otherwise lousy, fifth-rate screamer about a nerdy high school kid acquiring demonic powers from a satanic phone number.
During the first hour of the film only really weird things Â that largely remain unexplained - are going on, like a totally random biblical omen that exists of a shower of fish-rain.
With Englund's first time behind the camera, you would expect something truly unique or at least something close to being even remotely frightening like "A Nightmare on Elm Street" (1984), but when things get interesting "976-EVIL" devolves into typical slasher/possession stuff and thus joins the ranks of so many other "B" horror movies from the 1980s.
At first she offers to testify, then withdraws after learning her sister (Doris Day) is married to one of the Klansmen (Steve Cochran, in a wonderfully loutish performance as the murderer).
Quite seriously, I wish I could because I loved the first Pumpkinhead so much.
If you remember how the first Pumpkinhead ended your gonna be on angry mofo because there's a very special something taken out that made the Pumpkinhead villain so unique.
Watch the first, but ignore this disgraceful sequel.
The feeling of Unstoppable carnage and revenge that emenates in the first film is made into a hokey crapfest (almost Unworthy of having a drinking game created for it, where every time you see the actor playing Pumpkinhead's f***ing Nikes, you take a swig).
I was also put off by the attempt at making said local badboy's (J. Trevor Edmund- Return of the Living Dead 3) persona distinctly familiar to the jerk character in the first film.
They are aimed more for a horror romp effect than the deaths in the first film; but from that point-of-view, they are pretty entertaining.
His greatest moment would be when he rehearses the famously bad rhyme from the first film, and this is a pretty embarrassing moment, to say the least.
Totally pointless and exceedingly boring low-budget sequel to the surprisingly popular and yet, disappointing first film that starts off promisingly enough as it shows in black and white a young deformed boy being tortured by a group of teenage thugs that call themselves "The Blood Wings"...or something similar to that.
Overall, the only true highlights in this sorry excuse for a film are the few short scenes of a rather luscious-looking Solei Moon-Frye (from "Punky Brewster" fame) in a small supporting role as an occult obsessed teen, and an admittedly creepy atmosphere which seems to mysteriously dissipate altogether after the first half-hour passes.
This movie seemed a lot more like an episode of the x-files than anything that would compare to the first film.
This film lacks the emotional conflicts of the first and the direction, lighting, and special effects are lacking in comparison and in general.
I guess if you thought the first Pumpkinhead was awesome, this movie would be a let down.
Pumpkinhead II: Blood Wings starts in the isolated 'Ferren Woods 1958' where a deformed boy named Tommy (J.P. Manoux) is happily eating his slop that his guardian Miss Osie (Lilyan Chauvin) has left for him when a group of six teenagers come along, capture him, beat him & eventually murder him... Jump forward to the present day & New York City cop Sean Braddock (Andrew Robinson) is returning to his childhood town to become the local Sheriff together with his wife Beth (Caren Kaye) & teenage daughter Jenny (Ami Dolenz), at first things seem perfect but while trying to make friends Jenny becomes involved with Danny (J. Trevor Edmond) & his gang.
There is even an old lady that resembles the old lady from the first movie as well.
Basically, anything that was good about the first Pumpkinhead movie is now taken out so you can be amazed out how simple the plot is and how uninspired.
This is a rather late straight-to-video sequel to the Stan Winston movie "Pumpkinhead" from 1988, that wasn't even a big commercial success in the first place.
The first movie already wasn't too great but this movie also adds very little and can hardly be called an improvement.
Jumping back to the black and white beginning (rip off of the technique first used by the Wizard of Oz), I know we watch these movies for blood and gore, but the opening scene when the deformed Tommy is chased down hanged, sliced and diced, then dumped down the old iron mine was truly shocking, I found my mouth hanging open and I am no pansy when it comes to violence, blood and guts.
Well, first of all, the videostore ripped me off on this one.
When I put it in the VCR, the first thing it said was : PUMPKINHEAD 2: BLOOD WINGS.
But I was right the first time.
This was this persons first film and I really don't know how he got cast, until I read the credits and I noticed he was the writer and executive producer also.
During the Mexican carivan scene first the guy drops his gun then a black man in a animal wrangle outfit walks into the shot, real bad editing... kinda funny though...
The beginning promises a lot, but right after the first five minutes, the movie becomes SLOOOWWW!
This was his big first acting appearance and it was pathetic.
We start with seeing two people in a van that at first I wasn't even sure whether they were both men or one was a woman.
There are some scenes in this film that are definitely not for the squeamish--the first brain scene is just the tip of the iceberg in this kind of imagery, so either brace yourself or click it off now.
Diana first uses the machine on Cesar, who, though innocent,has been convicted for the killing of the female border guard.
The first half of the movie is a mess, needlessly jumping around in time 3 days ago, an hour ago.
Don't even bother with The Quickening, just watch the first movie and then skip to the third one (after all, that's what the producers did).
Easily one of the worst films ever made and one which ignores the magic of the first movie.
Whether gracefully bowing out of a stage performance of HAMLET, paying off a snooty men's tailor with his pearl earring, experiencing his first airplane ride (a wonderful sequence!)
However, this movie deserves a special place in the realm of modern disasters in the film industry, because as a sequel it is absolutely abysmal, out of place, and an utter disgrace to the first one (and to the whole series, which never recovered after the atom-bomb that this movie dropped on the plot).
This movie was so incoherent and inducted so many plot inconsistencies in the whole series that even the credibility of the first one came out irreparably damaged.
The first time I saw this I was totally puzzled, I almost couldn't believe it.
Me sitting with a pile of friends, eagerly clasping their hands and gazing at the blank screen, eyes shining, all the while babbling to me that I (not having seen the first movie) was in for a total treat.
Why do our hearts break when her father stands her up after she spent the first half an hour lying about how much he cares for her?
This is such a huge letdown after the first movie, which is an absolute classic.
It gives some explanation as to how the competition began and it shows how Connor used the "prize" from the first film.
So what the hell was supposed to have happened at the end of the first film?
You can't just change the premise from the first film of what the immortals are, then bring back one that was dead.
I thought "but I have to, I loved the first one so well".
What was attempted as original just felt stale after the first several scenes.
The story is better than the first one, but I was a little disappointed with the end.
Whilst a novel if unbelievable partnership in the first film, in the sequel Connery and Lambert are generally awful.
In an attempt to summarise, whilst the creators of "Highlander" produced a simple action film which was simple to relax and enjoy, when they created this first sequel to it, they created an abomination.
It will contaminate all the good memories you have from the first film.
*SPOILER ALERT* (As if this piece of muck could be spoiled) This movie tells us the immortals from the first movie, steeped in mysticism and ritual, are actually...aliens.
Oh, and Sean Connery's character from the first movie (Juan RamÃ­rez) manages to come back to life for a little while, to help Conner MacLeod.
Magic...but didn't they just tell us these guys were aliens and not the mystical warriors we were led to believe in the first movie?
the theatre was packed and having really enjoyed the first movie, like i guess most of the audience we were all really excited to be seeing the sequel.
This movie has almost nothing to do with the first movie, and even by itself sits on laughable premises.
His part is about 6 minutes and he did die in the first one, not that the writers payed any attention to that little fact.
Don't misunderstand; I'm not saying this thing is poor - poor would be generous praise for a Frankenstein fantasy in which all the invention, both visual and conceptual, inherent in the first film's appeal is frittered to nothing.
Highlander III, not exactly itself a great sequel, ignored this one completely as ironically it left no outlet for a third episode but it too was a cynical cash-in and could only continue the first film by ignoring its ending whereas the forth in the series simply didn't bother with the first film at all, opting instead to go with the spin-off T.V series.
When Tom Goes To The Mayor (the first Tim and Eric project) first aired, I gave it chance.
Some nimrod here on IMDb actually compared this show to Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, in terms that when The Rite of Spring first appeared, the audience was shocked at the performance of it, and it split the audience.
It has some similar qualities to MTV2's Wonder Showzen, except Wonder Showzen had some real creative transitions in the first season (the 2nd season wasn't as good...the drugs they took must have worn off).
They say that history repeats itself, for the first time as a tragedy, for the second time as a farce.
Well, I would say that in Cabaret every event repeats itself for the first time as a human drama in life and for the second time as a farce on the stage, but it would not be exactly true.
There is nothing but reoccurring skits and jokes that were never funny in the first place and lame improv skits from lackluster people.
This show seems to be compiled of sketches where the writers feel that if they put down the first thing that pops into their head then it will automatically be funny.
and the year is probably the only reason that i first started seeing that awful movie.
At least watch Cannibal Ferox first!
On first viewing I found myself fast forwarding through the film, looking for "the good parts", though really I didn't give it a chance .... Then with time to spare, I gave it another go.
I must admit at first that there were some funny moments in the film -- most notably a coffee-guzzling Bill Murray, but it wasn't enough to save it.
After the first bit, you get a feel for the rest of the film quickly: Awkward, dry banter full of esoteric references and cute statistics.
'Cabaret' is an exciting place for music...  'Cabaret' is the first musical to exploit the notion that life is fascinating because it is ambiguous...   'Cabaret' uses music in an exciting new way... His characters do not disintegrate into song to express their emotions... Rather, a sleazy night club becomes a place where satirical comment on the lives and problems of these characters is made in striking, entertaining, and often in ferocious dances and songs...  'Cabaret' is only one of three major elements that remains separate in the film and then gradually and inexorably become melted into one...
Speaking almost entirely in emotional hyperbole, she regards herself as 'a strange and extraordinary person'... She takes Brian under her wing and one day introduces him to Helmut Griem, a rich, suave, divinely sexy baron with whom they both have affairs...   Everyone becomes part of her free world: an unseen father who is indifferent to her; and Marisa Berenson, a young serious Jewish department-store heiress who is feverishly courted by an opportunistic, a fortune hunter, called Fritz Wendel (Fritz Wepper)..  At first Sally's insulated life bears little relation to the events propelling Germany toward its bleak destiny... Gradually, however, the cabaret becomes more threatening; the Master of Ceremonies provides the historical and social themes throughout his songs.. (he and Sally sing 'Money makes the world go 'round').. Later he sings a stimulating 'Two Ladies' about the joys of a mÃ©nage Ã  trois..
If this is your first kickbox flick, you might not be too bored.
It makes the first American Kickboxer movie look quite good, something it definitely is not.
OK, it's set in America, but it has nothing to do with the first movie at all.
Who had heard of the first movie anyway?).
Not only do these events not make sense, but they are not fun like the first movie.
my sister and i had all four movies in the "House" series and decided to have a "House" marathon.we had just watched the first one,and had somehow made it to the end.but it wasn't easy.it was not a good film, at all.so, we suffered through the second one in.we managed to make it through 40 minutes of this dog, before we finally had to put it to sleep.this movie made the first one seem like Shakespeare in comparison.
the acting was atrocious,at best.the budget was next to nothing as was the first one.the whole plot was ludicrous,which is to be expected,but not to this degree.nobody would behave like these characters did,given the same situations.
The first film was weak enough, but to top it with this splattering of childish and irrelevent plot, characters and emotions, not to mention the rather stupid special effects, I found myself wondering why I had even bothered.
I remember when it first came out how the kids in my class at school were so excited by it.
So I bought the DVD and at first I was a little disappointed.Not by the movie really,but by the fact that not all the songs from the Broadway show were in the film.I really love that soundtrack so it mattered to me a lot.
So Cabaret is basically not "just" a musical.It has some darker themes about society,as well as showing us what the night life,and life in general,in poor Germany after the first World War just before Hitler came to power was like.And yes it also has wonderful musical scenes,good acting and is definitely worth the time to check out if these things interest you!!
The first was decent at best, this is just plain bad.
This doesn't seem to have any purpose at all(other than to successfully squeeze money out of what I suppose must have been somewhat of a box-office hit of a first movie of the franchise).
The first HOUSE was a decently amusing horror-comedy, but nothing at all great.
House 2 is not at all a sequel to the first one.
And this one is not as good as the first house.
It was worse than the first one even.
This House tale has nothing to do with the first "House" of a couple of years earlier and doesn't really qualify as a sequel even as it tries to capture some of that same wry humor, but it doesn't stand well on its own, being mostly non-sensical.
Oddly enough, the main connection to the previous film is that another actor from the "Cheers" TV show plays a part (Ratzenberger here; Wendt in the first one).
The first "House" was great.
one of the first comedy/horror films.
I went from cautiously liking this film in the first 40 minutes to despising it in the last hour or so.
The first part of the movie is rather good - grey sweeping footage over suburbia accompanied by monotone instrumental music sets the mood effectively.
Was I seeing the ending first?
This film lacked, in all sense of the word, coherency, from the first scene to the last.
This is the third Haneke film I've seen (Funny Games and Cache being the others), and it is pretty obvious to me that it is the first one he made.
The movie is good, if you have already read the book and have an inkling to what is going on in the first place.
In many ways a recycling of the first season's "The Night of the Glowing Corpse" but without an interesting villain like "Ironfoot".
However, after the first 15-20 minutes the film no longer deals with the topic of hecklers at all.
I honestly wish he would come interview me for "Hecklers 2", but we all know that nobody who watched the first one would ever green light a sequel.
Also the powers that be seemed to openly want to sabotage the film as with the amount of chances to get Sybil fully nude, they go to great lengths to not show her fourth acting talent, her tits and ass being the first three, so you know where I'm going with that one.
OK, first off there may be a SPOILER here since i don't know what constitutes giving out too much information.
Well, first of all, Emilio is driving everyone in the world's most overblown RV/Winnebago, tricked out with satellite dishes and crap like that on it.
Rated E(Contains Violence)   Released in 1988 Double Dragon is one of the first side-scrolling beat-em up fighting games.Sort of like Final Fight.In my opinion this is one of the best games released for the NES.For 1988 it was almost flawless.
The graphics were fairly good for its time and the gameplay was fun and simple.Double Dragon is a nice fun fighting game.You can fight using your fists and legs or you could use various weapons that you can find.This is one of the first of many side-scrolling fighting games to come.Double Dragon is a fun and good NES game.One of the best NES games in my opinion.
Double Dragon is commonly referred to as the first side-scrolling beat-em-up.
The Soviets beat the Americans to the moon; however, see how the first Soviet is found dead.
I've just heard it all before and it was funnier and better said the first time.
I saw this "film" the first time when I was a teenager, late at night, on broadcast television.
The first two stories are told clumsily and hurried so we can all sit back and watch the final story which takes up far, far too much of the total playing time of an hour and a half.
So you get the idea, the best performance is from a guy who has 2 lines it, the escaped lunatic mental killer in the first story.
The first story, about a group of jocks picking on a school handyman, doesn't fair much better in it's acting or production values.
I was probably the worst hour with a few minutes of all my life, first, the actors didn't knew how to act, then, the stories were so stupid that I couldn't believe that someone could listen to them, to worse the things, three silly boys were hearing to a drugged ranger, you think that could be a good movie?
There were 2 American tragedies in 2001: the first being 9/11 the other being the release of this film.
The first tale is of a nameless lunatic who escapes the Corbin Bernsen Institute of Dentistry, reestablishes himself as a Catholic high school janitor, and takes out four of the young men they randomly pulled off the street to play the most annoying bullies I've ever seen.
"Campfire Stories" was pretty lame,in my opinion.the opening sequence,with the so called flaming skull,looked like it was made on the cheap,to be polite.normally,i try to be diplomatic about bad acting in movies,but that would be hard in this case,so i won't say any more about that.aside from that,i didn't find it scary.i guess it's supposed to be something like "Tales From the Crypt" or "Creepshow",but it certainly doesn't measure up to either of those anthology series.i don't know what else to say.i guess i could talk about the lack of suspense,or even tension in the movie.or the fact that is not much gore for you gore hounds.to be fair, i didn't watch the whole thing.i didn't even watch all of the first episode.i fell asleep,but I'm fairly certain the rest of the anthology is no better.most people would likely be bored by this one.my advice is to avoid "Campfire Stories" and look elsewhere to satisfy your entertainment needs.I'll give this movie 3/10,at most.
The whole reason I picked up this movie in the first place is that I just adore low budget made horror movies because in my opinion they normally turn out to be better than the big budget horror films (examples: "Campfire Tales" and "Dead End").
The first is about what occurs to some idiot, scumbag jocks who mess around with a school janitor who just happens to be an escaped convict who was able to flee his asylum by murdering the psychotic doctor performing "pain threshold experiments" on him.
The first was perhaps the most pointless and is about a man escaping from the insane asylum.
4 is better because the first story was awesome, at least better than some episodes of Are You Afraid of the Dark?, unlike the rest of the stories.
The first story actually had gore, which I didn't expect much of.
The first one is OK.
After the first few minutes I thought I was wrong, this movie was going to suck but as it progressed it did get better.
The first story, about a group of jocks picking on a school handyman, doesn't fair much better in it's acting or production values.
The first sub story was just unimaginative.
THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR appears in the first collection of Sherlock Holmes short stories, THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES.
He is a fortune hunter who marries and gets rid of wives (so why not the first one?).
I must say, first and foremost, the casting for this movie is superb.
The first half of the movie plays out OK-- nothing special, but an OK action film.
Babylon A.D., the story of Toorop, a veteran-turned-mercenary who takes the job of escorting a woman named Aurora from Central Asia to New York, stays fresh and witty in its first hour.
The movie begins quickly and the first hour is brilliantly average Â one can only help but admit there is little chance of a blockbuster after hearing zero publicity.
Either it stayed true to its first hour Â gritty, surprising evil marked by mysterious characters or get lazy and forever be lost to theatrical mediocrity.
There are some exciting action set-pieces, the dramatic and satiric set-pieces are occasionally intriguing, and the world of Babylon AD may be unpleasant but it is fully realized, which is the first demand for any sci-fi film.
A TV show pilot where they spend the first two seasons running from town to town evading the religious nuts?
I'd first like to say that,im usually generous and optimistic when i see movies, and usually films my friends say suck, i say they are okay, or when my friends say they are okay, i say it was great...This one failed in 2 very important aspects of storytelling.
I should say first that I don't know the book this movie is adapted from, so I just mean to give an opinion on the movie itself and the way it's handled.
Same goes for the acting : Depardieu and Wilson are easily the worst : they would have read the script for the first time it wouldn't have surprise me.
Sadly, they were right, the first hour actually had me, I was like "Are they crazy?
My first reaction to Babylon A.D. was that it's not nearly as bad as its own director, Matthieu Kassovitz, has been claiming it is, although that reaction came to me before I got to the end of the movie.
At first all she want's to eat are flies which is fine, but she begins to grow (it's flower pot must also have the ability to grow as well) & quickly moves onto frogs, then it's dogs from the local pound.
And the first twenty minutes actually aren't that bad, neither!
At first, you're just searching for an untraceable method to get rid of one corpse you accidentally got stuck with, yet before you know it, you're mangling people especially to generate more tasty cat food.
"Ginger Snaps:Unleashed" is almost as good as the first one.The soundtrack is awesome and creates a creepy atmosphere of desperation and isolation.There is plenty of gore and violence and some really vicious werewolf attacks.The acting is excellent with outstanding performance by Emily Perkins.The film is really tense,so if you liked the original you won't be disappointed.Highly recommended.
Being a rather cheap copy of Lars von Trier's original i found this mini series annoying after the first few minutes.
At first I have to say I was attracted by this series because it seemed like offering something new and more complicated than your average "Jack Bauer-hour".
Recently I finally saw Riget II, which was even more riveting than the first part.
If you started watching this when it first aired and never finished, then don't bother, it only gets worse with every episode.
Hey, I'm not the first who falls into that tale.
Having seen the first 2 episodes of kingdom hospital, i must say that i am already really disappointed.
At first it seems like a remake of Lars Von triers "Riget" but stray of from the original, which is a lot better and much more scary.
The first episode actually seemed very promising and had a great potential.
I couldn't stop watching this train wreck, because I always kept hoping that they would recapture some of the wonder that was originally established before the end of the first season.
Well here you go I'm typing some more text and I should repeat that Andromeda was fun in the first couple of episodes, and there seemed to be some sort of interesting back story to the whole thing but beginning in the second season, it lost touch with all of that possible storyline and became a senseless gunfight occurring over and over again and again.
As Season 2 began to move along, the usual first season clumsiness that one expects from new TV shows had totally dissolved and an epic plot line was beginning to come to life.
The intrigue and purpose seemed to peak around the end of the first season.
Most importantly the goals of the first 2 seasons seemed utterly ignored.
While I can recommend the first two seasons of Andromeda to most SciFi fans because they appealed to many people on many different levels, I cannot recommend Season 3 or beyond to anyone who appreciates intelligent or well done writing.
Joanna Lumley got her first film part in this picture, but was uncredited.
The first thing that went wrong is that the movie is based on a book by Ronald Giphart.
It's one of those movies which makes you wonder after you have seen it; Why did I even watched this in the first place?
Target Earth is the very first of Herman Cohen's exploitation cheap low budget Sci-Fi films.
When you first get a look at the cumbersome robot who shoots very slow moving laser beams, it's difficult to stifle a laugh.
Maddened brigands and bandits: this comes to the heart of the matter, even bandits are likely to negotiate first.
The first 7 hours of the movie contain an endless slog through a desolate landscape bereft of plant and animal life.
Granted I've only watched the first episode, but it was repulsive and filled with clichÃ©s.
In all fairness, it was brash of me to drop this series after the first episode.
Sorry, my name is..." And last but not least is a large-busted female we meet in the first episode, who the girl twin hates for some reason.
When we first meet her, she speaks a few cryptic lines into a cellphone.
First of all i think it's nothing more than a cash-in on the first movie.
Second the animators are not the same, the director is not the same, actually quite a lot isn't the same as the first one, which is a bad thing, since this second fritz movie doesn't have a proper story line, or a good script, actually it doesn't have anything of the things that made the first movie so wonderful.
Still it's Fritz the Cat and all is not lost, but all through the film i get the feeling that the director just took all the ingredients of the first fritz movie and mashed them together to a lifeless pile, sticking them in here and there, maybe because that's what he thought the fans wanted (and that would make more money).
Then he managed to portray Fritz as somewhat of a loser, which he may be, in some people's eyes', but i don't think that's the feeling you get from the first one.
So my suggestion is; if you haven't seen any of the fritz movies, watch the first one only, this one isn't quite worth while.
you and the future love of your life enjoyed it together on a first date, forgive what I'm about to say.
This information could have been relayed quickly in any number of ways, but the first 20 minutes of the picture is devoted to this.
Vogel would have done much better if he'd 'borrowed' more than just the plot from Raimi's 1982 masterpiece for his first stab at a 'real' film.
Instead, the first half of the film is wasted watching a despicable bunch of losers do nothing but take drugs and talk about sex; the second half is spent watching them stumble around an old building in the dark before being killed.
The first thought after watching The Redsin Tower was "Well, that was f@ckin weak."
At the very least you have to give Steven Bagatourian and Aric Avelino props for being the very first kids on the block to jump on the Crash-Paul Haggis bandwagon.
The alcoholic mother and the brother of one of the killers, a cop that was first on the scene of the event and suffers PTSD.
The first effort for this director is a waste of everyone's time.
In the first half of the film, most lines were spoken in flat monotone--the absence of inflection made the plot harder to follow.
While the much-talked about To be or not to be speech is wonderfully conceived in that monument of indecision, Blockbuster, with the not-too-subtle "Action" signs passing by our mirthless heir, Hawke reads the speech without ever getting out of first gear, without ever giving a hint of meaningful inflection.
Only two others in the film even approach Schreiber's level of excellence, the first being Kyle MacLachlan, in his portrayal of Claudius.
I'm a great Fan of Ginger Snaps and was really excited about this film when i first heard about it, unfortunately when it arrived at the cinema I was to young to see it.
I'm sure its always a gamble for people and film fans alike to buy movies on Tapoe/DVD with out viewing them first and for me this was a first.
I whole heartedly will you to see it, even if you have not yet view the first one.
One of the first films produced (but not directed) by Roger Corman is marginally okay tale of convict (John Ireland, who directed) who escapes from prison and then kidnaps Dorothy Malone and uses her and her sports car as a cover for entry into a race that will get him across the border and to freedom.
Its not a bad film if you don't pay 100% attention to it, but as background noise, which is what it became, but as something to actually sit and watch from first frame to the last it's a bit of a trial.
When the star car starts the race it is with white wire wheels, full width bumpers and without a front license plate, then at the first turn the plate appears, then the front bumpers disappear and become little bumperettes, then they reappear, the wheels change from white to dark and back again, and so on throughout the race.
When the race is half over, the girl back at the starting line jumps into an Allard and somehow catches up to the Jags, by which time the Allard has changed color twice, and gained a spare tire on first the right side, then the left, then the right again, and now it has portholes in the side, definitely not the same Allard she started with.
It ranks right up there with Curb Your Enthusiasm as first rate letdowns.
If you get frightened of the jump scenes, this must be your first action movie.
This is the first movie in the new Wallanderseries and is based on the book with the same name.
In the first one (Mannen som log), Rolf LassgÃ¥rd did an admirable job of portraying Wallander, but I was mildly irritated when the film ended in the complete opposite way: the villain got away!
Chaplin is dressed as an Englishman who appears to first propose to a young lady and then must find work.
However, it is still historical of course to see Chaplin in his first film, even though he is not honed.
After catching the first two episodes of this show and then taking a gander at this site's message board, it's pretty apparent that it is the teenage girls, and sadly a handful of grown women who are attracted to the so-called "Hotti-Gotti" boys as they've been dubbed who continue to watch with regularity and keep this pitiful and wretched excuse for entertainment (which can be likened to a type of mental Novocaine if you ask me) afloat just enough to cause A&E to run a second season or so I've been told anyway.
Kristin Cavallari, reality-TV star turned actress, impressed me for the first half of the movie; her acting seemed genuine and she was rather charismatic on screen.
But, you know, this was her first movie, so i'll cut her a break.
The scene in the junk yard: The actor that plays the first body out of the hearse looks like Johnny Depp.
A cynical lazy Hollywood pic, lowest common denominator stuff, recycling ideas that weren't really that good in the first place and should have been left well alone.
Bad jokes sporadically thrown throughout the film, which were vulgar and tasteless, made me consider walking out the first time I saw it - and I've never considered walking out on any film I've seen, no matter how bad it was.
The first 48 Hours was a bonafide hit that started and/or influenced the cop buddy film genre for years to come.
It was Eddie Murphyâs first film and along with Trading Places made him a star.
Nothing that worked in the first film works here.
Co-written by the director of the first installment, Walter Hill, (who had years to come up with something good) gives the fans of the original a HUGE letdown.
Because ANYONE who saw the first film could see the plot holes.
Whereas the original 48 Hours was a well written and acted version of the "buddy-cop" films, the sequel is uninspired and drawn out version of the first.
By sheer coincidence I saw this movie again about 24 hours after I wrote the review(purely coincidental)  I had seen this when it first came out and then seen part of it again and did not like it AT ALL.
In fact, I found this film - as opposed to the first one - very offensive.
Of course, my beliefs had changed since first viewing "Sister Act."
The film does come briefly to life when the nuns from the first film do a cameo number, but the main returnees such as Maggie Smith (I hope she was paid well), Kathy Najimy and Wendy Makkena are irrelevant.
It abandons the old neighborhood from the first movie, adds a bunch of characters that are introduced then forgotten, there are no references to the cop (Nunn) that helped out Whoopi in the original and aside from Sister Mary Patrick (Najimy, always good for a laugh), everyone looks bored beyond belief.
Goldberg's mere presence brings a smile, but this is hand-me-down material (much more so than the cookie-cutter first installment) and is completely without merit.
The nun choir songs were nowhere near as polished as the first movie.
Sheriff Bill Osco, who dresses like a truck driver, even when at the town station, is to the rescue, ready to kill the monster if he doesn't bore him to death first with his non-performance and monotone voice.
I'm a Southerner first of all and I don't appreciate the gross inaccuracies that Willmott made in this film.
I liked it a lot, in fact even more than the first movie.
From the outset, with the breathtaking bungee jump off the dam, a real stunt by a real guy that manages to be both visually exciting and believable, my first impression was Â if they're going to stick with this sort of approach; we're in for something special.
Even something like: "Just dropped in," would have at least referenced how Bond got there in the first place.
I first read about this in Fred Olen Ray's fantastic "The New Poverty Row", so when I saw it for $5 at Grimsby Giant Tiger, I scarfed it up.
This is almost to be expected from the second story, which is basically just an hour of filler - but even the first tale doesn't adhere to any kind of logic (except maybe Jean Rollin's!).
Popular French art/cult director Jean Rollin's first foray into the horror genre calls itself a two-part melodrama and is divided into two segments that overlap; "Part One: The Rape of the Vampire" and "Part Two: The Vampire Women."
In the first portion (which is the shorter of the two), psychoanalyst Thomas, his friend Marc and Marc's girlfriend Brigitte go to a mansion to investigate claims of vampirism.
Several characters from the first segment wander in and out every once in awhile.
This second and much longer portion also seems more rushed and less stylish than the first.
Discounting Rollin's super-cheesy living dead disaster ZOMBIE LAKE (which even his most devoted fans have a hard time defending), this is my first real look at the work of this director.
The first segment almost seemed to hit the right note, but the second didn't even come close.
When I heard about Anna Nicole Smiths death today, the first question that popped into my mind was "Who gets the money?"
It is fascinating to see how the USA was a non-intervener at first (a refreshingly different stance form the current aggressor role we have adopted) and how the needs of the planet required global cooperation in the face of Hitler et al.
It's hard to stay interested as the film goes along because the characters we begin to sympathize with are each killed off in turn...which is fine as an element of surprise the first time it happens, but when it continually happens throughout the movie, the end result is that it distances the viewer and you're not left with much to care about.
This one, the original Howling, and Howling IV are the only ones worth watching out of the first 5 flicks.
and the story is so predictable, I wonder if a toddler wrote it.... the dramatic payoffs are simply comical and the audience was left laughing at a scene where sympathy was expected....  salman tries to bring comic relief to the first half, but due to bad direction and worse dialog, one can't help but feel exasperated.
BAGHBAN was scripted 40 years back and it was modified and it had some good emotional moments bt yet it was too oldfashioned   Here too the story sounds 2000 years old  Rani Mukherjee's role, her dress sense, her acting, her smiling is all too bad Don't know why she is boring to watch Seriously i loved her in YUVA, HUM TUM but nowdays she is just doing the same roles, same acting style, even her dress scenes are outrageous  I don't understand people praising her like hell here, she has no role just to cry after Salman dies and then get married because Amitabh says so  About the rest as i said the story is like PREM ROG(1982) and the handling is not at all convincing  The all hoopla done about the clash of titans between Amitabh and Om is just 5 minutes talk  Direction by Ravi Chopra is outdated Music is outdated  Amitabh once again demonstrates his acting skills and overshadows everyone but he is getting monotonous with such roles Salman does well in the first half, nothing new but he is more lively and less animated then in most of his films John looks sick(he was suffering from jaundice those days) but fails in his acting here Hema Malini is just there in the movie, her role lacks substance In fact the director doesn't at all care for women's wishes in the film supposedly based on women role improvement in society Rajpal comes does some usual gags and is forgotten Parmeet Sethi has no role Om Puri is too loud
The comedy in the first half wasn't great either.
I'm not sure why the `championship' team played the first half like a bunch of thugs.
From the boyfriend you know will cheat on her from the first scene, to the evil nemesis complete with wicked sisters, to the MTV video inspired make over that turns bland and boring Jenny into a hot vixen, to the kids she wins over through determination and pluck, this movie manages to take on every clichÃ© ever made.
Since I first wrote this in 2004, I have just discovered (May 2007) that it was released on DVD back in Feb. !
Of course, if his first wife hadn't become you-know-who, he wouldn't even be a blip on the radar.
That day in 1987 (or was it 1988), I tuned in to it for the first time.
I can see why I liked the first live action movie so much better.
If you want to see an experience close to Eastman and Laird's works, watch the first live action movie.
The first one, with Debbie Harry as a maniac housewife about to cook a kid for dinner, is actually the best.
The first thing he does is goes on about how the ritual of mummification calls for pulling out the corpse's brain.
The first 30 seconds where the "witch" where on her way home from the supermarket where fine, but once she came in to her house and we saw the boy trapped in some kind of jailcell, we where like, "what the hell is this?".
The boy starts reading "scary" stories so that she wont kill him, and the first one is about a mummy coming back to life and starts killing people and kind of making them mummy's too..
I sat through this tripe hoping(nay, praying)that it would somehow lift itself out of the mediocrity that is established in the first few scenes....
Eden's first major release in a decade is certainly nothing Major Nelson would approve of.
It's the first movie I ever walked out on.
When the IMDb top 250 and it's ugly step-sister, the Bottom 100 first came out a few years ago, this movie was in the latter.
At first their erotically charged relationship seems like paradise, but this, of course, cannot last.
The first episode premired and after the challenge Kutcha went.
I remember watching it when it first came out.
At first, I was a little bit reluctant about watching this show.
The second part of the "Ginger Snaps" trilogy picks up after the first one.
While the first one simmered with satire on female hormones and puberty, "Unleashed" is a straight horror film.
Bridgitte is a lot more confident and a lot hotter than the first one.
All the warning signs were shown in the first thirty minutes.
If you haven't seen the first one you could just watch this one alone.
One other issue that some might have with this film is you really must see a traditional version of Jekyll and Hyde first.
When I first started watching it I didn't mind it at all, it wasn't to bad, then it started getting crap.
I first started watching Neighbours when I met my girlfriend about 2 years ago because she watched it.
first off most of the new people on the street like Marco are simply boring where as Bridget is just annoying to the point where you wish the show was cancelled.hopefully the show will pick up again if they bring back evil Paul,Connor, Stu, and get rid of Marco, Didge, all the people who are involved in a storyline with Marco and Ringo as well for good measure.well that's all i have to say really i used to love this show but now it really has just begun to annoy me.
The first, really glaring problem is the opening that has a very incomplete and poorly-explained history of how the Khmer Rouge came to power.
how can the director justify himself about the secrecy hidden in the picture that Basil does not want to reveal at first, and HIS confession to Dorian later?
after the first 15 minutes the story seemed to turn in circles- which actually was a good thing for a friend of mine, who got out of the theater to buy some drinks and returned 15 minutes later: I didn't have to tell him what was going on while he was gone, because actually nothing happened at all.
Steph, was easily one of the most competitive people ever on the show, she was likable, and everyone was rooting for her to win in her first season.
Prisoners Of The Lost Universe is my first camp movie love.
And, at least in the first viewing, you can't help but to applaud for the inner logic of the story and the world.
Red Dawn was the very first film released with a PG-13 rating in the states, The Flamingo Kid (1984) was actually the first film to be given a PG-13 but Red Dawn ended up being released before it.
The animals are still lovable and fun to watch, but the lack of adventurous moments makes it is pretty boring compared to the first one.
Not forgetting, in the first film, Chance explained that before he was adopted he was a stray dog, and was abandoned when still a puppy, so he'd know a little about living on the streets don't you think?
For example: Where did they get the gas to drive a jeep several hundred miles through an unexplored rainforrest Why would anyone like Connor join up with two complete strangers (Chris & Darlene) on a wild idea such as the expedition in the first half.
In fact most of the actors here seem to be appearing on film for the first time.
I understand that this is the first effort at something above the level of made for TV for this team.
The first halve of the movie can be basically seen as a build up.
Not much is happening in its first halve but also from the moment one when the cannibalistic humanoid underground dwellers show up the movie doesn't really know to become exciting.
The first tale (by Clive Barker) is laughable effort in which a salesman is saved from a criminal hitchhiker by a set of chattering teeth-toy.
Both stories run low on creativity and they're extremely repetitiveÂYou'd be better of watching `The Hitcher' instead of the first story and `The Beast With 5 Fingers' instead of the second one.
I enjoyed the stephen king tale, i thought it did a good job from adapting from the book and it was creative, but the second story, was the most god awful thing ive ever seen on film, it was just horrible, i was in pain watching this, do your self a favor turn this movie off right after the first story, the second one is so bad.
3/10 for a good first story the only thing that gave it points
It is truly one that I will always keep in my collection and never forget what it meant to me when I first watched it.
I decided to put the TV on and one of the first channels I flipped to was a show starring Christopher Lloyd.
His first he delivers to a newlywed bride whose car has broken down, and whose husband has wandered away looking for a gas station.
Scientist explains what is going on in the first part of the movie, he makes it really, really easy (not to say primitive) to understand the basic physics behind the idea of the film.
But first, I need to hurt the puerile-minded fans of this schlock: Any ratiocinating fools who entreat those of us with a modicum of intelligence to "sit back, relax and enjoy this entertainment" do not realize that we who rail against bogus "science" in movies of this ilk, do so NOT because of bogus science per se, but because of the INCONSISTENT bogus science.
Example 2: If your movie cites Real Science to explain the impossibility of generating enough energy to start the planet's core re-spinning, why not establish that it takes that same impossible amount of energy to STOP the core in the first place?
There's the Square-Jawed American Pilot (least-known of the principals Â ergo, first to die); Delroy Lindo, Token Black Dude; That Guy from Six Feet Under and Alfre Woodward as the preposterously miscast Flight Director.
Within the first five minutes I knew that the two main characters would get together, the rest of the crew would die, and they would be successful.
Brigitte now has the virus in her blood that destroyed her sister Ginger in the first film.
Because of the sequel's depressing vibe, it does lack the heartache of the horrifying matter that drove the sisters even closer in the first film.
Just like in the first film and like many reviewers have painted it's a metaphor for adolescent life, from angst, drugs and sex.
Should we completely remove our brain first by smashing our head on a rock until it falls out, because if so, I'll do it.
Let me just first note that there are geological records to say that the magnetic field has changed direction many times in the past, with evidence to support that each time it has been reduced close to 0.
Fifteenthly, the arming code for the nukes was the first four prime numbers... 1 2 3 5...
Well, thats about all, and thats not even going into the fact about how the core could stop spinning in the first place.
Wells wouldn't roll on his grave with this since it is wonderfully fashioned, but it definitely not a classic like the first one, "The Island of Lost Souls", has become, but definitely worth a look for some fine performances, exotic locations and fine creature make-up.
The first thirty-five minutes of this movie is how horrible this boys life is at home.
Spend the first 1/2 of the movie bored to tears and the second 1/2 wanting it to hurry up and end.
I know Harrisburg isn't the first small city/town/location to have a bad movie associated with it, but the advertising made such a big deal that the movie was in Harrisburg.
Having realized after the first 10 minutes that this movie is going to be relentless in its pursuit of unfunniness, I was half-hoping that Travolta would once again introduce the concept of "leverage" into the plot.
It's David's first day at school after having recently moved to the area.
Lo Bianco and Stoler argue constantly, yet we can't see why he is so devoted to her (or why he changed his course of action for her in the first place).
"Double Team," directed by the Hong Kong veteran Tsui Hark, is Van Damme's first foray into the world of Asian/American cinema.
In a globe-spanning odyssey from Spain, to somewhere in the Mediterranean and finally to the Roman Coliseum, you would expect "Double Team" to be fast & furious Hollywood/Hong Kong action of the first degree.
Well, first of all the name: Double Team.
To play the game 'who dies first - good Jack or bad Stavros?
DER CLOWN is a vintage cinematic failure - which rates even more painful, as it is conceived to be the first cinema released film of the newly formed cinema division of Germany's production company ACTION CONCEPT.
My first hint was that the DVD said in was 1hour and 15 min.
It has a firm first act: the problem is that a grown man, named Elwood P. Dowd, has an imaginary friend that is a six foot tall rabbit-similar to the Easter bunny-named Harvey.
Now, that's not to say the movie doesn't make us laugh, because there are several sequences in the film that are down right hysterical, proving that a movie can be successfully made about an imaginary six foot rabbit, but most of the funny scenes accrue during the first twenty minutes, for the one joke this film has gets stale after a while.
There is a particularly bad scene in "Harvey" that not only proves my point about how bad the film is, but also make's public an obvious flaw that the majority of an audience would miss the first time watching it.
If you have not seen the original I urge you not to watch this dreadful imitation first and see the real thing.
The story is truly imbecile, the direction and camera - very mediocre, and the movie looks like it's somebody's first try in cinema montage.
That's first movie of Genelia and Ritiesh.
), Walter Pigeon as a bewildered Chairman of the Board and a split-second cameo from George Raft - who co-starred with Mae in her very first film, NIGHT AFTER NIGHT (1932) - as himself.
Raft (West's first cinematic co-star) has a brief bit in an elevator and Regis Philbin of all people has a cameo as a reporter.
I first saw this movie when it came out.
The themes were never good in the first place.
Cameos from others such as Rona Barrett and George Raft (Mae's first screen co-star in 1932, who grimaces through his scene with Mae in the elevator as though he regretted agreeing to do it) abound.
At first he is subtilely creepy with his awkward questions and affable laugh but as the film progresses he becomes more unhinged.
At first they are first tricked into thinking it is Canada.
This movie was very disappointing and a major let down compared to the first and second Santa Clause films.
The first film was dark, entertaining and witty and had a good amount of tension and scares.
Following the events of the first film, Bridget is on the run, moving from town to town and constantly taking monkshood (the drug that prevents werewolfism) to stop her turning into a werewolf following the final confrontation in the first film.
The farting reindeer wasn't funny the first time and then they had them fart AGAIN about 20 seconds later like it would be funny that time, and it wasn't.
I am the first to admit I loved the first two Santa Clause movies and was really looking forward to this third installment.
I thought to myself and told my friends - critics don't know anything about movies and they were hard on the first two films in this series (both average around 4.7 out of 10).
I went to see this movie like I did the second one because I am a very nostalgic person and I wanted to relieve happier parts of my childhood by watching this film in which it's predecessor or The first one was a great delight in my young years.
They spend nearly hour just in the toy shop in this film and never show Tim Allan as Santa interacting with kids on the level he did in the first or for that matter the way he did in the second one either.
I saw the first one when I was about five I loved it.
Don't get me wrong, this movie is great for little kids but not for fans of the first two Santa Claus movies.
**Spoiler** Bernard does not appear as the head elf anymore like he did in the first two.
I liked the first film, loved the second one, but was highly disappointed with the 3rd film.
The first two films went together.
The magic of the first two films simply was not present in this film.
The attempt to bring a bunch of family members to the North Pole seemed to also take away from the formula that made the first two films so successful.
This film was rarely funny, confused, poorly executed, and the only real escape clause should have been for the audience...to get out of the theater within the first 15 minutes.
Another killer is the flashback to the time Tim Allen's character first meets Santa Clause on his roof.
At first I just thought the script had put the actor to sleep.
When I saw the first Santa Clause at the age of 10 it had set the standard for Christmas movies for me.
The set from the first movie was huge -- outside looked like a dark, expansive glacier and indoors was a gigantic toy workshop.
The special effects were far worse than the first movie 12 years ago.
In the first movie, the producer actually cared about the outcome and therefore sunk a large sum of money into the best special effects at the time.
The filmmakers even had the audacity to use actual cut-scenes from the first movie - about 90 seconds worth - which to me is pretty tacky; seems like they just needed some more filler.
Seeing the first movie at the young age I did of course I wasn't going to understand some of the adult humor.
Then there were Alan Arkin and Ann Margaret's couple bickering so much you really wondered what they ever saw in each other in the first place.
This film felt like the dieing embers of a Yule log, spluttering, a few pretty pops, but none of the warmth that made the first 2 films so enjoyable.
Tim Allen created a great character in the first film - the 2nd was pushing it - this 3rd outing was simply vengeful.
It wasn't that great as the first one.
The first one was more funnier.
My family and I enjoyed the first two Santa Clause movies, but this was a major let down.
Props first, Zhang Yimou is doing an awesome job behind the camera which, in my opinion saved it from total anonymity.
And while this comes as a shock to her father at first, despite the insistence of his girlfriend, Janet (Catherine Hicks) that this is all normal for the girl and in fact, good for her, he is still unconvinced and becomes not only paranoid, but soon enters therapy.
Mike Harlan (John Stockwell, in his first top-billed role) is a laid-back car junkie who doesn't seem to care about anything else BUT cars.
The lovely Edwige Fenech, of course is ravishing throughout, but deigns not to take her clothes off as much as in the first film.
My first reaction was to shut it off half way through.
Alex: I knew he was one of the Horsemen right when I first saw him act shy, blame his father for not being there for his mother when she was dying of cancer, taking care of Sean while his father is busy working, etc.
You are automatically thrown into mystery and suspense with the first body being discovered.
In it's first scenes I thought the movie was promising, and it kept me going for like 20 minutes, without complaining, but when the plot begins to twist, I began to think that it was not worth watching, and then that it's one of the worst movies of the year.
I first heard that song during the opening credits of the much better movie: 'Dawn of the Dead' (remake.)
During the second half of this movie the only thought in my head was "please don't let this be the twist, please tell me that writers are more imaginative than that, please don't let me have to watch the second half of this movie only to find it was what I guessed after the first 20 minutes".
This is one of those movies that is so obviously thrown together to make a quick buck that anyone stuck watching it is bound to feel embarrassed after sitting through, say, the first ten minutes, wondering why they have chosen to waste their time in such a way.
What I didn't see in the show, ( and it may be mentioned in his book - which I haven't read) is where is his actual first wife?
While married to his first wife, Pam, he has an affair with Kathy who bears him a son out of wedlock.
Pam, admits that she is very angry and resentful of Kathy when she first moves into their home, but now, 18 years later, she loves her and can't imagine life without her.
I write my first ever post to save someone else an hour of their time and a bottle of pepto to quiet an upset stomach.
He cares only for himself, first and foremost, and this is apparent in the show.
The kid who plays Pinocchio is just weird and idiotic, I mean first he doesn't know what's going on, and then suddenly he has ideas of his own about things.
To be honest, the first half of the film is in fact quite amusing due to its low production value and completely dysfunctional storyline, but it becomes somewhat aggravating to watch the latter half when these redeeming qualities get old.
This is the first Disney movie I've seen in the theaters done by the Television Animation department and it will definitely be the last.
")- I do feel the need to point out that Nemo is not the first fish to reference popular culture to adults.
My first film from this year's San Francisco International Film Festival.
The slowness itself didn't bother me, but the much-heralded Apichatpong can learn something from Tony Bui, whose first feature film "Three Seasons" is FAR better at the languid development than this.
At first, I thought to myself, how in the heck did such a movie even win an award.
The first way it tries to do this is by jumping from camera to camera(all of which are at an unsettling angle) and from normal film quality to CCTV-esquire film.
The acting was also pretty dire, having wondered "whatever happened to Jennifer Jason Leigh" for the first few minutes of this movie, I soon realised why i hadn't missed her.
This is the first film i've failed to sit through.My head ached, my eyes hurt, and boy did i feel sick!
What insues is unfortunatly unwelcome and senseless visits from the first films title charachter but a vast mixing pool of other cringe inducing twists including the fact that a male werewolf has found her and wants to mate.
The actor who plays Tea Cake is the first to really use the southern dialect and give the feel that the movie takes place in the south.
I have to agree with the first comment, because this movie was nothing special.
Because Winfrey decided to remove all instances of domestic violence from her movie Janie has no motivation for leaving her first husband.
The blend of horror and mystery is a cool combination, but that simply wears out thin after you see it the first time.
Sure there are a couple of funny sketches like the sick and twisted one about a teen boy in love with a sex-toy, at first I was like "yuck" but I couldn't help but to laugh.
He's only in the movie for maybe ten minutes, if even that, and the first couple of minutes really nothing happened.
The presence of Oscar Wilde and Lord Alfred Douglas, who first met in 1891, coupled with references to Jack the Ripper (1888) and the Eiffel Tower (1889), would however suggest a date nearly fifty years later.
The first joke is that, behind a mask of piety and respectability, Victorian men were in fact all incredibly randy.
The first of these jokes is perhaps based upon a half-truth; social disapproval of vice and prostitution has never, in the Victorian age or any other, prevented it from flourishing.
I saw the promos i was interested especially the first promo but the last few promos gave away and i hoped the film won't be as bad but the film is worst  Abbas-Mustan tried to make a commercial potboiler instead just to appeal to the masses who like such nonsense films  The film starts off okay, 2 songs at the start itself and then slowly each characters are introduced but then the film gets boring because All characters are jerks  Paresh Rawal- Johny scenes are stupid and too loud and crass Shahid- Kareena scenes are worthless and boring They is little hope when Isha is murdered but the director is too involved with comedy, romance and nothing makes sense in the end  The Johny- Tanaaz finding a dead body in the briefcase is too childish and then the entire investigating scenes are not that great  But the end takes the cake, one of the worst climaxes ever Even the CID episodes have better culmination  Abbas-Mustan give their worst ever film Music is good  Shahid and Kareena who were a pair that time are truly wasted Shahid just keeps making big eyes trying to look funny and make weird noises while Kareena irritates Akshaye imitates his dad Vinod Khanna at places and is the only actor worth mentioning here Tanaaz and Johny overact Paresh Rawal overacts too while Payal Rohatgi and Isha are dismissal Upen Patel with a dubbed voice is painful rest are poor
It is way too long,there is no performance strong enough to anchor it,there are very few believable characters.The exception being Mr Victor Argot as Miss Lopez's father,a small role with little dialogue but a first class example of how good actors can do "less is more".
Coppoloa is as obsessive about getting down every little uninteresting detail about people and events he doesn't understand the significance of, as his protagonist is; if the process of watching the minutae of bugging is SOMETIMES involving (as in the opening scene, where we see how the title conversation was recorded in the first place; or the sequence in which Caul patiently and methodically sifts through what sound like random crackles in order to pull out complete, comprehensible sentences; or even the trade show, where matters of moment look as though they might be under discussion), this is because it's sometimes going somewhere.
A lot of people preferred the first film also with James Ryan as Steve Chase in "Kill and Kill Again", but I must tell you that the box-office figures tell a very different story...in fact, depending on how old you are, you might remember a film made by Bo Derek's husband John Derek called "10" ...a 'tits and bums' vehicle to show off the many charms of his lovely wife that did very well at the box-office and was released the same year as "Kill and Kill Again'.
The first casualty--Ritch Petroski (Brody Harms of "Adam & Evil")occurs about 20 minutes into the action, and the shook-up survivors tear off in their Jeep and then have second thoughts about leaving their poor mauled friend behind.
There's one scene in particular that stunned me, it's just after the first attack when Rich is killed & as Wes drives the jeep away next to a sheer drop & Sean grabs the steering wheel & they have a struggle which sends the jeep over the edge of the small cliff & causing themselves all sorts of problems.
The first maybe 30 minutes or so are actually pretty decent, but after that the movie just sort of meanders around and nothing happens (I don't mean in terms of plot - no plot is fine, but no action?
Plus, this is the first movie I've seen that before the credits, it says the title again.
All this, and a plot based on the premise that the victims all choose to run around in the open to escape the wooden bear, rather than take refuge on the first floor of the empty house.
Within the first quarter of an hour, they get lost, attacked, and one of the happy-go-lucky teens dies.
Yeah when I first saw the commercials for this movie I was like.
I first saw Grizzly Rage, like so many other Big Creature Eating Attractive People films late one night on the Sci Fi channel with a large group of friends while the majority of us were downing sizable amounts of alcohol.
You can get attacked by a bear, rolled off a cliff in a car, thrown spine first onto a bear trap and spend all day battling for survival on a sun parched strip of mid-western wilderness and still have better skin and hair than Andie McDowell.
It would probably be a good idea to see the film first then read the book to note the comparison, and in doing so also raise the bar on the story.
The movie instead plays the older part in the first segment, as one full flashback that tries to cram way too many events into one bit, whereas they should have simply tried to organize their own way of telling, and the more recent events in the second half.
And it's OK that they cut out the kids being lost after first believing they killed It (definitely because of the made for TV movie... hell, even a theatrical movie...
While they could have made it much worse, I must urge people to read the book first.
Breaking down the character name is also telling, not least the unsubtle Biblical reference of his first name.
Before I get into this film, I'd just like to comment on the last few minutes, when little Edmund enters into his fantasy world of singing daisies, talking birds and day-glo skies for the first time (can I take some of what he's having)?
His barnyard friends, which include Patou, a droopy canine unable to tie his shoes, Peepers, a bespectacled and lisping mouse, and Snipes, a zany magpie, do little to emerge as anything memorable, although the first two are well voiced by Phil Harris and Sandy Duncan, respectively.
His speech impediment is merely distracting as first, but by the "We'll all dwown."
Patou told us that a) Goldie was a lot smarter and nicer than she seemed at first and b) that she was really falling for Chanticleer although she was only supposed to fake it.
The first half hour is close enough to the book to entertain the fans.
But by the last half hour the book is thrown to the winds as we see the war first hand.
The first battle was alright but the psychotic killing kids having fun was just awful.
The Battle of Lexington is moderately well done rather obviously leaving open the question of who fired first.
And the first half hour entertains.
At Lexington Green, as Rab stands among the Minutemen confronting the might of the British Empire, he is mortally wounded in the first volley.
The first half of the film is pretty good, dealing with J.W.
thanks to its great writing in the first season, its progeny is stinking up the airwaves.
She'll have to agree to marry him first!
(She's a babe) Adding to it all is a whacked out sense of odd lights and bad Halloween decorations that make a first graders haunted house seem scary.
Like George Washington's "wooden teeth", the "fact" that everyone in Columbus' day thought the Earth was flat and Betsy Ross making the very first American flag (all fiction, by the way), this film is a great example of bad history.
While my list would be HUGE, here are a few of the problems with the story: the girl's name was "Matoaka" not "Pocahontas" (this was a nickname, not her real name), she was about 11 or so and Smith an older man and so the romance in the Disney film is either disgusting or false (fortunately, there was no romance according to all but the Disney account), the whole head getting smashed like a pumpkin incident probably never occurred (Smith spoke of this for the first time 17 years after the fact and it was never recorded elsewhere before this--plus Matoaka publicly showed contempt for Smith--something that makes no sense if the story was true), Matoaka was kidnapped by the British and she did not willingly join them (as seen in POCAHONTAS II), and the natives were not "tree-hugging hippies"--but real 3-dimensional people (for good and bad).
At first, I thought this was a sequel to Entre Nous.
Man, this is the first time in my life I have been so incensed at such a misrepresentation of an unoriginal film.
I am a film student and tonight Producer Rob Cowan came to our campus to show the first advanced screening of this film.
Its poor quality sneaks up on you, since there's minimal dialogue before the first extended action sequence (though said dialogue does include the news that this Iraq company will be heading home inside of a week, which anyone who has ever seen a cop movie knows is a sure sign of impending death and destruction).
The bulk of Presley's resume, according to IMDb, is on soap operas; this is his first major film, and with any luck, it will be his last.
The premise was interesting; that the U.S. planted atomic bombs in all its embassies in the Soviet Union and Eastern block countries during the cold war to give them first strike capability.
When it first came out in '88, I read in the newspaper that it was not well received.
I was certain that I was wasting my time through the first 80 minutes of gratuitous TV-preacher bashing (which might actually be appropriate if it were not handled with such apparent fiction and superficiality) when suddenly, at the very last moment, it seemed that a story was about to emerge.
There are better motion simulator rides out there, but this one probably came first.
The movie makes a crucial blunder from the first sequence.
The first 'gadget' is a tape recorder which Diamond uses to record his statement to the Commissioner about the funds used in the Brown investigation.
(A quick check of the IMDB showed me that Pat and Jack were in the first movie but not in the second.
Fred Astaire's first forays into the Western genre, the TV medium and moustache-sporting came via this modest "old men's movie" about a trio of retired Texas Rangers who come together to help their old superior who has been wrongly jailed for robbery and murder.
However, Astaire deludes himself further into thinking that the roughnecks who come into town eventually leave it because of his notoriety (rather than through the helpful 'armed and invisible' presence of his friends) and even befriends a much younger saloon gal who turns out to be the girl of the robber behind the crime Astaire was supposed to have committed in the first place!
The first half is stupid, and the second half doesn't make any sense.
To save people just scanning the first few lines of a review, THIS IS A TERRIBLE MOVIE!!
`Legion of the Dead' was my first movie directed by Olaf Ittenbach and I can't say I'll immediately purchase his other achievements now.
Two main storylines are presented during the first hour of the film.
Yesterday I bought this used VHS in a rental without any previous reference first because I am a great fan of horror movies.
The storyline is horribly plagiarized from 'From Dusk Till Dawn' and is also divided in two parts: the first one tells the 'saga' of two morons hitchhiking and being kidnapped by a psychotic killer.
when i saw the trailer the first time i thought "wow", that will be a crazy movie.
The first problem is that is runs for a minuscule 6 minutes.... take away the credits and you're left with a 4 minute film.
One watching this for the first time, would think it was done by a couple of 10 year olds just fooling around and experimenting with a home video camera.
When I first watched this movie, I thought of it as a "remake" of Dial M for Murder.
The songs will get stuck in your head and make you want to run head first, at full speed, into a brick wall.
Pitt I was surprised and impressed with, though I was doubtful at first of his being cast.
When I first saw this movie, I only caught the first half hour of it, but it was enough.
The character's for instance, the selfish businessman who wants to keep everything quiet because of his investment, the Mayor who fears for the towns economy, the unflappable hero with personal problems who nobody takes seriously at first, the blonde female who falls for the hero & just tags along for no apparent reason other than to be put in mortal danger so the hero can save & 'get the girl' at the end, the disposable character's who are there to keep the body count going but add nothing else whatsoever to the story, the scientist expert who happens to be a personal mate of the hero & knows everything about the creature/monster (depending upon film) & the central threat itself, in this case snakes, that pop up occasionally to kill someone.
The first serious mistake was the use of flashback at the beginning of the film.
Given that there is very little action in "Virus," the use of flashback undercuts any element of suspense, at least during the first hour.
If the first two hours of "Virus" were simply boring, the last 30 minutes is downright tedious, despite a whole 7 minutes of mild action, the first since the first half hour.
The prince can't get his hands off her from 20 seconds into their first meeting, the dress which is supposed to be at her ankles shows as high as her panties, all the other male character are constantly smooching her and touching her against her will, while they discuss which of them will get to keep her to satisfy his needs.
The first sequence showcases BenoÃ®t Magimel and his family in front of the TV news that reveals a murder.
I try to get it out of the way in the first reel."
Oh and Britain was the first country to abolish slavery in the early 19th century , just thought I`d point this out since A WARRIOR`S TALE really does seem to think all the evil in the world began and ended with The British empire even if in 1620 Britain as a country didn`t exist as such   A word about the acting - It`s totally variable .
Movies were our first outlet for fun.
Hardly worth sitting through the first time, much less viewing again.
This movie was a rather interesting first take for Director Sobel.The story is interesting, the comedy works,somewhat,and the characters are well developed.The biggest downside is in the technical aspects of the film.
The first would be the fact that there is already a much better movie with a similar plot, namely 'Shelter'.
The first would be the dialogues, which might sound original only for people who begin their adventure with cinema.
The Conrad Boys was a nice try for first timer Justin Lo with good intentions, but I can't really imagine what kind of group this movie was even targeted to appeal to.
If she had attempted to squeeze one more droplet of collagen into her fat, drooping under their own weight, lips I have no doubt they would have exploded all over her botox hardened face the moment she uttered her first line.
The film piles bad jokes one on top of the other and beats to death what wasn't particularly funny the first time -- the Italian chef who pines for Marty, the FBI agents' jokes about how hot Marty supposedly is, etc.
There's just nothing going on here, no romance, almost no comedy, certainly no suspense, and we lost logic in the first five minutes.
The first two movies had some(albeit not an awful lot) value and were just above being garbage committed to celluloid... this one is different, worse.
The writing, since the first two films, has taken a turn for the worse, something I didn't think possible before watching this tripe.
Characters are messed up completely, going in a completely different direction from what was seen in the first two films.
The humor is taken down a further notch from the first two films; again, a surprise for those of us who weren't aware that it was possible to go any lower.
Unlike the first two films, this one doesn't have one single redeeming quality... it's just bad.
I recommend this only to people who loved the first two so much that they simply can't stand the notion of there being a film in the series that they haven't seen... no matter how bad it is.
Like the first two this takes palace in Florida in the mid-1950s.
The first two were no masterpieces.
"Porky's Revenge", directed as it is by James Komack (yes, THAT James Komack, from "The Courtship of Eddie's Father"), tries to ape the original as much as possible in looks but just doesn't get it right; the material never finds the right tone of raunchiness nor one single scene that has as many belly laughs as the original (if you've seen the first one, you know what I mean).
In Funny Farm, all the magic that made the first Vacation-movie so great is missing.
At first, they look to us as swaggering city sophisticates, as they dress-up in international costumes for a park revue, surrounded by emblems of international commercial culture, like fake Louis Vuitton bags and movie posters, such as of "Titanic," They jealously and zealously call each other constantly by the most modern cell phone and text messengers, particularly from the encircling monorail that at first seems like a symbol of modern technology, but is really cobbled together from airplane parts--though one woman wistfully notes that she doesn't know anyone who has been on a plane- a frequent response to a call is "I'm on the train."
On the other side, you've got a tunnel digger and a geologist who just happens to be the tunnel digger's ex-wife and when they meet in the movie for the first time, you've got the sappy music for them.
Jia Zhangke's The World, his first state supported film, continues his look at the disillusionment of Chinese youth with Western-style globalization but shifts the setting from a rural to an urban environment.
The Chinese government would like for the world to see them as metropolitan, glitzy, shiny, and new, so Jia, in this first film of his with government backing, uses cinema-scope, modern techno beats, computer animation and up-to-date electronics.
(mostly for the first 25 mins)
This movie however was so extremely slow and hollow, that for one of the first times in my life, i really felt sorry for wasting time on a movie.
Anyone who expects anything from the much later added first three episodes obviously can't be very bright.
REX basically takes the passengers of his ship on a trip around the Death Star almost exactly identical to that of Luke Skywalker in the first Star Wars movie.
("This was your first time, wasn't it?"
But we stop wondering who these people are and just enjoy the first enjoyable thing in this movie.
But she decided to give it a second try, thinking maybe there was something admirable about it that she missed the first time.
Dave H., for being a movie reviewer, you sure don't know the first thing about rating one.
Seeing as the first one is impossible to integrate here and the second is just not directed with any understanding of detail what we are left is an approximately 40 minutes of slow-motion that does it's job in extending "Bad Boys" into a near two hours length.
Sure, watch the movie for the first time if it's on TV and there's nothing better.
TÃ©a Leoni has no role in the movie, she acts in the craziest, most insensible ways, invites trouble each time(if it was real life, she would have been killed the first time she tried to pull off those stupid stunts of hers), not to mention the male leads who too are guilty of this!!!
Well, the first one was full of clichÃ©s and the killer Santa wasn't that scary, but I give it the benefit of the doubt since they were trying to explore deep childhood fears that some of us may have had!
To begin with, if you see the 2 movies one after the other like i did, you'll save a lot of your valuable time playing it in fast forward, since this Part 2 has about 40 minutes with footage from the first one.
After his parents death, and later his brother's (in the first movie), he became so disturbed that starts killing everyone who crosses his path, or blows his nose to a red handkerchief!
Silent Night, Deadly Night 2 continues the story of Ricky, brother of killer in a Santa suit Billy from the first SNDN film.
The movie is based around Ricky basically telling his life story Dr. Bloom, which consists mainly of flashbacks to the first film.
In fact, the first 35 minutes of this "sequel" is footage from the first, minus the gore.
So, as you could imagine, it is pretty boring and even after that, when Ricky explains what happened to him after the ordeal at the end of the first one (in which his brother is shot dead in front of him), it does not get much better.
Don't worry, just shove some footage from the first movie in a new box and someone will actually see it.
The plot, and I use that term loosely, is about the little brother from the first movie (played by a distractingly horrible Eric Freeman) sitting in a room telling his life story through flashbacks.
The first half of this "sequal" is a re-tred, showing lengthy scenes from the the first movie, strung together with narration by Ricky (Billy's little brother) who is being interviewed by a prison psychiatrist.
The plot doesn't matter, it in fact just shows clips from the first movie through the middle of the movie, but when you meet the title character Ricky face to face you realize that the movie is taking a turn for the best/worst.
Oh the first film was trashy, seedy and truly in bad-taste and that's what made the dementedly serious piece entertaining.
By throwing flashback after flashback of the first film within the first 45 minutes (were half-way there) and having Ricky, the brother of the original Santa killer provide the voice-over.
It had me thinking "Should I just turn it off, and put the first one instead?".
The first 40 minutes (almost half the movie) is just clips from part one, which makes this a terrible viewing if you try and watch the films back to back.
We learn about Ricky's brother, who the first film is about, then after half the movie flashing back to the first film, we get to know Ricky and how he became so psychotic.
Ricky flashes back to the first film in vivid details, and literally over 20 minutes of the film are just long scenes from the first movie.
His words come out in strange patterns, like he's trying to read the words for the first time off a teleprompter as he performs.
The first scene she's introduced, seconds later they're making love.
When Ricky escapes he goes for the Mother Superior, who is supposed to be the same as in the first film, but now she looks completely different and resembles Two-Face from Batman.
Ricky (Eric Freeman) is the brother of the killer Santa from the first film.
For starters literally the whole first half are scenes from the earlier movie.
Yes he DID try to rape her beforehand but still... And when Ricky and his fiancÃ©e go to the movies they end up seeing the first movie which means we get to see it TWICE!
Might be good for a few laughs from fans of the first movie but nobody else.
Ricky(Eric Freeman), the brother of Billy(the killer from the first film)is the psycho donning the Santa outfit..well, for a moment or two..this time, explaining to a psychiatrist what occurred to his brother years back.
They practically show most of the first film and then we get thirty or so minutes of Ricky killing people.
Most people watching the sequel have already seen the first entry.
Cue footage from the first film, used in the form of flashbacks.
Even Ricky has a "huh" moment as the film starts and is revealed to be the first entry in the series.
How can Ricky, who was in the first film and has crystal clear memories of events that occurred within it, go and watch the first film in a movie theatre?
Because of the extensive flashbacks in the beginning of the movie, in which footage from the first film is used, those who have seen the original recently will probably hate this; for the rest of us the flashbacks are almost a bonus: essentially you get to see two movies for the price of one.
so my first thought was: shenanigans!
The entire first half of this "sequel" contains sequences Â not even essentials ones Â of the 1984 shocker, talked together as some sort of wraparound story by Ricky Caldwell whose brother was responsible for the infamous Christmas killing spree.
The first thing anyone will admit when mentioning this movie is that it is terrible.
It is even admitted in the Anchor Bay DVD release that it was mostly edited from the original to extend the video shelf-life of the first film, which was also less than Citizen Kane.
It's beating around the bush for the first hour, and doesn't deliver much during the second.
I am no expert reviewer at all, but I could tell from the very first scene that this was a spectacularly low budget film.
It is a shame that after a brilliant first two films, full of cameraderie and a great comedy element as well as a plausible plot, this one just ruins it all.
I rented this movie from my public library along with Beverly Hills cop 1 and 2.The first two were really great and when I was about to put it in I had a thought of 'how bad could it be'.Well the first 10 minutes were good but then all the comedy and good acting got taken away.I only became excited once when they had George Lucas has a cameo so thats not really saying much.
My suggestion is see the first two movies and dont ruin them by renting this god awful one.
This movie is totally out of tune with the first and second ones, which respectively were fantastic and good.
From the brutal approach to movie action of the former ones (thanks to Bruckheimer), this one has scratched most of this off (no more social realism of the first and no more really bad guys of the second) and replaced it with superficial layer of humor and Murphy's funny faces, which really aren't funny when you've seen them before in his stand up comedy shows or The Nutty Professor.
Sure, there was an obvious sense of inevitability about a first sequel, and it pretty much followed straight afterwards, just restoring Murphy's stock after one less than stellar box office feature (The Golden Child).
The fact that the film was location first, plot second points at everything that's wrong with Beverley Hills Cop III.
Yet to compensate for the lack of a Ronny Cox or a Paul Reiser, they bring back Serge from the first film.
I loved the first movie - Eddie Murphy was outstanding.
He was just such a lovable goof, which was semi-sad since he was a cop in the film, but I got past that part pretty much since he has been a goof from the first Beverly Hills Cop movie.
Now the complaints, there are a huge list of them: first off, for security guards, most of them had pretty crappy shooting techniques and couldn't hit a barn.
The first problem is that there isn't even s starting theme tune.
The whole feel of the movie is much more slapstick than the first two and ads a result it feels very superficial.
With the first there was a feeling that this could possibly happen in real life, but this film is just too silly.
Practically none of the regulars are there: Todd's there but he is killed in the first five minutes, there is no sign of Bogomil, Taggart is briefly mentioned as having retired and Jeffrey's not there either.
It's not the worst film ever made, but it's nowhere near as good as the first two in the series and indeed doesn't even feel like a Beverley Hill Cop movie.
The first two in the series were fairly simple, fun films, relying mainly on Eddie Murphy's performances but nevertheless with strong backup from the rest of the cast (particularly in the first one), and a certain eighties 'cool' factor that, while obviously dated, still charms.
The villain, played by Timothy Carhart, is totally expendable and it's a wonder why they couldn't at least have brought in a stereotype police captain like in the first two parts.
It's a shame because like I said, I love these kind of stories and it annoys the heck out of me that Wilder was more concern in trying to voice a (tired) opinion than actually trying to create a great film first.
Although Fear of Flying introduces a better plot than the first, the acting is very bad and some parts are outrageously unrealistic.
Fear of Flying was somewhat more entertaining than the first Turbulence, in good and bad ways.
Her first major role, doing all of her own stunts and overall just doing a phenomenal job.
The first Turbulence movie really reeked (ie.
2-dimensional characters, inane dialogue (except in the first half, where Mitterrand's acid tongue is occasionally allowed out for a run).
When I started playing this game I (at first) liked it but as I continued onward I realized I was wrong.
The music was catchy the first two or three times you listen to it but can also be repetitive and annoying after a while.
Despite being predisposed towards liking this movie (I stubbornly held out hope until the end credits, despite all rationale,) I consider the time I spent watching it as waste, and here's why: The story wanders around aimlessly, with zero surprises (you can't twist what's not there, I guess) and reaches a conclusion that the viewer basically makes during the first 5-10 minutes of the film.
So after the initial disappointment of the first Final Fantasy movie, which seemed to bare next to no resemblance to the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy: Advent Children has released itself to a warm reception and, now, a dedicated fanbase.
If you have not played FF7 then it is best that you play it first before watching this film.
For about the first two.
If they're gonna remake anything FFVII, they need to do this one first.
Well, the movie started out OK in the first 20 minutes, but then things get out of hand as the movie progressed.
If this is too long here is the simpler review-  the pros- the first 20 minutes top-notch cgi animation decent action scenes visually stunning  the cons- illogical over indulgent action/ unbalanced action (leaves the viewer jaded at the climax) weak plot super human characters=no suspense the j-rock soundtrack/score (what happened to the orchestra?)
Before the expedition reaches the monster's turf, they first have to undertake a 27 day long safari during which they encounter primitive tribes (primitive tribes big enough in number to fill the entire Chicago Cubs baseball stadium, by the way) and suffer human losses through lion attacks.
The expedition first struggles through weeks of drought and dehydration and then subsequently weeks of unceasing rainfall.
the story was real good and the acting made it very interesting  for Adam Brody's first big role he was awesome as was the young Vietnamese girl.I don"t know if it was a true story or not but i found it very entertaining as I always wondered how they did these sort of searches.i watched it with my teenage son who also liked it.especially the snake scene with Adam Brody.i think it also gave him an idea of what was going on with all the Vietnam issues of the 1960s/70s.i have an older brother who is a Vietnam vet and i have recommended to him and his family.i like that it was both serious and funny as it was a very emotional movie especially with the music.
If you're going to watch it make sure you get a decent copy first.
So give this rubbish a miss unless you`re interested in seeing Lon Chaney Jr in a cameo in the first episode or you`re wanting to laugh at some bizarre robots who are obviously men with a water boiler over their heads
I have to admit, when I first heard about this film, I hoped to watch it and rate it was perfect 10.
There is only one show that lasted as long as Hey Hey and stayed good from first episode to last, and it did so because it regularly changed staff, allowing new ideas to make their way in.
Someone should have taken the first twenty pages of this script, developed the plot from there are thrown the rest of it on the fire.
However watching The Swordsman and then Gladiator Cop is an interesting exercise in picking up what you have seen already, what really belongs in the first film and why you aren't doing something more productive.
I watched Alaipayuthey more than 10 times and remembered every scene and dialog in it after the first viewing.
The funeral, and Kim's first painful written speech.
Kim Basinger plays Kuki Gallman, the real-life conservationist, as we learn the story of how she got to Africa in the first place.
Experimental in almost all departments, but handled by the whole crew and the cast, including the first time director Shaad Ali, with great virtuosity and panache, this is a film that everyone should see, if not for anything but just for the sheer, unforgettable experience of the breathtaking cinematography, the brilliant location selection, masterly costume, art and set design, and above all, the painstakingly executed, digital editing and subtle video effects that puts Hollywood studios to shame.
Vivek Oberoi is a student who sees Rani Mukherjee everyday on the train and one day he asks her out...They date and then decide to elope...When Rani's father finds out he disowns her and she moves in with Vivek...At first they are two lovers who love everything about each other and then the fights begins...the fall outs...the making up and then Rani is caught up in a accident that changes everything..
Soon Valentino becomes a screen sensation and he becomes involved romantically with Rambova but technically he is still married to his first wife.
This is my first review ever, what a way to start where no one has posted anything yet so here it goes.
My first thought is that I cannot believe that he actually wore that wig.
[MAY BE SPOILERS]   Whenever I visit Disneyland, the very first ride I go on is this one!
The first half of the movie I was trying to get to know the "real" storyline.
Granted, it can also be fun and extremely exiting if only one person is at risk, as it was on the first season.
The first half really drags by despite these "horrific" images we see through Beacham's eyes.
He extracts good performances from his actors, he has a sense and understanding of emotion, he portrays the entire story realistically, and that's what makes his first work so great (although he would ruin that image in his future projects BAB and JBJ).
The highlight of the first ten minutes, John Wayne is serenading his prisoners, George Kennedy is a well groomed, neatly presented bad guy who snarls with the best of them.
But, now to sit there for 103 minutes, guts churning and bubbling was bad enough, But to have the Duke insult my intelligence in the last three seconds, of what I figured out in the first ten minutes: "Don't Rob Banks!
It doesn't have the feeling and respect that the first show has.
The ET gag with Pamela Stephenson's body being sexually ravaged by the ghost who molested her the first time, her silhouette flying across the image of the moon is certainly a strange moment towards the end.
Okay, first off, it wasn't an absolutely horrible film.
I FULLY agree with many of the other posters here (which I SHOULD have bloody well taken MORE time to read first!!!!!)
First things first: Blood Angels or Thralls was crap, but I've basically already pointed that out.
This is the first Ron Oliver film I've seen, but he can't direct for s**t!
Cate opens her legs for an RAF flier the first night she meets him (slut alert) and, when he disappears in France a few days later, she decides to find him (getting a number of French underground fighters killed along the way).
Reminds me of that story of a very poor Anne Frank's Diary production where the audience were motivated to shout out 'she's in the Attic' when the German first came on stage.
The idea of the magic of the spices was a bit of a stretch for me at first, but Aishwarya played it well and carried it off nicely.
The good-natured cab-driver's first scene seemed completely unbelievable because of the bad acting.
The direction was very veteran like considering it was Shaad Ali's first film.
I mean I think that some subplot was needed to show the way the spices work (or however you want to word it), but they really detracted form the main story, which itself wasn't up to much in the first place.
Above all Shaad Ali in his first directorial effort has surpassed many veterans.
He first appeared in Clive Barker's novel "The Hellbound Heart", which was later turned into the 1987 hit movie HELLRAISER, which was written and directed by Barker.
The first was HELLRAISER: DEADER, which was better than the average direct-to-video release, but still not nearly as good as HELLRAISER was.
a first class shame
The problem, you see, is the following: the first half of the series (yes, even the 4th installment which most people dislike) were monster-movies - a mysterious box, a couple of evil looking beings that came with it, and a lot of unlucky people who came in contact with them - while "Inferno" and the rest have been turned into mind game movies, where people see things which may, or may not, be related to the box...  What we have in "Hellworld" is a genuine mediocre teen slasher: 5 young people, who were once dedicated players of the Internet based game "Hellworld" but are taking it cooler since the suicide of their fellow player, get invited to a big party.
During the first act, assuming there was one, I was getting a sense that the film was predictable, but I was wrong.
Pinhead shows up only a few times briefly during the that first 80 minutes, only to do things that his character never does or would do.
Needless to say, it's kind of like an overblown Halloween party where everyone seems to be fascinated with the macabre (serious macabre, too, like dead babies in jars, sounds like a blast), and girls randomly pull their breasts out (curiously, the first bit of wildly gratuitous nudity is followed by the following exchange Â "Gratuitous breasts?"
The first from Bota was good.
The actors plays like bored first time actors.
1) CHARACTERS - The first half of the film is driftingly slow.
At first I felt sorry for Lance but then I remembered he was in Mangler 2 so he deserves what he gets.
Shaad Ali puts in a fantastic effort for his first film, picking the perfect actors with the perfect locales to create a near perfect film.
Unfortunately Nicole & her crew are hampered by a few unforeseen problems, first off is Maxwell Odemus (Jack Scalia) the son of a Greek mafia gangster who wants the two relics returned to Greece by any means necessary & there's also the small fact that a gigantic squid is guarding the precious bounty & basically kills anyone who goes near it.
After the first hundred questions I didn't care what the answer was, I just wanted these people to shut up already.
was that the nobility (men and women alike) for the first time ever could sit and watch someone undress.
Her first artist name was "Lady MacLeod" after a supposed lord father, and it didn't disappear from the posters until 1912, when the real MacLeod (her former husband) sued her.
The first half hour of this film wasn't bad at all & I thought it was another ridiculous IMDB rating.
I first saw her in her later movies--and on her TV show, swirling through the door every week--so it's quite a revelation to see her at the absolute peak of her talent and looks.
This is the first Otto Preminger movie I saw and I would have liked to enjoy it, or to find it at least interesting.
I say these things because she sings three or four songs in here in the first 30-40 minutes and it is painful to hear.
What could have been a wonderful film about the twilight of French Indochina is irretrievably lost in the turgid pot boiler of a melodramatic boy-girl-mom 'love' triangle that seems to have been plotted and scripted (even in the original French) by a first year drama student.
The first segment is an ancient horror comic book chestnut which has been roasted one too many times.
As this is taking place after the battle of Endor, how can there be another Death star that is completely built up like the first one, when the second one was no where near completion?
An incredibly uninspired television anthology sequel that has little to do with the first fantastic film, except that the lead character in all three stories is played by one woman.
Lysette Anthony gets chased by the infamous zuni fetish doll from the first TV movie except the special effects are somehow worse two decades later.
Now the first two stories weren't too bad, a little cheesy, but so was the first.
Well, the first story is about a woman where her husband dies and she discovers his grave is missing and encounters horrible things when she finds out there is more than what meets the eye.
This film just didn't have the elements the first one did, Dan should have just left the stories alone, they are perfect the way they are.
In the first one she plays a rich trophy wife who bumps off her husband with the aid of her boyfriend.
The worst story is the last, which is ironic b/c it's a sequel to the best story from the first film.
The story then serves as a strict remake of the first one, with Anthony trapping the doll in a case, cutting herself while trying to grab the knife when the doll saws away at the case, and then becoming possessed by the spirit in the doll at the end.
If a first run through his completely awful text (which might pass as "edgy prose" in my junior high diary), set to Andriessen's music, wasn't enough for you, don't worry... he'll display the whole thing from start to finish in a slow side-scroll that features such high-tech effects as digitally-generated drop shadow.
But before I get to that rationale, first the obvious complaints.
The character's got on my nerves to start with but they sort of grew on me & I ended up quite liking them, also I couldn't but help think that if Doc knew what was going to happen why didn't he just stop Johnny & his friends going to the party in the first place & prevent the whole sorry situation?
Miss Kristal's best scene is where she stands at the edge of a trench and her coat drops to reveal for the first time her nurse's uniform (her costume for her spy duties).
Taylor plays an interesting part, his attire is first class and so is the mask he wears, mustache and all, planted on his beautiful self by the makeup department.
Riker and Troi behaving like the first couple in school who find out how to kiss  2.
This was my first Spike Lee experience, and I have to say, I now understand why I'm laughing when comics make jokes such as "That makes about as much sense as a white person's script in a Spike Lee movie" ***SPOILER ALERT **** I thought it was hilarious that the first white man on screen kills himself, and the next white person shown is a complete and utter witch.
My first and last "joint".
When Jack first started his new 'business' he supposedly needed money for the moment to counterbalance his frozen assets and continuing financial responsibilities.
So the anti-Bush campaign that makes up the first 45 minutes or so of the movie are pretty clear.
There's a second act, so-to-speak, that tells the father's story that is interesting and better than the first and third acts.
At first, Jack is angry about him receiving the experimental treatment.
Although this is my first review, I have watched a lot of movies.
From an ill-placed and beyond confusing opening in the Middle East, the film runs through scene after scene practically thrusting the viewer right in the middle of the action, and hoping they will completely understand the motivations of all of the characters, or even why we should even care about them in the first place.
And what should have been a great stretching point from the acclaimed Training Day quickly morphs into amateur first time film-making.
Absolutely no character development - you never understand how these two got to be friends in the first place, let alone stayed friends.
Certainly this isn't the first film to do this, but that makes it even more problematic because by now filmmakers should know what to do and what not to do, particularly when you are working with the slasher genre.
Well, lets just say that for the first 45 minutes of this film I was BORED OUT OF MY MIND.
The plot is typical slasher horror fair, with young college students trapped in a building, and the first half hour is quite interesting, setting up the situation.
This one didn't have a predictable story entirely but it did drag out for the first hour and it failed to have enough excitement to wake me back up towards the final 42 minutes.
Well, in my opinion, if the first halves of these couples suck marginally worse, the second halves are also all bad.
My text versions always included it) was arguably the first truly modern psychological ontological existential novel, the forerunner to, among other things, Catcher in the Rye & many of Woody Allen's better works.
It seems to be great resistance at first, but rather than make the men come to him - he went to them at their favorite hangout, a Caribbean takeaway restaurant.
Historically this is important as (I believe) the first full length Holmes picture and I'm glad it's available.
Okay, aside from completely changing the story into a tale involving Moriarty (who, by the way, was captured pretty easily at the end), the story did some of the most ridiculous things you could do with Holmes--it made him a sentimentalist AND had him fall in love, inexplicably, at first sight.
Although I was enjoying it at first, I began to suspect that something was awfully awry during the drawing room scene where 'the accident' was revealed in the news.
That's the first good thing about "A Winter Tale."
At one of the first screenings that I attended about a year ago, Solomon thanked Diane Boehm for CHUM TV's providing the original funding to get this project going nearly eight years ago.
When I first went on it I was 8, hated Star Wars, and loved the ride.
I liked it at first, but then I started thinking.
The first meeting, however, fails expectations.
The first thing that hit me was massive lack of realism.
Still, it may have been jarring, things such as the >1 year journey that is inside earths orbit also jarred me, but other than that first one I don't think the average viewer should have noticed, and unreal-ism, even in the case of this movie, shouldn't lose more than 1 point from movie's score, rather it was the plethora of other problems that doomed Sunshine.
computer that will override their vital mission to fix the shield in a vital, life threatening way but it wouldn't bl**dy well make the one point something angle correction to the shield when they changed course in the first place!
- Why exactly did the first probe fail?
I'm wondering, first of all and a little queasily, what, in ten or twenty years, will be the movie that makes "Sunshine" seem smart and entertaining.
The first two thirds of Sunshine were fair.
The first are those with shooting and/or aliens (Star Wars, Serenity, Alien etc).
Nothing much happens until the crew discovers that the ship from the first mission is still orbiting the sun.
Director Brian Yuzna's camera angles are inventive at first, but the music-video edits occur so regularly that they become annoying after a while; yet perhaps the one thing "Faust" can hold to its name are the impressive special effects (impressive for such an obviously low-budget production), even though I'm of the opinion that people shouldn't even bother adapting comic books to film.
This movie was the first made by the Spanish company Fantastic Factory, they have released later two films more "Arachnid" and "Dagon" but While these two have been a total flop "Faust" was at least a bit more successful.
In my opinion this movie never should have been released in the first place.  
In my opinion this movie never should have been released in the first place.  
Leonie Forbes, Jamaica's "first lady of film" won the festival's award of excellence for her telling performance as Miss G, the proprietor of a small restaurant in Toronto's Parkdale district, where the entire tale is set during bleak winter time.
in each episode you can guess the conclusion of the episode within the first five minutes.
And it could be fixed where the first story could move into the second smoothly.
Worth seeing only for the first half, which, as mentioned, delivers the laughs and offers a nice change of pace for FULL HOUSE's Lori Loughlin, who breaks her "nice lady" image with a foul mouth and a brief nude scene.
Naschy even recycles the "Blind Dead"-esque guardian that was first glimpsed guarding Countess Wandessa's tomb in "La Noche de Walpurgis".
I first watched this as a cricket-obsessed kid, and loved it.
I first saw it at an old downtown theater that ran mostly B horror movies and soft core porn.
in the first five minutes.
This cartoon is notable for being the first appearance of the Rooster but for no other reason.
Regardless of familiarity with the original version, the plot is 100% predictable from the first few minutes right up until the last five.
At first glance, you start watching this movie and wonder if you accidentally turned to the Idiot Channel, because you can't possibly imagine someone actually getting PAID so much to act so poorly.
If this is the kind of movie to which our children turn for entertainment, then I'm scheduling an appoint with my urologist first thing tomorrow morning for a VASECTOMY!
I distinctly recall sitting down to watch "Carpool" at home ten years ago and being appalled within the first ten minutes by the film's insulting intelligence level.
Having said that, the first 20 min.
Not only isn't it believable (especially if you know the Gator character from the first movie), but the outcome of the relationship is terribly predictable.
The first time I watched this movie it made the life of what is emoral become heartfelt, but after a few other times the movie became mundane.
While the plot had possibilities, there is very little going on here and none of it is terribly funny - despite the support of Edward Chapman (the first of 5 collaborations with Wisdom) and cameos by Margaret Rutherford (playing a dotty millionairess with a passion for animals) and Jerry Desmonde (his unbilled split-second appearance, though, is more of an in-joke than anything else)!
The first time I saw it I was 9 and was totally blown away.
When I first saw the show, I didn't really know what to expect.
The first thirty minutes of the film is nothing but pointless "comedy" sketches which makes Eddie Murphy's Raw opening sketch look like Casablanca and thats a good thing.
For example, Marconi, often credited with the first radio transmissions, didn't accomplish it until several years after Tesla demonstrated a radio controlled model boat.
Angus Oblong only has one producer credit and only has writing credits for one episode (the first one, probably) so all indications are that he sold out creative control.
If you are not familiar with the series this is not a good way of getting into it as it leaves you extremely confused and frustrated with the random parts of story lines crammed into the duration of this film, the sequel,"the end of evangelion" is fantastic only wish I could have seen the series first rather than this released, for the sake of making money, film.
All that this film is, is a 45 minute rehash of the series and an (edited) first 15-20 minutes of End of Evangelion.
The first scene is more messed up than a raving maniac and from there follows extreme sadistic violence.
This is basically The series recapped in 45 minutes, followed by the first 20 minutes of TEoE.
So this is basically my first Spoiler-free review, because really there's nothing at all to spoil.
Sion Sono returns to themes of loss of personal and group identity first covered in Suicide Club However, I believe that Norikos Dinner Table is his most coherent treatment of alienation and atomisation driven by westernisation Having watched this movie and having sat through the seemingly never-ending making of documentary (where the director provides no insight into his intention except, (he States in the opaque documentary of the making of this movie) 'to make a beautifully grotesque spectacle', my take is that Sion Sono vision is flawed.
The quality of image and sound (on the Shameless DVD release) leaves a lot to be desired - but judging from some of the night scenes the quality of film used in the first place was not the best.
The film has a very promising beginning with the first murder scene taking place during the credits inter-cutting to calm scenes depicting the protagonist play piano in his concert.
But ultimately, after the first half or so the film loses its fire and becomes slower with plenty of talk and things that don't make too much sense, mostly involving the killer and his (absent) motives for his vicious acts.
The things that are discussed in the second part are also interesting and important but they are presented with too much contrast with the more lively first half.
Pusher was a great movie no doubt so clearly i expected A lot from this one but i'm sorry to say that it does NOT and i repeat NOT at all reach the heights of the first one.
it's generally boring and not so tuff and scary as the first one cause i can remember in some scenes from Pusher i was really frightened but not at all in this one.
i hope pusher 3 goes back to the original environment from the first one and i'm glad to see that Zlatko Buric is back in this one cause he has only a very small role in pusher 2 and that sucks!
only mel gibson really had that quality in the first Lethal Weapon.
he was no longer a father and husband like in the first one.
This grubby movie, the first of four, has slapper Robin Askwith having unprotected sex with numerous horny housewives on his window cleaning round, while his brother-in-law Anthony Booth cheats on his pregnant wife!
The first half contains meaningless squabbles between the gang, and then we get into other situations with little point to them.
It's fortunate that this was not Marlon Brando's first role because it might have short-circuited an otherwise brilliant career.This movie was not a dream, but a nightmare.
This movie was my first introduction to Waters and Divine and what a wake up call.
Peter Ho is a singer by trade and this is his first time acting.
At first they don't like one another, then he finds she is actually a sweet, nice girl inside.
The first half of the film is pretty boring, and I didn't check why Fergus and Jody had to become friends.
Also you think about how Jody and Dil might have had sex and you can't understand that Jody first wanted to sleep with Jude.
There are just too many uncomfortable, sordid and dark scenes in this movie, including a horrible first 15 minutes in which Forest Whitaker is a hysterical IRA hostage out in the middle of the woods.
There us no reason why this movie should ever have been made the first time yet alone twice.
It's played a little differently as he isn't the driver of the first car she sees but it's the same tired old trite clichÃ© you've seen before so many times.
Within the first ten minutes I was very aware of what was to follow.
having characters talk directly to the audience), Funny Games may very well be a film that could never have been truly accepted by American audiences in the first place.
The actors, who supposedly are Mexican and speak Spanish as their first language, have less convincing Spanish accents than I do and I'm a hamburger and pizza lovin' gringo.
I know that this wasn't his first job, you would think the director could at least done a little directing and done some retakes or something.
Of course, you always can stop the DVD player when the display shows you 42 minutes; you'll be sparing yourselves the disappointment of seeing how the very decent first part of this movie helplessly wrecks.
I rented this movie and shut it off after the first twenty minutes only to return to find out if they ever cleaned up.
I suppose if you can make it through the first reel you are hooked.
The Joey character was good for a young man experiencing his first love, but I found the Sissel character convoluted and hard to follow.
This is a summary of the first 30 minutes of the film, and I'm not going to give anything else away.
There are no real turns in the plot and you already know the end of the movie within the first half hour.
I would say that for the first 2/3rd of the series it really deserve a good 8/10, for its originality, the efforts made in creating different heroes and a real nasty and evil Villain.
Also there are more and more inconsistencies in the power of Peter Petrelli (replicating other's power) which is automatic when needed by the script (regeneration, be invisible, becoming radioactive etc..) and inoperative when really useful (replicating Sylar's powers at first, second or even third encounter, time travel from Hiro and so on) and not to mention that he never uses the ones he really need when he needs them (unlike Sylar), why did it take him the last episode to listen to anyone's mind (aside from the accidental encounter with Parkman), and why does he need his brother to fly him and play the firework while he can fly all by himself (his first ever duplicated power).
The cheap fight against Sylar, and the first few images of the teaser of the second season don't reassure me with the potential disappearance of Sylar's body in the sewage (how the Hell could anyone let him move even an inch) or Hiro in Medieval ClichÃ© type Japan....  Watch it when you really don't have anything better to do and watch Battlestar Galactica instead if you look for the best TV series ever (who said I'm subjective)
Maybe I had to get the bigger picture, see where the programme was going... Maybe I was light-hearted at first, but right now shows like these make me angry and disgusted.
It started out strong; the first season was far from perfect, but it had an energy and a message that simply felt good.
If I was to judge only the first two seasons, the rating would be considerably higher.
He was introduced in the first scene as a normal geek and BAM, he controls the time/space continuum(repeated 1,039 times).
Claire became a quick popular character, I even liked her... at first.
Nikki also became popular with the men, probably because of that lovely crotch shot in the first episode, so they continued on her dull struggle to keep from becoming her alter ego, take care of her son and to not go to jail, when they finally put her in there, she murders some couple guards or something, and then... they release her!
Peter who was at first an innocent, sweet guy, who cared about everyone, and had dreams about flying, only became someone who was insecure and grumpy.
The idea of how the heroes have their powers is ridiculous, putting it on a scientific theory that is an incomplete theory in the first place: "evolution" To say that a person needs the ability to fly is rather foolish as the brain is people's weapon, and if they want to go on Darwin's theory of evolution, they best realize that it's also "survival of the fittest" which goes into the idea of the food chain.
When I first heard about heroes I liked the idea very much.
The first one is Jack Palance in CHE!, playing the part of Fidel Castro.
The first 15 minutes of "When A Stranger Calls" is powerfully effective as we watch a helpless Carol Kane slowly being terrorized by a series of strange phone calls inquiring as to whether or not she has "checked the children".
One of the best action thrillers ever made, Die Hard still rocks like a thunderstorm nearly twenty years after it was first released; often copied and arguably never, ever equalled, this film introduced the set-up of the lone cop/soldier/tough guy against a team of terrorists who have taken over a secured area.
Not to talk about the camera work (probably a first time operator, at least I hope so), although the "day for night" they invented for this movie is shockingly interesting (I understood this only after the first half of the movie and when I mentioned it to the others watching the movie I could see that no one had understood the purpose of this strange color effects before).
For at least the first 45 minutes, I couldn't make heads or tails out of what was happening, who was fighting whom, who all those people were, etc.
McClane is first depicted as a mildly-reclusive, word-avid cop, but he quickly becomes wild after the terrorists' takeover.
The first one is Gruber's henchman Karl (Alexander Godunov).
At first I was intrigued when I saw the posters advertising the show.
For at least the first 10 minutes of Don't Trip, I was trying to figure out what the hell the deal was--I felt like I had stumbled into a timeshare sales pitch or multi-level marketing meeting by accident--when you know there's some ulterior motive occurring, and this isn't just a collection of more or less random people interacting in a general way.
The first installment of a third-rate detective series, featuring a former safe-cracker, Blackie (Chester Morris), his sidekick the Runt (Charles Wagenheim), and the impatient Inspector Farraday (Richard Lane).
What first turned me off was Calista, or Cindy, or whatever her name is, the character had about the same IQ as your average eggplant.
The first few action sequences involve the ultimate bad guy, Hans Gruber (played by Alan Rickman in one of his more solid performances) and are great viewing.
But these first few scenes are upstaged by the brilliance of Bruce Willis in his many fight scenes, usually involving gunfire, glass breaking or some kind of explosion!
I first saw 'Social Misfits' under the recommendation of a friend.
During the time little does he know that a group of terrorists are planning on taking over the building (this all happens in the first 20 minutes or so).
Well, the first one did work pretty good, didn't it?
When one considers Hollywood stars whose careers have gone down the tubes, Eddie Murphy is one of the first names that pops to mind.
When you see a movie for the first time, it is usually good, but when a part two is released I become a skeptic about weather or not the sequel will be any good.
After all the first movie was good, why wouldn't the sequel be?
(Eddie Murphy) It is a great sequel, just as good as the first.
I loved the first movie.
There is so many things wrong with this movie that I'm amazed anyone would say this is better than the first.
Finally.. at the end of the first movie we are left knowing that it doesn't take riches to get places in one's life.
But I think they forgot this movie is about animals first and foremost and totally forgot about the first movie.
If the first movie didn't exist maybe I'd like this more, but it does and so I really don't like this movie all that much  4/10 Quality: 5/10 Entertainment: 4/10 Replayable: 5/10
It's more like a repressed memory now, and I only commented here because I was trying to find out what the Spanish Orangutan in the first movie was saying.
The original Dr Dolittle with the white guy in it was OK, the first Dr Dolittle with Eddie Murphy was hilarious and a very underrated film, but this movie sucks.
This is the first realistic connection the audience has.
Though miles better than the (awful) first game this still suffers from major bore.
I'm not sure if the first poster was watching the same film as the rest of us!
Anyway, from the 1st 2 minutes I felt this is some awkward attempt to ride on the "success" of the first movie.
Some shots are clearly ripped from the first one, like the liquid nitrogen demonstrations and when the leader dude stands in front of the japan flag & his "army".
If you haven't seen any of the 'series' and feel the need to see any of them (whether or not that is a good idea for you to do is a whole different discussion) just see the first one.
The reason I'm going on at length about the first movie is that 90% of this movie "Laboratory of the Devil" is simply the first movie, re-staged, only done very badly.
some very badly written dialogue (though to be fair, the movie is dubbed, so maybe the translation lost something) we find out that the main evil guy from the first movie wants to restart the medical experiments.
No, for some reason they don't, even though they were all there the first time.
"Well let me tell you about it..."  We go into flashback mode and I optimistically figure it'll last maybe 5 minutes, summing up the first movie.
After I realized the movie was half over, I resigned myself to the fact that the whole movie was going to be a re-hash of the first.
Now that's bad and lazy enough, but not only do they just blunderingly re-stage the first movie, they manage to completely f-*$% it up in every way possible.
The experiments that are restaged are the most boring ones, and they only include one from the first movie that was a real shocker, but since most of us have SEEN the first movie, it's not shocking.
The first movie was well paced, but in this case, it seems like the screenwriters just wrote down all the scenes from the original on index cards, put them all in a hat, and picked them out at random and filmed them in no particular order, making sure to leave out the most powerful ones and substituting incredibly stupid ones in their place.
They also figured that maybe the first movie wasn't humorous enough (yeah, you really need humor in a movie about POW torture), so they stuck in some really, really unfunny "comic relief".
In the first movie, during several scenes prisoners are tricked into the experiments, which is much more believable and has much more powerful and disturbing results.
In the first movie, it had the effect of making you hate the villains even more.
Oh, and every once in a while, they stick in some stock war footage that is so grainy you can barely tell what's going on (I *think* that was a shot of something being blown up there...)  The characters look so much alike (I'm not saying this in a racist way -in the first movie, I had no problem, but here the screenwriting is so sloppy I didn't know who was who.
The only positive things about this wretched excuse for an exploitation movie are that it leaves out the suspiciously realistic, unnecessary scenes of animal cruelty included in the first one, and that it has the guts to have a downbeat ending (though again, it's just a really inept rip-off of the first movie).
The first movie was so disturbing it made me lose sleep, this one just put me to sleep.
I repeat, do NOT waste your time with this (especially if you've seen the first one).
The first is when Kidman is saying that her boyfriend is from Bulgaria: "close to Transilvania... he's got the whole Dracula-cowboy thing going on".
We are first assured that this movie is 100% factual, and I guess it came close.
When Hulten and Jones first meet, he invites her to pick out a well-dressed woman whose fur coat Jones fancies, which Hulten then steals for her.
This films attempts to be three things: a mystery (wherein it wastes actor Skeet Ulrich), a "first love" story, and a portrait of boys at a boarding school.
Riding for the first time in a limo, he's introduced to the suave driver, Argyle (De'voreaux White), who gives him some pretty useful advice on trying to win over the wife.
It's not the first time he plays one of these characters, and he usually plays it very well.
Fellini exposes his great attraction for the clowns and the world of the circus first recalling a childhood experience when the circus arrives nearby his home.
first of all there are no teachers at the schools, second all the schools are constantly trying to conquer the other, and lastly every single kid is an expert fighter, oh and on that note this show is so unoriginal that they actually decided to call the kid's "destined" to fight "Fighters".
There is a 2nd season currently but don't hold your breath, the first season ended with only a few incoherent questions about the future.
The substantial profit garnered by this movie prompted production of three sequels, each continuing the amourous adventures of young Will and his trusty spy cameras, and even though their potential merits cannot be determined by this viewer, the first number in the series does provide an unexpected element of suspense in addition to capable costuming from Ha Nguyen, fine stunt performing, and a polished turn from Carr.
Since "Die Hard" was first released in 1988, it's difficult to think of a blockbuster action film that doesn't follow the basic structure and format of "Die Hard" .
I was led to buy the first two DVDs from the glowing comments I read on this site and from having really enjoyed James Herriot's books which I've read and reread over the years.
Was the first one Captain Kidd's and the second one some other treasure?
A few nights ago I was flipping through the channels and I came upon a treasure chest full of sh**(Blackbeard), but being the generous soul I am I decided to give this movie a chance: That was my first mistake.
Ok, first of all I have to say that I am a Tsukamoto fan.
Also, the movie looks as though it were assembled of entirely first takes.
Sword sound effects that sound as though they were ripped straight from the first season of the "Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers" TV show.
When one thinks of good first films - Swingers for instance, you just have to realize that there is no excuse for this sort of embarrassment.
You can clearly see that this movie is made by amateurs, first of all the lighting is really bad, at one point you can't even see the person being film because the sun whites out the camera.
If you want to see this, think about it first: "an imaginary killer on the rooftop".
It was nice to see Satana up there on the big screen again after all these years (but then again, I wasn't around for the first time, so why not just rent another classic Satana flick and leave this one behind?).
whenever she claims she was abducted by aliens, then there's some George Carlin-lookalike doctor who teams up with a psychic or something, plus Tura Satana (from the first Astro-Zombies movie) and her dimwit henchman who looks like Vincent D'Onofrio from MEN IN BLACK who hope to cash in on the invasion.
Much better than the first film, which was 88 minutes of characters standing around explaining to each other how the Astro-Zombies work, and 2 minutes of killin'.
Let's be specific: The opening sequence wasn't that bad - very evocative scenes in the dessert, camels, Bedouin, a group of Eastern European women, a campfire, lots of Russian and Arabic chit chat - OK, "expectations build": Next scene (after the first obligatory rape scene): auction of the Eastern European women as prostitutes: very noisy, not sure who the English-speaking (French-accented) person was - a buyer or a seller: couldn't make that out.
I had bought this movie on video before I watched it because since I had liked his other movies I assumed I would also like this but I didn't like it and I learned a lesson that I should watch a movie first before I buy it!
I would recommend people rent this before buying or try to watch it on TV first!
At first it's harmless but as soon as Shore's character cheats the judicial system it becomes both excruciatingly brainless and dull.
I first saw this movie when I was in grade school, so naturally I wasn't too critical.
Lets get that down first.
This is the first thing I have seen from Salome Breziner; if this is any indication of Breziner's style of writing/direction, then I'm not in any rush to see anything else.
My first misgivings were at the archaeological dig.
It was one of Cynthia's first roles.
Cynthia Rothrock, whose first film this is, appears on the video cover and has a couple of fight scenes in the opening 5 minutes.
This is important: it was the war that ushered-in Japan as a modern nation, and was the first time that a Western power was defeated by an Asian one.
At first it was good, but then it got boring.
The burlesque sequence offered a lot more tease than the actual dance show, with a lesbian pursuing a hot conquest and a dirty old man type getting worked up enough to attack the first young lady he sees after the show.
A group of randy boys looking to party, a lesbian couple who can't stop pawing each other, and a man who gets all worked up he rapes the first girl he sees.
The forest is the setting at night and inside it is where Leatherface and his clan(including a mother with a mechanical voicebox and a father whose been dead quite a long time)live..a compound very similar to the one we are familiar with from the first film.
The acting is amazingly unextraordinary, with the exception being the sole survivor from a group that was abducted and killed a few days in before this story (fittingly enough, she gets in one set of dialogue before she is separated and killed) and Leatherface's little sister, who is genuinely unsettling from first encounter (she holds tea parties with skulls and a doll made from what looks like a mummified infant), but is also barely given any screen-time.
It is an almost complete rehash of the first Texas Chainsaw Massacre in content, lacks any significant scares, has characters that are as thin as rice paper, and looks like it was made for about what I currently have in my wallet.
It kinda tried to hard to be the first movie.
I would have thought that the Texas Rangers would have completely investigated the Sawyer family and discovered any relative who may have taken in Leatherface after the events of the first two movies.
If this had been my first Gerard Butler movie I would have suggested he switch to a career in male modeling.
The women--tho pretty--don't get wild for the first half hour, and even then it's only 1958 wild, which is to say tame enough for afternoon TV.
I know that when I first heard of the title I couldn't rest till it was part of my library.
The Wild Women of Wongo is their third release as The Film Crew (Hollywood After Dark and Killers from Space being the first two) and easily the most funny.
First things first: somebody needs to officially release this film in the United States.
They all live happily ever after with Mother Nature as usual correcting herself from the mistake she made when she at first created the incompatible, to each other, men and women of Wongo and Goona.
Man this movie short is so bad that even a Joe Besser short with the Three Stooges is much better than this except maybe the horrible Besser shorts, I just don't want to imagine if this was the first Three Stooges film I've ever watched, stay away unless if you're a hardcore stooge fan.
Linda Blair has undergone quite an amazing transformation since the first "Exorcist", but this inconsequential, goofy, utterly predictable comedy is easily forgotten a few hours after it's over, because it has no plot and no weight whatsoever.
When I've watched this movie, I had no idea how bad its going to be, right into the first 5 minutes.
I mean, I remember seeing him for the first time in Back to the Future when I was little, and now this?
Obviously the studio was planning on hyping the movie knowing that the first weekend is all the movie was going to have.
I absolutely will not be attending another movie from these guys until after the first few weekends.
I know they made the entire investment back the first weekend, but good god almighty.
For the first time ever I have tried to get my money back from the cinema and believe me I have seen some bad films but this took the biscuit.
I wasn't expecting much when I paid for my ticket to see this film, however this was the first time I actually considered leaving the theatre in the middle of a film because it was so bad.
Not Only does the film recycle old jokes from previous parodies but also recycles jokes within the movie, Jayma Mays kicking the beaver wasn't funny the first time, so why do it again.
I think I laughed at one joke within the first 5 or 10 minutes.
For the first 20 minutes I thought to myself.. "this just can't be.. a movie that looks like it was filmed using one camera in a decorated high school auditorium".. "there's got to be a joke somewhere".. but alas, at the 30th minute, I could no longer justify wasting my life.
The first two Scary Movies were funny because they didn't let the flat parts slow them down.
There is bad acting by everyone involved (of course all the women are hot) and if you can't figure out who the killer is in the first ten minutes, you've never watched a movie before.
This was my first experience with a film festival, particularly with a world premiere.
The scientist was kidnapped at the opening of the film by several accountants in a huge car, set to a bouncy tune that gets on your nerves after about the first five minutes of endless repetition.
In closing, unless you're like me, a KISS fan who wanted to see Ace in his first dramatic role, don't bother with this movie.
The first twenty minutes of this movie are solid gold.
Now, I admit that I could tell that this was supposed to be the story of a movie fan named Jerry Harvey who was involved with the first pay movie channel, but that was about it--and I think I should have known more after half an hour!
OK, OK, I can understand how some movies try to use womanly figures to promote their movies and give some cheap thrills to the male audience, but you have to begin questioning a film that has the main lead getting it on with the first two nameless bare breasted chicks he rescues.
There is nothing new to gain from seeing 40 interactions as opposed to just the first few.
when i saw the trailer to this film i had high hopes and then when i found out that Mark Jones was behind it i figured it would be good i loved the first leprechaun but even though the trailer was good sadly thats about the only good thing about the film, it trys to hard to be funny and you just start feeling sorry a quarter of the way through asking yourself why am i still watching this maybe it might get better I've seen it all the way and let me answer that question with a big no.
this is like a bad sequel around the lines of leprechaun in space, but i forgave that movie simply because the first one was good but this on the other hand you cant forgive it trys way to hard at times and throws a little blood and boobs ur way every now and then to keep u watching, a part made me smile close to the end because it was simply a scene stolen from dead silence.
The first thing to say about Triloquist is that it's a horror comedy with heavy emphasis on the comedy, unfortunately it's not funny in the slightest which is obviously a big problem.
Stay away from this film unless you love the worst films out there or this is going to be the first film you will ever watch because from here the only way is up and for the Triloquist I don't think it could get any lower.
The role of Angelina seemed way over the top; first it was like watching a killer spoof from Scary Movie.
It was as if they had budgeted exactly an hour of tape, so everything was done first take and then all this nonsensical stock was added.
first off, those endless, obnoxious scenes of children playing, crying, laughing, running, hugging; I haven't seen an example of such shameless propaganda since the newsreels from Nazi Germany!
That's what got us into this mess in the first place.
I like how Martin Mull, who plays Paula's father and the first victim of the killer, is shot by a archery arrow and is left bleeding, but manages to survive like this for days.
Pitt had his first credited movie roles in 1989.
I'm not sure if this was released first or Happy Together was.
There's also the fairly original running gag of the killer's first victim surviving the assault and fruitlessly struggling for help for the rest of the film.
Not too long people are disappearing and bodies are piling up at Wurley High and Brian is first to be accused by Dwight because of his disturbing past.
I too saw ''Magic Boy'' on it's first release back in 1960.
The first is it's one of Chaplin's first films where he plays a relatively straight role throughout the film, and the second reason is it contains perhaps his first real attempt at pathos in his films: He draws a smiley face on the bar room floor of the girl who left him.
In contrast, the first episode of its popular predecessor "Lost" opens with chaos mediated by a broken hearted hero, but with comic sidelines such as a panicked character looking for a pen to perform an unneeded tracheotomy.
Having just watched the first 4 episodes on Sci-Fi, just to see what the big deal was all about ( and because the writer strike ), I can not fathom why there was such a strong call for this show to be "saved".
These are the only things that came into my mind after watching the first series...but don't get me wrong i loved the story and the whole concept of the post-nuclear atmosphere.
One of the first things a writer must take into account in creating any story for television is the fact that commercial breaks are going to interrupt the flow.
This is where the basic building blocks -- the rules if you would -- of television writing arose from, the most notable of necessities being that a significant motivating event must take place before the first commercial break.
The first van full of Uzi-toting bad guys would mow the town down and they would abduct and rape the women and the men would all be dead.
Terrible acting and dialogue are unbelievable at first, and then steadily turn to laughable.
The main character who mysteriously returns to "Jericho" after an unexplained five year absence is so heroic that in the first episode he saves an entire school bus load of children, including making a makeshift respirator for one of them with some straws and a pen knife!
The first conversation piece, with all 5 waiting women in the same room, is a long shot approaching 4 minutes, with various of the women talking.
All that in well and good, but as soon as I heard the first monotonous monologue from the mother, her eyes turning to heaven, speaking of how she can not reach out to her husband", not even to scratch his eyes out, my Bergman-radar immediately hit the red zone.
Great idea for a TV show and first and 2nd episodes were watchable, but after that it turned into the worst sci-fi soap opera.
I had the misfortune of viewing this film on the first day of a course on "Media and Democracy."
and a lot of people would probably check this out for curiosity's sake, to see John Travolta's first role.
TIDBIT - this was one of Travolta's first gigs, and he is barely recognizable under that makeup; and he has all of one line, albeit a memorable one.
After the first 10 minutes of watching this I was bored to death and had no idea what was actually going on.
Additionally, if you look carefully, you can see a very young John Travolta making an idiot of himself in his first film.
When we first meet Borgnine's character, he's standing alone on the streets of a ghost town looking every bit the part of a western rancher.
Title: The Devils Rain  Director: Robert Fuest   Cast: Ernest Borgnine, Tom Skerrit, William Shatner, John Travolta   Review: I had heard a few things about The Devils Rain, among them was that this was John Travoltas first movie and that William Shatner (aka Captain Kirk) was in it.
But first and foremost I thought that the fact that the used a "high priest of the church of Satan" as a technical adviser for the film just really peeked my curiosity for this film.
And for those of you holding their breath to catch Travolta in his first film role...well don't hold on for too long cause you just might miss it.
Right from the first opening minutes you are treated to an opening sequence that will certainly pull you in!
I am guessing they thought of the ending first and wrote a bunch of filler to get to said ending.
This is one of the very best of the first season episodes of 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents.'
In this one, Joseph Cotten plays a mean employer, who during the first five minutes fires an employee for showing too much emotion.
Films that don't almost put you to sleep in the first half hour.
A personal observation: when I first looked this up after watching it, I could not believe my eyes when I found out it was made in 2001.
As goofy as it all looks, if you think about it, that very first piece of cooked meat had to get a start somewhere, so this is just as good a rationalization as any.
I'd be curious to find out how close this movie was to being the first done in color.
I will be honest.The only reason I bought this DVD was to see more (in every sense of the word) of Laurette Luez.She first caught my attention in the 1950 film "D.O.A."
This sequel kept my attention for about the first hour before taking a sharp left turn into sheer nonsense territory.
The first film with Michael Keaton was pretty dull and boring, I think I watched this sequel to see if it was as bad.
So the first people that he tries to save is a bum.
At first I thought it would give a spin to the original and would dazzle us!
I also think that the first movie was more creepier!
Having seen the first film, I must admit that I didn't harbour much hope of this being a quality sequel.
The first film is a decent, if laboured attempt at creating a ring-esquire horror film.
White Noise 2 suffers from the same problem the first instalment.
The final sequences of both films jar with what precedes - thus undermining the audiences suspension of disbelief, and in the case of the first film, ruining a perfectly decent set-up.
What's worse is that all the good comments here on IMDb had me go in hopeful for a change from the first White Noise.
This Tammy person talks about how she got to know Pandora's Box when she went there with Lance, then seconds later announces there's a rule that you should come alone the first time.
Even though we were kept in suspense to who's setting the forest fires for the first half of the movie it wasn't a surprise at all the Tiny was the culprit!
Don't overlook the first five minutes even though it's an uneventful set-up for what follows.
The first thing that this film does is kill off the team.
"Quelques Jours en Septembre" is a very ambitious first film for Argentinian author Santiago Amigorena and it shows.
The first involves the abandoned Paris meeting when William Pound arrives at the hotel to surprise IrÃ¨ne and Elliot.
The technical specs of the film are first rate, with DP Christophe Beaucarne doing top work with the visuals.
Checking his bio on IMDb you will discover that this is far from his first movie... he's been in dozens!
Handling double duty as producer, Ken Curtis portrayed drunken Jerry Farrell, responsible for the escaped shrews in the first place.
Nothing is shown when the shrews attack someone and the first ones to die are (of course) the black guy then the Latino.
A Canadian television critic called the conclusion of the first episode "head spinning".
Captain Sherman (James Best) and his trusty first mate are delivering supplies to a doctor on a remote island.
Eventually, the daughter and scientist start to tell the captain about what is going on, but not after the first mate becomes the shrews' dinner.
The general concept is compact and dramatically efficient: a group of people are trapped first by a hurricane and then by an outside menace in a stronghold which gets less and less strong as time, ammunition and group cohesion all grow short.
The first half is boring and useless, it could have been cut down.
Now the characters on the show are annoying, first there's Spongebob, like I said, its about a normal sea sponge working at the Krusty Krab, Spongebob is twice annoying than Patrick and Squidward, Spongebob is a lousy mouth, gotten himself a lot of trouble in every episode.
I remember thinking Spongebob was the most stupid thing in the world when it first came out, but after my friend convinced me to watch one episode I found out that it actually was a decent show.
They original, funny, and the first for-kids cartoons on a for-kids network on the air.
At first it was okay, but it just seemed too bland.
Both films were completely ignored in first release.
It was the first time I ever saw a fully naked women, I was male and 15.....and it was still only marganially entertaining.
The film's first half is driven by the excellent performance of Dutton as Reverend Willie Taylor and evenly spreads the storyline between the families.
Stop me if you've already heard this one before: Six extremely annoying and unappealing college kids -- sassy blonde Rachel (Catherine Wreford), obnoxious, insensitive, and spineless musclehead Mark (a supremely terrible and insufferable performance by Alan Ritchson), sexy libidinous lesbians Atlanta (cute blonde Ashley Hawkins) and Liz (foxy brunette Tiffany Kristensen, who at least bares her breasts prior to getting bumped off first), bumbling nice guy Adam (decently played by Tom Nagel), and token black Sophie (Myiea Coy) -- on a cross country road trip run afoul of a vicious family of deadly and demented hicks after they get a flat tire in the middle of some nowheresville sticks.
The acting, at first, was so bad I almost switched this off.
This is very visible at the end of the first part (about two hours in) of the mini-series.
When i was watching it at one point i though i was watching, wrong turn, then i star thinking about the Texas chainsaw massacre, then hills have eyes and finally i know what you did last summer, the movie it's basically a mix of all these other movies but unsuccessfully did what those other movies did, it's just so predictable, the scrip it's so weak and far beyond scary, instead of that it's so lame, with this thousands of clichÃ©s like "don't go in there" "what it's this place" "he's gonna kill us all" you basically know who's gonna die first and why called it "the butcher" there is no butcher in the film and there is not even a good slaughter, they should have call it "i know what the Texas hills wrong turned last summer" or something, honestly i don't know what a company spend money into making this crappy films.
Check, he's here, let's hope he gets knocked off first.
Yeah, you'll spot her in the first two minutes.
During the first ten minutes you'll find yourself hoping that the bad guy mops them up quick and then goes to Cancun for a vacation with some margaritas and maybe beach babes.
no points for thatÂ.they give birth to a baby !- the reason why people get married in the first place !
Was a big question in my mind now even Rishi Kapoor feels the same in AALC which is very bad  I mean please the superficial way of showing America puts people off and in today's overseas audiences dominating times this isn't good  The first half moves in different lanes and the love triangle is done to death  and the second half gets better a bit Akshaye's realization is well handled and then the film ends well but the sudden change of the other son is too much  They are many problems in the film like the first half which moves in different lanes and not proper treatment is given to most of it  Rishi Kapoor directs some dramatic scenes well but he needs to improve his storytelling, overall a decent debut by one of the finest actors as a director Music is okay  Akshaye Khanna shines in his role, He was always a good actor but signed bad films those days Barring his receding hairstyle he leaves a huge impact as an actor Aishwarya is plastic as ever Rajesh Khanna is okay Kader Khan and Jaspal Bhati are good Satish Kaushik is funny Paresh Rawal is good
During the first half of the film, the story follows each family on a equal basis through social and family struggles.
Well, here - this is the first time I have ever come home from a movie and said "I have to get on IMDb and write a review of this NOW.
Let's just put it this way - my wife, who has only been in the U.S. for half a year and speaks only a small amount of English - whispered this to me when the girl first appears in JG's pad, and I swear to God I am not making this up: "She go to house to kill girl.
I had read the book once before when it was first released (I had also read Angels & Demons which I enjoyed only slightly more than TDC), and a week before it's release decided to read it again to brush up on the story.
If I hadn't read the book first, I would have been confused with the flash backs, which were very poorly rendered.
In those first 15 minutes Tom Hanks (whom to my mind has only ever made a handful of decent movies at best) is giving a lecture to students.
The strange thing is I briefly started to read the opening chapter or two of the book whilst I was away last month with my girlfriend, and my first impressions were that it read like a movie script so something doesn't quite add up........
I watched this when it was first broadcast, living at the time in Washington DC, where the press was harrumphing about what a dangerous, subversive, anti-social act it would be to watch this paranoid fantasy.
The American first strike is still 1091 nukes that sounds like Pt 109 won the war and that says back off brics alliance.
The first 15 minutes were good, but the usually low budget, too much dioluge, and sappy made for TV quality.
I remember when this dreadful mini-series first played.
I've never been inclined to view those tapes, because the non-sequitors were annoying the first time through.
The first, and one of the only, night scenes in the movie is almost entirely out of focus and grainy.
At first I thought it might be a comedy, since the characters are written in such broad terms.
He was the reason I really wanted to see the movie in the first place.
My first complaint is that first 2 minutes basically give away the ending of the movie!
I have been a history buff on the sinking of the RMS TITANIC ever since September of 1966 with the opening episode of the ABC-TV IRWIN ALLEN SCI-FI SHOW "THE TIME TUNNEL" where time travelers Tony Newman and Doug Philllps (Jimmy Darren & Robert Colbert) went on the first of many journeys to this ship just hours before she struck the iceberg sinking carrying 1,502 men, women and children to their untimely death's in 28 degree water.
The old man that Pitt talks to is not running a pub in the book, he is the last surviving crew member in 1987, and calls Dirk Pitt away from the expedition to hear the story of a dying old LYMIE as Pitt calls him at first, but through him learns the story of the Titanic.
And when the Titanic came up in the book it came up the way they last saw TITANIC in 1012 stern first.
That was the first of a 3 movie deal that Clive Cussler sold.
Raise The Titanic was NOT the first Clive Cussler/Dirk Pitt novel.
The film follows first year law student James T. Hart (Timothy Bottoms) on a series of misadventures and anecdotes mostly revolving around his borderline obsession with one of his professors, but also dabbles in his relationship with a local woman he meets, the lives of some of his fellow students, the pressure of finals, etc., etc.
If this had been the first film by the Quirozes I believe it would have been a good attempt, however, after more than ten films apiece the product is very poor.
The first season was good and so was the second.
Runners up for the title of Best of the Worst:  - War Camp (There is no script, and the entire movie was shot on the first take.)
At first, I thought the director was just being "artsy", but now I know that it was some kind of mistake, but it makes this awful movie even worse, if that's possible.
The music is pretentious, the editing bears the mark of a first year film student, and the acting is horrifyingly bad.
It has the characters fighting in swearing fits that come off like children learning the "f-word" for the first time.
She says that when she first read the script (by John Byrum), she was taken aback by the untruthfulness's of it.
I am 60 years old and read On the Road for the first time in 1969.
In the first chapters, we see some shots of the Vietnam war, in between the scenes.
There were many holes in the plot also, like how did the orphan kid survive the Ebola virus in the first place, and why did that crazy doctor lady fake her death?
It was so predictable within the first 5 minutes of the movie what was going to happen.
At first before the movie started I had the feeling it would be cheesy like a horrible Sci-Fi movie.
The ending was annoying, first with her cutting only one of the straps on the tunnel and it expanding and then when she made the last second phone call.
From the first appearance of its main character, the whole thing starts to fall apart.
The first tells how she had an affair with her teenage sweetheart and how her husband reacts.
The first and third stories are a little cliched, especially the elevator sequence, but they're still quite great.
Why did they make such a pathetic film.I think his first film was so wrong, it just wrong.
Although the title would suggest otherwise the first 5 years of the 60's are not really important in this film.
as a first aid employee at the Woodstock festival!
I am primarily referring to the first three-way tag ladder match between the Dudley's, Edge and Christian, and The Hardy's.
And yes, I know Benoit was a heel in that one, but Vince was an idiot to make him one in the first place.
Very simple, first day, Film School 101 rules are completely ignored and it shows off that the people doing the thing are nothing short of amateur and the whole thing really comes across as a public-access show.
The first had a beauty queen/late-sleeping princess type, whose husband did everything for her, swapping places with a gal obviously not into great concern over appearances (either hers or her home's), with a street performer husband with some sort of metal clips permanently installed in his forehead, permanent red striping on his face, and more tattoos than the typical NBA basket-baller.
Somehow I always thought this was Bertolucci's first film.
When she wakens under a blanket, the first things she sees are her own clothes -- including her bra and knickers -- strung out to dry.
I saw the first half of the film then gave up because this looked to me DOUBTFUL.
I imagine the creatures would be queued in right after the couple promises to survive for one another and hang on no matter what even though they fought non-stop for the first 100 minutes of the movie just like Bud and Lindsay.
When they first begin their experience as freshmen, they vow to say together forever no matter what.
It was my first Bing Crosby film and though I thought he was okay in it I have to say the only reason for me has to be Donald.
Okay, it looks like this film was created to do two things; Obviously, the first one is to give little girls another movie to add to their collection of princess/bubblegum memorabilia.
Ummm that deaf kid wasn't even deaf...when he first appeared I thought hey an interesting subplot...but I was wrong.
Well...first off..just why.
Let me be clear here first of all: I'm in my twenties, and I saw Bratz, but not for any kind of simple lewd intentions at gawking at sexy teens in gobs of make-up and slutty clothes.
The first words that came out of my mouth when I found out my friend's sister wanted to see this for her birthday.
Bing Crosby stars in his second big screen version of the Cole Porter Broadway smash, although this plot has been modified slightly and brought up to date 50' style..it therefore tells a completely different story to Crosby's first version twenty years earlier.
Like Yoda, the Traveler says we must learn control first.
We would need to evolve better mental faculties first.
That's all I could think the first time I saw this film.
This movie would've been a hoot amongst some of the pseudo-intellectual Arts students when first released.
While this isn't the first foreign film that I've watched, it's certainly the first one that I've done a review for.
I'd first seen her in the James Bond movie, Quantum of Solace - which wasn't exactly a great movie, but I thought she did really good in it.
When Iris is first introduced, she's working at a bottling plant (until she has an accident, involving her cutting off the tip of her ring finger on a broken bottle).
And it is with the writers' treatment of those characters that McAnuff's Cousin Bette first fails.
Instead of having to deal with the difficulty of a great beauty thrown into the gutter, they have taken the easy way out by killing her off within the first five minutes of the novel.
This will be the first and last occurrence of explicit violence in this weird film but violence will be ever present.
Images and sounds call extremely little attention to themselves at first but each scene and each movement ventures further into your soul and once it's there, it never leaves.
This is the first and probably last film I will ever submit anything to on this site because it is that bad.
Well I first saw it on the Sci-Fi channel, then a few weeks later uneditied on Showtime, its much better on showtime, becuz then at least there is some nudity.
It also takes quite a while for the killing to start, because the makers of this vaguely likable crapfest thought it necessary to introduce us first to the utterly dull and unfunny humanoids.
I know my Lawrence well and I have read all of his books, and my first encounters with Lady Chatterley's Lover (the book) was strong, so I had been looking forward to this adaptation.
When it eventually does (after what seems like an eternity), you only see the first 5 seconds of the sexual encounter then you fade out to the aftermath.
Life continues in silent desperation until she first lays eyes upon the ruggedly handsome grounds keeper, Parkin (Jean-Louis Coullo'ch).
Even before they first consummate their love, it is quite evident that Lady Chatterley and Parkin want each other.
I first saw Brandy & Mr. Whiskers on the Disney channel and decided to watch it.
The first episode showed them falling into the jungle, meeting Loa-Boa, a snake who is purple and pink and wears earrings.
She saves them in the first episode towards the end.
The very first show I seen, had the characters burping/belching, and flatulence/farting as they were laughing about it all.
Very wrong description on the first page for this movie here on IMDb.
This is a pathetically dreary film about a "gang" of drug smugglers and their not-so-funny misadventures as they are hounded by the Georgia State Patrol while first in a beat up camper and then a huge rig.
Perhaps had I stuck it out Id have got my reward but in the first half this just didnt have anything to excite me, make me think or particularly want to see how it ended up.
And the first person to comment on this movie is talking about a Horror movie.
Yes, well what can be said...a seemingly normal woman (Laura) goes completely insane after giving birth to her first child, a girl, if that matters.
I found the actress playing Iris was quite good, especially given that it was her first film and that she had to communicate so much non-verbally.
- When asked why she adapted this novel, Bertrand said when she first read the book, she couldn't stop, and had all these images in her head, which was unusual since the atmosphere in the book is not European.
- Olga Kurylenko is from the Ukraine, and this was her first film, thus making it difficult to obtain financing.
For instance the mother, what mother would not come to see her first grandchild because she was scared to fly.
A young woman has her first baby after moving from the city to a large home with her husband.
The only reason European-Americans like it is for fear of being branded a "racist" because they don't enjoy a mini-series that is not good in the first place.
In the first episode a scene is added for no other apparent reason than to allow O.J.
The first scene of this movie is the best scene, and as soon as it's over the movie falls flat on its face and never gets up.
In reality, hot young temps don't come on to whatever shlub showed them around on their first day.
On the first viewing, this struck me as an overwrought film noir with the tragic overtones slathered on heavily.
I didn't know what to expect when I saw this movie, but I wanted to throw it out the window when I came across the first scene of the dead animals.
there are not too many good things about this horror movie.one good thing is the performance of Larry drake as the psycho.he really puts his heart into the performance.you can tell he really has fun with the role.the only other good thing is that in the last 25 minutes or so,the movie starts to get good.the last 15 minutes in particular are really good,and there is one scene near the end which is priceless.unfortunately the first 70+ minutes are pretty lame.there really aren't enough positives are enough to make the movie worth watching.that's my opinion.
The first 15 minutes were pretty cool, but then the next 20 minutes were deadly boring.
With this kind of talent behind the camera, and with the formulaic and uninteresting stories most of the Masters of Horror entries had been delivering as the series first debuted on Showtime, Deer Woman was the "episode" I was dying to see the most.
For that matter, it seems that the supporting cast members were the only reason this movie could have been produced in the first place.
This episode is one of the best of a mixed first season.
At first I found some of the weak points to be frustrating, but then the whole thing quickly became laughable.
This is the first time I've ever turned of the movie before the ending.
I already started getting worried when I saw the first images.. the movie was recorder with a simple dvcam (or even worse)..
At first he starts off as an aussie and ends up as a Texan who occasionally lapses into aussie!
The first one you see absolutely nothing, not even a reflected flash in the car window that he is stood right next to!
2) Why is the first time that we even know this guy has a home life is when we are in his wrecked home where he wants to get his sword?
6) Why did he need a lair in the first place?
i was a little uncertain when i was first introduced to this film...my friend had bought it and it really didn't seem interesting, i mean come on...another nazi v. jew film but i was surprised...  this story is origional following a little boy who is left alone and is being hunted by the nazi's.
OK, first things first, let me get a little rant out of the way: IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE AN EX-SPECIAL FORCES BOUNTY HUNTER IN YOUR MOVIE MAKE SURE HE OR SHE CAN ACTUALLY SPEAK IN THE DIALECT YOU WANT THEM TO!
Joe meets another girl in town, Bertie (Pompeo, who looks like Rene Zellweger's younger sister) and at first she is funny, and charming, but as soon as they start to fall in love with each other she becomes dark and depressed.
While this review is generally negative, I want to make a positive point first.
The movie had a bad storyline to begin with, and the only thing that could've helped it is if they destroyed all evidence that it was made in the first place.
The dialog is horrible and within the first five minutes it becomes obvious that this movie blows.
For me, this movie was something of a one trick pony, very tiresome after the first few minutes.
When I watched Cold Fish, I had heard rumors that when it was first screened people walked out, not because it was bad, but because it was very disturbing.
And the director's first name is David...wow, what a coincidence.
The first glimpse we get of the vampire community is a WW2 style vampire safe house, complete with said period's costumes, and the NSA's costumes are very Nazi-like.
Instead, it's a contest between screenwriters Gage and Fletcher's comic book dialogue and Bokeem Woodbine's unfathomably inept lead performance to see who can drive a stake through the heart of this mess first.
I have no real idea of exactly how the whole thing ended because I'm not really sure what happened during the first part of the film.
The amount of real dialogue could've been crammed into the first five minutes, anything else said was either cursing of strange things questions on the part of Paul's character.
The central relationship between Grant the human & Gray the Vampire was clichÃ©d & really cheesy, I mean at first they don't don't get on & seem mismatched but by the end they are best of friends & have saved each other's lives, we've seen it all before & done a lot better.
"Gummi Tarzan" was one of the first movies which seriously admitted that bullying exists and is a problem.
Much like other people here, I was disgusted by the superficial and petty characters (even though at first glance the story lines appear to offer some good values).
My first thoughts on this film were of using science fiction as a bad way to show naked women, althought not a brilliant story line it had quite a good ending
I saw this film, the director's first attempt, when it debuted at the Philly Film Festival in 2002.
Just in case you didn't learn from the first 4000 holocaust films that the holocaust was really bad........Speilberg goes out on a limb and hits you over the head with the fact that the holocaust was really bad.
The first was Sad Cypress, and the reason is the same.
There have been persistent rumors that Rosaleen's first husband, an intrepid explorer, is still alive and as such would nullify her marriage to Gordon.
This is one of Christie's titles which was carefully thought out and contains all the clues one needs - we are dealing first and foremost with an adventurer and opportunist!
The first episode of FULL HOUSE makes BABYLON-5 seem like a documentary series.
The average viewer wanting to enjoy a fun comedy series is going to be repelled by the major events in the first episode of FULL HOUSE.
I did not think that Cannibal Ferox 11 was as good as the first film.
I thought that this was quite a good cannibal film, but not as good as the first film Cannibal Ferox was, but i did end up enjoying it.
This film started promisingly, and for about the first 35 minutes was full of riotously funny humour - but then, it appears that the scriptwriters just ran out of the ideas - So what did they do?
Acting is below substandard, humor is absent in every scene and the script should have been burned after the first reading, after the scriptwriters had been shot that is.
But recently, that creativity seems to have been drying up, and Kevin and Perry were resurrected, first on TV (Kevin's sexual encounter explained as a dream) and now in this disappointing film.
Firstly, this film is cruder than the TV series (illustrated by the endless repetition of one particular sight gag that was fresh at its first outing but that does not survive its over-exposure here).
I am disqualified through reasons of age and culture to comment on the Ibiza music phenomenon,the raising to sainthood of disc jockeys,and the apparent ambition of every teenage boy to become one.I do understand - in the form of a distant memory - the urge to procreate that overcomes one at the age of fifteen to the extent that little else is of any consequence.Thus Kevin and Perry exist in an almost permanent state of priapism,their whole object being to divest themselves of their virginity at the first available opportunity.This can be - indeed is - amusing for five minutes but all too quickly palls.There are some gags that actually improve with repetition but unfortunately "Kevin and Perry go large" doesn't actually have any of them.
The first place he runs is into a fun house, which for no reason is a storefront on a busy downtown street.
While I loved the first one due to its excellent writing despite its low budget, the other Bancroft films have been mediocre at best--mostly because the writing was, at best, second rate.
PS--For the first time in a Brass Bancroft film, sidekick Eddie Foy manages to do well!!!
When a killer is running amok with a gun, Foy subdues the guy and for the first time in one of these films, he seems like a secret agent, not some dumb comic relief!!
I remember first seeing this in 1980 as part of THE HAMMER HOUSE OF HORROR series and everyone was talking about it at school on Monday .
I saw this movie again on Sky One last night, I had not seen it since it first came out on video (did it even get a cinema release?).
I even wonder how could such films be released in the 80's....The first time I watched it, I couldn't even say any single word, I was amazed and astonished by this incredible movie, I couldn't believe they made that for real !
When I first saw the title of Cannon's 'Cyborg' and the name Jean Claude Van Damme tagged, I thought of a cyborg Van Damme.
I must admit the most amusing part was when I correctly guessed the little doggy had something to do with he whole thing, I couldn't believe I was right, I was laughing, that was the first time I have ever laughed at a movie!
The absurd set of coincidental circumstances that lead to the (first) boat's explosion are an early indication of the dumb things to follow.
The first real sex scene is of one of the monsters raping the woman.
I rented it because the actors in it are normally first rate, well they were terrible and the directing was ridiculous.
I give you with 1/10 the first real dud of 2004.
It may have been shot first with a different creating crew.
The first few times I let it go b/c urban inner-city (read: Black life) does, in fact, reflect some of those things, some of the time.
At first glance, Take the Lead looks like it will take the "Inspirational light drama" genre to a new level.
I'll admit that when I first started watching this show, at a friend's request of course, I thought it was vaguely interesting.
I've been watching this show as a fan from the first episodes and now many years later have come to the conclusion this show is completely fake and that Jason and Grant are nothing but a couple of frauds.
I was transfixed by this show since my first viewing.
Before watching the film I saw the very high IMDb score (but forgot to look at the number of votes) and was expecting to sit down to a cult classic, indeed the first 2-3 minutes set the scene with a suitably art-house feel but then.... oh dear.
Mori (Zoe), I must say that it's the first time I see her acting, and to be honest, I think that she never managed Zoe, being absolutely lacking of the emotiveness required by her character.
"Necronomicon" is an analogy of three short stories:1)"The Drowned"(Christophe Gans)2)"Cold"(Shusuke Kaneko)and 3)"Whispers"(Brian Yuzna).In my opinion,the first one is the best one maybe because it's highly atmospheric and a little bit creepy.It has also very appealing cast(Bruce Payne,Richard Lynch or wonderful Belinda Bauer).The second one is very weak:boring and full of uninteresting characters.I didn't enjoy it.The third one is too bizarre and also very ridiculous.It has some nice gore effects and nothing more.I suggest you to watch only the first story-"The Drowned".Don't bother with rest.My evaluation:4/10 perhaps 5/10.
* The first two stories were all right.
If you're looking for a REAL MOVIE, you'll wish you hadn't given it the chance in the first place, especially considering it's nearly two hours long.
Spoiler Alert I have to say that when I first saw the movies Rocky 1-3, I was in bliss.
I read highly negative reviews for the film and expected a lame rehash of the first.
We don't know who's who on the first viewing but still, what a boring a lazy way to start a horror film.
The first thing that pops to mind when you start watching a Battlestar Galactica episode is "Why?"
If they had been activated the war would have been over the first week.
How can you go back and enjoy the first seasons of the show knowing that most of the actions by key characters are lies and completely illogical since you now know they are cylons.
Battlestar Galactica was sold as a sci-fi drama, not just "drama", and that's the reason it was green lit in the first place.
Oddly, while shocking, the group at first seemed to take this in stride--I guess they didn't want to pass judgment on quaint native customs.
Heading west, reformed outlaws Emmett (Scott Glenn) and Paden (Kevin Kline) become a band, first by springing Emmett's wild brother Jake (Kevin Costner), then by getting saved from a posse by Mal (Danny Glover), crack shot with a Henry rifle.
I first saw Tracy as Misto Bottome in "Brother Rat" and thought he was wonderful.
She wears shoes with ankle straps that reminded me of the first girlie magazine I ever saw.
Perhaps it's because it's the director's first feature film, but mainly because of budget constraints, "Civil Brand" left a lot of gaps in credibility, and visual creativity.
Well, after sitting through the indescibably awful first two hours, I needed to see how this mess ended.
The first movie is Cemetery of Terror lets take a look.
I have talked with Mike and he says that they are in the process of making a feature film compassing the first three chapters together.
I will be first in line for that film.
it's the extent to which this movie is so god awful boring that in the first five minutes i already wanted to shout "LET ME OUT" in the middle of the theater.
At first this annoyed me as i really wanted to give the film a chance, but as the film progressed I couldn't help but join in.
It built up the suspense for the first hour making you wonder who is this guy and why did he change his identity.
Outstanding first effort, and I hope to see MUCH more...
Before and after the film, when the director spoke, he seemed like a nice guy, and was certainly very cute--so, I wish him well in the future, but this is really bad first feature.
A loser in the first season of American Idol (America couldn't kick his signing butt off the show quick enough), a horrible actor on screen.
It falls into the category of not bad enough to walk out of, but not good enough to have shown up for in the first place.
Warning: Spoilers  Two parts of the movie really irked me:  1) When Gwen is trying to seduce Caleb, she says something about him trying "normal" sex first.
At first he's comprehensive and helpful, but later it actually seems as if he wants to prevent people from saving themselves.
Franco successfully builds their scenes, starting with the eye-contact between Odile and Mario's wife, while we also see that Odile ogles Mario, from their hotel windows..an opportunity is presented, and we watch as Mario's wife makes the first move.
Folks, there is a reason why this movie is so hard to find, let me tell you...  (SPOILERS)  The first half of this movie has the main character El Topo with his young son riding through the desert where they encounter various violent wierdnesses.
The first is a barn in the middle of nowhere with mutilated human and cattle all over the place.
You know there's something wrong when even Robert Downey Jr. is uninteresting in a character that made me wonder why he chose to do the movie in the first place.
Presumably,as a minor, they would consult with his mother before prescribing these drugs, and in fact, it would be very unusual for them to even accept him as a patient without first having contact with a parent -- at very least to arrange for payment (this being the United States).
Go and write the first three to five high school stereotype characters that come to mind on the back of an envelope -- and yup, you're going to see them in this movie.
The film-making is first rate here.
In this film it's used twice, the first time as a duet on the piano, just as it's used the first time in "Harold And Maude," which is annoying enough.
The first scene is the first scene from "Rushmore."
Actually, the first several scenes are from "Rushmore."
At first, the story is confusing and you are wondering what in the world is going on.
Grades: Acting: D- (This would be an F but Jeff Thomas does a decent job as the lead) Suspense: C- Sometimes this movie was too slow sometimes it was too fast Gore: B- This was the best part Story: C It sucked at first but revealed a lot in the end Characters: D You had no clue who was a main character or if they were dead Overall: C- had the potential to be good but nothing was explained well Do not buy this movie!
in the first 2/3rds of the movie, and yet despite the presence of these skin scenes, the movie is a very uncommercial and personal effort.
When I picked up this movie at the video store it looked decent at first; at the bottom it showed 4 awards from 4 different festivals that looked like this  WINNER, Newy York Independent Film Festival, WINNER Detroit International Horror Film Festival, WINNER, Fantastic Festival of Film UK, WINNER, Barebones International Film Festival  WHAT???
Do not trust the first reviews of this movie.
If one character is addressing another for the first time, the introductory word is the character's first name.
The first story is a brilliant mix of both intrigue and action.
At first glance, it was a little bit disappointment, when I saw Melissa P. I had an expectation that Melissa P. herself would have played in this movie.
We watched the first one.
OK, I need to make a disclosure first: This movie is just plain camp as far as i can tell.
In fact, the first time i saw it on TV i thought it was 6 or 7 years older than it actually was.
The science talk seemed slightly more scientific than usual (Well, not being a rocket scientist, for all I know they could have been exchanging formulas for melted butter - but it sounded right in the first part of the movie).
However watching The Swordsman and then Gladiator Cop is an interesting exercise in picking up what you have seen already, what really belongs in the first film and why you aren't doing something more productive.
Also the action is great with some of the first every special effects on the TV thanks to Lucas Film.
Also the first episode the Mexican revolution is great and is like A Fist Full of Dynamite.
Ever since I first saw the Drew Carey roast that kicked off the tradition of airing the Friar's Club Roasts on television, I knew that no matter who was being roasted, the comedians could make it funny.
I don't know what it is, but it may have to do with how old you were when you first saw it.
I'm guessing that when the movie was first released, a lot of guys took their dates to see it Â women typically love romantic themes, even when done badly Â and got laid that night or something, hence they remember it fondly.
As a huge fan of the original Indiana Jones movies, I must admit that I did not take to liking the young Indiana Jones Chronicles when i first watched them at the age of 7.
I saw them again for the first time since then around two years ago and i have been hooked ever since.
When Hope first reveals herself to Daniel with the rosary beads, there is shock - then nothing.
Flynn makes a dashing hero in his first Western, one of five films he made with de Havilland and Hale.
Thank God this movie only lasted 84 minutes, because it was pure torture, the first half was just your average bad teen movie (what I expected) but in the second half it turned into a real nightmare, It make Police Academy films look good.
In the first hour this film plays out like a comedy/ western and then suddenly it turns into a drama/romantic/action western.
The only reason I watched it in the first place was the fairly high rating and good reviews.
After reading a little about the director and his previous films, I can understand the attraction that other viewers may of felt and the respect for the director (based on his previous films) that gave rise to the high rating and good reviews, but this is my first (and possibly last!)
This was Flynn's first Western, and he doesn't really look at home among the grizzled cast: he's too fair-skinned for that weatherbeaten crew, too well-groomed in a world of straggly facial hair (the trademark Flynn pencil moustache isn't really appropriate here), too neatly dressed to fit in with the rest of the town, and a somewhat self-conscious grin has a tendency to turn up at inappropriate moments (as he disclaims the role of Sheriff, for example), suggesting that he was not entirely certain of himself in the part.
This movie is the first sequel to Walt Disney's "The Shaggy Dog" (1959).
Wilby Daniels, the teenager from the first film (Tommy Kirk), has grown up, and has a family of his own: Suzanne Pleshette (as wife Betty) and Shane Sinutko (as son Brian).
The "special effects" from the first Shaggy progress surprisingly little, and look worse in color.
As in his first two films, Argento includes a variety of eccentric supporting characters, often to distracting comic effect (eg.
That's pretty much the first half of the story too and it does come across like a political drama, though at times it did feel and look like a TV soapy.
The film is very slow to start, with practically nothing happening in the first half of the film.
Errol Flynn stars in his first western movie.
I first heard about this from my good friend, who told me to rent it.
If you are looking for some campy thrills, there is little charm to be found with in this film, with the exception of the excellent first section.
"Quitters Inc.", the first of the three stories, is superbly acted by James Woods (but what doesn't he superbly act in?)
The first segment is definitely worth watching for any Stephen King / Camp Horror / James Woods fan, and the third if you really like trolls or Drew Barrymore (they are basically the same thing).
At first she does not like Hatton, blaming Wade for the death of her brother on a cattle drive but coming to love him when he shows his courage in opposing the men who make Dodge City a dangerous place to live.
Ever since seeing it when first released I have waited to find a worse film.
When i first witnessed the horror that was Strike the Tent, i was looking for a good film to watch with my friend, but what we got made a fourth grade spelling bee on film look exciting.
Dodge City, an all action Western from start to finish, finds Errol Flynn {in his first Western outing} on tip top form.
When he straps on the Sheriff badge for the first time it's akin to Clark Kent shredding his suit to become Superman.
The stuff with April's family is just painful to watch and rings false from the first second to the last.
The characters were the lamest group of needy individuals however as a man, I was at first intrigued by the lesbians, but even lost interest in them within the first 3 minutes or so.
I just saw this movie for the first time, and the last time.
Perhaps this one too was a book first and it just did not translate to the big screen all that well.
This was Akki's first film with DD who is known for his mad films, Akki had done a comic role before in SUHAAG(94) but here he plays a full comedian  The movie is a full crap and surprisingly DD released it with another film of his DEEWANA MASTANA which had better actors like Anil and Govinda(at least that time) and that film worked  This film is a complete crap film and makes no sense and it doesn't even keep you entertained, A must for comedies  The comedy scenes are trite while the main plot is itself senseless and the attempts to comedy are foolhardy though the message is a nice one  Direction by DD is bad Music is okay  Akshay seems uncomfortable in the comedy set up as it was his first attempt and he was a bad actor those days He shouts too loud and comes across as a poor man's Govinda Juhi is amazing in her comic role and steals the show Kader repeats his act, Paresh is awful Satish Kaushik annoys Gulshan Grover has an indefinite role
The closest is Ann Sheridan's first stage scene and that's saying a lot considering it lasted all of a couple of minutes.
Me and a friend were sitting in the local movie store and decided to just go to the horror section, spin around in a circle, and point at the first movie we saw and then rent said movie.
The acting from the first frame was unconvincing and amateur, and proceeded throughout.
During the first half it's kind of hard to figure out much about what's really going on, it just plain jumps around too much.
"Feet first" strikes me as quite weak, and Harold Lloyd is one of my all time favorites.
i've seen better from first year film students.
Eye Candy: Carlee Baker, Eryn Joslyn, Eve Mauro, and Robin Sydney all provide T&A (Robin I saw topless before in "Big Bad Wolf", the other three are baring for the first time) There's also nudity in some of the extras (noted with an asterisk)   My Grade: D+   DVD Extras: Optional Intro by Al Jourgensen; commentary with Director Zach Passero, Actresses Robin Sydney, Carlee Baker, & actor Justin Stone; 19 & a half minutes of bloopers & deleted scenes*; photo gallery; Advanced trailer* & theatrical trailer* for this film; and Trailers for "The Oracle", "Love me deadly"*, "Blood Sisters", & "Witchery"*
No sequel should work where one needs to see the first to understand the second; the work of the director is to allow first time viewers to understand their goals, missions, and tones of the film without forcing more money out of their hard earned pockets.
If Roger Kumble did such a fancy job on the first Cruel Intentions then why did he do such a bad job on this.
Here's a rundown: Storyline Â much like the first film, which was alright, this one is slow and sparse with no audience relation to the characters or the situations.
Besides, I was 16/17 when I first watched it.
Was this their first movie?
I had just got done watching the first one and popped #2 in.
This review also contains a spoiler of the first movie -- so if you haven't seen either movie and want to but don't want the spoilers, please don't read this review!
While this movie is supposed to be about Christian and Kathryn meeting for the first time, the movie is a poor copy of the first Cruel Intentions.
There are also inconsistencies in the plot - if this were truly the first meeting of Christian and Kathryn, then why is it that Christian fell in love with a girl at the end of the movie?
He supposedly was supposed to be in love for the first time in the original movie (with Reese Witherspoon's character).
If you're casting Errol Flynn in his first western after audiences have accepted him as Robin Hood and Captain Blood, you're not going to make something like Stagecoach.
This is set up in the very first scene, in which a stagecoach and a steam train try to race each other.
Alright normally i am not as harsh on sequels especially if the first film is done well and was ultimately a good movie.
This thing Really ruins the experience of the first one stay way from this.
  When I first started watching this movie last night on Cinemax, I was shocked that it had been made.
That is, if you can get past the fact that Kathryn wasn't blonde in the first film... Then the movie goes on, you see the cheap romantic story from miles ago, and you notice Sebastian has already met an Anette in the past, here called Danielle, and a Cecile, here called Cherie... How original is that for a prequel.
I was a bit confused at first but then I caught on and realized what was going on.
I loved the book its based off of, and I loved the first movie, but I'm not even going to bother with the 3rd movie.
If you've read a review that says that 'If you likes the first one, you'll like the second one' the only reason that is is because IT IS THE EXACT SAME MOVIE!
They took so many lines from the first movie, Its hard to tell which movie you're watching.
The first Cruel Intentions, the original, is my favorite movie of all time.
Sarah Michelle Gellar was perfect in the first movie.
The Sebastian in the first film is devious, deceitful, and much more evil than the Sebastian in the prequel.
It basically goes like this...  1- Sebastian has a bad rep at his first school, so the movie says, although it mentions nothing about him and his dating life, and how he has been with girls 2- Sebastian moves to New York, and just suddenly decides he's going to turn himself around.
And i loved the first one so much.
This movie was so obviously based very much on the first one, and thats OK.
But if I hadn't seen the first one before seeing this, it would have sucked even worse.
The score is the same as in the first one, and it didn't feel like a movie at all...
The plot of Cruel Intentions 2 is very similar to the first film.
Kathryn wanted to make the freshman into the biggest slut in the school, a similar sub-plot to the first film.
There were some dark themes involving sex and drug use in the first film, but in Cruel Intentions 2 tried to make it funny and some of the ideas in the film shouldn't be, such as Kathryn having an affair with a teacher.
The jokes in the film fall flat, whether if it's a verbal gag like 'she goes all moist when she sees you' to a visual gag where Sebastian pushes Kathryn face first into mud.
The story is exactly the same as the first one (even some of the lines), with only a few exceptions.
In the first Cruel Intentions, we are left wondering what motivated the lead characters to become the way they are and act the way they do.
It attempted to mirror the brilliance that was the first one but failed in so many ways.
It only takes away the enjoyment of the first.
If you ask me the first one was really better one.
Second, Sebastian was cute and hot in first movie, now he is "baby face".
Why didn't they make this one first, it is the beginning.
It is not the worst movie I saw, but in compaer with first one its one big, big, big nothing.
In the first film, it is clearly stated that Kathryn and Sebastian never had sex.
And in the first one, Kathryn rejects Sebastian because he fell in love, making him a loser.
Did the writer even see the first film?
Seeing Sebastian become the ass hole he was in the first one could have made an interesting film.
The plot is a cheap rehash of the first, which is weird, since it's supposed to be a prequel, not a sequel.
Pretty much the entire movie seems like a cheap remake of the first, with scenes mimicking the things that happened in the first, only a lot more ridiculous and unlikely.
Where the first had a great cast, this one consist of B-list actors and rejects.
Half of the good lines in the movie are taken directly from the first, as is nearly every major character, including the ones who weren't in the first movie.
However, as these are nowhere near as good as the ones in the first, even this isn't raising it above a rating of 1.
For the first 50 minutes absolutely nothing notable happens in the movie.
The first time I saw this film it really scared Me!The alien is very realistic and the scene where the scientist is operating on the alien's mate is disturbing but yet realistic.I don't want to go any more but I'll tell you this that if you like alien,sci-fi and horror films then check it out!
The public obsession first began proper when the Cannon Film Group released the Sho Kosugi outing, Enter the Ninja in 1984.
Perhaps the pettiest departure from the book was Sharp and Haas' choice to have Dr. Haber say "New York" (instead of "Antwerp") as the phrase that induces George Orr's dreams under hypnosis in their first session.
The first movie version of The Lathe of Heaven was awesome, made for a pittance, and captured the ethereal nature of LeGuin's most enigmatic novel.
Rather than compare apples and oranges, I simply recommend people forget this film, and search for the 1979 Public Television Production-the first film ever made by PBS, and still the most requested item ever for PBS.
The first problem is that there is so little left of the story that much of its impact is missing.
I read it after I saw the first "Lathe of Heaven" on PBS in 1980 and realized that considerable liberties had been taken with the story, although it was much closer to the book than this latest endeavor.
I also wonder why here in the States we had to wait until September of 2002 to see it when the first comments about it, from a viewer in Turkey, are from February!
George falls victim to a well-meaning (at first, anyway) psychotherapist, Dr. Haber, who uses George to remake the universe.
The director boasted that he hadn't seen the first movie nor read the book.
Many of victims of terrorism had their coffin lids screwed shut at their funerals so their families wouldn`t be allowed to see the horrific mutilations they`d suffered , the way they died were even more unforgivable than the fact they died in the first place .
Errol Flynn rides to his first western in this Technicolor movie from 1939.Michael Curtiz' Dodge City is a fantastic western.Flynn plays Wade Hatton who has to safe the city where violence flourishes.It is ran by the villainous Jeff Surrett (Bruce Cabot).He runs the city with the ways of a dictator telling what to do and what to say.The citizens are helpless until Wade comes to safe the day.There is also a lady along.She's Abbie Irving, played by who else but the wonderful Olivia De Havilland.Soon there might be romance that flourishes.Errol Flynn and Olivia De Havilland work great together in this film as they always did.Whether they were in the Sherwood forest or in a western town, there was always chemistry between them.Bruce Cabot makes a fine villain.Alan Hale brings some comedy to the picture playing Rusty Hart.The brilliant Henry Travers is Dr.Irving.I must also mention the kid Bobs Watson, who plays Harry Cole.The scenes with him are the most moving in this film.I really enjoyed this western story.They should make more movies like this today.
The people see Hatton as brave and honest, and want him to accept office as their new Sheriff; he is at first reluctant to do so, but eventually accepts the challenge after a young child is killed in a brawl.
That's why McQ's superiors never wanted him on the case in the first place, as they feared their illegal activities might be exposed if a loose-cannon of a cop like McQ ever caught wind of their plot.
There is also a golf bit that is supposed to be funny - it may have been a little funny the first time but when they pulled the same bit at the end all it did was elicit eye-rolling moans in our little audience.
the thing that got me annoyed with federal protection was that it was completely boring.Armand Assante is first billed yet you hardly really see him in the film Dina Meyer steals most of the film as an annoying smart ass character.
Dodge City was one of the first westerns in color.
The best part of the film was the first five minutes showing an assassination attempt on the President of the United States.
There are so many movies in this world about the first daughter, and considering how few people in the world can relate to the very particular experiences of that group of people, this addition to this 'first family' film genre is just unnecessary.
This was a combination of all of those random generic first daughter films and the mid-90's Meryl Streep wild-water-rafting film "The River Wild".
For the first half of the movie absolutely nothing happens as the filmmakers go out of their way to establish what a mean-spirited jerk Dupea is.
Actually that was established in the first five minutes but they belabor the point to tedious effect.
My first thought when watching this is how did they get such known celebrities to become involved in this.
It is like one of those SNL sketches that may have been humorous for the first 60 seconds or so, but are dragged on and on until the audience is ready to throw pointy objects at the performers just to make them STOP already!
(And only made it the first half hour to be kind to our host that night).
It's a one-gag movie and a poor send-up of a film that was overly precious in the first place.
The most farcical thing about this film is the fact that it was ever made in the first place.
When I first started this movie I had high hopes.
The first five minutes seemed quite funny with Samuel L. Jackson's narration and the promising all-star cast.
But considering there isn't much amusing about penguins in the first place, Saget couldn't do much to make it funnier than the thoughts everyone with any sense of humor whatsoever was thinking while watching March of the Penguins.
Answer: so bad that it makes you want to turn it off after only the first 5 minutes.
ITV are genuinely insulting the viewers intelligence by actually allowing this piece of meaningless drivel to be broadcast.What person decided this waste of time to be deemed fit for public consumption?Surely after the rock bottom ratings for the first series it would have acted as a dose of cold,hard reality to ITV and make them execute this monstrosity but alas it was unleashed on the poor public again.
There are 6 full pages of positive testaments to this film, so I don't expect this to be a popular decision, but I've awarded one point for awful for the first time ever on IMDb.Someone actually compared this movie to "What About Bob"....Blasphemy!
5 - A very young Olivia de Havilland at her prettiest  This was one of the first westerns to feature a well-known actor, helping to give the genre a boost in reputation.
Vicente Blasco Ibanez's novel "Sangre y arena", first filmed as a silent with Rudolph Valentino in 1922, gets the most prestigious treatment 20th Century-Fox could deliver, complete with Spanish music adornments, gorgeous color photography, and some outdoor locations which could certainly pass for Spain.
Since this was Flynn's first of eight westerns, Warner Brothers felt it necessary to explain his Aussie accent by saying he was an international soldier of fortune from Ireland.
Olivia DeHavilland hated this when it was first being made.
He was married in a Catholic Church, sent his daughter to a Catholic school, and we see her receive her first Communion.
This was Errol Flynn's first film and it was made before he made it to Hollywood.
It just goes to show you that first impressions don't always mean anything!
I think Joe Eszetheras got out his first draft of Basic Instinct and gave this to the producers and they loved it.
It was probably funny when they first met on the set after all that time.
The first is that Linda Fiorentino is very well cast as Trina Gavin who just oozes an understated smouldering sexuality , she's far better than than Sharon Stone in BASIC INSTINCT and a million miles better than Madonna in BODY OF EVIDENCE .
When I was a kid I used to like the original first American Tail film, but then they started making straight-to-video sequels.
To prove that first impressions aren't always everything, we also have Errol Flynn giving his screen debut, in a performance that doesn't show any signs of the charisma and appeal Flynn would have only two years later in "Captain Blood".
Review of An American Tale (Gone Western): I didn't like the first and original film based on the same characters.
Horribly one sided, this propaganda piece spouts the supposed merits of inoculations (whill conveniently NOT telling that those same shots can in some instances be MORE harmful than what they innoculate against) I learned of THAT travesty first hand and it's a bitch.
As the second cinematic presentation of the 1789 mutiny aboard the BountyÂthe first was also made in Australia in 1916Âthis film is required viewing for anyone interested in that historical chapter.
A pre-credits crawl announces the documentary and travelogue endeavor, to follow in the Bounty's wake: promising this is the first of a series from Expeditionary Films that should also entertain.
Errol Flynn in his first film is barely recognizable in that role at this point.
Here the movie shifts from reconstruction of historical events to become the first motion picture event to document the mutineer's haven of Pitcairn Island.
This second half of the dual narrative strategy is vastly more successful than the first and gives IN THE WAKE OF THE BOUNTY its timeless quality.
I remember watching it when it first came out.
The first and foremostest was all the jabberwocky about codes.
After the initial nostalgia of watching a VHS for the first time in years, having found this video amongst my parents collection of videos, there is nothing much else to say in the way of enjoying oneself watching this film.
I should first point out that this is a review from a person who prior to seeing the film read the book; an excellent and gripping thriller.
The only interest is in seeing Errol Flynn in his first movie role.
He was the undisputed leader of the team that took the initial Polish work to break the Enigma Code, broke subsequent variations (such as for the naval Enigma machines) and automated the whole thing by creating one of the world's first computers called BOMBE.
Jane Powell appears as herself in her first film, playing a beleagured child star, who escapes and joins a youth hostel to pick vegetables and fruits (Don't ask!!!)
I originally purchased this film on video from a well known chain store without first seeking any kind of recommendation.
All I will say is that if you are going to do a film about football violence then at least do your research first.
In the first part, alien Meeko is endlessly tortured and mutilated by American scientists while his pal Nukie wanders around South Africa and mutters.
In the third part, Meeko is first hypnotized by, then befriends a talking computer, while Nukie disco dances.
The plot in the first half the movie consists of Meeko SCREAMING back to Nukie for help, and replying to the doctors about how "Tranquilzers kill him".
Honestly, when I finally finished this movie I felt like dying(it took me a while because I watched about the first half hour and needed to stop on account of the utter idiocy of this movie).
It was hard to imagine when I first watched this just how devastating the hysteria over Satanic Ritual Abuse was to families and communities during the 1990s.
i don't know what to comment about,there's nothing in the movie to comment about the first half was a teen-movie the second half was worse(the cave scene was okay) burrow scene was pointless(actually i found the entire movie pointless) there was no emotion in the end scene and the dumbledore's death scene(i was happy dumbledore was dead and the torcher movie was over) ginny weasley is given way too much importance(she hides the HBP's book and not harry) and i cannot imagine lavender blabbering about ron in front of the teachers let alone the headmaster dumbledore asks harry about his feelings for hermione there is plenty of these idiotic scenes,i don't understand how so many gave it 10/10 this might be the worst movie i have ever seen,shame IMDb doesn't have a 0/10 rating
This is actually the first movie that I have ever been to where a person near me was actually SLEEPING through most of the movie.
HP:OOtP was his first HP movie and, at the time, was my worst one.
The movie should have stayed true to the book wherein the first scene started with the Muggle Prime Minister being introduced to the new Minister of Magic and while he was being told about the ministry and how resent catastrophe were magic related....scenes o death eaters destroying the bridge, etc should have been background scene and not, not what was shown in the movie.
The first Harry Potter movie is so far the best for me.
The first battle is around 1 minute and shows just NOTHING!
I believe they left some for the first part of the Deadly Hallows, but then again this sixth movie was completely unnecessary and pointless.
Unfortunately our friendly writers decided that it would be wise to alter the first kiss of the future Mr. and Mrs. Potter.
I loved the essence of the first two films, but when Alfonso Cuaron took over as the director of Prisoner of Azkaban, it seems more and more material had been cut from the books on which they are based.
Prisoner of Azkaban was the first and some key sequences were eliminated.
The first two Harry Potter movies were able to capture the essence of the books perfectly.
Glen Morgan and James Wong came up with a great teleplay here - after a darkly humorous teaser, where we discover that the seemingly priggish, uptight-about-swear-words members of a PTC in New Hampshire are in fact a bunch of Satan-worshippers, the story begins as a worthy entry in the bad-things-happening-to-teenagers-in-the-woods genre which was especially popular in the first two seasons of the show.
The only slim ray of hope (because hope springs eternal) left for the next movies is that they include what they missed out in HBP at the start of the first seventh one.
Suddenly, the love story did not seem to dominate as much as it did on my first viewing.....Honestly, I never really thought that changing the way I approached the movie would work, but it did.
It was the first time I have seen an audience actually fall asleep during a Harry Potter movie and after the ending, only two people clapped.
With the exception of Dumbledore's first meeting w/ Tom & Tom asking about how to make Horcruxes, all of the background was left out.
I watched the first two, so I have to finish the trilogy, that's the way I am for better or worse, in this case the latter.
Now there's nothing wrong with that, but when you set her up as absolutely hating blacks in the first one, you stick to the character no matter how despicable.
The rap against the first two Ginger films (besides the obvious fact that they are misogynistic in the extreme) is that if you took away the sadism, bondage, rape and acres of young nubile flesh on display you would have a pretty bad movie.
Anyway when seeing this when it first came out it already seemed dated & cheesy.
I ask, and not for the first time: Where a part requires an actor to speak in a regional accent, can we please have an actor who is capable of delivering that accent accurately, even if the actor is hitherto unknown, rather than some "big name" actor who is happy to earn a large pay packet for insulting viewers with a puerile attempt at the accent.
This overly long film was based on one of Jack Higgins first novels, He has written many books since & nearly all of them have been far better.
This is such a creepy episode for me even years after having seen it the first time, which is rare for me as most of the episodes I used to be creeped out by are now pretty mild.
I was not very impressed by this production; first the Nautilus looked like a whale and the interiors were so cheap looking you would think they were plastic and cardboard.
From the very first scene where the US Navy comes looking for Professor Aronax and the daughter says I'm not sure we can help you I have a Biology degree and my father has a degree in Oceanography.
The best thing can say about this film is that for the first 20 minutes or so, I didn't realize that I was watching a made-for-TV movie.
Now if you think of Peter Lorre as Prof. Arronax assistant in the 1954 version and consider what you get instead, a girl with an ugly haircut, this is the first big disappointment.
Of the cast, Magimel has the 'cute' of Cassel (from the first) but not his charisma.
Olivier Dahan tries to build on the success of the first 'Rivieres pourpres' and brings back Jean Reno in a second series which has little in common with the first film, unfortunately.
The film was shot by a first time director in an abandoned shopping mall.
It's hardly gore, false scares or daft teenagers... heck, there's some of all of that within the first five minutes, *and* gratuitous nudity to boot(something that is a rarity in the newer slashers, but somewhat dominant of the older ones, or so I've been told).
This is supposed to be the first Norwegian slasher.
It is the first norwegian movie to be worse than Dis, that's it.
At least, it's the first horror movie that made me cry...of laughter!
Superior to the first two movies, anyway.
The film maintains a good deal of tension for the first half.
And what's more, the first hour of SOMETIMES THEY COME BACK... FOR MORE isn't even about resurrecting Satan.
The action is quite good at first but then , towards the ending, it looks like a cheap footage from typical direct to video mediocrity.
"Sometimes They Come Back...for More" is a fairly routine and forgettable horror film that offers literally nothing new.The first half is actually interesting,but after it the film goes quickly downhill.Two military officers(played by Clayton Rohner and Chase Masterson)set out to investigate a remote Antarctica based governmental outpost where a mysterious occurrence has killed crew members.The only survivors are a medical officer(Faith Ford)and a tech officer(Max Perlich).Before long,the bodies are discovered all over the place.
Equally as apparent was who was going to end up with whom (and this is coming from the very first shot this person was on screen.)
It has a lot of problems; first of all, the scenario is not original and is slow-pacing.
I am less interested in heroics than I am interested in people (not just soldiers but them too) thinking about why we are in such places as Somalia in the first place.
This was the same problem with 'We Were Soldiers', where all of the storyline was condensed into the first 30 minutes, freeing the remaining screen-time to be dedicated to nothing but non-stop gratuitous violence.
Unfortunately I did miss the first quarter of an hour.
This first screenplay by Robert Desiderio is very commendable,  He is from TV & so are all of the other actors.
Of course you could ask the producers why this supposedly first mission of 007 is set in 2006 and if that means they have dared to completely write off 44 years and 20 films that allowed them to make this one, but their response will probably be "Do we look like we give a damn?".
I first discovered Bond as a child in awe of the magic of the films of old.I consumed them all, cheered for Bond and indulged in these adventures.
Just like everyone else, when I first saw that Daniel Craig was to replace Pierce Brosnan in the role, I was a bit confused.
But at the very first frame of the film,my original skepticism re-emerged:  The opening scene happens in a sombre black and white cold war setting in which Bond makes no spectacular entrance, chatting with his enemy and finishing the mission with his fists inside a...dirty public restroom.
If I wasn't with a bunch of other friends at the theater, I would have walked out after the first ten minutes and got my refund before it was too late.
I feel sorry for Anna Friel, first the show that she is absolutely adorable in gets cancelled, then the final episode is almost as bad as the final episode of Seinfeld, then what could have been a great movie for her career - the only other real character in a major Will Ferrell comedy - turns out to be a terrible, stinking turd of a flick.
Speaking of the T-Rex, I remember being 10 years old and going to the movies to see "Jurassic Park" for the first time.
Besides that point, the comedy, which most people probably wanted to see in this movie in the first place, produced a few light chuckles, but that's about it.
"Land of the Lost" is another in a long line of old TV shows lazily packaged into summer movies, too dumbed-down for fans of the original show and nothing all that memorable for those younger viewers coming into it for the first time.
"Land of the Lost" is just lost, misguided in every way, starting with even deciding to make the movie in the first place.
It deserves to be shunned and left to be the summer's first big box-office bomb.
The CGI effects are terrible, many plot holes from the first film are unanswered and French Stewart fails to capture the same quality performance that Broderick achieved as Gadget.
When I first knew that French Stewart was playing Inspector Gadget, I thought, "great!".
I thought when I saw the first version, he would have played a much better character than Matthew Broderick.
However, my excitement turned to disappointment during the first few minutes of Inspector Gadget 2.
The first film was a disappointing and mediocre film, but actually was reasonably entertaining.
There has been the general impression that the sequel is better than the first film, but I can't agree.
The script was very very weak, and even lower in laughs than the first film.
What is so screwed is is that the Claw from the first one is no longer there.
Overall, its worse than the first.
I thought that the first was bad enough, but when I saw this I was shocked.
The only reason I rented this movie was to see if it was worse than the first, which sucked.
I didn't find the first few scenes of the movie fit in particularly well with the rest of the tone, but it was a minor annoyance.
I am sure that the idea of getting your son his first major role was an important selling point, but did you even read the script (assuming there was one) before you agreed to get involved with this?
It was a nice first effort, I suppose, but so many scenes didn't mesh well with each other and apparently everyone speaks German.
I love it when Tom and Jerry get away from their usual domestic setting to cause havoc somewhere new, and the seaside proves to be the ideal locale for plenty of inventive mayhem and violent hi-jinx: the cat and mouse get in trouble with a cantankerous crab, who is keen to use his pincers on the duo whenever possible; Jerry gets Tom to swallow sand, break his teeth on a shell sandwich, and leap head first onto a wooden post (which the cat is tricked into thinking is a drowning woman); Jerry is launched from a soda bottle into the sea; and Tom swallows an inflatable horse.
After the first 10 minutes (which included Mr Bloom feeling himself up in his bed) I just couldn't stand much more.
Raitos cautious nature has been completely ignored with him blatantly bringing out his deathnote in a crowd full of people to write names in it in the very first scene showing him!
Just think about itÂ So that's what I can say about first 30 minutes of this film.
You may consider it as review of Retrograde's first 30 minutes.
Even the female doctor ( one of the villain in the movie) discovered that the homework is unusual at the first glance( why, L!
If they'd have treated the movie separately it might have been better but as it stands it's just a blatant excuse to cash in on the good will generated by the first 2 Death Note movies which I thought were excellent....
The FX are strong for a Japanese film, and are actually slightly more advanced than those of the first two films.
I loved the first couple of seasons of the TV show and I love Paris!
Here's my plot spoiler: successful couple, man gets on coke, loses job, does more coke, loses marriage, house, does more coke, loses everything else, does more coke, loses everything else else that wasn't in the first everything else, does more coke... the end.
I saw this movie when it first came out, over 20 years ago, and have continuously referred to it as the worst movie ever made.
I was at the first show, eagerly awaiting a new film by the director of Ju-on.
But this one came first.
Beautifully shot, atmospheric in places and all that, but artistically inert after the first twenty minutes and no more enjoyable than countless films that cover similar ground with much more panache and cinematic touch.
The first VAMPIRES was fun, but this low budget retread makes me yawn.
If you've seen the first VAMPIRES, you've already seen this, and done much better.
And just like the first VAMPIRES, this one also has the vampires-bursting-into-flames special effect.
I only rented this because i loved the first movie.
I quiet like the first movie, but can't say I enjoy this one very much.
Stick to the first "Vampires", it's a good movie.
FINAL VERDICT: Not anywhere near as good as the first Vampire movie.
The first vampires was good ... and it was the only vampires.
I never saw the first film but this one doesn't stand up on its own merits, there are several unconvincing plot twists and the viewer is never made aware of the importance of the lead female vampire.
In fact thats what attracted me to the DVD case in the first place.
I probably would have bought it anyway being such a big horror fan and having enjoyed the first Vampires title so much.
I know the first Vampires being set in New Mexico wasn't exactly the twilight zone in terms of creepiness but yet it still managed to be dark and foreboding when it needed to be.
There is no wow factor in knowing this is the master of all master - the original vampire, as in the first film.
The Gavin who first appeared at the beginning at the film was different from the man whose death was being Mourned at the end of the film.
This is the first movie i have seen that references the job the dogs and dog handlers did in Vietnam.
This is actually the first film I have watched and thought what??
I had a hard time staying interested after the first 30-45 minutes.
This movie was supposed to be the first of a series of movies with JOAN BLONDELL and MELVYN DOUGLAS playing the same man and wife parts, but BLONDELL opted out and another actress took her place.
At first this seemed like an enjoyable film with a good premise but it quickly becomes clear that the storyline is being manufactured in a wholly predictable, and more than a little, unbelievable way.
I love Dragon Ball Z but the first three movies they produced were not great.
Edwards is reduced to using Greta Garbo and Mae West as his examples; Garbo was just breaking into American cinema and West was three years away from making her first picture.
Unfortunately, in this case, the 'earlier seasons' means the first half of the first season, so I'm only giving it a 2.
In the first look itself, the stranger looks creepy, but for her (Who is mad on her husband) he is like her brother.
The woman in this film is put through an ordeal because she had the audacity to leave her husband, Hamill's mother was a psychopath (Hamill's sister had an affair with him), another female victim talks back to her boyfriend and the first female victim is shrewish, hence these women are either killed or put through an ordeal.
Linda Evans re-appears in this "Gambler" sequel dressed in another cowboy outfit.This black cloth outfit is unlike her first cowboy outfit she wore in her first "Gambler" episode.
I remember liking this movie when I first watched it but when I bought both DVD's of The Ring and Ring 2 I actually fell asleep, and I've never fallen asleep during a movie.
A good two hour drive from the place where they almost perished under the hand of the creepy Cousin It ghost in the first film, Rachel is looking to start a new life.
Unfortunately, while her performance is bearable up until the climax (and definitely not during the climax), her character is so freaking stupid it's amazing she doesn't die in the first five minutes.
He was okay in the first "Ring" and I liked him in "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," but he is ridiculously God-awful in this sequel.
The first twenty minutes are mildly engaging, although even then it was quite apparent things were only going to get worse.
Boring, stupid and hardly scary, this is not a good first step for Nakata in Hollywood.
This is definitely a sequel that you MUST see the first one to understand the second one and this is a sequel u DON'T NEED TO SEE.
They discarded the whole premise of the story after the first 15 minutes, the tape if you're wondering.
Please if the sequel is not gonna connect with the first film, don't make it.
It shamefully exists only for the sake of milking another $10 out of the poor saps who enjoyed (or understood) the first film.
I had no expectations for this movie, but say what you will about the first film - it did maintain a creepy tone through most of its running time, and its goofy psychobabble was at least palatable in the whatever-it-takes-to make-this-work mode.
Soon though, the undead spirit from the first film reappears to lie claim to Rachel's son through a series of not-entirely-understandable "shock" sequences that lead to a cyclical revelation of horror repeating itself.
Yes, it's only a movie, but the resulting "product" does the unconscionable: it rips it's audience off and sends them out the other side poorer and less entertained - suckered in by the goodwill earned from the first film.
The first film was truly scary, and kept you on the edge of your seat, and when the end came it ripped you out of your seat.
First, I thought the premise from the first movie was that in order to save yourself, you had to make a copy of the videotape.
Also, the whole premise of the first movie was that it was watching the videotape that caused death.
All in all, first half of the movie was very good, lots of tension; it just didn't seem to be able to sustain the plot or the horror.
The Ring Two joins the new breed of "Who-dun-it" mysteries... "Who-dun-it first".
For example: Creepy Kids... Who-dun-it first?
But most of all Who-dun-the-entire-movie first?
The first Ring movie was deep.
With all the things that went on during the first Ring movie, there was nothing left for the Ring Two to do but MORE cheap thrills in between borrowed gags from other thrillers and horror flicks.
Conveniently the son of Rachel from the first ring.
The opening sequence, for example, could've been a moment in the movie that all moviegoers will remember just like in the first Ring, but instead it was in short... stupid.
Everything is either recycled from the first movie or reused from other movies.
The Ring Two dangerously ruins the mystery behind the first movie which should've been left alone.
I loved the first movie.
Like the first movie, the plot throws you many scenes that are made to scare, but simply do not live up to expectations.
I'm not sure what the answer is to that perplexing question, all I know is that this is about as much of a true dichotomy from the first.
But if you can get past the regression of the story, then what is even more disturbing is that there is nothing remotely disturbing, interesting or scary about the film, and everything that was freaky about Samara in the first one is now like watching Scooby Doo and mystery of Samara.
But suffice to say that everything that made the first such a paradigm for years to come, has vanished in this one.
One wonders if they couldn't find horses to continue the story from the first movie so they figured fake deer was the way to go for part 2.
If you hated the first one, this one will make you wish you were stricken blind by burning embers before you put the DVD in.
If you liked the first one, this will make you mourn for a half decent story and a film that doesn't induce bile production.
Did no one who made this mess ever see the first Ring movie?
Having Rachel thinking at the end of the movie that the only way to stop Samara is to seal the well...wasn't she the one in the first one who un sealed it?
The kids in the first movie watched the tape at the cabin and then went back to their homes and I doubt that they left a forwarding address for Samara to find them.
I could go on and on with the HOLES in this POS movie....I was a big fan of the first Ring and also the original RINGU, but this was just TRASH!
Sure it made 36 million the first week...but I bet it will fall so fast you will hear the studio heads spinning.
The film follows Rachel Keller into Oregon where she tries to forget the events of the first one, but then Samara shows up wanting a mommy... and that is the point of the film.
This film honestly has no guts, spunk, or attitude that the first film had.
You've got to compare then because the first one sucks and the latter one is great; because the cast of the first one is way superior to the latter one'sÂ   I like Ryan Phillippe is a starring role: I liked "Cruel Intentions" and very much liked "Antitrust".
The jellyfish is perfect and hasn't needed to evolve since the seas were first poured out, the hapless bears, however, have come to rely on the ice that us selfish humans are now using to chill our Budweiser.
and the plot..... first off we find our so called 'heroes' in a dojo with their trainer 'white Dragon' but they don't know he is white dragon, they are being informed of white dragon foiling robbers and such.
this sparked my attention because later in the movie they saw white dragon on a Japanese comic, they were wondering who he was, even though they were informed of him in the first FIVE MINUTES of the movie.
I'll outline the plot first.
Same characters appear as worker's in the hospital and the first aid in the ambulance.
Lets just say after I watched the first three minutes it was already off.
We almost fell on the ground when we first found out who the evil boss is.
So how is it a favour to those people to give them a car that will need ultra-security to prevent it from being stolen within the first two days?
"Pardon Us" was the first full-length film featuring the comedy duo of Laurel and Hardy.
Bugs also seems excessively brash and obnoxious in this cartoon, from his loud "Am I the first to arrive" routine at the beginning of the cartoon to his frenzied cat-calling at the end.
By the way, I took an instant dislike to Montgomery when I first saw him in "Mr. And Mrs. Smith", and his performance in "June Bride" did nothing to alter my opinion.
Really, the only interesting thing about the film is the director's first name.
Impossible to believe that someone put up money for the Tv series after seeing this, yet surely this is the first time that a TV show is better than the film that inspired it.
At first look it's "Egads not that kind of stuff again!"
The first scene shows Emily Eden (Griffith)and her partner in front of a club, reminiscing about their "rock" days, and how bad they are.
Lumet is dealing with a number of problems here, first and foremost among them a meandering script that can't quite decide what its main storyline should be.
The first time Simon, who is warped back to the past, sees himself getting involved in a struggle with his brother, which leads to Peter's unfortunate death.
This is a haunting movie with a really nice, twisted plot, a lot of suspense (especially in the first part of the movie), overall decent acting (I thought the character of Anna and the guy waiting for a heart transplantation were done especially well), but rather uninspired music (although the sound effects are nicely done).
I think I have to go with the first.
In particular the first half hour drags itself along, and you just don't have a clue about what kind of film you're watching.
Those people are greatly disappointed when they after a first introduction action scene, are turned back to calm scenes in the description of the Arn's childhood and youth.
This would have given a brilliant drama movie with lots of conspiracies, political plots and a description of the forces that was between the rivaling families (as described in the first book).
My similar great disappointment of this first movie is thus inevitably coloring my comment posted here.
In fact, the first time that I tried to watch it, the two guys in the room revolted within the first 15 minutes and refused to watch any more.
this only shows that the twist is a poor gimmick that's easy to fall for at first, but when you rewind the movie in your head in light of it, you find it just doesn't work and the whole movie just doesn't make sense.
Renting a movie that looks well-done on a tight budget by a first time director or someone new to the scene.
One is a good first effort by a novice director.
When I first read about this film I thought I would enjoy, It looked offbeat and has an excellent cast.
first of all, the story was not great, though a pregnant godzilla was a nice twist.
The city is evacuated and the military attempt to kill Godzilla, first luring it out with a huge pile of fish (the creature's staple diet).
And to a lesser extent, MEMENTO, which is fun on the first watch, but bored me on the second, since no new clues are revealed.
I was also interested in seeing Pepe Bojorquez's first film.
But let me first focus on the positive aspects: the cinematography.
A prime example is the scene towards the start of the film where Harold first smashes up O'Brien's straw boater.
The same strong leads (JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson) return, and I give this movie credit for not simply making a carbon copy of the first film the way so many sequels do, but this film is DOA.
Not one moment in the film comes close to rivaling any number of thrilling moments in the first one.
It's quite gross and would perfectly fit in a goofier monster flick, but the POLTERGEIST franchise was supposed to be a more sophisticated horror enterprise, and the remaining sequels just mercilessly ravage what made the first film so good.
I couldn't help but wonder what JoBeth Williams and Craig T Nelson felt while making this sequel, an obvious decline in all areas from the first film, from the rather embarrassing plot to the dialogue they are forced to endure.
The first two-thirds of "The I Inside" are fantastic: very intriguing and engaging, recalls "The Butterfly Effect", "Jacob's Ladder" and "identity", just to mention three similar movies.
The poor family from the first Poltergeist film think they're safe, after having moved and thrown out the TV.
All talk about how the family must stick together feels strange considering that one of the kids from the first film isn't in this one, and no explanation is given either (yes, I know the actress was killed shortly after the first one - but still...).
Containing none of the chills and thrills of the first this lame movie goes nowhere slowly.The final act is poor too.The cast look as bored as i was.im suprised this ever got to a third movie.a very bad sequal.avoid.1 out of 10
After the events that occur in the first film, the Freeling family is living with Grandma.
So with help with a Indian guide and dead Grandma the family must battle a ghostly cult that was buried under their old block of land in the first film that will stop at nothing to get what they want.
This film basically sets up what we already saw in the first film, with an opening that's rather interesting, but it suddenly falls into the original's formula with some idea's being changed around (It's no longer the TV, but a toy phone that's the medium to the spiritual world) and a feeling of deja vu.
Some problems that the film faced are that there are too much dwelling on what happened in the first film, the film's pace is quite slow, rather humourless, some rather meaningless scenes, a lot of talking that has no real interest and overall it's rather a pointless sequel with no meaning to the narrative when it finally finishes.
However, the first film wasn't all that great and this one isn't a complete washout either.
The story is modified somewhat from the first episode so that now the source of the poltergeist unrest is attributed to the dead followers of a cult leader, as opposed to the dead disturbed by unscrupulous property developers.
Although it's a well documented fact that the actress who played her, Dominique Dunne, was murdered shortly after the first film was released, I still don't think it would have trashed her memory to have explained her absence; quite the opposite in fact.
The older daughter from the first movie is missing and no attempt is made to explain her absence.
The first movie was really good- it held your attention, had interesting effects, and had some very scary, eerie sequences.
It has a few okay moments whenever the main monster shows up (He first appears after Coach vomits him up!).
We begin by meeting the freeling family after the events of the first movie (homeless and living with jobeth Williams' mother), after an absurd opening featuring shamans and Indians and excavating... until carol Anne sees a mysterious figure at the mall, which turns out to be Reverend Henry Kane, who wants Carol Anne.
If curiosity is still getting the better of you, watch the first 5 minutes and you'll know what I'm talking about.
The film ain't much better, on the plus side the CGI effects are first rate, from ships to Lightsabers, the extras in their Stormtrooper costumes look the part (at times), made for 20 grand, doesn't look it, they should really stop boasting about this , there's a lot of film makers who could make a very good feature for the same amount, I'm a star wars fan, and love watching the fan movies, but I've seen far better done with far less.
I do have to agree that the acting is the weak point, but I think one has to be at least a bit forgiving of that, due to this being a production done gratis by a group of Star Wars fans, likely acting in front of a green screen for the first time in their lives.
Even first Star Wars movies are better.
The direction was the second worst part of the movie (the first being the actors), i guess some people have no artistic vision.
I went to see this movie with several co-workers when it first came out in 1988.
The first few minutes are a stong indication of the absurdity to follow and one does get a perverse twinge of anticipation, can this movie carry on to be so bad?
I give a show a 3 if I really enjoyed it for the first year or two, but then found it growing stale, stopped planning to watch it, and eventually turned it off when I accidentally ran across it.
In this case, it would be more accurate to say that it's the film itself that unravels, except that it is never together enough in the first place to do so.
In defense of Gibson, it should be pointed out that this was his first attempt as a writer/director, which is no easy undertaking even for a seasoned professional.
The film is notable for the fact that it was written by and stars Jacinto Molina; also known as Paul Naschy, who is apparently a big name in Spanish horror cinema, although this the first film that I've seen from him.
Establishing the character of Rodya is the first and foremost thing in any production of "Crime and Punishment", no matter how restrained the time or budget might be.
It was destroyed within the first five minutes.
One of Dario Argento's first writing credits and one that he probably doesn't put on his resume.
The men are, a Bluto-like strongman, a grizzled dynamite expert (who when we first meet him is a suave card shark, but for the rest of the film he looks like a hobo, like they abandoned his original characterization), a Samurai (who is so tan he looks more South American), a young Jim Morrison looking acrobat, and `The Dutchman' Peter Graves.
Was the year when first Starship Troopers came out... Man, when I watch it now, it is strong as it was then... Good story, good CGI, good acting... That film was entirely good.
Then 2004. came out second Starship Troopers... and I thought to myself " This is some lame try to make more money on the fame of first movie."
The movie like first Starship Troopers where he did a decent job.
The bugs have been brutally destroyed in every possible way, i remember the good old days from the first movie, when a bug was so intent on killing its prey that it would try by all means to kill it, focusing solely on it and nothing else.
I remember when i first saw the original starship troopers movie.
It was terrible, i consider it a monumental feat that i even watched the whole thing in the first place.
This movie is possibly the worst movie i have EVER seen, as the first one is one of my favorite sci-fi films of all time i have been bitterly disappointed twice so far !please save yourself the same heart ache and just watch the first Starship Troopers again while imagining in your own mind the endless possibilities they could of embraced to build open, then if you really must, watch the second and third films and see how it was completely and utterly screwed up.
2) You don't expect anything philosophical from a Starship Troopers movie but the lines are at best copied from the first movie.
Really, far, far, far away from the first "Starship Troopers".
"...give me a break, it is simply a terrible rip off from the first "Starship Troopers".
But the worst thing in the movie, its definitely Casper Van Dien, trying to do a though character...but he fail 100%..  Im a Starship Trooper first flick fan, sincerely, this Starship 3: Marauder in my opinion is a bad movie.
Rico's friends must now first save Rico, and then mount a covert rescue operation deep into enemy territory.
Haven't seen the second installment in the series, but the first one, the original based on Heinlein's novel, is really good.
Now I wasn't going into this film expecting something great (like the original starship troopers) and I wasn't expecting something completely garbage (like starship troopers 2); so my feelings were neutral (best when watching a movie for the first time).
The main problem with this film is it actually tries to be faithful to the first one and that's not good.
The first Starship Troopers was made by Paul Verhoveven, a guy not as clever or smart as he thinks he is.
One of its selling points was the return of Casper Van Diem, the star of the first movie.
Van Diem shows up for the first few minutes and is seen for two minutes in the middle and then 5 minutes at the end.
The first movie at least knew to throw us a battle scene every 10 minutes to keep us from losing interest.
This one not having anywhere near the budget of the first can't and we're stuck with people trying to act with a poor script.
Other then that the film is an attempt to be a sequel to an overrated first film done by people with even less talent and money.
I enjoyed the first one but this sequel is just terrible.
Having the actor from the first one (Rico) helped a little to watch this movie (not that he is a good actor).
The film is boring with Jonny Rico being the only character returning from the first film.
No beetle-like bugs, no grasshopper-like bugs, only arachnids and other new bugs that was never in the first film.
Last scene is too childish and unlike the first film, no detailed shot of a arachnid being gunned down is shown.
Watching this it was hard to believe that the writer/Director was the same screenplay writer for the first Starship troopers movie.
It's better then the 2nd(not saying much), but very disappointing for those of us who really enjoy the first one and the spirit of the series.
I still remember that evening when I first borrowed "DIL CHAHATA HAI" CD secretly on the way back from mathematics coaching & very excited to watch it because my sister watched it two days ago & highly praised.
So, without diverting any further with my past numerous hidden movie experiences, when I first watched it, I was simply dazzled by the beauty of the movie.
Tough to be the first guy in the posse if your third guy in line is shooting at a moving target in front of you.
I first saw this film 5 years ago as a University student when it originally came out.
I recently saw this film again, and I remembered again why I loved it SO much the first time.
But what it shows also is that true friendship can overcome many an adversity, misunderstanding, and even time.The first movie about "Male-bonding" to come out of Bollywood!
This is where we see what happened to the characters we met in the first part.
In the newer disaster flicks the black person has jumped from being one of first victims or gang member to now being one of the bigwigs.
I am happy that I saw it in one sitting because I believe this had to be a 2 night movie when it first aired.
Especially after watching the first 20 minutes or so, I was preparing my "you don't know what you're talking about" speech.
I'll do my best not to give anything away here: the first 40 minutes I found entertaining and downright creative.
A movie with a bad ending like this one is kind of like trying Pepsi One: The concept is intriguing, and at first it doesn't seem half-bad.
But the horrible aftertaste left in its wake ultimately doesn't make it worth trying in the first place.
At first, people think "Professor Adams" has gone fishing; and, in a sense, he has.
I'm just going to get this out of the way first.
For instance, in the first one third part of the film, Captain Kirk and Sergeant O'Brien find a giant pizza-faced mouse in a manhole of the old factory, and the Sergeant says OH, MY GOD!
This is the kind of movie that a first year film student should have been able to make.
I'm glad I didn't watch this series until first catching "Studio 60 On the Sunset Strip", which is basically just a re-tread and re-imagining of "SN".
As it is, the film lights up the moment this dazzling hunk makes his first appearance as a clerk behind a tobacconist's counter, and the entire first half of the film that's gone before seems like a hopeless waste.
I have to admit, that first season of Monk was really amazing - original, interesting, entertaining and I was always looking forward to the next episode.
Second season was very good, not as good as first one, but still kept the high level.
From the very first episode, the show has treated OCD as a joke, a comical disorder, easily dismissed and therefore easily mocked.
And packing the first season DVD set with a moist towelette... what a stroke of sensitivity from the marketing guys at USA.
It is about as riveting and exciting as finding that someone has emptied a trash can on your doorstep the first thing in the morning.
While "Psych" is a clever and original show that does fresh and funny things every week, "Monk" is an unintelligent show that ran out of fresh and funny things after the first few episodes.
It was kinda funny the first, third, and tenth times, but eight seasons of it is appalling.
On first viewing, I thought this film was intriguing, but after several viewings in the interim years, it becomes more laughable and comedic than worthy of intense reflection or serious attention.
I recently viewed this film for the first time and found it to be intriguing if not especially satisfying.
They must have gone to a mall and just signed up the first 10 people who said "yes" to the question:"Hey how'd you like to be in a movie"?
The first type, we call them intellectuals, they use their intelligence and logic to explain this world, maybe they got a totally wrong answer, but at least they used the right way(reason) to explain it.
Dil Chahta Hai was an amazing movie for me when I first saw it...and it's still one of my favorites.
I was actually squirming while watchin it repeating "no no no"... And finally just had to end its misery after the first hour.
His first mistake was picking Ice Cube.
This movie didn't have much going for it in the first place and with Mr. Carpenter flubbing this one up I don't know what is happening to his once great talents.
I guess it might have worked as a action movie, but then you would have to sit or sleep through the first half of the film.  
One of the first things one notices is the fashion of 2176.
I almost swallowed my icecream scoop when I first heard him, then I just laughed myself into a coma.
For the first time in a few months, I left this movie theatre feeling I had been entertained.
One might argue this was the first experience of a "blockbuster" film by contemporary Russian TV producers - I regret they have not realized that they should better shoot their TV-series crap than to spoil the perception of the great Russian cinema.
If you're reading this, then you're probably a fan of Park's previous films and like me have seen the first two films in his revenge trilogy (Sympathy for Mr Vengeance & Old Boy).
"Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance," by the same director in the first of the vengeance trilogy, contained meaningful violence with character and story development.
(Not the first half hour, that's the slowest damn beginning I've ever seen.)
This was possibly the first Hindi movie where the young generation of India was so realistically depicted and because of that I can relate to this very much as a young man.
This is the first time I've ever written in these comments - I just wanted to warm someone else before they lose an hour and a half of their life.
Here's what went wrong: first and most glaringly, the era.
I saw this when it first came out and didn't know quite what to make of it.
Then they show the first ever pagers, which are considerably larger and more limited than today's models.
I've heard (positive things) about Arturo Ripstein before, but this is his first film I've seen.
She has already been set up as extremely unsympathetic from the first few scenes, leading up to the one with her own daughter and son, thus the scene with a replacement "daughter" just doesn't wash at all.
The first thing what I want to say, I am A REALLY BIG FAN of Herbie 'cause I was grow up on his films, I loved the jokes the tricks, the music and the characters-even the evil ones-and I'll love the "Herbie Movies" as long as I live.
And Sapna was killed in the first half , wasn't she?
Terribly first weeks numbers; only some 27.000 people went to see the film on the weekend.
And there is also for Peter as for Thomas nothing more as a filmmaker then their very funny first movies.
Its first rate comedy and very enjoyable, but you feel rather like a customer in a restaurant whose been presented with their main course and desert on the same place - nauseated.
For hardcore noir enthusiasts the first half an hour is really worth viewing, then turn the TV off.
The first 30 to 40 minutes made me think this was a sleeper, better than what I had anticipated.
This is the first movie in which I have seen her, and the salivating adoration of thousands of American GI's in WWII is completely understandable.
The first half is excellent noir, and Mitchum, Russell and Price are all enjoying themselves.
My message to the Director: You have to give me a reason to stay with your movie beyond the first few minutes.
THEN, next episode another person falls in the water, comes back and the cycle continues, nothing new really happens in the first few episodes.
Perhaps this was the first heist film that used laser beams in a vault as an obstacle to thieves, but why did they do it so badly?
The movie attempts to portray the main actors as actually having mental visions of another human affecting their lives, ala A Beautiful Mind, in the first part of the film.
The first half of the movie was ok and pretty innocent, but then the rest freaked me out.
Thats all one needs to know about the film because right from the first reel the viewer is absorbed into the story and learns about each character.
Just another way to cash in on the cult success of the first one.
It is also one of the first sci.
Though the acting seems real, at first, the actors lose their grip as the movie progresses.
Upon first glance, it might seem like the story has been rehashed from the plotlines of several other Indian films.
The first half of the film has some of the light good moments.
I've seen first year film student projects that are far better than this waste of space.
You can watch the whole thing on YouTube, but I bet you won't sit through the first minute.
When I first heard what these people were trying to do with this movie, I was confused.
The first film Ju On: The Grudge, is personally one of the scariest films I have seen so I had high expectations of the sequel.
Ju On: The Grudge 2 really was a pointless exercise in film-making, that starts off poorly, barely keeps it's head above water in the middle & completely falls apart in the final third, it appears that the good ideas were used in the first film.
The whole rebirth concept reminded me a lot of the first Ringu sequel(Rasen) & guess what, it didn't really work for that series either but I did think that one it's own Rasen was a better film than Grudge 2.
sorry it's really movie i couldn't understand at all first of all the name's were very strange to me then the plot was very confused the relationships between the characters of the movie another mystery what's happened to the mother is she died ?
It just seemed far too contrived and too similar to the first film.
(Even the Amityville Horror series had the decency to leave the damn house eventually) To make matters worse we have had approximately 100 white screeching ghost chicks with black hair Asian horror films since the first one.
First things first: I'm not a conservative.
Most of these ideas are rammed down your throat in the first twenty minutes of the film and what makes them so obnoxious is none of the jokes or gags or deliberately obvious references to Halliburton, the Neo-Cons and the US occupation of Iraq, are imaginative, clever or funny.
This movie was released in the year 2001, the time when bollywood seemed to be in doldrums, producing one trash after another, the same year when another masterpiece "Lagaan" was released from bollywood and the year I finished my college and entered my first job and wow what an experience - it was just like a fresh breath of air.
The first movie by an unknown young guy Farhan Akhtar (may be known earlier because of his famous parents Javed Akhtar - lyricist in this movie - and Honey Irani) and what a fantastic job he did both in direction and script writing.
Even the first 10 minutes of this movie were horrific.
At first, it may have seemed like some kind of politically motivated derivative of Grosse Point Blank with Akroyd and Cusack(s) all over again.
Yeah, the guy was nice looking, but gee whiz I'd think making out wouldn't exactly be the first thing on their minds given their tense situation, and the fact he has some cuts and bruises.
The story is simple Â at first, and is largely interspersed with a lot of English.
It seems like it was first slated as a movie-of-the-week but then an fading MGM figured to score some box office bucks with the gimmick of this being one of their last movies shot on a studio lot.
This 1972 film is the first and probably the best of four, varied 1970s movies by the same writer about sensationalistic small-town murders solved by the local police chief against the backdrop of quirky town regulars and a casual romantic interest.
I just finished reviewing all 9 seasons of the X files (while watching the 8th and 9th seasons for the first time) and i guess that my comment is not only about the last episode but also about both last seasons.
The first thing that i realized is that at least for me the show was based on agent Mulder and his special non-romantic relationship with Sculley, the last 2 seasons totally ruin that, Mulder mostly isn't there and when he is the he deals with the romances with Sculley and their baby.
I find the last 2 seasons lack the great acting and the great sense of humor there was in the first seasons (especially 1-6).
I watched the show first time around in real-time, and have finally watched it again on DVD (over the course of a few months).
CSM believed that he was good (a trait of first class baddies).
Only a full scale war against the aliens or a first class monster episode would have sufficed.
The next time I watch the show, I'll restrict myself to seasons 1-6, which were magic of the first order.
2 and 3 were OK, but still they still don't compare at all with the first.
(A CLASSIC)I think Kickboxer 4 just made Tong Po look so stupid and weak.In the original he lost to Van Damme but he still was a bad mofo.In 2 and 4 they made him like look an amateur.I know Van Damme ain't a great actor but his action scenes make up for that.Sasha Mitchell on the other hand is a terrible actor(acting scenes and fighting scenes)If your gonna make a sequel u better make it better then the first if not don't make it all.
In my opinion, the traps that Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) set for Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern) were even more hilarious than the first.
I mean, Kevin set two of the same traps that he did in the first HOME ALONE.
(The makers of the first "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" showed great wisdom in avoiding any shots of the alien invaders in their natural form.)
History tells us that the film was shot in France and Yugoslavia in French with the multi- lingual Christopher Lee first speaking his lines in English on camera which he sportingly dubbed into French himself for the original 96 minute version.
Just watching the movie for the first time is an extremely painful experience, and it's only after multiple forced screenings that some of the gags have started to become even mildly amusing.
She and Hrithik really worked in the first film.
It was because of them that the first movie really worked.
To have those two separated just destroys the memory of the first movie.
It's not like the Rohit/Nisha pairing in the first movie.
In the first movie I really, really wished that Rohit and Nisha would end up together.
But really, my biggest grievance about this movie, (on top of all its little flaws that added up) was that it just ruined the first movie.
First of all, the film's first mistake was calling itself a sequel.
The fact that this movie is the sequel to Koi Mil Gaya I expected it to surpass the first movie.
I'll talk about the songs first.
This is such a step back from the character of Nisha from the first movie who was a strong female character and guided Rohit and did her best to protect his innocence from the harshness of the world.
In Krrish on the other hand, you get a feeling that Krrish only fell in love with Priya because she's the first woman his age that he's seen all his life until that point!
By the way, another thing that really bothered me was that in Krrish, Rohit in the flashbacks while he was still young looked too much like the mentally handicapped Rohit from the first film.
The first film already established that Rohit was completely normal and he even looked that way after Jadoo gave him powers.
But the biggest shortcoming of this film was that it didn't make us empathize with Krrish and Priya the way we did for Rohit and Nisha in the first film.
In the first film I rooted for Rohit and Nisha to overcome all odds to be together.
Krrish is being promoted as Indias first superhero movie even though that genre is probably the oldest in Indian film history.
In the first half,I mistook Krishh to be a kid movie,meant for kids below 10 years of age.In the second half i realized its not even a kids movie..its just a bizarre dumb movie that has more holes in its script than most adults can count.
I remember seeing this when it first aired.
Get right to the movie review by skipping the first paragraph  After watching a movie like this I lose faith in humanity but after watching MST3K bad mouth movies like this I regain a little faith in humanity.
The first movie I rented was the Movie Version with "This Island Earth" which isn't really bad so I thought MST3K was an damn funny show, now I know it is one of the damn funniest shows ever!
I'll bet this was there as a tribute to Chris Columbus's first movie he directed, "Gremlins."
I was hoping for something new after the first Home Alone, which all my friends begged me to go see, and my reaction to it was "Uhhh, "The 3 Stooges" were funnier and I can watch them for free on TV."
(It's also got an English dub created with a tin ear and ESL voice actors reading their lines from cue cards for the first time).
And as I mentioned, the horrible English dub robs their performances of even the limited nuance and dignity they may have contributed to the film in the first place.
It was also the very first episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 I ever saw, way back when, so it will always have a special place in my heart.
Leaving out the first 20 pages or so and completely changing that plot point, well, it made for a completely unlikable character.
The stream becomes a series of rapids and small waterfalls that first damage the canoe, then the bow breaks off while Dr. Jim and Laura, respectively, continue to paddle and scream.
OK the first one wasn't bad, but the violence in this goes to a bugs bunny G rated level of stupidity.
The first one great.
After all, sequels aren't meant to be copies of the first movie.
Any way, they shouldn't of copied the first movie so much.
The first time I saw it, I laughed and laughed of the bad acting and the bad effects!!
The first time I saw it, I didn't catch the name of the movie.
Apart from that the second part of adventures this way isn't amusing Kevin as first, mainly thanks to darker climat.
One note of interest, Tom Haneke's editing for the first couple of hours was superb!
this piece of sh*t is well just that a piece of sh*t. it has loads of glitches popup graphics handling of the cars is not as good as the first one it is too sensitive on the second one compared to the original.
i have the first one and will probably have the third one but i will not ever have the second one.
The first half-hour of the movie is unfathomable.
When he returns to the apartment, he finds Lisa dead (he actually trips over and lands face first in her pubic hair), so he ultimately decides he has to go on the run.
This is a complete rehash of the first film.
I enjoyed the first film, but the second one was kinda sad.
It uses almost the same script from the first film, and not really any points for originality.
He is wealthy so he wears nothing but a very out of style suit for the first part of the movie (the same one day after day).
At first he is going to go buy some girl from the slave trade that the animal shelter people don't notice is in a cage.
This movie is so much like the first one.
Instead of a sequel, this movie should have been made as a "Scenario B" to the first one.
It would have been good, had the first one never came out, and we wouldn't realize what a blatant rip-off it is.
As a member of the BDSM community, I have seen first hand the loving relationships between Masters and their pets.
Itâs ironic that, of Ganceâs more celebrated Silent work, this should be the one I watch first: itâs a one-reel short about a mad scientist â hence its inclusion in the âHorror Challengeâ, though the tone throughout is distinctly comical!
I watched both the first and second pilots on youtube (go to youtube.com and type in Red Dwarf pilot).
The first one was utter garbage, the only saving graces were the captain, Tau (played by a woman, she was very good).
I give the first pilot a 1 out of 10.
"the producers approached me and Doug (Naylor) and said he had a few questions before the go ahead, the first was that he didn't feel the American audiences would be able to associate with a hologram, so was there any way we could not kill Rimmer.
Director Harry Bromley (who also directed the first two flicks) is really clutching at straws with this flatly handled and too practical project.
They should've kept their first choice as Rimmer instead of using Anthony Fuscle, who looks way too muscular and not weasely enough.
This was Chris Columbus' first time directing a sequel, and as expected, he falls into the exact same trap that cripples many a sequel.
The first was not quite a holiday classic, but it was reasonably successful.
His script has none of the tiny amusements or sharp insights that propelled the first film.
In fact when I first saw it, I thought if it had been made by John Hughes, it could have been a much better film.
It misses the natural warmth and amusing developments of the first film by a mile.
There are times when Home Alone 2 thinks its being really clever, by dropping in knowing references to the first film, in a vain attempt to make you think this is not a rehash.
But where it proved to be the comic high point of the first film, Chris Columbus has blown it up to absurd proportions for this one.
This all happens within the first 30 minutes.
In the first "Home Alone," Kevin only seemed interested in maiming the villains; in this one he is apparently trying to kill them.
Walter Hill has done some GREAT movies (HARD TIMES, his first, is still his best, THE DRIVER, 48 HRS, TRESPASS is pretty thrilling too), but this is among is weak works, unfortunately NICK NOLTE, whom I love to watch, does a hammy job (on purpose, probably), the whole movie is poorly photographed (it looks like "made for TV", but in fact I have seen better photographed "made for TV"-movies !
I still remember the trailer they used to promote this movie in Europe (it's a different trailer than the one here on the IMDb, which is a weak trailer, too) and it was in fact a TERRIFIC trailer, just great, with the soldiers being introduced in scenes I never saw in the movie (you never see the soldiers sparkling in Nolte's glasses in the movie either...), so I remember having felt let down when I saw it first (nearly 20 years ago), but recently I wondered if it's time for a new viewing, when it was aired on TV here a few days ago: well, as said above my memory was unfortunately right and it still has not improved with time (never will).
Home Alone 2 has pretty much the same general plot as the first one.a few of the particulars have changed,including the location.this time Kevin is Lost in New York,while his family is somewhere else.the 2 bumbling Robbers,Marv(Daniel Stern)and Harry(Joe Pesci)return and of course meet up with Kevin and slapstick ensues.this movie is a bit longer,and i felt it took a while to get going,but once it does,it's very funny.the booby traps Kevin designs are just as elaborate and cause a lot of pain and grief for Harry and Marv,and a lot of hilarity for the audience.this movie is a bit more touching and heartwarming than the first one,and at least as funny.the only downside for me is the slow beginning.otherwise,it pretty much lives up to the first one.for me,Home Alone 2 Is an 8.5/10
Let's first start with the plot.
I mean at first it was cool, then it become OK this is his thing, and now its just wow your still doing that.
Really lives up to the first one!!
It's followed by Home Alone 3, naturally, but it doesn't star anyone from the first two.
I first watch this movie 'fool N final' and the watch the original movie 'Snatch'.
It's just as good as the first.
But he uses his dad's credit card and Harry and Marv (from the first) and follow him everywhere he goes.
Then he does the same thing in the first, but only at his Uncle Rob's.
This film made more cash than the first.
Harburg first knew and loved W.S.
It absolutely amazes me that the studio didn't pull him off the project after the first few weeks.
I wanted to see if it was as awful as I remembered it from the first time.
I need to add that I first saw this in Madrid when it opened in Spain.
Is this the first time he's dated one of his students?
The first two attributes should apply to a good portion of the women he's been dating Â his students, that is Â and as for the third, if he's the playboy we're meant to believe he is, this should be nothing new either.
Or better still, kill them off in the first act, and put them out of their misery.
If anyone loved the first home alone, chances are they like this one just as much.
From the very first sound (a cartoonish attempt at an active sonar "ping") by a synthesizer sampler, this movie was riddled with mistakes and inconsistencies.
Home Alone 2 is pretty good, but I liked the first one better.
While in New York City, Kevin learns that the two bandits from the first film escaped from prison and are planning to rob a toy store.
The formula is basically the same as the first film.
Fonda and Kristofferson's first meeting isn't much of an icebreaker, yet the two are bedding down together by their second or third encounter.
Whereas the first two installments had a personal feeling, like the filmmakers had left their personal signature proudly on their excellent work, PART 3 and this one are obviously done to make money and nothing else.
I was strongly tempted to switch it off after the first 15 minutes, but hung on until the end in the hope that it would get better.
If the first one is hilarious, this one is hysterical!
The basic plot is similar to the first one's, but it's not a carbon copy.
The first one basically takes place in Kevin's house and that zone.
The booby traps are more violent comparing to the first movie, but somehow they're more hilarious, although sometimes they overdo it.
Cedric is a likable chap, but the Concierge not so much because he dislikes Kevin from the very first moment, although this guy is hilarious at times.
You can do a lot with a small budget, but you have to put some care into what you're doing first.
When I first watched it, I thought it was one of the best movies I've ever seen.
I'm not exactly a big fan of CLAMP's work, but this one is the first that I got into with the mangas.
The good parts first: The special effects are great, and they really help you feel like you are in that galaxy far far away.
While the first provides fairly flat characters, the same characters (and actors) really shine in Empire strikes back.
To wrap up on the whole most people liked the first three films, but with this one a great deal did, a great deal didn't, and some were indifferent and that I thinks tells the whole story.  
Dialogue is flat and perfunctory (don't expect to be dazzled by repartee); the story lacks the beauty of the first Star Wars film and the tension of the second ... and then there's the magical `character development' everyone complains about.
So the defence that `The Phantom Menace' is allowed to be a poor movie because it really wasn't trying to be something great in the first place, just won't wash.
So Jar Jar Binks is the first digitally created main character?
In truth, he doesn't fail to return on that promise, but the lines do not come off with the same charm that the first movies held; indeed, how could they when the lines themselves are delivered with two-by-four accuracy?
I submit the first scene between Amidala and Anakin in the shop of the slave-keeper.
Lucas has said numerous times that he detests directing (this was the first film he's directed in over 20 years since the original Star Wars film), and his contempt for directing shows.
I remember the stories that Obi-wan told about how he first met Anakin to Luke during the original trilogy.
"When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot, but I was amazed at how strongly the force was with him.
Jesus, George didn't you watch the first three films?
The first three films helped define my childhood and have stayed with me into early adulthood.
(Gabriel Byrnes accent is awful) In this 30 minute first ep nothing happens but talking about a womens problems with her love life, no cracks, witty dialogue wise ass remarks jokes or anything that makes this watchable in the slightest.
One must first look at Philippine culture to realize that in the Archipelago, there is a tendency to believe that "more is better".
Real talent doesn't come from disciplining yourself at first, it comes from letting it all hang out and RUNESTONE seemed to have a preoccupation with being respectable.
So much so that after the first half-hour of the film, I was reading it again, trying to use the book to block out the TV screen.
The first bad thing is the flashback: how can CGjr know these things?
Best (or worst) of all this movie boasts the worst disguise since Jane March in 'Color of Night' - if you don't spot it within the first 10 seconds and then work out the whole plot, then shame on you, you're no movie buff.
There's just smoothing about this one that is so much better than the first.
Home Alone 2 is a carbon copy, but it's also much better and more complex a movie than the first.
His Aunt Georgette from the first movie is still in Paris so he uses her half-renovated home as a huge mousetrap for the bungling burglars.
Home Alone 2 has a more satisfying climax than the first.
Much like the first movie Home Alone 2 is presented 'matted' widescreen.
Unlike the first movie.
I liked the first HellBoy & Guillermo del Toro was too good in Pan's Labyrinth!
Went to this movie expecting to really enjoy it - was so looking forward to it as both myself and my wife enjoyed the first Hellboy movie a lot.
We both love Guillermo del Toro's movies in general and really thought we would love this...  We both saw the first Hellboy movie again before watching this (which I would strongly advise you all to do, as that way you will appreciate just how bad this movie is compared).
The movie has also lost a lot of the edge and suspense it had in the first movie - I seriously feel like the directing in this movie is worse than the first one.
Please understand I'm in no way a comic book purist as in fact I've never even read the comic book version, but I am just someone who really enjoyed the first Hellboy film.
On a side note, not being aware that Seth Macfarlane had voiced the character when i first viewed the film i spent half the time wondering why Krauss sounded exactly like Klaus the fish in American Dad.
This is my first comment on IMDb and I'm sad it has to be a harsh criticism of this movie.
outside of the plot holes and clichÃ© beyond clichÃ© twists the characters are just unlikeable in this one and the music score is an abomination, compared to the score of the first.
For the first hour you are thrilled with the movie.
For the first part of the movie this story is well told and interesting, but in the second half it becomes obvious and clichÃ© and the good beginnings are ruined.
This is one of his early movies and, although I haven't seen any others, I firmly believe that his production has improved vastly with experience, but you should definitely not see this as your first movie by him.
Now I'm aware that Home Alone 2: Lost in New York is the exact same plot as the first Home Alone, and not to mention how silly it seems that these folks would leave their kid behind, but come on, this movie was all in good fun.
It still has me constantly laughing 'till this day, I think if you loved the first Home Alone, I'm sure that you'll just naturally love this one as well.
I think this house that Kevin set up was actually in some ways a little more fun than the first because of the traps he was able to set.
Doctor, who seems to have his office and clinic in his house, is being blackmailed by a strange woman who disappears after the first five minutes...or does she?
I must also add that this is the first DVD from Alpha Video that I've viewed that seems to have been taken from a respectable-looking print; too bad it was for this pathetic little stinker!
After that set-up during the first 20 minutes or so, the film seems to forget all about Laura until the very end of the film, when some absurd, out-of-left field explanation is given about how she was literally "scared to death" by someone from her past who has returned to settle an old score.
The biggest mystery of the film is why it was filmed in color in the first place - when there were so many lesser musicals that could have been enhanced by color.
This is a strange, lukewarm chiller that arguably for the first time in the movies has a corpse telling the story of her mysterious death by way of flashbacks from a lab in cold storage.
The first XTRO was a peculiar little sci-fi/horror/drama-gem.
Enjoy the series for what it is, but read the books to get the story that made them classics in the first place.
This first installment is the perfect example.
I first saw this as it was originally presented on TV in 1978.
I read the book on which this film is based--"Bud and Lou", by Bob Thomas--when it first came out, and it didn't impress me much.
I don't think the movie is as bad as the first two comments, i also don't think the movie is as good as the third comment.
I don't agree with the first two comments, and I thought the performances were acceptable.
I was only a 12 year old kid when I initially saw this movie on the first day of my summer vacation from school back in 1970.
I think the film was written by first time screen-writer Alice bell, and it really shows.
It seems to me that the first thing that should be developed is a concept, something new and different.
It's a comedy that isn't funny first of all.
So, whether seeing the new one or not, see this one first!
The first time I started to watch this movie was after drinking two beers pretending they would be enough to send my stressful day at work into the past and help me indulge in the simple pleasures of idleness.
I couldn't understand anything of the first 20 minutes and falling sleep won the match.
I didn't take this loosely the next day, first of all I speak Spanish and the language was not an issue, secondly, if two beers are making me so incompetent, AA in my area will be my next google search.
So, first watch it.
The first hour of the picture wasn't even necessary.
The first hour and a quarter scarcely set the stage, with the duration moving no quicker or more palatably, and I'm more than patient with artistic efforts that appear to want for plot, but this was pointlessly plot less and otherwise utterly bereft of potentially other redeeming features.
During its inauspicious four year run, the TV series "Starsky & Hutch" was never a huge hit; though it did land at an impressive number 15 in the Nielsen ratings its first year (1975-76), the numbers declined steadily thereafter.
I saw this for the first time as a kid in the 70s.
Maybe the first could be an acceptable Starsky, but the second made a very stupid Hutch.
As in the first movie, a bunch of teens visit a possessed house on Halloween and become victims of the nasty spirit that dwells within.
Also, like the first film, the action takes a good 45 minutes to get going.
Steve Johnson, who provided the gore effects in the first film, also does the make-up FX for this one, and he does a pretty good job; particularly impressive moments include a woman's tits transforming into demon hands and a wonderful snake creature with a huge lashing tail.
The demons don't crack stupid jokes in the first movie, did the writers think they were being funny or original?
And, most importantly, he's going to make you laugh, which in the end is what this movie is all about in the first place.
Or, I should say, the first Bill Rebane film I can make it through without being bored to tears.
There's the drab but somehow attractive female protagonist, her brother who cares so much about the group that he actually leaves the cabin for help, the rich snob who is slightly reminiscent of Charles Winchester from M*A*S*H, the guy the female protagonist is infatuated with, and the brainy, slightly crazy nerd who looks somewhat like a walrus, and is actually more important to the story than you think he is at first.
It is on the plane where we first start to see George as a total moron - he's not too bright, blames everything and everyone else for his own problems, and whines all the time like a child.
The first season was good and so was the second.
I have seen this show three times, the first time was because I was flicking through channels and I thought it was a really stupid commercial.
As much as I hated the first season, I respected it for its uniqueness and took in every episode.
Now, this next statement might only convey that I've been spoiled by living a nice, sheltered life in a first world country, but the reason this doesn't work is that misanthropy is only funny when people are randomly slaughtered left and right (Robot Chicken).
The Porcelean Birds episode in particular put the entire 18-35 demographic on suicide watch for a half hour after it first aired.
I wasn't disappointed, the only remaining mystery being why it was banned in the first place.
When some people complained that this film "glorified" or "made light" of this serious issue, this final line of the film was cut when the film first was shown on television.
Thats pretty much what this film does... takes the same title from an entertaining first film and slaps it onto a film with a completely different story.
Which is sad, because the first film was entertaining.
I even bought this film based on the fact I loved the first one... but I'm sadly selling it off.
Jaycee Chan (son of Jackie Chan) makes his first and only appearance to date in a film and after seeing his poor performance I recommend that he stick with music.
To wit: the mother of the poetess, whom we see only rarely in the first thirty-five minutes, comes off as a mostly absent entity whose only purpose is to arrive home waaay late every night and give our long-suffering hero a hard time for not taking proper care of her little sister (read: yet another obstacle for our poet hero to overcome on her way to heartfelt expository writing).
The entire plot was laid bare with the first problem the couple runs into and it just went downhill.
The description of the symptoms is that first you break into uncontrollable laughter, then you become frenetic, and then, your mind altered, you do insane things.
This cautionary tale of blatant lies and unintentional hilarity about demon weed is one of the first broad sides in the war on drugs.
At first everything went to plan, and I remained on schedule; then Â with a dull droning sound, like that of a whimpering animal Â my computer suddenly took it upon itself to shut down for no apparent reason.
For a cocky businessman (Jack Lemmon) and his neglected wife (Sandy Dennis), a meticulously-planned trip to New York City is first disrupted by a seemingly-minor delay, which gradually blossoms into a fully-fledged urban disaster.
It's interesting to note how the husband-and-wife relationship shifts constantly as they are confronted by each new setback: at first, George is rather dismissive of his wife, using her primarily to "verify" facts to be later used in the courtroom.
Mickey gets knocked over by a milk truck driven by dairy magnate Malcolm Trevor (Cary Grant), and Letty, Mickey, and a shady lawyer try to get damages, but somebody's taken film of Mickey running and jumping, so they throw the case out of court and Mickey gets taken away, first by matrons, and then by the soft-hearted Trevor.
Then the scheming Letty tries to get her son back by fascinating TrevorÂeasily doneÂbut the noble response of the wife, first in not making a fuss, and then saving Mickey from drowning in the swimming pool, changes her mind.
Big unselfish act, probably her first.
Incest is NOT a topic that ingratiates itself with viewers, unless they are morally deplorable in the first place.
The Phantom Menace was the first nail in the coffin, but Attack of the Clones buries the Star Wars magic once and for all.
When I looked at imdb after the first few nights in theaters, read about Jar-Jar being almost totally gone and how much better this part was, I was really excited.
Now first of all, the directing was utterly horrid.
I do wish that Lucas would get back to the gritty colour tones used in the first two films, they certainly added to the realism but the Disney look seems to have infected the franchise too deeply.
The gladiatorial scene was straight out of your first Dungeons & Dragons game.
Maybe I just have a nostalgic love for the first trilogy, but I would never think that they were anywhere near as poor, in any way, as this new garbage.
"The Defiant Ones," a truly great film was first, and then this one followed.
Yeah, OK MW blows its two best fights in the first 20 minutes, but there's a lot of good solid action going on here, and though Yeoh isn't as central as I would have liked to preceedings (given she's the only one here who can act her way out of a paper bag) she has some fantastic set pieces and humorous lines to fight/charm her way through.
The first time it was on I wasn't able to pay much attention to it, but was able to catch the premise, and I made a mental note to watch it again and pay attention.
At any rate, if you are tempted to see this film, examine your own motives, first.
This one, Number 42 in the series and the first with Roland Winters in the title role, does not augur well for the remainder of the Monogram efforts in this inept re-make of Mr Wong in Chinatown.
This was the first Chan film with Roland Winters in the title role.
I first saw it when I was a teenager back in the 1980's, but I rented it just last week because I needed to be cheered up.
That, of course, is a reference to the first of two films which they did, where Bette spoke with an accent that Meryl Streep would never envy.
), some first class actors and actresses .
The thought of Joe Lara playing a character who was not Tarzan was kind of disturbing at first.
I first saw it on a tour bus while studying in Ghana, West Africa.
The script takes derivative segments from a host of good movies and inexplicably fails to deliver anything that made them good in the first place.
On only two occasions did humour struggle into the film, the first as a consequence of the robot's infrared vision which is perfectly normal vision where certain objects have been painted bright red.
That said it is an important true story of the first sexologist who fought for the rights of what is now called the queer community.
Like Abbott and Costello, the studio first used them in this role and only later gave them their own starring films.
A real artifact of the earliest talkies and musicals, which includes the first two-strip Technicolor (the last half of the movie).
That, finally, would have been the first thing about this movie to make any sense.
Some are good but most get tedious after the first half dozen.
First (and foremost), adults first.
As for the quality of the film overall, this isn't a particularly bad film for the first half and it does have an interesting plot twist (Dracula finding love).
When this happened what came in my mind was -- what about the first hour and a half??
She is rooted in her regard for her fierce Hispanic great-grandmother and her quasi-Catholic loyalties, and it's her family that the movie should first introduce to us.
They are defined by taking "average Joes", often a bit timid at first, and setting them at odds against the world--initially through no, or at least relatively little, fault of their own--in an increasing spiral of dilemmas from which extrication seems impossible.
I bring all of this up, of course, because The Out of Towners is one of the earliest examples, if not the first full fledged "hell handbasket" film.
Even if not the first, it is certainly one of the most influential.
Of course, things start going wrong, beginning with the flight to New York, which is first put into a holding pattern because of excessive traffic, then later sent to Boston because of the weather.
so, on we go to round three of the "House" series.we(my sister and i)had watched the first entry all the way through and were underwhelmed,to say the least.the second one lowered the bar for crappiness even further.how bad could number 3 be?it starts off promising enough.after all,it had Lance Henricksen (he should've passed) in it and it looked like it had a bigger budget.however,it soon became apparent that this movie was also a dud.another ridiculous plot,bad acting,bad everything.i think this one made it 40 minutes tops.any longer and my head would have exploded.again,no horror,and no comedy.i must be missing something.i wish i knew what it was.
It's got plenty of garish 80s style behind it--the fact that the director worked on music videos came as no surprise, nor did the fact that this was his first movie--but its substance is practically nil.
On a second viewing it might be laughable, but there's so much to deal with that the first time around was just a painful exercise in masochism.
Pretty much NOTHING happens within the first hour, apart from the introduction of many bleak & uninteresting characters.
Whilst doing a sightseeing trip on the first day, their motorcycle is run over by the Rolls Royce of a fancy local millionaire who subsequently offers them both a cup of tea in his ridiculously large mansion.
Things start to go wrong in the very first reel when Katherine Ross and Sam Elliott arrive in England where Ross has a job waiting for her.
When I saw the very first trailer, I was already sure that this film wasn't going to be one of my all time favorites.
Basically we all know Anna and Johan will get back together, but first the plot has to be manipulated so that we can give some sex scenes to the roommate, to an different couple, to Anna with other people, and lets not forget the obligatory lesbian scene to say nothing of the big sex scene when they are finally reunited.
The first half is good.
Then why did they create her in the first place?
When this movie first came out, the reviewer in my local newspaper began his review with "This offensive mess..." and finished by giving it an F minus.
The first movie from Thailand that I saw was Ong-Bak.
This dude, on the other hand, should've been dead after the first 30-45 minutes (which became the most infuriating plot hole).
For the first time in my life I had the urge to leave after having only seen a quarter of it.
The first time I saw this movie I thought it was great.
This was the first movie I ever saw.
  Rating - 4 stars (out of 5)  Too many reviewers have tried to compare Emma-Kate Croghan's second feature with her first, Love and Other Catastrophes.
In fact all the actors gave first class performances.
this has got to be one of those films where the trailer is 50 times better than the movie itself.I first saw the trailer in 1991, it looked great.Since then i have always wanted to see it but could never find it.....until today, yes, 14 years later.
His name alone led many to believe The Climax would be a grand, shivering horror fest, especially as it would be Karloff's first color film.
And to think that Karloff's first color film was this dull song-fest.
This film was the first one to star Boris Karloff that was in color.
As such, it illustrates that to be the first of anything is meaningless if the film lacks coherence, intelligence, and a decent script.
I had been excited about this one since it was first announced... especially with this amazing list of guest stars.
This is my first review as I felt compelled to write to say just how bad this film is.
I would usually never write a review in the first place, but if I can spare someone 1.5 hours of their life then writing this will have been worth it.
I first heard of WWHTKB from a friend of mine who appeared in the film.
Writer/director John-Paul Nickel does a hell of a job on his first film, and shows that, given some practice (and maybe a budget), he could one day be a force to behold.
At first the audience was quiet and respectful but (when it became clear that nothing was happening) they got restless.
when i got there the line was crazy out the door, they were only letting in the first 500 people, but we managed to get in.
For an "erotic" film, there was very little actual sex, apart from the first scene, which incidentally does not feature much nudity, and a shower scene.
This is just the first of many implausible scenes between Mary and Joe.
The first scam we see Mary, Aggie and Joe pull is extorting $20,000 from an old man for writing love letters to "14 year old" Aggie (right - Aggie looks about as much as a 14-year-old as I do!).
The first thirty odd minutes of this focuses almost entirely on Will, Jayne & Darren & feels more like a teen soap opera than a horror film & when the horror elements do eventually kick in they are pretty lame with Will trying to be turned into a Vampire & a bit of bickering between Julien & Claudius to see who is harder but they both come across as wimps anyway & really don't put up much of a fight at a very weak climax.
My first intuition was that in this film there are clichees put together in a stereotype way to tell a story with a conservative political message.
Android of Notre Dame is third Guinea Pig movie, the first is Devil's Experiment and second is Flowers of Flesh and Blood, and these first two are the sickest in the series.
Even the first two are not as sick as they could have been, but they are still very rough and mean spirited.
I like Ms. Sheedy no matter what film she's in, ever since I first saw her in War Games.
Maybe its the dubbing, but this story of a Greek hero who is at first the key to taking control of Athens and later to beating the invading the Persians, should have worked.
The first half of the film is basically setting up the romance and the war, and then in the second half you mostly see Steve Reeves running for what seems like 15 minutes, and then a huge naval battle with some interesting underwater photography.
Watched "Around the World in 80 Treasures" for the first time tonight - as I am just back from Cambodia, and heading for Tajikistan.
In fact, the only decent acting (amongst the major actors) comes from Lewis Stone, but he looks so out of place with the rest of the cast, that at first you think he's the bad one.
At first I figured it was a botched comedy, but turns out it's a botched drama.
I first saw WWHTKB when it was screened in my hometown film festival two years ago at one in the morning on a Saturday.
The action offers a good mix of martial arts and large-scale battle scenes, and the story is (after the first 30 minutes) engaging and at times even inspiring.
There wasn't enough suspense or action to keep my interesting after the first hour.
When I first watched series "Miami Vice", with Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas, I was very happy because that was a hell of a show.The plot was good,actors was fine and of course Miami was here.
All the 'comical' bits are contained in the first three minutes, after which they are repeated ad nauseam.
The first part is titled The Unhappy Man - and in bounces Ray Milland with a self-assured Hollywood smirk!
The central theme of the original novel is developed through the contrast between the first part and the second, titled The Happy Man.
I admit, I've never been shot in a battle, so I cannot tell what a person would normally do under these circumstances, but my wild guess is that having sex with a comrade (while the enemy soldiers are searching around) would not be the first item on the list.
i first watched the movie with a friend who had seen it at school, and she loved it so much she shared it with me.
the first 2 min are ok then the opening credits come on and are about 5 min with the worst music i ever heard in my life.
--The first 40 mins.
The most annoying character in this film is the grandma, she should have been the first victim.
I think the only one uniqueness this post-Friday-the-13th-Part2 film has is its expressive way of the first and silliest two victims, Ted and Angie who originally tried to have a woodland-****-on-a-motorcycle in the middle of the cold night.
It's going to be a first class production.
The scenario attracted me to this film, and the first half definitely was worth the time.
And how about the killer's daughter going on a bit of a rampage herself Â and that first murder (manslaughter) of hers!
(1969-70), starring camp British comic Howerd, whose penchant for gossipy asides to camera was well-served by the first two films (UP POMPEII and UP THE CHASTITY BELT, both produced in 1971).
Bob Kellett directs with the same faceless efficiency that distinguished the first two movies, and Howerd is ably supported by guest stars Hermione Baddeley, Stanley Holloway and Zsa Zsa Gabor (as Mata Hari!
At first he was a bit of solvent sniffer and then just hours after trying a bit of coke he is raiding a medicine cabinet just to get high.
Shot in first person, the difficult mechanics of POV and storytelling are well executed.
The first part is in turns funny and sad, and is generally realistic enough to be poignant.
Example:the scene where he meets his first client in the public toilets.
My first real acquaintance with the truth came with Gerald Posner's book "Case Closed," which debunks conspiracy lore with modern science and far more accurate and detailed information than was ever available before.
That should be the first hint.
After watching the first fifteen minutes of this "festering bowl of dog snot," I longingly wished that I'd been hit by a truck on the way to the video store.
I have never been compelled to write a comment about a movie before this, and in fact, the very first comment I ever saw on IMDB for this movie (at the time, it was the only comment and is now the last comment) was pretty spot on (the one where the person saw it with Finnish subtitles).
People with a low tolerance for inept cinema are likely to faint or even die from a stroke during the first half hour already and even experienced bad movie fanatics will, in fact, face severe difficulties to sit through R.O.T.O.R from start to finish.
I first saw 'bitch' at a film festival in Oklahoma last year, and I must admit, I've enjoyed this movie over and over since that day.
But my favourite part is where the android cop takes on a trio of tough men, the first being a drunk who gets swept aside easily, the second being a karate expert who is outmatched by the robot, before leading to a real tough man being walked on by the robot.
The first story involves two women (a quite attractive and busty brunette and a redheaded goth chick who looks about 20 years older than her friend).
If this wasn't one of the first talking pictures and didn't have Jolson in it, it would have disappeared long ago.
The movie made a lot of money for the studio and gave people the first opportunity to see what sound could be like in the movies.
The movie made a lot of money for the studio and gave people the first opportunity to see what sound could be like in the movies.
The novelty of being the first sound film having worn off, this movie truly doesn't have much to offer.
What then can be said about a film that is well known for being the first talkie (wellÂ that's not technically true, it's more a synchronized film) in film history?
he speaks the first natural dialogue in the film!
Overall, I thought this movie was fairly bad; I know nothing about the director, but the level that this movie sits at makes me think it's possibly his first, and hopefully his last.
Maybe considering an indie alongside these movies was my first mistake.
Oh my dear god, please people, before slating any other film please watch this one first, who in their right mind eats a banana in the bath and then tries to feed some of it to their dog??????
A few sequences are downright dazzling (like the first massacre, set in a filthy restroom) and there are some delightfully absurd characters introduced.
Bette Davis is normally looking out for number one--and she's definitely her good old self in the first half of the movie.
OK, so Tarantino (we're not on a first name basis) was blown way by the outrageous idea of having an almost nude woman as a hood ornament on a car.
Well, it took a while, but I've finally seen this first film of the two, and while I was expecting to like it enough to watch the sequel, it certainly didn't work out that way.
Final Cry:  Movies: If this made it into theaters I was the first President of the U.S.  DVD Purchase: That'd be a no!
After the first few scenes, involving father and son time, my expectations were already low enough.
I watched it twice, and caught a bunch of stuff for the first time the second time around.
All in all this movie is a poor attempt to teach us a lesson you either learn in first grade, or never learn, and that is that people are different and what is "popular is decided by the populous."
After watching the movie I assumed it was a first time director who somehow got the financing together.
I thought at first it might be an over the top movie that was meant to be humorous but that was not the case it was a clichÃ©d slasher film without any redeeming features except the bodies of some of the women in it.
The first entry in this now franchise had that from Paul W.S.
This sequel is pretty much a direct continuation and goes right from the ending of the first film, but soon into the film you can see that things are missing.
Action movies never really need deep plot (just watch the first "Resident Evil"), but they do need visual flair (also shown in the first "Resident Evil").
Instead, we get much of what we had in the first - but no where as good.
Overall if your a zombie movie fan avoid this and see the Dawn Of The Dead remake or 28 days later, If your a resident evil fan it might be worth a rental I guess if you liked the first one.
The first movie was vomit inducing, resulting in pulsing headaches and dissolved moral.
The director just copied and pasted what Anderson achieved in the first film, namely rapid editing, a hard rock soundtrack and YAWN, kung-fu melee.
I remember the first movie was okay so i decided to see the second one ONLY BECAUSE the trailer made it seem like she was in the same setting as the resident evil 2 video game.
Within the first 5 minutes of me watching RE: Apocalypse, I knew it would suck.
How crappy was the first scene with those astronauts entering the vault and getting the parasite lose.
The first RE had a lot going for it.Nice cast.Good fx.Some suspense and general scares.A nice visual style.And a surprise ending that set the stage for a lot of promise to build on toward making one hell of a Horror flick.But a lot of people griped that Re was not like the game enough.Well the bad movie gods heeded their collective whine and have given them what they wanted.While the rest of us are still reeling from this disaster.
For starters why give Alice Super powers?It takes away from the first movies realism,makes her shallow,and a grade z matrix wannabe.The stakes go from high to low.Whereas the first you never knew who was gonna live or die.Where is the tension?
Character development is non-existent, so the scene where the two main female characters meet for the first time was quite appropriate: Jill asks Alice, "Who the **** are you?"
What a waste of money (I actually bought the DVD, shame, shame, because I liked the first RE).
Quite a scary flick...I was first exposed to this little horror about 15 years ago by my Pop.
The great Black comedian Mantan Moreland easily steals the movie out from under all the white stars; he's genuinely witty and a charismatic screen presence, and he gets the first line of dialogue as well as the final gag.
Watch for Eric Roberts' sneaker/tux combo when he and his team first enter the hotel.
2)ICE T falls asleep in the first half hour and does'nt get up.
He should have just left in the first place.
The first time i saw this movie was on cinemax 2 days before halloween.
I must say that since the first time i saw it I have bought it on tape and when I got a dvd player i bought it for that too.
When i first saw the movie i couldn't actually determine if it is an action movie or a movie mocking other action movies.
The Andromeda Strain is my all time favorite movie and the first time I saw it I was about fifteen and was awed!
All the major changes came in the second part, the first part was played almost exactly like the original.
Notice how the first 4-5 reviews are all stellar, and yet the people who actually just finished watching it on the first run of the broadcast schedule are hard pressed to give it even 2 stars.
Credibility was given the first version for the usual reasons.
Is there really anyone who hasn't seen the first one?
...and that's just the first hour.
So...  (1) Where did the virus come from in the first place?
(How appropriate that I first learned about it while waiting for the lousy "Indiana Jones 4" to begin.)
I don't need anti-government paranoia thrown in my face, overdosing me, from the first minute of the film!
I could tell from the first 30 seconds of the film that it was going to disappoint and be as predictable and unimaginative as it was.
"Phantasm" is a B-movie classic, in the real of flicks such as the original "Nightmare on Elm Street" and the first "Friday the 13th".
Everything from the first word to the last scene was dreadful.
The first was how Mr. P (the hobo) turns out to be the hero from "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner."
thats the first thing any officer on any level would do.
Due to our experience with the first movie we didn't bother renting any of the sequels.
If you have seen Phantasm and didn't like it I recommend watching Phantasm II then giving the original another try (mind you if you didn't like the first one you probably aren't reading this review).
Let me first start with saying I rather liked the first three seasons with Prue.
Needless to say, if you are looking for an entertaining show: watch the first three seasons only.
But the redeeming side of it, was the relationship between the sisters and up till the first half of season 5, this was still present but severely diminished.
Not only the acting went downhill, the writing went first and it was visible.
The first year was new and fresh and sometimes funny.
The stories became bad after the first years.
At first, I thought the show was decent.
So lets get one thing straight, I've watched the first 7 years, many episodes more than once.
let me sum up the first 7 years, since i haven't seen the 8th one yet (but ill watch it just so i know how the story finished)  I hate being a witch I love being a witch I hate being a witch I love being a witch I hate being a witch I love being a witch "maybe this is an innocent we just cant save" i love you *insert overly attractive male stars name here*, but i cant be with you because I'm a witch.
The second half of the first season and the second season were going somewhere prior to this stall.
For instance, the relationship with my first girlfriend could provide enough content for an interesting film, but a director is misguided if he thinks that showing me on the toilet for five minutes is going to provide any sort of entertainment value.
If this film was shot with two video cameras and submitted as a first year film school project it might make for an interesting watch but as a director's 6th piece it is baffling.
It's this dishonest use of IMDb that's caused me to write my first review.
From the mind of genius Don Coscarelli, this film is the first in the Phantasm series.
The first five minutes we see some really bad actors go into a cave where there's a monster.
Let me tell you first that you see him for maybe 3 and a half minutes, so this is blatant false advertising.
In a nutshell the movie wasn't that great, and it was disappointing to see Cerina Vincent try to out act the bad storyline, after a first class performance in Cabin Fever.
She spends the whole first half of the movie wallowing in a pool of alcohol and self pity because she caused the death of her best friend in a drunk driving accident.
The first 20 minutes plays out like a weakly dramatised infomercial on the dangers of drink driving, the two characters we have a handle on by this time are about as deep as a cookie tray, seem to have an almost fatal case of the clichÃ©s and just as "she" confesses to "he" that she was responsible for her best friend's (and his girl friend's) death - what do they do?
Bottom line: bad acting, worse script - would have been more satisfying to see everyone killed in the first five minutes and then watch the monster wander around aimlessly in the woods for a few hours.
I was expecting the best comic book movie of all time because of the hype, but it turned out to be worse than the first one, which I didn't think was that great either.
Better than the first one?
I actually enjoyed the first SPIDERMAN (2002) with its simple, focused story of Peter Parker (played soundly and solidly by Tobey Maguire) bitten by a radioactive spider and discovering that he had unusual abilities to shoot webs from his wrists, scale buildings, and sense things!
The point of the first one was that Peter was a kid (a high schooler for cripe's sake!)
This sleaze basically stole the woman meant to be your girlfriend in the first movie and you let him get away with this?
The action scenes are not bad, but really not that different from the first movie.
Not content to describe once how good certain parts of a child's body were when roasted and eaten, it describes the heinous deeds in fact and again in a first person voice-over narrated by an actor playing Albert Fish.
As many point out, the first 10 minutes or so of the film is missing.
The Alpha Video release seems to be fairly complete with the entire story intact (except for some splicy sections in what was probably a 16mm television print: The story does make sense in this version which has the entire explanation of why the criminals are on the ship in the first place and what the doctor's motivations are.
That's probably incorrect and doesn't represent the original theatrical release, but rather some random individual's timing from a DVD or VHS tape that wasn't complete in the first place.
I gather from some of the other comments I've read that the copy I have (on one of those Mill Creek 50 Movie Packs) is missing the first several minutes of the movie.
Recently got one of those Mill Creek 50 pack of horror and mystery PD movies (Tales Of Terror) because there were about 25 of these programmers I had not yet seen.I was already aware from experience that the quality on most of these is less than desirable but some can't be had anywhere else or were not worth paying ten bucks for alone.In this case I was taken royally as this print is missing the first 8 minutes or so leaving one to guess the rest.
At least that's the plan, but things start to go wrong and things are revealed to be not what they seemed at first.
Doesn't it bother anybody that the movie's producers kill off the star of the first movie within the first 10 minutes?
Yes, the first Iron Eagle movie was predictable, totally 80's and far-fetched...BUT it was entertaining and fun to watch.
I was excited when I heard about this movie and eagerly tuned in to watch when lo and behold you see the hero from the first Iron Eagle, Jason Gedrick, get KILLED in the first 5 minutes!
Then you think, well maybe he's still alive, after all, in the first movie you thought Lou Gossett Jr's character was killed and yet he turns up alive and well at the end!
The first film was so-so, and the sequel is rock-bottom.
In an attempt to tell a more serious, or adult story Furie reject everything about the first film that made it work.
Instead he chose to take all the fun out of the film with in the first few minutes of the picture.
The first film was more of a Teen movie, it stood out because of that fact.
He never seems to have the same energy as he did in the first film.
The contrived Love story didn't work at all for me, it felt like they were again trying to take the story into more adult territory and in that lost the point of what makes the first one so good...
Iron Eagle II was as ridiculous as it's predecessor however the edge of the first one and the overall amusing teenage vengeance angle is in favor dropped in favor of your basic military mission that for the most part is watchable if not too interesting.
Now, bearing in mind that Doug had shot down dozens of evil, nasty non-American pilots in the first film, and that was without any training, he would now be an even better pilot, since he'd joined the US air force.
However in the first two minutes of the film he was shot down and killed.
Much of the footage is from the first Iron Eagle.
"Very loud,"The Producers" "- as Noel Coward might have said.10 minutes of it goes a long way.I remember the posters on the Underground when the movie first came out.
While Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet's careers have taken off quite grandly, fate has dealt him the unlucky hand and he gets to co star in drivel like this, where he first speaks with a weird American trucker accent before being magically transformed into a more smoothly spoken evil alien type guy.
The opening of the movie, with two white kids in a foster home ripping off a store owner with a box containing a rock instead of a cell phone because they want to buy some burgers for their dog, is the first blow to the movie's credibility.
What kind of morals does that teach, first of all?
I first watched this film when I was 8 or 9 and it freaked me out beyond terror.
Mike has just had his first encounter with the ghoul known only as The Tall Man, but it definitely won't be the last.
No other director could bring to it the sparks of originality that spawned the series in the first place.
Everything that the old films built up over the first four films and then maintained steadily through no less than nine entries is picked up, raised high in the air, ungentlemanly dropped and repeatedly jumped on, until there is nothing of the magic left, and everything that was once great about this franchise is destroyed beyond recognition.
Perhaps viewing it for the first time in the 21st century just doesn't provide the necessary atmosphere to appreciate what this film is about.
I had rented the first film (from 1993, remastered by Tarantino in 2002, I think) and had really enjoyed it.
The first film depicted the Iron Monkey as a sort of ninja, concealing his identity.
It managed to keep me watching, but merely to see something spectacular happen (and I'm still waiting) A BIG problem here is that the movie does not fit much with the first one: the 1993 film was set in the 19th century.
I watched "Passenger 57" first; kept wondering why Snipes was so thug-ish during the whole film, till he walked into the sunlight with the pretty lady.
Also, I missed the first hour, so part of my brain was able to work at reconstructing the plot while I watched the eye-candy.
I'm not gonna rip on stuff like how completely unlikely it is that someone (especially in 1994) would have as complex of devices as they had in this movie because lets face it, this isn't Stallone's first unrealistic movie nor is it probably his MOST unrealistic movie.
I like this movie for its setting(so exotic, so alive, and up to date) In fact, so up to date that this is one of the first movies that had modern cellphones in them.
The stress isn't laid on The Tall Man in this first episode yet, and the ultra-cool Reggie (an ice-cream vending guitar player with a ponytail) hasn't got that much screen time, neither.
The first one (released in 1988) is a highly recommended film with an overload of macabre splattering and black humor.
At times, this first sequel was even funnier to look at than the original.
I can remember loving the first two flicks, and I still do enjoy them.
I am a huge fan of the first and second Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, they were both fun films that even the oldest adult could still have fun too, I grew up with the cartoon and movies, so I just loved them from minute one.
Please, stick to the first and the second Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, those are really the worthy and fun movies for the classic cartoon and story.
The first Ninja Turtle movie was a classic; the first sequel however was okay but tried to hard to be family-friendly.
While I was glad to hear Corey Feldman's voice as Donatello after his absence from the first sequel due to the drugs along with seeing Elias Koteas as the crazed Casey Jones, the film wasn't the same.
The third film removed any sense of seriousness left over from the first film and amplified the campiness of the second film.
On a positive note, Elias Koteas returns as Casey Jones, one of my favorite elements from the first film.
One thing I liked about the first two films were the opening sequences, which were nice suspenseful build-ups.
When the Turtles made their first appearances during the pre-credit sequences, you felt like cheering.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III is just a big insult to the the fans who had been waiting two years after the first sequel for another Turtles adventure.
Well after the amazing first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film and the second not quite amazing but still good Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2:The secret of the Ooze the turtles return to the big screen for the unlucky third time where in the first 2 films they had a great opening sequence like in the first we had never seen the turtles on the big screen and really alive before so they kept that suspense going for about a awesome 10 Min's we finally see them all together right after there about to jump at the main titles and in the second one the turtles all jump up and the main title goes right there it was pure awesome and everyone couldn't wait for them to come up.....but in the third there is no thought no imagination its just the turtles dancing witch couldn't even succeed at being funny and brings me to splinter witch if you think splinter was an undeveloped character in the second...wait until you see him in the third splinter is supposed to be a main character that teaches the turtles but in this movie he just stands in his under ground house and at least the first two films he looks really cool but in this film he looked like a puppet behind a wall and only appeared in a few scenes witch was pointless so lets get to the plot April buys a some sort of time warp thing and warps the turtles in time and this movie would have been good story and have something that fans wanted such as shredders return and the debut a krang if thats what you are hoping to get......your wrong...instead you get 2 weird stupid undeveloped characters that nobody cared for why?
because we didn't know these characters from the cartoon show and they don't look cool there just siting on a horse shooting guns and ones the gos guy and other is the bad guy and the Michaelangelo gets kidnapped witch keep the turtles back April as well gets set back in time where her and mike and prisoners and the turtles costumes just look so awful it isn't funny and there is only a couple fight scenes not involving all the turtles until the end at least the previous films had more then one for scene with all the turtles more then once so as you can see they pretty much went wrong where ever this is buy far the worst tmnt film as well as it being one of the worst films and let downs ever and goes to show that most three's in a sequel flop the first,second and fourth tmnt films are all great so lets just pretend the fourth is the third and leave this horrible film as a past and killed off memory.
I mean, I was disappointed when I saw it the first time; and considering I loved the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, that has to mean something, right?
This film is crappy when compared to the first (which was a masterpiece) and the second (which was OK) combined.
The first feature film, complete with man-sized turtles played by actors in suits, was a low-budget triumph.
That last point is where the first sequel, and this one in particular, went wrong.
As a direct result, the budget allocated by Golden Harvest to the third Turtles film was a mere fraction of that allotted to the first film.
Given that the first film was dedicated to Jim because it was one of the last things he worked on before he died, this is quite the sad come-down.
While the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles will never be confused with the likes of RoboCop, the first film went back to the roots of the original comic book and depicted a world that was, for all intents, rather dark.
Okay, I was a fan of the first movie.
Okay, first off, there's NO fluid movement to the Turtles AT ALL.
In the first movie, he was nuanced and realistic, but I guess that's why the folks at Jim Henson's Creature Shop make so much.
Okay, I know the cartoon series was too but the first movie did have a hard edge to it.
The first 2 had a rather believable Splinter but now he's juddering and stiff and obviously operated by a couple of technicians loitering a few feet off camera.
It adds a unique twist or two to the plot, but nothing you couldn't have predicted in the first reel.
Special effects were reasonable, although the multiple alien spacecraft sitting in the crater, each one an obvious copy/paste of each other... at first, I thought it was a computer wallpaper.
I was sucked in by the first third which set up a believable situation involving strong motivation for an uncivil act.
Difficult for the writers first of all, to keep a story together and include comedic bits without it all seeming to be just a patch quilt of non-related ideas.
And the story still has some good spots during most of the first disc.
You had created the first six Final Fantasy games, all of which deserve a place in the pantheon of video gaming (and number 6 can compete with Chrono Trigger for the head seat at the table).
Marketing: FFVII's release marked the first time a video game had been so widely advertised.
Anyway the point is that all of the comedy in this movie is confined to the first half and the second is an overwrought drama, which beats its message home.
And it is impossible for me to understand how a movie that half consists of routine slapstick in its first act, and doesn't even attempt comedy in its final act is the 39th funniest movie of all time.
Oh wait, I know, it's a freaking "classic" first off, and not only that but one that champions the film industry itself.
Oh by the way, the little joke I made in the first two lines of this review, is funnier then anything in 'Sullivan's Travels'.
At no point during the first 85 minutes did I feel even remotely interested in what was happening.
To be honest, the first 85 minutes could have been easily condensed to less than 30 without much loss to either plot or character development.
When the final sequence of events took place, I could not help but feel cheated at the rather superficial treatment of the primary issues that the filmmakers were attempting to address - especially considering all of the screen time that was literally wasted during the first 75% of the film.
My final issue with the film is the first ten minutes which are as wooden as any episode of "Murder she wrote".
Is this a stylistic device or are the first ten minutes of the film just really badly made.
The first half of the movie, we don't see Vincent; instead we see the action from his eyes.
The film has first person camera work which is excellent, and the supporting cast is fantastic.
I first saw this film at a test screening about 6 months ago.
The motivation to make it in the first place clearly comes from someone finding a big abandoned house in which to shoot the majority of this very unscary piece or rubbish.
Even first 15 mins of the movie don't save it.
The first hour of this movie was very entertaining, even if it did offer up the normal clichÃ©s of the day.
In fact, most people agreed that this film was great for the first half, horrible in the second and was filled with too many clichÃ©s that ruined a movie which good have been a good one.
Things weren't so bad to begin with, with the first entry of a new decade the fairly standard Up The Jungle.
Will it be able to reverse the downward slope that began right here, with Carry On Behind, the first truly bad entry in the series?
Unwilling to compete with such material, and having lost both Rothwell and star Sid James (he died onstage at the Sunderland Empire theatre in 1976), the series plunged into serious decline with the following entry, CARRY ON ENGLAND (1976), a wartime farce which swapped wit and cleverness for puerile pratfalls and naked female breasts, earning the franchise its first restrictive censor rating in the UK (AA - no one under 14 allowed).
The pacing is bizarre with a ton of plot simply explained through voice-over (the hanging verdict in particular seems unlikely as shown) in the first half the second half with Karloff stalking the elderly drags.
Nothing here has been improved upon from the original the first remake, and if you've seen either, then this is completely unsatisfying.
At first his brother Jody (Bill Thornbury) doesn't believe him, but when Mike shows him a cut-off finger surrounded by 'yellow blood' in a little wooden box he had saved as proof, Jody starts to believe him.
Once it does, it unfolds well at first, with the early deaths resembling accidents.
His weak, vacant expressions and flat delivery are evident from his very first line.
It takes a while to get going (nothing much happens in the first half hour), but when it does there's scarcely a letup.
I was confused from the first 2 Min's of the film!!..
i turned it off after watching the first hour... shockingly POOR!
At first I saw that this film was rated a 10, which I never see on here.
IF YOU WANT TO GET RECOGNITION FOR YOUR "GROUNDBRAKING" DISCOVERY: first you should do is study, learn maths, physics, or whatever area your discovery covers, preferably a bachelor or masters degree.
To say the only positive about the film first: the interior of the space station looks impressingly claustrophobic and some of the details in it are well thought.
A great first effort by the director - shows a lot of promise.
But the story is pretty bad and while the dark space station sets a claustrophobic mood at first, it starts to get annoying at some point.
They look alike in many ways, sharing a radical vision of movie-making and story telling but where the fountain kept me involved in the character development process and opened some thoughts, "Dante 01" just got me lost somewhere loosing the meaning of it's concept - or maybe I never got it in the first place.
If you can't guess how the movie will end after watching the first ten minutes or so, you just aren't trying.
In the first fight scene the hero fought very well; expertly.
I first read the book, The Indian in the Cupboard with my Reading Class when I was in sixth grade, and I enjoyed it.
The first few minutes of the film (around 10 minutes, but it seemed like 30) show Kinski as the Marquis.
The first two Glenville films were not very good, but competent efforts in the slasher genre (with some particularly disgusting gore sequences in part 2).
Like I previously stated, the idea behind the film is good and since this is one of Spadaccini's first efforts, I give him credit.
I guess the first installment of this series was about being nice to people (and not blow them up).
However, things take a turn for the worse as a terrifying set of events happen to Rebecca, first she finds the body of a dead fisherman in the lake, she sees zombies walking around & a strange girl keeps popping up.
Of course she gets the message and sleeps with the first guy who gives he a kind of semi-compliment.
The first thing that struck me was that this was actually a comedy!
This is a major spoiler for you who haven't seen the movie yet, but it's a fun one, and the reason why I thought this movie was a comedy at first: Her dad wakes up in the master bedroom, coughing - he smells the gas and yells something like "honey!
When the first corpse spoke I almost wet myself with laughter.
"Too Scared to Scream" is completely lifeless,dull and bloodless outing in the slasher genre.The acting is awful,the pace is extremely slow and the final motif of a knife-wielding killer is so painfully stupid that it has to be heard to be believed.Anne Archer in her first role is incredibly wooden,and there is almost no blood and gore to be seen here.So don't be fooled by other reviews-this is one of the worst,most boring slash'em all flicks I have ever seen.1 out of 10.You'll regret seeing this your all life!
The first flaw is that the main guy is not even a ninja.
It seems that they have ported to PC just to rake in the profits, no thought to current day graphics,Try it out first before you spend your money.
This may be the first FPS I have started that I may not finish.
These first twenty minutes can be analyzed scene by scene, but there wouldn't be an iota of credibility or intelligence in it.
Wouldn't he shoot at the "bad man" first?
Maybe if I had seen this when it first came out I would have loved it, but today, it's just dull and stupid.
another thing, I never heard anything about the swat team killing kids at columbine, your the first person to mention this, I'd really like to know where you got that nugget of information.
If this is an alternative medium challenging the military industrial complex in the US of A, the "big" media etc., why is the only message of this film; "Do not trust anything federal and first of all - do not let go of your guns.
This was my little brothers' first movie.
My first movie was Disney's "Beauty and the Beast," and it was one of the greatest films ever made.
Sadly, my brothers' first film, this, was one of the worst films ever made, but I won't let that count!
The first 30 minutes of" 911: The Road to Tyranny" I was appalled.
Secondly: every person who are right in the head knows that not all TV-reports are 100% accurate: all the first TV-reports from major events are always based on rumours, which always are exaggerated, and all his so-called "evidence" is based on this.
At first i believed it, but then i began to think, and realized, that it could not happen in a society like USA.
Granted, ONJ is a singer first and an actress second, but even Judi Dench would be hard-pressed to make this role work as written.
Johanne Nail plays the mother, and she goes through so much that in any other film she would have been dead after the first reel.
honestly, the first several times i watched this movie, i turned it off an hour into it because it was so boring.
The school scenes were so unrealistic -- c'mon, on her very first day at school a black girl completely befriends her out of nowhere and treats her like she's her best friend, even sticking up for her to every other girl in school.
Possibly because it means that for the first time (in his life, quite possibly) he can tell himself, 'I'm not a buffoon!
Rather than first showing the movie that I came to see, and saving "Filthy" as a bonus for people who wanted to see it, Andrew Allan and co. made the decision to show "Filthy" first.
the first time I saw this movie, I thought it was boring.
My young daughter and I watched it together, and at first I was ready to change the channel if it got too scary.
The opening sequence to the film, kind of a Rube-Goldberg type slapstick thing which ends with a man almost getting drowned in his car, is a dead giveaway to the audience that this film is not going to be in the same league as the first two Supermans.
Unlike the first two films, the stuff that is supposed to be funny simply isn't, and most of the stuff that is supposed to be dramatic is spoiled by bad timing or misjudged performances that ruin any sense of involvement in the film.
Superman II was also very good, it lives up to the first one, and the new Richard Donner cut coming in November should be even better than the one we're all accustomed to!
After the first seqel though, is where things began to change...  At the end of the 2nd movie, "COMING SOON SUPERMAN III!"
was the first sentence in the credits.
How can people claim that Superman 3 is better than the first 2?
Truly Amazing, considering the great talents of Richard Donner who brought one of the most beloved superheroes to life in the first film.
To be frank, the only redeeming qualities of this film are Ol' Supes fighting his evil twin (also known as Bizzaro) and the first appearance of Lana Lang, played by a young Annette O Toole who is much better in Smallville than she is in Superman 3.
To those who assert that this film is truer to the comic books than the first two, I beg to differ.
The first two films are kin to the best Superman comic stories.
Supes hair is jet black...or did no one look at the first two movies?
Did they fire the SFX people from the first two movies and hire some graduate of Devry?
when i saw this for the first time i was more of a kid than now......a little kid and i was a big superman movies fan.....i even liked this one a bit....and when i see it right now i still enjoy some of it....it is enjoyable to see superman turn evil....it is the best part of the movie....or maybe the only good part of it......richard pryor is too dumb at some parts of the movie and the opening credits belong to a Charles Chaplin movie.....a bad Charles Chaplin movie........the musical score is not bad.....mostly because it is filled mainly with John Williams' music but still it could've been much better........the only excellent thing in this film is Christopher Reeve's performance......but the rest is disappointing....specially when the big computer battles superman....disappointing but certainly better than the fourth superman movie........** out of 5
Superman II was a very strong sequel despite all the production woes, but has not held up nearly as well as the first film, and now plays more like camp in many spots.
The first Superman was grounded in a sense of reality, even if it was a comic book one, which is noticeably absent from much of Superman II.
In the first film, Metropolis always seemed like a real city with real people inhabiting it.
The first message conveyed is that Arabs are evil and behind attempts to sabotage peace talks.
After the first 15 minutes the film was like this : Every time the main character(a man) meets a woman , the woman attacks to him sexually and...
The animation is so unnervingly rigid and stagnant it makes La Jetee look action-packed, the character design makes it almost impossible to discern what gender characters are without looking at their chest or waiting for their first line of hideously cheap, unpleasant dialogue, and it manages to pretty much clinch the victory for the most vile main character in history with the titular Angel.
This movie came out when he was 5, and I saw it for the first time in years, and I wish I never did.
The first problem was that it was too americanised.
At first it held my interest, until I saw the similarities to "Rosemary's Baby" up to a point.
Why didn't she get that gun the first time she saw it?
To be honest, I missed the first 15 minutes of this..and should of missed the rest.
At first glance, A*P*E* would appear to be the worst movie in history.
In fact, if it had a first run presentation in the 1970's, I'm very surprised I missed it then.
The first time I watched this, I was so tired at the time, nothing made sense.
By then they were using first names.
Homosexuality is denounced here for the first time in the film, full of hysterical assumptions and fears that are so absurd one finds it impossible to believe any audiences even took the film seriously.
It's also funny that the writer (Mike Mains, the worst actor in the film) wrote himself the part of having the first primary relationship in the film.
When the first TV series came out I thought it was a marvellous adaptation of those books, complete with Ringo Starr's lugubrious narration.
Jabez then starts out again at the beginning of the movie...literally, we are just brought back to the first scene with Jabez, and then the movie abruptly ends.
It actually looked as though they just replayed Jabez' first scene over and called it the end.
As for Alec Baldwin a scene where he goes to meet Webster for the first time is not to be missed.
OK, first of all.
Without her soft-core porn scenes to keep your eyes peeled for there'd be no reason to tune in in the first place.
I am a fan of Bring it on but Bring it on again isn't what i have expected it to be.I thought the actors were better in Bring it on.The routines were not as good in bring it on again.When the movie was over I thought it basically just started and that they never had a very good ending.It was definitely not as good as the first movie.I thought they were going to go to the nationals but then the movie was over!Bring it on again would of been more enjoyable if they continued the movie until the nationals...like we don't even know how it ended!From now on I am never going to watch a cheer leading movie again but i will watch it if Kirstine Dunce comes back in a cheer leading movie!
I loved the first one.
I think thats what made the first one so much fun.
Compared to the first movie, it was the worst thing I have ever seen.
To follow the first movie, which combined routine-stealing and race issues, with this movie, with a plot that basically follows all cheerleader movies, is just bad.
If your a big fan of the first movie this isn't the movie for you, its nearly as good as the first one.
I wonder if the casting director or the director approached any of the actors that were in the first "Bring It On?"
I borrowed the movie from a friend because I liked the first one.
The first one at least had its funny moments like the part with Ian Roberts, and the girls were hot.
Bring It On Again lacked the originality and flair of the first film.
It tried to be exactly like Bring It On and used the same format that the first movie used.
Later, we get the audition scene that the first film has made a classic but the second film poorly imitated.
That seems to be the major problem...the sequel tried too hard to be like the first film and didn't have the style or energy the first did.
It trudged along trying it's hardest, but lacked everything that made the first film great.
There was no sense of personal style, but it seems as if they gave first year filmmakers some low budget cameras and told them to make it look like the first film.
The cinematography slightly resembled BIOs style, but didn't have the flair that was introduced in the first.
It would've made much more money and would've been a much better film if they had most of the original cast signed on and a better script that could've placed the cast in a college or elsewhere and brought on the same collaborative team that helmed the first.
OK so the first bring it on movie was NOT the best movie ever made, but at least it was good and made sense....bring it on "again" was in my opinion a sequel from hell...i mean, it's OK if people like this movie, but compared to the first one, it had really no point to it other than that the new cheerleader gets in a cat fight with head cheerleader, new cheerleader forms a squad of people who didn't even seem to know wut cheerleading was, in like, 3 days she trains them from freaks to actual cheerleaders, they oddly "win"....blah blah blah..it's storyline is like, the exact same as the first one.
Well i liked the first one Bring it on, I mean, Kirsten Dunst, Eliza Dushku and Gabrielle Union..at least we know who they are and they rock on that movie..!
Makes me wanna say maybe they should just stop on the first one and everybody would be wow nice movie, know what i mean?
No acting, no story, just a cop-out of the first one.
), i like the first one, and I LOVE bring it on 3 & 4 .. but this one?
The first "Bring it On" is no masterpiece, but it has charm and manages to be very entertaining.
His one puppy-dog like expression seemed endearing in the first fifteen minutes of the movie, but later translated to simply bad acting.
The movie chronicles their tale of first love, along with every obstacle in between, such as Al's friend who directs porn movies, and his father, who wants to start with a Cops -like cooking show with his son.
The first fifteen minutes were a sweet, almost realistic account of first love, which many people could relate to.
Freddie ("She's All That") Prinze Jr., and Julia ("10 Things I Hate About You") Stiles are attending a New York City college when they discover each other one night in a trendy bar and experience love at first sight.
Not long after Imogen (Stiles) and Al (Prinze) shack up, the anxieties of living together take a toll on the 'tingles' of the true love that they felt when they first met.
A few years pass, and Imogen and Al rekindle the old flame or 'tingles' as they referred to them about their first love.
I saw this at its first screening (with many walks-out).
The acting is embarrassingly awful with a convoluted, super-dumb plot that only managed to create some unintentional giggles for the first five minutes, until it becomes a total boredom.
I'd like to say it's a good film by Full Moon standards and by the fact that this was the director's first picture.
Judith detains Lincoln but they are both locked in a store room with a steel door while elsewhere Hesse crawls across a strange glowing spot on the floor badly injured & bleeding, as his blood drips onto the floor an evil demon is given the power to bring some of the various toys to life & Hesse first has his face chewed off by a mutant Jack in the Box, he then has his fingers bitten off by an incredibly vicious teddy bear & finally Hesse is shot by a toy robot using blue laser beams.
The script by David S. Goyer who has since gone on to write massive Hollywood films such as Blade (1998), Blade II (2002), Blade: Trinity (2004), Dark City (1998), Batman Begins (2005) & the upcoming Ghost Rider (2006) film was amongst his first & after this it's a wonder he was ever let near any of those films.
The killer toys themselves lack imagination except the Jack in the box who is the first toy to be killed anyway so don't expect to see a lot of him.
I liked this movie and it gave me the "heebie-jeebies" when I first saw it.
8 What was Diesel 10 doing there in the first place if he was such a pain in the a..?
This is only the first time I see Christopher MacDonald in a lead role (he usually plays supportive characters) and he already fails to convince us of his acting capabilities.
First things first, I love the classic Seagal movies.
A lot of people felt the acting in this movie was horrible.Yes some scenes were badly acted and a few of the actors were really bad, but it was their first time and this was the director's first film I believe.To me it seemed like real life and not the worst acting i've seen in a film.
Anytime you get a first time film maker who writes AND directs their first film 9 times out of 10 it's going to be a mess.
Basing it on the Shining Time Station theme was the first mistake.
In the first a man watches girls.
In the third he watches them again, although there's a suggestion that he may have acted on what he's learnt from the first two.
The secondary love interest (Simon Baker) didn't make us feel she should be attracted to him, while the boyfriend (Adrian Grenier) made us wonder why she took up with him in the first place.
If I hadn't been with a friend, trapped in the middle of a row in the theater where I saw this movie, I would have left within the first five minutes.
She's tough and, at first, snarky, but we never truly believe that she's evil.
The whole premise of her accepting the job in the first place is that she can then move on to enviable roles in other magazines.
Why should Andy or anyone else sacrifice their promotion for co-workers that never made any effort to be nice to them in the first place?
You obviously had precious little in common in the first place if girlfriend + an unusually stressful year of work is enough to eviscerate all that you used to have in common.
Let me say, first and foremost, that this is no WAITING FOR GUFFMAN.
That first scene, in which he scares the crap out of an entire plane load of people just so that he can teach a 'lesson' to some Congressman just leaves you shaking your head in disgust.
I don't know where the Love Boat plot style first originated, but SFI follows this to a "T".
I was initially confused as I thought that Annie (Kelly Galindo) may have been a different Lacey, but she was someone trouble by psychic visions of a boogeyman similar to the one in the first film.
Almost all were written in the first few months of 2005, many in March.
All of them were posted in the first half of 2005, and almost every one of them--no matter what the country of origin (and there are lots of those)--misuses commas in the exact same bizarre way.
I saw the movie last week for the first time in theaters and I see why I have no memory of it.
"Galaxy of Terror" is a movie that I saw for the first time almost 20 years ago and my reaction to this movie back then was "OH THIS MOVIE IS DISGUSTING!!!"
I just saw it again recently, and my reaction was pretty much the same as it was the first time.
This is the same James Cameron who went on to direct big box-office smash hits such as the first "Alien" sequel "Aliens, the two "Terminator" pictures, "The Abyss", "True Lies", and the current #1 box-office blockbuster of all time, the Oscar-winning "Titanic".
Because it's so nonsensical, don't be surprised if you lose interest if you experience this for the first time, and as for the ending - you have got to be kidding me - 80 minutes of my time for THAT payoff?
The woman has been having dreams about the Boogeyman and his victim's from the first film.
Biggest Mistake #Two: They tried to fit the entirety of the first two comics (about 30 pages total, and in small print) into one half hour show.
The show first debuted with a fresh blend of comedy, action, a tad of romance, and a great set of characters, based off DC Comics' well known teen-age super-heroes.
But this was obviously not true, since there were no more hints made after the first season.
Mr. March provided better support in Bow's first sound appearance in "The Wild Party".
Mr. Allen is the first sailor to appear, and he does very well in his supporting role; this film offers a unique opportunity to see the attractive Mr. and Mrs. Bell on screen together.
It's one thing if that had been an original film that was the director's first and sucked.
Don't even think of watching this without first reading the book.
There should be some sort of test you should have to pass first before being given a budget, any budget, to do something like this.
At first he is depicted as a cunning warrior out to save his fellow Maori, but he makes some very stupid mistakes in the end, ones that defy explanation and logic (unless you buy the "revenge always trumps intelligence" line).
Mutch of the film is constant and annoying flashbacks from the first movie.
The movie really is about a psychic woman who has visions of the first movie.
I have seen the first movie I don't want to see the same scenes over and over again and I don't know who would.
This film is an abomination.It's nothing but footage from the first film.
Also, whatever moron patched together this turd didn't even bother to watch the first film, because they kept calling Suzanna Love's character Natalie, when it's Lacey.
If I had any alternatives to watch, I would have ejected it within the first 15 minutes.
The ENTIRE MOVIE is flashbacks from the first Boogeyman movie as well as, inexplicably, footage from another Uli Lommel / Suzanna Love film Brainwaves.
Okay, first, I'll make it clear that I am not a Mummy fan.
I think this may be the first flick with some passable production values (you can hear dialogue, they know how to do lighting, etc.)
I was lured in to watching it without doing any research first and was under the illusion that it may in some form be related to Francis Ford Coppola's classic, "Bram Stoker's Dracula."
So a few minutes into the movie and there's the first flashback.
I think nothing of it at first.
Then the next flashback which is a bit longer and I'm sitting there thinking "Yes I've seen the first Boogeyman!
Was Annie just having flashbacks of what happened in the first movie?
Or was the stuff from the first movie just happening at the same time as this?
With no actual scares, this film becomes a campfest from the very first minutes.
In essence, everything that the first "Superman" film (1978) did right, these guys got wrong.
Years and years after I saw brief fragments of this absurdly grotesque Spanish "Superman" knock-off on TV, during a special about the worst movie productions ever made, I finally the full film for the first time!
Go lie on a bench and move your body first 10Â° to the left and then 20Â° to the right.
After the first half of the movie, though, the characters that you are introduced to and all the previous plot twists become completely insignificant.
In fact, the first half of the movie is completely different than the second half.
So, I suggest you watch the first half then catch the last 10 minutes if you are interested.
Secondly, LOADS of recycled bits from the first movie.
It serves as a framing device for the endless clips from the first (and possibly second) movies.
I struggled through the first 30-40 minutes, and then could not bring myself to watching it to the end, so whatever I say here is based only on the first part.
The film fails to generate anything even remotely resembling a laugh within the first half an hour, leaving little hope for the rest of this sorry debacle.
But as a young 22 year old Austrian Bodybuilder's first film it's not his fault at the time he couldn't even speak full English.
this, is NOT one of those films it is one of the biggest pieces of tripe I have ever scene, the camera work is trying to be flashy but it really just crap the whole thing looks like the red shoe diaries, but without the sex, the only reason I bought this was I wanted to try out dvd and this was the cheapest one I could find, possibly the worst buy of my life and could have put you off dvd forever, the soundtrack is REALLY tacky and most of the movie is made up of endless repeats of clips from the first two films, why anyone would want to make a movie as awful as this is beyond me, if they had really attempted to make an original movie and failed I would be nicer in this review but they don't they just got the rights to reproduce stuff from the first two and then edit it and repeat it into this film with about maybe under 1 3rd original footage which is about up to the standards of film school students, DO NOT buy this movie.
Then we have main supporting character Arnold Stang, an actor which has exactly two different looks: one of utter confusion, probably because he's wondering about what the hell he's doing in the movie in the first place and one look of not so utter confusion, which he often uses when Hercules flexes his muscles for him.
Director Sean S. Cunningham,probably more famous for directing the first and ninth in the Friday the 13th series(among other films),helms this pic and looks pretty unfamiliar with comedy in this effort.
The acting, by Garfield especially, is first rate, and the mood convincingly downbeat, at times depressing.
However, this is another case where a first time director, working from his own plot, is felled (and his projects fails miserably) because there is no director to call the writer on the weakness of his plot, or no writer to argue with the director about where the move is being moved or pushed away from the script -- or simply to toss ideas around with.
He tries use him at first to get stuff, like good grades, and when the alien fails the alien is tortured, beaten, and thrown in the trash.
Steven Chow's next movie should be a horror film called "Revenge of the CJ7s" and it would be about cute fuzzy dog aliens avenging the death of the first CJ7.
Let me first say, I did not select this film to watch, but it was scheduled on TCM at our movie watching time and my wife and I agreed, what the heck, lets watch John Garfield whom we had not seen in quite a while.
I was riveted from the first scene to the last!
It also has some drawbacks, physically you are limited with what you can do.This is where Blackburn errs.The first half hour of scene setting as the characters get to know each other is fine, and the sex scene is convincing.
If only "Donkey Punch" had SOMEWHERE to go, plot-wise, after the first 30 minutes or at least tacked on a bit more T&A and a lost LESS of that hair lipped-meth-head and overly forced "alpha-woman" BS, it might have been able to hold my interest a little better.
That sounds like the opening scene of a softcore porn film, and at first it seems that that is exactly what "Donkey Punch" is turning into.
This was director Oliver Blackburn's first feature film; I can only hope for the sake of his career that his second will be a huge improvement on his first.
The first half is genuinely terrific, as six lairy, sexed-up twenty-somethings flirt, take drugs and confabulate on a yacht anchored off the coast of an unnamed Spanish island.
I wanted to leave after the first two scenes.
This film tries to position itself as a comedy in the vein of American Pie but whilst that movie (and it's first sequel) succeeded at being both entertaining and engaging Surf School fails spectacularly on both counts.
Frankly, I was bored rigid after the first 30 minutes, and couldn't wait for it to end.
The actual events started off being subtle, but then we are quickly thrown head first into an array of crazy events that feel like they were there to cover up the many plot holes and show off ILM's command of the effects.
The first one was bad, so I unsubscribed, and then the other two just sat there for a month.
The first thing I thought of was when Tommy Lee Jones's character went to the American Embassy and he saw the holes in the wall on the outside of the building.
In fact, the entire first half of the movie has extremely well shot war scenes, plus surround sound used as effectively as it has ever been used.
At first I trying looking at it as a serious drama/thriller held in the ranks of many of the other courtroom classic dramas.
Literally, the first scene of this movie is the best one and it just falls off a cliff from there.
Be warned though, that first scene really isn't very good.
Body and Soul isn't the great fight movie Â the first half of the movie is often too conventional and formulaic for that Â but it's certainly a contender even if it loses the title to The Set-Up.
(Possible spoilers)  I've just watched this film for the first time.
This is very disappointing work for Frances Marion, who is one of the first important screenwriters in film history.
The stutter was endearing at first, then pitiful, then it just got annoying near the end of the movie when it finally dawns on the audience that Nicholas D'Agosto's character doesn't actually help him conquer it.
This is my third time watching it; the first two times I made it to the end and was highly disappointed both times.
The direction in the two important fights, first with the fabulous African-American actor and former pugilist, CANADA LEE and then the final fight, were so well wrought, filmed and edited that it utterly destroys any movie made before or after which dealt with boxing.
At first it feels, albeit unpleasant, at least informative; however, as the film wears on, it becomes even more unpleasant, loses its informative nature, and begins to feel distinctly exploitative in tone.
Cool calculus - this was my first feeling when I saw this very disappointing Chinese film.
In fact, why would the enemy even send buffaloes through a canyon in the first place when the entire good guys army is safely positioned on the ridges of the mountain?
It would take at least 5 viewings of this film to understand the plot, and if someone actually bothered to submit themselves to such torture, they would realize that the plot was virtually inexistent and thin in the first place.
Most of the Indians would remember this movie as the first one, at least the first blockbuster, where the heroine openly bares her breasts.
Upgrade to first class and watch a better film.
This will be the first of Charlie's concessions and unfortunately not the last.
Charlie at first agrees knowing that there a big pay-off for him in the fight.
Ben angry and agitated at Roberts, whom he never liked in the first place, goes into a fit.
In the ring the fight goes into the late rounds with Charlie carrying Marlow for the first fourteen rounds with only one round left for him to throw and lose the fight to Marlow.
This was her second film, she was in another science fiction travesty, Mesa of Lost Women first.
They are all eventually captured by the mysterious woman and her Zombie sidekick Ivan (who looks weirdly like Alfred Molina who has managed to put on an overcoat with removing the coat hanger first) and locked in two cages with bars wide enough to slide a well greased elephant through, let alone a skinny teenager.
Also, how come there's a dam on an island in the first place?
I am so disgusted that this kind of low-grade film would even be in stores to rent in the first place.
  The irony of this film the is that the reaction of the producer in the first few scene, should have been the same as the real producer.
Whereas Hercules in New York (one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's first films) can pass it off as being an amusing look at Arnold's struggle to grasp the English language and succeed in being funny, the Muse is trying to be funny and failing badly.
If you happen to waste your money and decide to see this film, you will be running out of the theater within the first hour.
1/10 for the first hour or so
Next time I will log on and see the review first.
It is kind of like what Beverly Hills Cop 7 would have been after they had started to go downhill after the first one.
I first noticed this DVD in a record/movie shop some months ago.
Easily one of the most misguided projects in film history by virtue of its dogged determination to site the camera itself as the first person narrator point of view.
Demonstrates conclusively the absurdity of first person p.o.v.
When I first became very enthused about film noir, and began collecting about every tape I could find that was labeled such, this was included.
The first confrontation he takes a punch that results in a black eye but it leaves him unconscious!
OK, let me get my criticisms out of the way first:  Bad acting.
then in the first action scene they all act like they're meeting each other for the first time.
I couldn't make it past the first 15 minutes.
oh yeah, and even the first scene sucks.
All of the cast is awfully pretty (at first it was difficult to distinguish between any of the three blond male leads, two of whom are twins!
He, of course, is really the anti-Christ but at first brings peace to the world.
After the first half-hour, you'll be looking at the clock, fidgeting on the couch, and wondering if there's anything good in the refrigerator.
For my first Lombard movie I must say I'm pretty disappointed and really hope this isn't her best work.
First off, the first twenty minutes or so of Mary getting married, etc were never even in the novel, and basically wasted space in the movie.
Ex: If you hadn't read the book, you think "what the heck happened to Mary's first husband?"
In the first part of the film, obviously wholly lacking in any meaningful direction, she tries to portray the flighty young Anne but does so as a 2008 girl, complete with the same knowing looks and arrogant insouciance you would expect to find in that wonderful satire 'Clueless' (1995), rather than in a period drama.
She was accused with him (he was tortured to admit guilt) and with all of Henry's friends from the time he had first met Anne, her brother was thrown in to make sure there was no sympathy for the Queen.
Why was Mary sent off in a coach when the first person to have one in England was the Duke of Rutland in 1555?
The "Other Boleyn Girl" hit theaters today, and of course, I was in for the first showing.
I've been anticipating this movie for over 2 years now, ever since I first heard it was in production.
But this first it was most certainly not in front of the whole court and followed by a hunt in which Henry takes a tumble, to be nursed back to health by Mary, Anne's OLDER sister (the movie and book portrays her as the younger sister-this is false).
Anne was in love with and betrothed to Henry Percy at the time of her first meeting with Henry.
AgainÂAnne most strongly wanted to marry her first love, Henry Percy, Duke of Northumberland.
No, he would not have raped Anne for their first sexual encounter.
and to show the monster in full body view from the very first frame, rob the animal of its ability to be menacing.
It started out slow, and I was somewhat sceptical for the first half hour, but it turn out to be a hilarious very well acted movie.
At first he seemed too much of a clean cut, white, dorky football star to be the drug dealer he was, but as the movie went on, it became more apparent why this "disguise" made sense.
Irene Dunne also sings in this movie but as much as I love and admire Irene for having been a great actress, singing was definitely not one of her strongest attributes and especially the first number is quite embarrassing; it would have been better if a professional singer had dubbed her voice.
While we're on the subject, I don't even know why Smith, and his co-star, Griff Rhys-Jones ever bothered making this piece of trash in the first place!!!
But I want a comedy to be first, funny in a real life way, which this is, and secondly entertaining, which this definitely was.
This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen (the first 20 min of).
After the first 10 minutes I was like "well OK they just need to get some action started and then the movie will be worth watching" and then after 15 the first action scene came, and what a load of crap that was.
So after seeing the first action scene (app.
Apparently no one has ever fought Diamond and lived, yet Amy conveniently manages to do just that within the first half-hour of the movie.
Whether the sky should fall Whether the skyyyyy should fallllll Just as long as we're together It doesn't matter at all...  Great wrap-up... too bad about the first 85 minutes.
Bennet' first was a stunt-men in the Seitz's serials.
The feared and effective Gestapo act like a bunch of buffoons as their knocked out and disarmed by Eric & Co. after they first disarmed and arrested them.
The Germans trying to untie themselves and not at all feeling threatened by a blind man, Sandling, sitting guard over them have the shock of their lives when Sandling becomes the worlds first suicide bomber!
I should have seen this ambush coming, from the very first office/room whose walls were constructed out of curtains.
As my first English teacher said when she was looking for something nice to say about one of my essays: "Good transitions!"
If a movie doesn't catch my attention in the first 30 minutes I won't watch the rest.
That's fifteen years ago, with Soavi having done lots of TV work in the meantime -- maybe the reason why "Arrividerci amore, ciao", his first big-screen venture after more than a decade, is exactly looking like a professionally executed RAI Uno television assignment.
In the end of course the director who kicked Arnie out of the agency in the first place turns out to be working for the mob; vindicating Arnie's tactics as he becomes number 86 of his victims.
As soon as Arnold joins the mob we know everyone but him is going to be dead at the end, and not only that, he will be rewarded for his mass genocide (He gets reinstated for killing roughly fifty men, forty-nine more than it took to get him kicked out in the first place).
And the viewer is inevitably going to wonder: why did they torture us for over an hour with all the secret-agent business, just to get to a "Commando"-type final showdown, where Arnie is able to kill dozens of enemies simply because they are too stupid and slow to get him first?
What's great about the film is the writing, first and foremost.
The first half is OK, but chapters in Japan are purely awful.
2", in my opinion the first time Tarantino did more than steal from other movies.
When I first saw "Kill Bill 1" I thought it was a good film with lots of references to Quentin's favourite movies, the first Tarantino film that I could enjoy.
I know that the dialogues are pretty weak at times (a real problem for Tarantino, by the way), but it's the first time I could see this director do more than make references to films he liked.
And in the first place, why did they wait patiently for Uma Thurman's character to wake up?
And it contains strange techniques that at first you think is simply an homage to a film genre.
When we first start the film up we get a shot of the underbelly of a large spacecraft emerging from the top of screen and seeming to be infinitely long a la Star Wars.
Why does Keitel want to build the robot in the first place if all he really wants is Fawcett?
To begin with, the first few scenes appear to have been grafted on to the rest of the film.
He has also brought along a new robot, "the first of the new demigod series" to aid them.
At any rate, here's a review based on an adult's first viewing.
At first, with his wooden portrayal and monotone, I thought HE was the robot and maybe Douglas would be the madman.
I remember seeing this when it first out, in a theater, and thinking ... why?
I love entertainingly bad movies, which is what this movie is, and at first glance, you may notice the all-star cast of Farah Fawcett, Harvey Kietel, and Kirk Douglas, but these are the only 3 people in the movie!
The ending was stoopid to the first degree.....
It looks the BBC are trying to infiltrate the entire country because it's the first success they've had on a Saturday night since Strictly Come Dancing (and no I'm not going to mention Robin Hood).
The film follows the story of a pilot from the 366th Fighter Wing at Mountain Home AFB who goes to the Red Flag exercise at Nellis AFB for the first time.
Okay, first let me say, it takes a lot of horrible things in a movie to make me think I wasted my time.
The first 10 minutes seemed to be OK but then everything fell apart.
This is where the first zombie inserts herself into the narrative.
Bartlett and Gates may have been the first to capitalize on this first-person shooting gimmick for zombie movies in the venerable tradition of movies like "84 Charlie Mopic," "The Blair Witch Project," and "Cloverfield."
The appearance of the first zombie is only mildly shocking.
The first sign that The Zombie Diaries was going to suck?
The Zombie Diaries is presented as a sort of documentary-like presentation at first.
The first account, labelled as day one, is of a group of documentary makers.
I wanted to pull my eyes out with a cork screw the first time I watched it.
The movie exist of 3 diaries of people who come in contact with a zombie infestation (newsgroup, young couple who escaped and group of survivors on a farm) that the director tries to connect in some obscure way and filmed in a Blair Witch kinda first person angle.
The first "diary" makes sense (a newsgroup) and is a way to do a movie I can appreciate (Diary of the dead, ReC), but it absolutely made no sense that the guy accompanying the young couple and one of the survivors are filming (to the absurd in the case of the guy with the couple).
Don't get me started on the make up and special effects because the average Goth in the street looks scarier than what this director let loose on the world (and that's taking into account the first person camera and the darkness)  In short, I don't really understand why some critics can be so positive about this movie and the current score between 4 and 5 seems about right  other titles I recommend: Diary of the dead, Rec, 28 days later (for the English angle)
However there is more than one camera here and the director gets completely lost in first twenty minutes by mixing them.
The first 15 minutes were painfully slow.
Far from getting the feeling I was watching a documentary, I had more the impression I was watching someone's first student film.
The thing that annoyed me about this film was the shaky camera movements, it was tolerable at first but became a nuisance after a while, the storyline is very confusing, it even at times felt like there was no storyline, because the characters were never really developed enough for me to care about any of them, they actually bugged the living hell out of me, it also never really built up any suspense, at least not for me, because given the fact that I didn't care for any of the characters the film just bored me, plainly put.
The special effects and makeup appear to have been done by students venturing into their first foray into gore.
The first 20 minutes or so are competent, establishing the normally reliable premise of a curious stranger stumbling upon a paranoid, hostile town.
This first becomes apparent when the first group of 'survivors' encounter a zombie in a farmhouse they were supposed to be staying in.
The first time this is done it is quite suspenseful Â by the 5th time it happens, all suspense is lost and you are simply left watching a tactless idiot take 10 minutes to walk down a hallway and open a door.
Though I returned a day later to finish DIARIES, my opinion of the film on my first attempt hadn't changed.
On that note, it's about what one can expect for a first effort.
That is not obvious here, rather, Steven Soderberg's film goes the longest way possible to get a conclusion that is obvious, if indeed the film has a conclusion in the first place.
The first word is COMEDY.
There is some arrogant smell in the air that I felt heavily since I saw for the first time Mr. Soderbergh old fashion sort of feminine style glasses frames and it was strongly confirmed by watching this movie.
I don't know about the first part of that, but I strongly disagree with the latter conclusion.
From the moment you hear that first gunshot, you feel an air of cheesy action crapfest ahead of you.
You have to have a little patience with this movie, sort of like with the first season of ST:TNG.
Let's just say that Lynch is the subtlest of all the actors, many of whom look like they were doing their first job.
From the first few minutes the film is just annoying to watch, there are some fine actors but the overall optimistic & downright annoying feeling simply makes the film unwatchable.
Let me first say that I like "The Little Princess".
it had all the ingredients, but is ultimately ruined by two thousand times overused clichÃ©s which seem to have become fashionable again nowadays (see, for instance 'Brokeback Mountain' or the French 'Le clan'):the first one: the old homosexual teacher, OF COURSE, had to die at the end (the fact that is is a motorcycle accident and not a bashing doesn't matter, finally...); the fact that everyone mourns him at the end does not matter, the moral is safe, he finally 'paid for his sins'.
He also gives a jolly rousing speech in the House of Lords which makes us actually care about him for the first time in the film.
(I never learn)  The movie begins and the first few minutes are full of Vince goodness.
The first shop closes up, and Shawn, Wendt, et al are never seen again.
And the first girl still wants to marry him.
The first half of the movie was pretty good.
You laugh the first time and then it is an exercise in cringing as you realise you are supposed to be frightened of this thing.
This is the first film that has made me wish IMDb allowed negative ratings.
This movie is an unbelievable drag... first of all it has a very trashy look that is obvious from the opening of the movie.
What no one yet realizes is that Lombardi has somehow managed to take Andrea back to her very first incarnation - that of a killer sea monster.
I introduced my daughters to the movie first and later I read them the book; they didn't notice many differences except possibly the age of Sarah in the beginning.
The couple is rich and the daughter really likes this guy, but he apparently hates these people, which begs the question "why is he staying with them in the first place?"
To be honest I cannot elaborate on this one, as I only saw the first half hour of the movie.
The first half hour (fair is fair) is the most bewildering piece of fiction I ever saw, combining the utter idiocy of, say, the Police Academy series with the astounding 'la-di-dah, oh, what great art I'm making'-attitude of films as "Ulysses's Gaze".
Worst first half hour ever, but hey, maybe the rest was good.
Instead, the first 10 minutes are pretty much the only thing the movie has to do with the girl.
This is the first time I have ever seen a serial killer film in which you don't find out who did it, and it doesn't really matter anyway (and really, guys, the first thing I thought of when the body had something cut out of its skin wasn't "covering up bite marks," it was a tattoo)...
Shame it's a really tedious documentary, I mean you had all the elements of a great documentary, guys with inflatable wands, telling a bunch of uni students they are planning to feed third world countries with first world feces.
One of the first big jokes centers around a presentation made in Finland about a ridiculous phallic employee monitoring device.
Eventually, we get to see the first prank at a conference in Finland.
It was the first movie I ever owned and so I am greatly attached to it.
Now, I will be the first to say that she has wonderful muscular body which I am sure took years of passion and hard work to achieve, but that is not enough criteria for her to be placed into a film wearing a white ala Marilyn Monroe dress and made to walk around the ghettos of Bulgaria.
Nine Queens was a great Argentinian film, and then there were, of course, remakes of this first movie because of it big success.
This one succeeded in the first but only because it failed in the second.
This is just after he screamed at his wife Julia (Cherry Jones) for putting the jars out in the first place.
Next we see him getting some work, and the first place he goes is to get more beer.
of camera...  From the first action i new this wouldn't be a good movie.
As if these characters had ever shown any real interest in each other in the first place.
The director was doing the "you-are-there" jiggle cam for the first 10 or 20 minutes of the film and gave up on it.
Senior Warrants I knew personally would speak to general officers on a first name basis.
I first encountered this version of A Little Princess, by far the best, on a PBS station in the Pacific Northwest.
If you've never seen a version of "The Little Princess" or read the book--obviously read the novel first, then see this one.
If so, I suppose he began ingesting brain numbing substances after the success of his first movie.
The desperate attempt at character-development leaves one yawning through the first half, and the direction seemed amateurish at best.
In one scene, when Karan (Hrithik) sees the LOC for the first time, he claims being overcome by a feeling of belonging (to India).
I know this is Canada's first attempt at top model, but you would think after 6 seasons of ANTM they would have taken some notes.
The first mistake they made was making Tricia Helfer the host.
The second half of this 7 hour - film cure for insomnia - is slightly more interesting than the first half.
Generally thought to be the first official Laurel and Hardy release(although PUTTING PANTS ON PHILLIP is also put in this bracket),the boys don't wear their Bowler hats and have their heads shaved,but are very much a team in this early effort,more so than PPOP where they play against each other rather than for.There's plenty of amusing incident and situations(especially when they attempt to escape the jail as painters);one slight quibble is that as convicts,the characters they have to play here have a very slightly more unpleasing edge than they would be establishing only a few films later in the partnership.Still funny though,and Jimmy Finlayson's double take and fade away is worth a few more laughs as well here;in early publicity material the boys were sometimes billed as 'Hardy and Laurel' in this film;that soon changed.
I remember seeing this film when it first came out, and also remember that is disappeared from the video store shortly thereafter.
It's an average film that's fun the first time round, and may even offer a few surprises (frankly, I didn't expect it to end the way it did).
This is just a terrible film that sinks and stinks, from the first moment to the last.
The extras are cool, as they contain behind-the-scenes footage and more concert stuff not on the first DVD.
Of course this is television so they needed a crisis to compel the hero to build the thing in the first place.
(My friend bought it too)I was expecting some live performances and videos, but when I first saw it I realized it was so much more!
POSSIBLE SPOILERS:the screenplay is not that much strong,and the suspense is not really here.The first hour is boring and what remains is a spate of clichÃ©s:best/worst example:the killer,leaving "clues" on the dead body ,I've seen it (and read it) so many times that it leaves me amazed :how can a writer ,fifty years or so after Agatha Christie and co,still think of a such hackneyed idea?Giving the killer's identity or the key to the mystery half an hour or more before the ending can be rewarding (such was the case in "vertigo" (1958)),but here ,it destroys any fear:who could reasonably think that the hero -and his girl-could be really in jeopardy after that?Only a whodunit could sustain the interest till the very end.
It's easy to sense bad writing when stories falls flat after the setup or the first act.
It's not like other multi or plural protagonist films, where they establish the characters we will get acquainted in the first act.
All the built up in the first act is thrown out the window.
And we never learn why Jan Thomas kidnapped a child in the first place.
As expected, the 3 other students are killed first by the creepy people inhabiting the mansion.
She doesn't want to be in the house in the first place and her character does absolutely nothing.
Saw it when it first got released on video in 1984.
This film is the first and the worst one of Kitano's films.
The first hour of this movie consists mainly of the main character (and others) slowly walking around.
of the first hour consists of sitting, walking, and 2 characters making small talk with no story significance.
The first time I bought this DVD and the first time I watched it, I was cracking up so hard all the way through.
The first few incidents that indicate that something is about to go horribly wrong aren't creepy at all - at that stage the audience is still stuck behind the first hurdle of, "What is the POINT of this theme park, anyway?"
Within the first five minutes of the heroes' vacation, they blow away a robot played by Yul Brynner.
He is supposed to be "off," yet when we first see him, his thumb is turned up.
When I saw the DVD standing in the store, I though,finally a movie about WWI, with Danile Craigh and it will be showing us the story of the first big push during the first great war.... NOT, it was more of a school play, and a very boring one.
Set in the run up to the disastrous first day of the 1916 Battle of the Somme, The Trench isn't entirely worthless, but it's not a movie, more a filmed play (despite being written as a movie), and a very poor one at that with that 1970s BBC For Schools television look.
There are a couple of good scenes, too, but it doesn't really have the ring of truth or authenticity - the mood seems more influenced by hindsight than the actual mood in the run-up to the first day.
In reality, the Bulls averaged around 6,000 fans per game at home when Jordan first joined the team.
(15) 1991 Playoffs - In the film, an announcer says, "The Bulls down the New York Knicks and are on their way to the first NBA championship series in their history.
(21) Birmingham Barons homerun - Jordan did hit two homers with the Barons in his first minor league season; the film shows Jordan hit one over the fence with the Barons in what appears to be a practice game or batting practice, not an actual game; the film is unclear what the circumstances are.
When I first saw this I wasn't much of a fan, and that wasn't due to comparing it to the original, as I hadn't seen Castle's 1958 version.
At first it all seems like a kind of practical joke perpetrated by Rush, who is given to scary stunts.
It seemed like an okay movie at first, when they showed the black/white clips, but after that it went downhill and hit the bottom hard.
Before I can begin to review the "remake" of House on Haunted Hill, we must first throw the plot, effects, and script out the window, because the movie does a pretty good job of that by itself.
Within the first forty-five minutes, Bridgette Wilson is already gone and there's nothing left but Famke Janssen, who does all she can as Geoffrey Rush's psychotic wife before she herself too, dies, and Ali Larter, who deserves so much better than this movie and can be seen in a much better movie right now, Final Destination.
The script was perhaps the worst i have witnessed in a long time, the characters were all so instantly annoying that i found my self wishing them dead with in the first fifteen minutes.
Chris Kattan from Saturday Night Live makes an appearance, and this brought my hopes up thinking he would provide some sound comic relief, but instead he spends the whole movie ranting about how "the house is alive," something we have known since the first five minutes.
If you watch "Behind the Scenes" on the first installment of this painfully cheesy and uninspired series, you'll hear the writers and actors waxing philosophical about how this movie is all about imagination, the struggle of good vs. evil, and how we can use the power of great stories to help us work through our own real life difficulties.
Well, first off I have to say i greatly respect Hunter Thompson, at least before he started getting more mainstream and writing for Rolling Stone.
This movie is first and foremost very boring, if you read Fear and Loathing or Hell's Angels, Hunter Thompson was real far out, into the pudding!
His masterpieces have wonderful soundtracks by composer Fabio Frizzi, great cinematography by Sergio Salvati and the kind of surreal and infernal ultra gory imagery that will stay inside the mind especially when experience for the first time.
I have seen many bad movies, but it's first really PA-THE-TIC ending in my life.
- 3. when Gable goes off to war - 4. when he first visits her at the convent & she sends him away - 5. when he finally stops pursuing her but promises to love her for the rest of his life ... and get ready for one more!
When they made vampire ash a drug that gave users a short burst of vampiric powers, the dealer was caught and beaten within the first 5 minutes.
MacLish (the first Ms. Olympia) runs around in front of the camera in spectacularly "cut" condition, and she's not wearing a whole lot of clothing to hide her muscle definition.
For the first half of the movie I thought McLish wouldn't talk, for the second half I wished she hadn't.
In this Class B action film, she's the female equivalent of Arnold in his first action movie, "Conan The Barbarian."
Within the first few minutes 'Warlords of the 21st Century' (isn't Battletruck the better choice?)
In the first hour of the 91 minutes, a few people get shot, there's a few explosions, a weak chase scene and, you bet, some Battletruck destruction!
For the first time, I gave a 1 out of 10 rating to British mini-series.
As the Bible--and Spielberg in his Oscar acceptance speech--said: "In the beginning was the word..." With or without a significant budget, there first needs to be decent script, and this one just doesn't work.
I remember being first in line at my local movie theater at the opening day for this one.
Wilson has a tough time getting this one started, and it does manage to improve after a strenuous first half-hour, but the film's underlying emotion is just as fraudulent as the witticisms.
Nicholas Cage's Doug Chesnic is aghast to discover that his stint of personal duty towards the former first Lady is being extended indefinitely.
I can't totally blame him--English isn't his first language.
The choppy continuity (Dorian falls in love in the first three minutes...he "changes" after twenty minutes...and so on) renders the story shallow and meaningless.
You can't help but think about how disastrous the current situation in Hollywood is when the umpteenth representative of the infamous category "clichÃ© ridden, sugar coated American cute movies" arrives, and you've got to go see it because your niece is crying about itsince the first announcement.
Finally, the newspaper publisher arrives and announces that he's published Kit's first article.
I remember when I first heard about this movie; Seagal, Hopper, and Sizemore in a movie together; it sounded like a fantastic movie!
The first being that after a while, it was almost entertaining watching for the next goof.
My advice to others: if you feel the masochistic desire to see the DVD, and have any interest at all in the commentary, just watch it with the commentary the first time and get it done with.
The fact is this movie is utterly predictable from the very first opening scene to the ending credits.
Didn't get past the first 60 seconds of the film.
So, so disappointed in Diane Lane--the only reason I was interested in seeing it in the first place.
The script is the first disaster.
During the opening credits and later during the first battle, John Wayne is seen charging into battle on horseback, waving his sword in the air, and screaming like a Commanche with an expression of shear insanity on his face that had me busting at the seams.
Maybe while someone was out in the desert looking for that document they found the first trace of the real genius who wanted this movie made - Irwin R Shyster?
The costumes and animals were first rate and you could not tell they filmed the picture both in radioactive contaminated desert and radioactive contaminated movie set.
This was just the second film Powell directed (the first was Split Second, a 1953 noir film also for RKO that starred Stephen McNally and Jan Sterling), and it showed.
The first thing that comes to mind watching this movie is that is must have been a fan-flic.
the first highlander film was great the second and third were not bad but now its just completely lost its way.
goes from one thing to another back to first and then on some other tangent.
I am a huge Highlander fan own the series own first film own final dimension and own endgame.
According the official H:Sourse website, this is the first of a new trilogy...well if they move ahead with the other two, you can be sure they will be made for TV or straight to DVD releases.
This movie marks just another disappointment in a long line of disappointments after the great first Highlander.
Why do the creators insist on changing the story concept, first the planet Ziest and now there can be only one but there can be more than one?
From the first opening scene and voice over, I was trying to like this movie.
I came into Highlander with the TV series first, then the movies.
Like the last Highlander film that attempted a futuristic setting, this one misses everything that made the first film and the series great.
I loved the first Highlander movie.
I loved the first Highlander movie, loved the series, and have found every movie after the first to be pretty awful - but I watch them anyway, hoping against hope that they'll prove me wrong.
The first cut of the film has been released on DVD in Russia.
The first thirty odd minutes of this focuses almost entirely on Will, Jayne & Darren & feels more like a teen soap opera than a horror film & when the horror elements do eventually kick in they are pretty lame with Will trying to be turned into a Vampire & a bit of bickering between Julien & Claudius to see who is harder but they both come across as wimps anyway & really don't put up much of a fight at a very weak climax.
I guess the film is ok, if you absolutely loved the first one, but this continuing trend of finding lost footage and of more interviews is/was getting annoying.
You'll know who the killer is in the first five minutes, so there are only two questions to be answered: will the killer get Laura, and will Baldwin get Swanson, who continues to remain nudity-free after 55 films.
Missing in Action (1984) was the first in the Col. Braddock series.
The first scene alone made me fall out of my chair.
Two people are dead within the first 10 minutes of the movie, one, this Yuka character never has any significance ever again in the film.
Sure it provides adequate entertainment the first time you watch it, but this movie is not the kind you pick up to watch again a second time.
After watching the first few opening scenes in this movie, I thought this might be good.
The jokes came and went within the first 10 minutes.
I just recently watched camera for the first time (there showing it on www.lovefilm.com for free).
I walked in rather neutral with my expectations, and after the first 10 minutes realized that this ball of cheese was not for me.
The DVD documents their first tour.
Second, while the plan made sense at first, having the man taken from a secure cell where he was chained and putting him in a giant luxury tent made my head hurt.
The first Swept Away was terrific.
Delicious special make-up effects, like that one thing that first appears to be a talking lizard (the equivalent of a rubber sock-puppet) but then later revealed to be a midget in a rubber lizard costume.
A first strike against a drug convoy results in two apaches hit and three pilots dead.
The first widely distributed commercial movie directed and written entirely by 12 year olds.
At first, the shot is effective at building up the creepy, off-screen menace getting ready to strike out.
When I first saw the title to this movie, I thought immediately of the film Animal House.
PS - Thats just the first 3 minutes.
Her mother seems to sexually abuse her too, she treats her first child like an animal because the girl has down syndrome.
Alas, the first hour was not much of anything at all.
If you want to see one of the first films condemned by the Catholic church, tune in to see why.
The problem with the film was that the first ten minutes set up all the characters & a plot, but then that was it.
I generally liked her performance, except for her outburst in the first scene at her home, which seemed so overly dramatic that I could easily imagine it being a 30 Rock soap parody with Jenna Maroney cast as a character.
Now, things got off to a good start, and I do have to give the movie credit for showing rather than telling: as Jayce first walks the halls of her new school, the camera pans to show the very revealing clothing worn by many girls.
At first, I thought that I was watching either a dream sequence or a Jayce's exaggerated internal paranoia, where everyone was conspicuously and audibly talking about her and, later, THROWING FOOD AT HER.
I first saw the movie in a theater years before I read the book.
But his first movie, "Vidas Privadas" is a study is bad directing, bad editing, awful score, bad acting, horrible lines (out of a soap opera), novice photography and especially bad narrative.
Introduced to this show through a sibling who devoured R. L. Stine's books, I found I initially couldn't form my opinion of it since the first handful of episodes I saw happened to be based on the books I hadn't read (why is it the books you most want to read are the hardest to find?
Mercedes Ruehl (Jacey's mum) has had several roles like this, and I thought at first that I'd find that off-putting.
Aside from the first 5 or 10 minutes or so and the final 10 minutes this movie is actually pretty slow.
Brian De Palma, Robert De Niro in his first movie...it has to be good, right?
(And for the record, GREETINGS was the first film awarded an X rating, which says something about its content.
If you're going to see it, please turn it off after the first ten minutes.
From the first moments I was struck by the rosy, well-fed faces of the Russian soldiers going to the front.
If there is one memorable thing in the movie, and there is exactly one memorable thing, it is Gale Storm's first musical number - she is incredibly vivacious and sexy, in a dress which emphasizes her charms in a remarkable yet very chaste way.
With Let's Go Collegiate, Frankie Darro plays the coxswain on what might be Rawley University's first champion rowing team in 15 years.
I totally lost it at the very end when they were making the home video of Charley's first day at Kindergarden, I was in tears the whole scene!!
Some of the potential personal vendettas that were established during his first visit is cut to a minimum, and the entire coup is without any trace of suspense.
Unfortunately, after the first ten minutes or so it's too late to recover.
Also the "idea" he gets about using a blow torch to first fry up the egg residue and then sweep it up.
i usually hold in good esteem low-budget C Japanese monster movies, simply enjoying them with a child's eye ( as i saw them first ) and giving them credit for what they are (Eg i'm not expecting Orson Wells acting, nor Star Wars VI special effects ).
The first Godzilla film, in some regards, had some inferior special effects.
For the first time ever, it's plainly evident that the wire controlling his tail is visible on-screen, shimmering in the daylight scenes against the sky.
Containing the first real metaphorical monster and the first human death scenes since the first Godzilla film, this could have been a return to the glory days.
They ought to have made up their minds whether they were making a kids' film or a more sinister movie along the lines of the first Godzilla.
So, the audience does not understand that Mrs. Paradine, after having attended the first trial day, is shocked that her attorney tried to put the whole guilt on the valet.
The deplorable rest of the story goes as follows: When Mrs. Paradine sees that the valet gets more and more under suspect of being the killer, she starts slowly to make confessions, first in the form of suggestive remarks.
When Keane first meets her, the learned counsel is moved to utter: "Mr. Paradine could never have understood the sacrifice you were making (by marrying him.)
The first half of the film is slow going, helped only by the English upper-class interiors Hitchcock always photographed well.
Poised to become Europe's first "full-scale digital animation studio," their inaugural CGI feature is the $40 million adventure tale of Valiant, a traditionally diminutive Disney lead whose efforts on behalf of the Royal Air Force Homing Pigeon Service make him a hero.
Look like a college student's first film.
When I first heard about this movie, I wasn't sure what I would think about it, but since I watch lifetime movies like they are a religion, I decided to.
His house is overrun by machete wielding grunts, led by the same man from the first scene, who apparently decided seven years of hockey hair was enough, and got it changed.
I think you can count the lines of dialogue in the first thirty minutes on two hands.
I grew up in the North of England in the 1970s - was one of the first punks in Sheffield (where I understand the film is set) - and I don't see any authenticity in it.
I only just watched this film for the first time.
The first great thing about it was how totally simpathico I felt with the mum.
I used to watch that movie as a kid with my family and that was where I was first introduced to Danny Kaye's comedic genius.
Somewhere around the first half-hour, it became painfully obvious that it wasn't going to get any funnier or better.
When we first saw it last year on TCM, our whole family literally busted out laughing uncontrollably, with tears coming from our eyes during the rapid-paced knight-certification scenes (and this is with somewhat-jaded teenagers yet!).
But back to "Wonder Man" -- besides some of the positive bits mentioned in other reviews here, what really first struck me subconsciously early in this movie and then I became more consciously aware of as the movie progressed is how much it seems that Jerry Lewis lifted from Danny Kaye the manic, physical bits and persona he (Jerry) later became famous for and identified with in the 1960's.
Take the scene where the spirit of Buzzy possesses Edwin for the first time.
One of the most stupid thing he does is to put as much blood and gore into a story that didn't contain any of it in the first place.
I started to see the film's decline in the scene when Christine and the Phantom meet for the first time.
Vecino's fish is fresh at first, but is later in the freezer, as is the possibility of a relationship between Vecino and the mother.
Solas is an interesting failure and one of the first Spanish movies in a long row I disliked somewhat.
But it's probably the first silent movie to be made in the 70's!
Otherwise, I found it impossible to get through even the first 10 minutes.
(*I hate to give a schlockmeister like Steckler any real credit for creative force, but I keep wondering if he first got the idea of the two killers from the notorious Zodiac murderer who operated in California in the 1970s, and was never caught, as well as the "Hillside Strangler", who was caught eventually.)
She dies first, and he dies shortly after.
I take it that it found it's audience, as Steckler would later do a second film with Agostino (playing the same role - hey didn't he die in this first picture - only playing it in Las Vegas).
They ALSO expect us to believe that the FBI keeps its top secret files ONLINE in the first place!!
MarÃ­a first refuses all help from her mother who has to spend her days alone in the city.
Angelina Jolie even briefly gets her nipples onto film for the first time.
In fact, our protagonist is now shown adopting multiple disguises in order to accomplice his nefarious ends (a far cry from his head on brutality as displayed in the first two films!)
Oh well, one can always re-watch the first two over again I supposeÂ..
The entire first half of the movie is apparently dedicated to the development of the plot.
Later, when Steve Zahn finally returns to help the guys out with their Day Care, does the audience finally chuckle for the first time since they sat down to watch this turkey.
Stupid - there was a line about 4/5 of the way through the movie where the girl says something like "Let's get away from here" and I just had to respond "That's the first sensible thing anyone has said in this movie".
This movie is about an old woman's first experience in the big city.
Well, Freddie, I got a message for ya, keep dreaming'  When I first came across Shooting Gallery, Poolhall Junkies rip-off is what came to my mind, but for the sake of an argument, I gave it a chance.
We see Picard's quarters for the first time (why does Dr. Crusher enter without permission?)
If Malle were a first time film maker, there is no way that this film would have been tolerated.
seriously, was the first scene with the woman driving and hitting the badger or whatever really necessary?
Now, I have no ax to grind, and watched this at home twice over 12 months to ensure I wasn't angry at the world the first time.
Shakespearean actor Roger Rees in his first film role is generally good, problems with his accent aside and Mary McDonnel gives a very nice performance.
The cinematography and the score (by Washington composer David Kane) are both first rate.
I enjoyed the first half hour or so of a slowly unfolding story of family conflict, nostalgia for an interrupted youth.
The first half of the film dragged mercilessly, while at the same time facets of the plot were not fully developed, making the story line weak and non-sensical and the characters shallow.
And it isn't a good film The first 30 minutes are greatly hampered by some very stilted performances from a cast clearly struggling in an English language project.
The first of the 17 Scorsese films I've seen that I'll be avoiding like the plague from now on.
This movie never should have been made...maybe thats why it literally burned through the projector at its first screening at Cannes.
This film seems like a downer at first glance but there are some sublimely subtle comedic moments, despite the gravity of the situations.
I saw "The Old Man and the Sea" for the first time last night and I cannot say I really admired it.
The combined effect these two incongruities drove me the online Cliffs Notes, 16 years after the first time, to remind me of the mythic and Christ allusions again.
I first became aware of this movie back in 1971 when Rich Little plugged it on Dick Cavett's show.
I lived in French North Africa during the first half of the 1960s...and I was 8 to 14 at the time....I identified with the vintage cars a lot more than with the not too smart would be hood who was the hero.
The story concerns a family of extremely fat Hong Kong pork butchers, father and two sons, a young pimp who is trying to set up an internet call girl service and a beautiful young prostitute who blackmails the first two for a rich man we never meet.
This is the first Fruit Chan movie I've seen and it will almost certainly be the last.
I usually think that Liam Neeson is a good and interesting actor, but in this one he acts like he's on his first audition ever.
Well, the first and most obvious are the wretched songs.
It's actually amazing to think that Laughton was NOT in his first film but an accomplished actor--his acting was THAT bad.
Abbott and Costello were only a bit beyond their prime, ready to do the first year of their still beloved television series.
It's not really ever explained why there's a barricade in the first place.
It feels like the producers shipped the editing duties out to a first term film student...there are plenty of bad films out there, thankfully this one has been hidden in amongst the other dross on cable pay TV.
For people wanting to check out a movie like this, but done much better I'd recommend True Romance (1993- Christian Slater & Patricia Arquette) or the cult classic Valley Girl (1983- Nicolas Cage in his first lead role and Deborah Foreman).
And one wonders why they even bothered to kill Sira in the first place when the rest of the movie is about the villain, King Zagro, trying to force her to marry him?
This is my first film starring Samson Burke and I have to say that, physically speaking, he fits the bill for a S&S hero but the guy is kinda stiff!
If I had seen this when it first came out, then I would have thought it unfathomable that Tom Hanks would ever win even one Oscar, much less back-to-back Oscars.
When I first heard that a movie is going to be made by the book "Eragon" by Christopher Paolini, I must say I was very delighted, and I was even more delighted when I heard that Stefen Fangmeier will be the director.
The writers, director, and producers missed a real opportunity to make this into a great trilogy experience...perhaps they should have read the books first because they were much better than this.
We will forget the first attempt and bring back Rachel Weisz who made the dragon the best part of the film and it will be a better film.
Crude, unimaginative adaptation of Christopher Paolini first novel is a bad joke from top to bottom.
The tale seems stark and slow at first, and you think, O Lordy, this is a bit bloody grim!
When I first heard the idea behind this "urban operetta" or whatever it's supposed to be, I accepted it.
This, perhaps, is the great failing of the project, jeopardising its status as the first true "hip-hopera".
If you are the kind of person who could not live with watching the first two of the Godfather movies, steer well clear of 'Trapped'.
At first, I thought R. Kelly deliberately made this as a joke, but it seems apparent that he's taking himself pretty seriously.
The episode - as its successors in this first series - battles the intent of doing something remarkable in lyric storytelling with the dramatic dead ends of posturing, homophobia and brandishing firearms.
The first 30 minutes weren't really interesting, just some:"oh there's a time rift, black-hole whatever thing in this cave".
Two - a very complex storyline, based on a very long book with a difficult plot and many subplots... that wasn't a good idea for a cartoon, which gets lost Three - some good second level jokes and some good first level jokes.
GrÃ¼newald must be something of a German superman that an American widow falls in love with him at first sight.
Anyway, this spoof of "Basic Instinct" (with such side targets as "Indecent Proposal", "Body Of Evidence" and "9 & 1/2 Weeks") is certainly not lazy - there's a visual or verbal gag every 10 seconds or so - but, unfortunately, only a small portion of these gags score; the first 10 minutes are the best, the last 10 minutes, in particular, degenerate into sloppy idiocy.
For most of the people involved, this was their first and last film; one that I would have liked to see in more is former Miss California (or so the Troma DVD cover claims) Elizabeth Key, who is not only beautiful (though the nudity is provided by the other leading lady, Gloria Lusiak), but a pretty funny comedienne as well.
When you first see husband and wife together you assume she's clueless about the affair, just from their chemistry.
Though out of his league as the usual grade B actor, Woods succeeds here in the part of the first husband, who walks out on Russell after 10 years of marriage, 4 children and a life of hard times.
At first, life seems good for the newlyweds.
Naturally, it's not long before the more morally bankrupt members of the murderous trio decide that they wanna piece o' Lisa; to their horror, however, the girl proves to be not quite as defenceless as she at first appears...  Axe is one of many low-budget pieces of trash that gained notoriety thanks to its inclusion on the Video Nasty list during the 1980s, and, as such, will forever be of interest to those who are compelled to check out the 'forbidden'.
I can't even guess why it was banned in the first place unless it had to do with the rumor that the girl in the film was allegedly 13.
it was the first time i left from the cinema and didn't see a movie till the end.
To tell the truth, other than The Eye (the first movie), the rest of their works are mediocre, even borderline lousy.
The movie spent the first 30 minute developing something that only affects 5 minutes at the end of the movie, and that was the gist of the one and a half hour movie.
Well, in the high corner on the left of the videotape the first name written was Mickey Rourke.
Haralambides, a beatnik-wannabe himself, has a first go at creating a film with beatnik connotations all around.
This is Uma Thurman's first movie.
Louise's first failed marriage, her daughter who suffered infantile paralysis and her introduction to her future second husband (Jack Carson) - in a fish pond while dressed up for a costume party linger in the memory.
This truly obscure neo-noir from 1988 is memorable as Uma Thurman's first starring role and also has a bit part from Steve Buscemi.
Additionally, Steve Buscemi has a small scene as the sleazebag guitarist Johnny, for whom Sid spends much of the first part of the film searching.
This was Uma Thurman's first feature film, and she started her acting career right at the very bottom.
The second movie in the saga is by an extremely wide margin the very worst of them - it is actually completely awful in itself, let alone as a sequel to the great first APE movie.
I continually hoped that their characters would be killed first.
The only reason I rate this above a 1 is that it was just good enough not to make me stop watching after the first episode.
In addition, the first twenty minutes of the film where Keaton sneaks about town doing 'hitmanny stuff' is all very well arranged and is admittedly kind of cool - yet this twenty minutes does not in any way reflect the tone nor the level of quality you should expect from the rest of the film following it.
The first sign that this wasn't the movie I expected came in the opening where there was a music so depressing that could kill all enthusiasm.
We're first jumped into a chaotic scene, that BEGS me to laugh with an Indiana Jones joke and a chain of baby rabbits, when Chicken rings a bell in an Oakland town to warn everyone that the sky is falling in such a panic, later revealed that an acorn fell on him.
The entire first half is a rapid fire of high school clichÃ©s and a montage to a baseball game for Chicken's reputation to regain.
At this point, why did I have to watch the first half of clichÃ©s and sport montages when he becomes the village idiot again?
OK, at this point, why did they attack the city in the first place if they're generous?
The entire grueling first hour consists mostly of people sitting around complaining, while the last half hour consists mostly of people walking around in the "jungle."
In the first half of the movie, Deruelle obviously wanted to enhance the atmosphere by having crickets chirp for about ten minutes.
I expect something better with the prequel that is coming out this summer even though I don't think the people they chose to be the new Flintstones look like them as the first cast did.
First of all, I have to say, that I surf around IMDb.com a lot, but this is my first review here.
I watched this movie tonight for the first time in about six or seven years.
It just isn't as good as when it was hot the first time.
It is truly awful  The script is responsible , the opening episode features so many coincidences in order to bring the characters together it looses all credibility , but after the first episode it gets worse , concepts like the NDs ( They`re the bad guys from another dimension I think ) polluting the water supply and kidnapping humans in order to carry out experiments on them are underdeveloped and badly explained while entire episodes are padded out with the subplot of a Second world war army officer`s journey through the galaxy with a race of good aliens .
The whole thing made me wince all the way through the first episode, and I never got round to watching the rest.
You won't be able to get through the first hour.
I first saw this movie when I was 13 and thought it was the most suspenseful, exciting movie I had ever seen.
If I was out there at 70 below (which is ridiculous in the first place), I would have a forest fire going.
I saw the first 2 films and compared to this one, 1 and 2 blow this movie out of the water.
The ninjas in the first 2 films put up more of a fight.
This guy was awesome in the first 2 films but he wss smart to turn down this movie.
"American Ninja 3" has much of the same as in the two first movies, but with lower quality.
I really don't find the concept scary at all, so If I hang out with these ghostly metalheads (like I would hang out with metalheads in the first place) I will go crazy?
Brian De Palma used it to tell a story, Norman Jewison used to perfection in the first Thomas Crown Affair.
How about the great Leone showdowns with Clint, Lee Van, Fonda, and Bronson- the close ups of the eyes, the tension before the first man goes for his gun.
When I first saw Marianne Faithful in Irena Palm, she was so much the frumpy housewife that I almost didn't recognize her.
Scott Thomas is one-note severe, calculating, nasty - it's clear from the first that she and Auteuil deserve each other.
There were some nice touches here and there - the valet's father is chronically sick, but the doctor who attends him is even sicker and the father ends up attending to his physician more than the reverse; I kind of liked the jag-off cell phone salesman who is also pursuing Ledoyen, at least at first, he's so over-the-top smarmy.
From the very first scene you see him you either think he is drunk or in the "zone".
Regardless, I stand by my summary that this is worse than the first as those actors at least looked much closer to the actual characters and there was much more action.
It almost makes me think Hollywood is racist cause the first movie was on Guile( who was played by a french guy)...great casting there...and now this street fighter, Chun-Li is played but Kristen Kreuk...While I really didn't have much of problem with Kristen playing Chun-Li, I think they could of found someone more true to Chun-Li's character.
To a person who paid 85 dollars to get the Street Fighter Championship and Hyper Edition on Sega Genesis when it first dropped, this movie is not just a disappointment, but a mind-boggling failure.
The first half of the movie should of been back story and the second half should of been a worldwide tournament.
But at first, I'm pleasantly surprised!
Now at first I thought this is how he would start, then later in the movie he would get his Psycho Powers.
You expect Chun Li vs. Vega to be the first really big fight and it's actually the shortest.
A large chunk of the first act is based on Chun Li "living amongst the people of Bangkok".
When Tom(Kevin Bishop) chastises Maggie after he discovers what mom has been up to, for the first time, do we question her sense of morality.
When I first saw the trailer for this, I pretty much went WTF???
Now, it's bad enough that they made up such a stupid plot point to begin with, but can someone please explain something to me: just how is it that M. Bison could have actually even HAD a conscience in the first place if he was willing to go through with killing his wife and ripping out his daughter from her womb?
Perhaps the only draw of this show is the fact that in the first season it featured a little bit of nudity.
He understand the first and is wholly incompetent in the second.
okay, how shall I start.. first of all, I like you to know that you should not see this movie because it totally SUCKS!!!
: well, first of all, the special effects where made(apparently) with Microsoft Paint, its worse then Barbara Streisand, and thats really, really bad.
I too was smiling like the Cheshire cat when I first read the title of this film, wishing it was a doco.
At first shocked by the job description, she in desperation investigates the business with the help of her soon to be best friend Luisa (Dorka Gryllus), and accepts the job with reservations.
All their faults become virtually forgotten or forgiven, and their strengths, or the reasons they became famous in the first place, come quickly to the public's consciousness.
But, from early on to now, they're really went downhill: Encino Man: The first film where Shore had leading role.
It was in all honestly about the only thing that initially caught my eye about it because had the film taken place in any other time period besides the 70's I might have just happily skipped over it altogether, which would have really been the smarter thing to do in the first place!
But gradually through the course of the film first Wahoo (Oakie) and finally Jim (MacMurray) face responsibility and turn in the direction of the law.
It's the first review I write, but I definitely thought I should drop a line to defend this beautiful story that talks about what can a person do for a loved one, about re-discovering yourself, about avoiding stupid dogmas... And at the end it leaves you with a broad smile and a sense of tenderness that not so commonly a movie inflicts you.
The screenplay is terrible and barely maintains the viewer's interest for the first hour.
Nawab Sultan, one of the first clients of Umrao, sees Umarao what she is - a tawaif and abandons her with no compunctions to marry into the wealthy family of her cousin; others hurl insults at Umrao.
While in the original Rekha came across as this intelligent woman, Aishwarya Rai is just a pretty face and of course her Nawab falls in love with her at first sight.
Within the first five minutes, I already knew exactly what would happen in this picture and stopped caring immediately after.
SPOILERS AHOY If the ship was unable to reach landfall the first time, how come everyone assumes they will easily be rescued on the second attempt?
It seems more likely that everyone (including the soon-to-be-married main couple) will die given the arduous passage of the first unsuccessful attempt.
By killing off Jim immediately after (or during, it's not clear) his sister's first experimentation with sex, the cast and crew of "Rain" come across as a bunch of holier-than-thou moralists.
I'm not exactly sure if they changed writers or what's happened but basically for the first four seasons it was going in a nice escalating pace and then somewhere in the beginning of the fifth it just became dark and stayed that way.
"Les Ã©garÃ©s" ,in its first sequences on the road ,recalls RenÃ© ClÃ©ment's masterpiece "Jeux Interdits" .Then the scenes in the country far from the war might have been influenced by Louis Malle's "Black Moon" which would have turned "realistic",Yvan replacing the twins.
Forced by necessity and desperation Maggie does something that is at first utterly alien to her, but may yet become an awakening and salvation, a route to an identity she does not know she has and to new love.
After the first Rocky, the producers should have left this series alone.
My impressions of the first half: Too many characters.
The interrupted wedding gag was stale the first time.
While the first DEATHSTALKER movie played it with a straight face (making it a much easier movie to poke fun at), this second installment in the series is tongue-in-cheek all the way.
It did make me laugh as hard (or perhaps even harder at times) as with the first one, though maybe the enjoyment I got out of DEATHSTALKER II might be a bit less, how shall I put it... satisfying?
Part of the fun still comes from unintentional events, like scenes starting and ending abruptly, a chase-scene on horses were people just seem to be riding the same part of the road endlessly, stock footage from the first DEATHSTALKER (with a different look, easy to spot) inserted in this sequel for pointless reasons, etc.
Sometimes they use stock footage from the first movie for this purpose, but thankfully there's new boobage to behold too.
But you have to at least give Jim Wynorski some credit: He really watched and understood the first DEATHSTALKER movie.
He took several elements of the first film (characteristics of the 'hero', the nudity,...) and enlarged, emphasized and mainly spoofed them (out of the many examples of this, Warthog-Brute returning for a silly cameo is one of them).
The first thing that you are gonna think after you watch the film is: where is the warrior dress that Monique Gabrielle has in the cover box?
The first sequel, "Deathstalker II: Duel Of The Titans" of 1987 almost seems to be a spoof of its predecessor.
As the first movie, "Deathstalker 2" is again extremely crappy and therefore quite funny, but it seems that director Jim Wynorski as well as the actors and everybody else connected with this film were actually willing to do a movie as crappy as possible on purpose.
While the Deathstalker was basically a brutal and invincible Barbarian cheapo version of Conan played by muscleman Rick Hill in the first movie, the title character became a skinny guy with a tendency towards stupid jokes.
The dialogue is even sillier and out of place than in the first movie ("a cigar for the lady", "is that your sword or are you just happy to see me"...), the acting is (intentionally?)
"Deathstalker II" also features an Amazon tribe and warriors with human bodies and pig heads (one of those was my favorite character in the first film).
One of the main aims of "Deathstalker II" is to show breasts (although not quite as often as the first film), but sadly it fails to achieve the amount of gore featured in its predecessor.
I recommend to watch the first "Deathstalker" before watching this, and I personally laughed more during the first film, but I guess it doesn't quite make a difference.
Wynorski states on the commentary track that they tore up the first screenplay and reworked it because it was so terrible.
The first scene has our hero acting like Indiana Jones as he sneaks into a castle (the shot is lifted from Corman's own movie "The Terror," to steal a gem but then has to fight his way out.
), and this is the first time EVER I have actually left the theatre 3/4-way through the movie.
This is when Mickey Mouse debuted in the cartoon PLANE CRAZY and just a short time later, Mickey scored one of his biggest hits in his second film, STEAMBOAT WILLIE, as it was the first cartoon with a soundtrack (with sound effects and music).
O'Donnell's first proposal to Zellweger (and her reaction) is very funny.
How can a romance be effective if we don't buy the couple as a couple from the first scene?
Be careful of the early explicit sexual scene in the first quarter of the movie.
Personally, unlike the other reviewers of this cartoon, I found "Galloppin' Gaucho" very entertaining and I personally prefer it to Mickey Mouse's first two cartoons before it, "Plane Crazy" and "Steamboat Willie", for the following reasons: 1.
The first thing one notices about this film is that Michael Pitt speaks in a verrrrry slow monotone.
Amazingly the director also directed 'The Red Violin', a first rate film in almost every way - he must have been drinking himself into a coma every day since then or had a nasty accident that damaged his brain.
The film's become a camp classic, but it's actually just dull and awkwardly made for the first hour or so.
Anne Bancroft was first going to play Crawford but fortunately she came to her senses.
Even though she was the first runner-up for the New York Film Critics Award, Faye Dunaway disavows her performance as screen icon Joan Crawford because the camp following this 1981 potboiler has developed over the years has probably been overwhelming.
A plot anyone could have filled in after the first five minutes Dialogue that would have been embarrassing in a 70s movie (the old art vs commerce debate - please!
The relationship between "old man" Rea and his muse Polley didn't look believable at all to me, although in one of the first scenes (which turned out to be one of the only likeable ones) they seem to hit it off pretty well.
Someone actually asks her about her ideas for the first ever time in her whole entire life!
I'm a fan of the first Epoch.
Unlike the first Epoch, everything inside the Torus was different.
And My favorite Character from the first installment died.
If you like the first one, skip this.
He had more than that, those were just the first to come to mind.
The first 10 minutes introduce us to the main characters, a loving married couple living out their quotidian existence in an average house in an average borough of Los Angeles.
Though the primary characters may be readable, the authorities at first seemed to symbolise spontaneity.
Seriously, I was expecting the LAPD or something, but these guys looked and acted more like an ill-equipped SWAT team that were completely indifferent as to the lives of the inhabitants of L.A, which was at first quite intriguing, but eventually got boring and began to suffer from "I know what you're going to do at the end" syndrome.
I saw the trailer and thought o this looks like a good film, so i went to the cinema to see it and within the first 10 mins it got straight into it, which was great.
I found it unrealistic - so in love but when she first returns to the house he wouldn't let her in!
Even when the Handyman explains that it's worth the risk that he be with his wife & leaves, Brad is adamant his skin comes first, but concedes to sealing off a room so Lexi can come in out of the cold.
The first half of the story is a tense, feral journey through one man's experiences as bombs, which later turn out to be dirty bombs, explode on the morning commuter crowds streaming into Los Angeles.
If Mask of the Phantasm compliments the first 70 episodes of Batman: The Animated Series, Subzero compliments the 15 episodes that comprise the Adventures of Batman and Robin.
By airing the WB episodes first and then releasing this movie in 1998 was a mistake I felt.
As the film progresses to the actual 'zombie invasion' (which, strangely, wasn't the first ten minutes when zombies were wandering all over campus), it only gets worse and worse.
Sex/Nudity: The film spends the first ten or so minutes acting like softcore porn, but that ends abruptly and the rest of the film is spent mostly clothed.
All right first I'll vent my beefs' with the film.
JUBILEE was the first film to come from the true British punk rock scene, and has a fascinating cast, but unfortunately this is one of the most boring, pretentious, and ultimately pointless movies I've ever seen.
:( It certainly wasn't on the first disc.
In fact, its post-modern detachment and minimalist animation (as well as the title) suggest that its target audience is young adolescents feeling their first stirrings of rebellion and puberty, a time when even the most commonplace, unsophisticated vulgarity can seem forbidden, hilarious and daring.
Let me first say I am not a fan of this show.
Let me first say that I have a huge fan of the Television series.
See my first point.
Not only is Ving not the same character as he was in Dawn of the Dead but then they had the audacity to kill him off with the first thirty minutes and turn him into a pathetic, eye-eating, legless zombie.
Make sure you can finance the gore first.
Let's take the final instalment of a trilogy, the first two parts of the trilogy have already been re-made successfully by keeping very close to the originals, and give it a completely different story!
However as bizarre as the dead coming back to life is it's nothing compared to the dead climbing on ceilings upside down and running about and leaping 20-30 feet in a single bound all done with the brilliance of a "my first cgi kit" seriously the cgi in this film is awful.
Rhames plays basically the same character he played in the Dawn of the Dead remake, although he only appears for the first 15 minutes or so.
One being decent while the other, well, read my first paragraph...
I was gutted from the first twenty minutes.
In a decade of great musicals from all studios, Columbia, in 1955 managed to make a truly terrible one....and it is this one...and was their first film in Cinemascope.
It also might be Jack Lemmon's first film too.
I guess Columbia just wanted to make a splashy musical as their first Cinemascope spectacular ......but forgot to create one.....so they just copied the best bits of box office hits from the previous few years.
I once shared a second-floor apartment with a guy who seemed to have the most rotten luck in life: his first rent check bounced, he had endless problems paying his half of the bills, and his car was always breaking down.
One of the main problems of the movie is that the people who think they will like it, generally won't, while those that might enjoy it probably would never pick it up in the first place.
True, when the disgruntled artist Reno(played by first-time director Abel Ferrara) first goes on a rampage armed with a drill and 'porto-pak', the film does manage to touch a raw nerve, but soon it descends to laboriously-paced repetition and struggles to hold attention.
After disposing of the fact that this film was significantly under budgeted, and, in spots, more than a bit overacted, what remains is a realistically cold and existential account of the first day of the American Revolution.
I just had to fight to watch the first 30 minutes of the movie.
I know if a piece of sh*t like CITY HUNTER was the first HK flick I ever saw I would never bother to see another one.
Strengths of the film were Begnini's performance (though at times, it did come off as essentially the same guy he was in LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL) and the latter half of the film (while not great--it was light-years ahead of the first half).
Before watching the movie i thought it would be a full length comedy like Benigni's first works or maybe an amusing fantasy like Pinocchio.but,it was more like the film "life is beautiful",a romantic comedy that was not as impressive as that one was .
This could be the first fictional motion picture with such a portrait.
This TV film is based correctly on historical events developed in April 19,1775 , beginning hostilities for a shot was fired and starting the American Revolution, skirmishes among the British troops and the colonial militia were in Lexington and Concorde(Massachusetts); the deeds are the following : The first battle of the American War of Independence was in Lexington,northwest of Boston.Anticipating a rebellion ,The British general Thomas Gage sent 800 troops to seize stores at Concord and arrest John Hancock and John Adams ,two prominent American rebels.The rebellious were warned by Paul Revere(Vlasta Vrana).An advance party under Major Pitcairn encountered a party of about 50 Minutemen ,American rebel militia troops,on Lexington Common.They refused to disperse when ordered to do so,and Pitcairn ordered his troops to open fire.
this is not a spoiler by the way, it occurs in the first five minutes of the movie.
The plot is about these losers who still live at home, unemployed 40-year-olds who live with their mother and father they meet and they develop a relationship and get married Ferrel and Reilly hate each other and Ferrel does the worst thing in any comedy movie (besides Charlies Angels 2 with hiring those writers(even though writers isn't a word to describe them) he puts his balls on Reilly's drum set (no wonder earlier in this piece of crap he said "Don't touch my drum set") and then they find out they have more in common and they decide to start a new music band (REPLACE THE DRUM SET) and then Ferrels younger brother is in town this guy is a success with a love relationship Ferrel says he's an ###hole and the brother sells their house and they try to get it back by doing the unthinkable like dressing up as Natzi's and putting makeup on Ferrel's face trying to make out he's dead (if only it was real) and later Ferrel's younger brother runs out of people to sell it to and one night they release their first music video see they wanted to be in this band with 2 people the step-brothers and Reilly's father owns a boat and that's where they were filming it while it was in the water with nobody driving it.
I first learned of this film back in the early 1980's, while watching an episode of the "Siskel and Ebert" movie review show on PBS.
The viewer is not even sure at first, who Madeline (Gregory's sister)is.
Unfortunately though, the aisles and exits at the theatre I saw Step Brothers at were clogged with spectators who, beyond any intelligible reason as far as I can tell, were amused enough by the first 100 minutes to stick around for the encore, so I was stuck.
The two despise each other at first, but eventually become friends, especially when their parents grow tired of their immaturity and force them to try and get jobs.
I agree with other reviewers in that Walter/Wendy Carlos was only briefly mentioned during this documentary, especially when it applies to the Moog modular system (as recorded on Switched-On Bach, The Well-Tempered Synthesizer, Switched-On Brandenburgs, Tron and others) which were perhaps the first and most influential recordings of the Moog synthesizer of all time.
If you were ever an innocent adolescent and can recall your first infatuation with a girl with a wry smile, then this will make you laugh at yourself and cry at the same time - what more can you ask from a film?
I can still remember the cinema, the seat, the friends I first saw this film with - myself British and a friend Ausralian, both weeping with laughter as we recognised ourselves in that gawky Scottish lad, and his hilarious younger sister.
However my first thoughts on watching this film are: It repeats itself far too many times.
It only needed to mention that Moog synths were first used for experimental music and adverts once.
What about the first fall of Moog Music in the early 80s and the Moog Liberation (the first guitar synth - only problem was it was too heavy to hold!)
These are just the first 2 genres that spring to mind that were missing - I could go on!
not sure but just a warning so I can let my mind wander without worrying about it)  I watched this when it first came out and recorded it for the heck of it later.
I'll be the first to knock him out.
The soft ending is a major disappointment too, when this picture desperately needed a hard-hitting finale to drive home a point, one Mr. Gyllenhaal's film never had to make in the first place.
Feeling every inch like the tortured, angst-ridden romance that it should be, it's just so good to see a film that actually recreates the terror and fear that is associated with one's first love as opposed to overly sanitised teen love stories like "10 Things I Hate About You" or "Clueless".
the script and dialogue was awful as were the set pieces.. a total waste of 1 hour 45 minutes.. want the same experience but feel less cheated i suggest you put your head in a gas oven for that length of time but make sure the gas is off first.
Another inconsistency is the presence of several other librarians, none of whom can do what our hero undertakes on his first day of work; and the previous librarian, who was supposed to be pretty smart, seems never to have had a clue about the answers our hero has uncovered.
You know after the success of the first installment there was going to be a sequel.
It's satisfying to see the original director and cast returning for this sequel, yet they sadly fail to recapture the mood of the first film, and "Pat" Morita is not as impressive this time either.
The opening flashbacks to the first "Karate Kid" are the best this movie has to offer.
The main reason I'm posting this comment is point out that there are NO NUDE scenes featuring the femme fatal Christina app legate so if you mistook the R-rating,and the cover showing Appplegate pole-dancing as an implication that you're gonna see a "money shot" then do yourself a favor, don't make the same mistake I did when it first came out and don't bother renting it.
Watching 'Gregory's Girl' for the first time in over two decades, one is immediately struck by reminders of when it was made: the grainy film, the dreadful soundtrack, the big hair of both its male and female characters.
The plot was weak, with the only substantive storyline occurring in the first 15 mins., and the last 15 mins.
My sister remains freaked out about the little veiny-headed people to this day, so, being the evil little brother that I am, I hunted down a copy to give to her for Christmas, and watched it first.
What I will say though is that as a teenager, on the first couple of viewings, I lost interest after Carol turns up instead of Dorothy to tell Gregory she's not coming.
I comment on plot devices, so it would be somewhat spoiler, but the review doesn't work without the information Well, I saw the first in the series (noted above) and didn't think much of it.
Wastes the first hour wandering about plot-wise, then when the Mother is introduced, she is impossibly harsh (so harsh that the plot device of Beth asking for her help isn't believable, an elopement (or suicide) would have been more believable (and quicker!))
In the first movie he shows some brains/parenting skills.
So sugary I just about gagged, with WILD changes of heart that were completely out of character (Come on, should of used some that first wasted hour!)
For all the novelties that got it green-lit in the first place the final half hour is obsequious, indigestive bleurgh.
There is a shot nearer the end which echoes the film's opening, that of a girl shot in silhouette from a relatively long standpoint, only Gregory this time accompanies her in what is an item linked to the very first sequence of the film.
Except for the two first Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE films, if there's a movie with the word "massacre" in its title, it's gonna suck.
Okay, what makes a slasher is in it, some nudity and first person shots but still it is missing suspense.
They also knew when to hit the breaks, and take their money out in time first: Insider Information.
I'll be the first to admit that Moore distorts and stretches the truth to suit his purposes.
Now, I'm the first to agree on that he's not always accurate and sometimes not even right, but he finishes his mission which is; To make people think!
The truth is that Wilson should have practiced a bit more first before taking on a challenge as this.
You should have practiced by making some Youtube movies first to get warm in the clothes before going for the trophy; Michael Moore.
Well, I didn't see the first one.
The first is that while the alien female cast is definitely attractive (and I am not saying the human cast isn't), but it appears as if someone had instructed them to try and act seductively while playing a part and they just end up coming across like the actors in the crappy porn movies my flatmates used to find amusing.
ARAGORN is the first big problem.
I loved the first two LOTR films, and was keyed up almost beyond endurance to see ROTK the first week it opened.
This time, he couldn't be bothered, as if he felt that he'd paid his dues being accurate in the first two movies, and now he should be free to play around and have fun.
Sixty-some years after first seeing this movie as a child, I remembered only how cool I thought the bed in the wall was.
The first and most important fact to keep in mind if you have the good fortune to view it is that it is a turkey masquerading as a fantasy.
And the real Holland, Michigan today is to a large extent a Spanish-speaking community that reflects how quickly times change in the real world -- not that it ever was in the first place anything close to what this film fantasy conjures up.
Presley sings only the title song and only a fan with more time on his hands than brain power could sit through the first 30 minutes.
This was another movie that was supposed to represent Elvis' transition to that of 'serious actor' (the first was 'Flaming Star', 1960), but he just couldn't hack it.
Perhaps one of Sigourney Weavers worst films to date, her portrayal of a criminal psychologist with post traumatic stress disorder grinds from the first scene.
And when he finally gets his dream date with Dorothy and is lead from pillar to post, by first one girl then another he takes it all in his stride.
Perhaps this is one for the fraternity boys out there who could not get enough of Stifler from the first three American Pie films.
Okay, it may well be the first Australian horror movie, and a pre-runner of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but it doesn't take very long to become monotonous and downright irritating.
I first saw Gregory's Girl shortly after it was released, when I was an awkward and shy teenager myself.
I assume they would first try to investigate quietly.
This had nothing to do with x-files in the first place.
Forsyth's first outing, "That Sinking Feeling", also gave us very real characters and placed them in situations not far removed from the everyday.
Don't worry; it ends with a wedding AND a birth AND a first kiss (and you knew that the timing would work out that way; so predictable).
The excitement and anticipation of "the first time" (first kiss etc) is beautifully expressed by Madeline "The best part's before you taste it..."   This movie is not for viewers who require explosions to satisfy their entertainment criteria but if you wish to relive the joy, the sweet pain, the magic and the limitless possibilities of your adolescence let Billy Forsyth transport you.
The first official screen adaptation of Bram Stoker's decent novel is the equal of 'Nosferatu' in every respect Â like that film it's hammy, boring, dated, sluggishly paced and has an overrated central performance.
BOOK; first few chapters are about Johnathan Harker's travels to and stay in Transylvania.
I love Melissa Bank's sophisticated, complex, moving fiction and I was very curious when I heard that some of the stories in her first novel/short story collection were being made into a movie.
I first watched this film in 'The Kelburn' in Paisley.
The first action sequence is overly dramatical, but for no good reason.
I thought the first few minutes in 2009 had potential but very soon the story turns in to a clichÃ© filled, below average b-movie.
1: How's this for an alternative time-line... the Germans had the main character of this story on the beach of Normandie with a submachine-gun and one clip...   2: Why would a Japanese national agency have an English name (JBI.. my god..) and a graphic interface on their computers that makes the HUD in any computer-game look like the first version of donkey kong.. (not a big thing but it's just an example... )  3: When you hear violin music in a gunfight it's OK to stop running and shooting...   4: "OK guys: If someone is about to make an important kill everyone stop shooting so we can hear the empty shell bounce.."  I could continue on and on but i think you get the picture..
I try to watch it once a year because it brings back long-forgotten memories of what it was like to ask for your first date, the awkwardness of the first kiss, and the whole new dimension of relating to the opposite sex.
For the first time in quite a while, I was impatient for the film to end so I could get on with my life.
I first saw "Ceremony" after my friend and I rented it at Blockbuster.
After the first 10 minutes of this snorefest we were about ready to throw the VCR out the window.
I think this is the first time that I've given an anime anything below a 6.
Just have Sinatra be the guy who comes to stay with the Tuttles in the first place.
The first 3 minutes are the only ones worth mentioning, actually.
Watching the film for the first time in years, and for the first time without commercials I found it to be an absolute disaster area of a film.
I saw this movie at a film festival when it first came out and, after skipping over it at the local library for the last nine months, finally borrowed it on loan to see what my younger roommate would think of it and to view it again myself, nearly a decade later.
From her scene walking in to the divey apartment "Fabulous" to her scene walking in to roommate Marc's bedroom after he first has sex to her nervous breakdown or crying during the "grand gesture" to the whole cluelessness of her New York existence - it just was about four feet too much over the top and ruined what little good there was in her character or her performance.
The first 2 acts cry for a detective series with Pare and Belasco.
We've all probably been in the situations Gregory finds himself in during the movie and this just brings it all back... playing football in the school team (and chatting nonchalently to spectators when should have been keeping an eye on players bearing down on goal), getting into scrapes with teachers and of course that first date with the girl of your dreams.
Upfront, I must admit that I watched only the first 30 minutes of this film.
As in the first film, the plot makes no sense, the acting leaves one with no feeling of tension.
I loved the first movie so I thought the second one would be even better.
The first Mummy picture was quite good, in that it managed to fit in characters and plot amongst the big budget special effects.
The first picture showed that Universal movie monsters could easily be remade into big budget, special effect extravaganzas, and still be good.
Everything I liked about the first movie (minus the characters) was overdone to the extreme here, and about halfway through or earlier, I found myself loathing this picture.
Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) is back, nine years after the first movie (I thought it was two, but whatever), and he and Evelyn (Racchel Weisz) are married and have an 8 year old kid, Alex (Freddie Boath).
If you aren't paying attention in this movie, or you miss the first ten minutes, you will be extremely confused.
The contrast between teenage lust/horniness against the innocent and awkward nature of teenage infatuation and the eventual sweetness of the first kiss are spread decidedly toward the latter here.
It is pretty much a family movie (far more so than the first one) but some young children could be scared by the mummies.
Rachel Weisz was far sexier in this movie than the first, and the rest of the cast does okay; certainly Brendan Fraser is very comfortable in his role as Richard 'Rick' O'Connell.
If you watch it right after the first movie, you'll notice clearly that the CGI is a lot worse in returns.
This adds to the idea that it was just a poorly written movie to cash in on the first movie's success.
This is a different movie than the first one.
It really doesn't feel like it meshes with the first movie (especially the love between Anck Su Namun and Imhotep), and while it introduces the Scorpion King idea, it again doesn't mesh with that movie at all.
It's okay, fluffy fun; just turn off your brain first.
I LIKED the first Mummy.
They took the first movie, then instead of taking all the good stuff, they just condensed the Bad Taste In My Mouth parts.
For the most part, it's a total rehash of stuff from the first movie.
I'd put in a SPOILER warning, but if you saw the first one, you know how this is gonna turn out.
If you want decent characterization, I guess they thought it would carry over from the first movie.
Why didn't these neato abilities kick in in the first movie???
If you liked the first one at all, I don't think you'll like this one much.
Sad thing is, he isn't all that in the first place and you have NO clue why everyone in this movie is in love with him.
However, even from this first sequence, one is made aware of the sheer ineptness of the direction: it not only cuts away from one character to another with a boring regularity but the sequence is framed in such a way as to cut the creature's head off!
This is exacerbated as the film goes along by the director's apparent refusal (in some sequences, at least) to move the camera in any way; I don't know if this was an attempt on his part to satirize the TV medium (given that it is, after all, a TV crew which impounds on the Baron's home ground) but I'd be surprised if the thought had occurred to the director in the first place.
Second, and even more deranged, he is told by the first attending doctor that his son, who has just been hit by a truck, has spine damage.
Say It With Songs is the first all talking film that Al Jolson did on initial Warner Brothers contract and for him the first flop in his Hollywood career.
Say It With Songs became the first of two films he did without the blackface, a fact I hadn't known before.
The first half was pretty good and promised an intriguing finale, but the second part descended into a confused and unconvincing mess where the crew weren't the only ones to wonder what was going on.
If I could have, I would have rated this movie lower than a 1, only a little nub of the first star would have been lit up.
No one seems to realise that the reason that most of these flicks have vanished in the first place is because they were so jaw-smashingly rubbish that they didn't shift first time around.
In the first scene alone he's shown dismembering a patently unrealistic corpse, which looks to be made from paper mache.
The first thing that you should know is that this was not even shot on a reasonable format.
I want to say that I'm not trying to slander P. Alan's attempt to make his first movie.
I really didn't enjoy Splatter Farm and I reckon that the only fun to be had is hunting down a copy in the first place.
"Gregory's Girl" was one of the first masterpieces of the eighties revival of the British film industry which was to produce the Oscar-winners "Chariots of Fire" and "Gandhi", and films of the calibre of "Local Hero" "Educating Rita", "The Missionary", "A Private Function" and "Hope and Glory".
At first Dorothy responds to Gregory's ardour with polite indifference, but when he asks her for a date, she accepts.
It made a refreshing change from American high school movies which, then as now, generally used established actors in their late twenties or even thirties; the unkind joke about Stockard Channing's character in "Grease" was that she would leave school when she passed her exams or had her menopause, whichever happened first.
"The Day the Sky Exploded" in English, with Swiss star Paul Hubschmid (as John McLaren) becoming the first man in space.
No Bruce Willis, but Paul Hubschmid, the first Swiss film star.
He is on a team of astronauts that included a Frenchman and a Russian and was selected for the first mission in space.
It's interesting to see the first films of this type before CGI, which is why I am investing the week exploring them.
With his wife (Kerr) there is total detachment and not even a hint of why they got together in the first place.
It's a bit of a harsh statement, but I personally thought the first episode was awful, not even a smile appeared on my face, in no way was it funny.
It was the first programme in a while that I couldn't sit all the way through, I even thought there was funny moments in the 'Green Green Grass' (only fools spin off).
I can only hope that the BBC decides to cancel the show, if all the episodes are as bad as the first it will not be a hard choice.
Maybe I am being too harsh as this was only the first episode but the whole idea of the pilot is to gain an audience that will continue to watch, so with that episode, i doubt many will watch the rest of the series.
OK, forewarned that the first episode was exceedingly slow, but promised that later episodes grew in depth and gentle village humor, I slogged through for the first five (a fan friend shared the first seven episodes with me in the usually strong theory that immersing oneself in characters one can lose yourself in their world) and skipped to the finale which involved amateur theatricals and somehow seemed emblematic of the whole enterprise.
We watched the first two episodes and didn't laugh once!
The story is about a letter that is found in the first class airport lounge after an international flight has taken off.
Farrah is in one of her first roles and just as lovely as ever.
The curse manifests itself as a stuffed gorilla (first seen in 1913 Asia) seems to come alive, and kill people.
First, a box was found in the first class section that security thought it was a bomb that turned out to be a smoking jack in the box.
At first, it is thought to be a sick joke, but soon a man posing as a priest and a flight attendant are killed.
Opposing presidents use the CIA-version of IRC-chat to talk to each other in the midst of a mini-nuclear war, helicopters and cars survive a nuclear blast at point blank range, characters travel around the globe at light speed, Israeli's lose a nuke and don't even bother searching for it, and everybody in this movie just seems to be brainless (apart from Mr. Freeman's character, which is probably why he has to die in the first place...)...
He makes a crucial phone call to someone who doesn't trust him and fails to put the key information in the first sentence?
It was also flatly directed, attempting some form of style (no wonder it's Phil Alden Robinson's first film in ten years), which only managed to irritate, and STILL that American anti-smoking message gets through, because, as this film wants you to believe, only neo-fascists who kill innocent people smoke.
Let me preface my comments by saying that I loved Clancy's book when I first read it ten years ago.
In fact, the first 30-40 minutes were so bad, I never finished the film.
You just know that Lassie will overcome his fear and things will turn out well, as always, I'm sure it got better than the first half that I watched.
Nonetheless, filmmaker should learn what sports teams realize the hard way - you have to play hard and well the whole game - not just one half and this film's first half stunk enough so that at least one reviewer went home at halftime.
The characters may be boring and idiotic, but they speak in a natural manner(Michael's first thought after learning he's a Dracula is that he's going to get rich on royalties for all those movies).
It's fun at first, but runs itself into the ground pretty quickly.
I first became aware of this via the Blue Underground DVD, though I was not intrigued enough by the online reviews to acquire it; however, coming my way recently while being in a "Nunsploitation" frame-of-mind, I could not very well let the opportunity pass me by (in hindsight, the English dubbing is atrocious Â even if the print reverted for a couple of brief scenes to the original Italian language).
The production values are bottom of the barrel, at the beginning of the film the cast congregate in the TOA first class lounge that is supposed to be at JFK airport in New York, however the 'Theme Building' at LAX is clearly visible out the window as well as several palm trees.
Very sad, that people make the exact movie twice, with the same script, and that only a few years after the first one.
It's almost miserable that they used they exact lines that John Travolta used on the first movie.
And the second one is even worse, you see almost no emotion in the leading role called george, it's like he studied the first movie (John Travolta), and is trying to act like John Travolta, almost like a robot, because i totally mis the emotion in his words and face.
I really enjoyed the first Phenomenon movie, John Travolta carried the part well enough to surpass the somewhat obvious Hollywoodisation and gave a truly heartfelt performance.
I won't ruin it for anyone (even though there's nothing to really ruin), but you pretty much know how the story is going play out within the first five minutes.
This is my first post on IMDb and i read that u must have a comment longer than 10 lines.
We counted four in the the first scene of the movie, an three in the scene where he is escaping the blast in the tunnel.
However, one occasionally comes across a film which is so poor that any enjoyment one might have been able from the poor script, poor acting, poor continuity and the sense of "i can't believe they are taking this seriously" is eroded within the first half hour.
In his first 10 minutes of screen time he impersonates three animals so unconvincingly and hilariously, that it's hard enough for itself.
He always smiles, makes little jokes only he laughs about and gets scared the first time when his car is blocked by a sheep's herd.
And he has maybe the first computer ever, which has not only a little animation looking like him, but this one can also talk for itself and change visually in order of the things happening around it.
Mr. No Legs tells the tale of crime kingpin & drug lord D'Angelo (Lloyd Bochner) who has the hard as nails Mr. No Legs (Ron Slinker) as his bodyguard & as a gangland 'enforcer' who shoots first & doesn't bother to ask questions later.
The script by Jack Cowden plays the material 100% straight, is a bit on the slow side during the first 40 odd minutes & has very little of interest apart from the main title character Mr. No Legs, for most of it's duration Mr. No Legs is a standard implausible 70's cop film (in fact you could say the story doesn't have a leg to stand on, ha, ha, ha) about busting up a drug business with little to recommend it except that for some bizarre reason some absolute genius thought it would be a good idea to have a man with no legs to be the films main bad guy, he has shotguns in the arms of his wheelchair, throwing stars & retractable blades.
This was Nick Gomez's first film and it shows, from the "artistic", read too shaky, hand-held camera-work to the script which I imagine was two pages long, the rest of the film being improvised (I have a hard time believing anyone can write that kind of dialogue).
I read James Dixon's great novelization of this sequel first, so my expectations were high.
It plays like a retread of the first film with three killer tots instead of one.
Bernard Herrmann's score is culled from unused cues from the first film and is the film's only saving grace.
Following a coherent and workable first 20 minutes the babies escape, characterisation fades into evanescent memory, and suspenselessly-edited sequences telegraphed as 'shock' but ending up as anything but become the order of the day.
Weak follow-up to the original cult classic It's Alive is virtually a remake of the first film, but with three babies this time around instead of one.
Add to that the fact they take all the mystery out of the first movie, basically spelling out how the mutant killer babies are born the way they are something I do not think really needed to be addressed so thoroughly.
Through the first part we have to hear Affleck's lame narration.
Two scenes in the film stand out: The first an otherwise ordinary bar fight which Jaeckel's partner interrupts.
What makes it even more remarkable is just as the first punches are thrown Jaeckel senses something is wrong and follows his buddy into the bar, only arriving there after 10 minutes of non-stop head cracking action.
The plot revolves around a money hungry virus-vaccine producer who decides to make the virus first, put it airborne then make millions on the vaccine that he was ready to put out on the market because he knew their would be a need for it.
For just like the act of gambling itself, or indeed, not unlike the Air Bud movies, Owning Mahowny seems enticing at first, that is, when you and your friends are just planning to see it, joking that you might strike big, that this might be the one movie that comes out of nowhere to surprise you, but then from the moment you enter the theatre, every time you give this movie a chance, it's just one bad hand after the other, until eventually you are completely numb to it, and you stop paying attention to your wife, and you start cutting out of work early, and you no longer enjoy anything again in life anymore because all you want is your Owning Mahowny.
Apparently in real life they got married eventually, but the characters in this movie could never have gotten married in more than a postscript, because they were just too ingenuine, and the movie omits any moments that could have explained why on earth they ever got together in the first place.
The first time Claire sees the ghost in the bathtub, before Norman runs in after her scream, it takes what, 5 seconds for the whole tub to drain!
For instance, you have the rich father with the two strange daughters ("The Big Sleep"), the seemingly separate plots that may have more in common than at first glance ("Murder my Sweet"), and the character whose obsession may lead toward a certain road of destruction ("The Postman Always Rings Twice," "Double Indemnity"), etc.
The photography is first rate and beautiful.
(No, that inferior, insipid, little horror movie was not the first to use this device.
This is another one of those films where third party, completely random characters become the culprits, and defeat the purpose of getting to know the main characters in the first place.
In fact, the first 30 or 40 minutes are devoted to boxing matches between the two detectives, nicknamed "Fire" and "Ice" from the Symbolism 101 school of writing.
Rebound doesn't really have characters; there are just static, singularly-painted figures that we can't root for because it follows every sports film clichÃ© in the book, meaning the audience knows in the first five minutes how everything will turn out before the characters even get there.
Big Momma's House 1 and 2 were pretty good for some dumb comedy movies (me owning the first one and liking it)but, National Security with Martin and Steve Zahn was passable.
College basketball coach Roy McCormick is almost banned for life due to his aggressive behavior, but as his agent finds a clause in the rules that he must have another chance first, he ends up training a middle school team, the Mount Vernon Junior High School Smelters.
While the first movie had heart to it, this one seems to lack it.
It tries to mimic the relationship from the first movie between Seth and Veronica, this time with Daphne Zuniga as Martin's love interest.
I didn't really like how the fly looked less human than it did in the first.
Stoltz and Richardson are quite good (plus the first film's John Getz makes a welcome return in a cameo role), and there are some effective moments here and there, but this is a totally pointless sequel, one that doesn't even come close to matching the original.
Instead of a tragic, scary film like the first we have a gross, stupid film with an unclear and stupid ending.
The Fly II picks up where the first Fly left off.
Everything that made the first Fly so good is suddenly gone in this sequel.
At first, they do not seem to get along.
Take for instance the first Lethal Weapon.
Mel Gibson and Danny Glover at first hate each other.
And in "Die Hard: With a Vengeance" Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson did not at first get along, but in the end their differences are put aside and they emerge as friends.
Forget the first heist; it feels like filler to keep us occupied until the final scenes and climax.
Of course, a sense of pride enveloped me when the first few glimpses of the majestic towers were shown.
The first key to a thriller like this is having characters who remain a mystery throughout the movie.
The sheer lack of chemistry between the two leads makes the first 20 minutes are so supremely implausible at best, and a big F you to the intelligence of the audience at worst.
Well, first of all it fails a usually sturdy horror movie concept (self-reliant woman fights for her life in an isolated rural setting against one or multiple assilaints).
Here we get an endless 100 minutes of an unappealing actor trying to hide he's a psychopath (a character as supposedly smart as the woman in this movie should have been able to tell after her first conversation with him, but like the rest of the movie, she remains stone still with a concerned look on her face while he has any number of freak outs), mixed with clumsily directed murder scenes, and an ridiculously repetitive and drawn-out final twenty minutes.
The first half of this movie is like a big black hole.
Another problem is that the effect of the film's first big surprise is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the copy on the DVD box gives it away completely.
Some curious cameos are also featured here from a number of character actors that are passable considering all, though to be honest I'm still scratching my head as to why any of them would have actually made appearances in this flick in the first place; the actors I'm in reference to are: Maury Chakin, Christopher Walkin (!?
We sat and watched this one first, and we found ourselves cracking up.
So, while Moreland might have been a negative role model in one way, in another he showed that a Black man can be very bright and articulate as well (now THAT'S a first in film).
I hated the first one but I had some hope that maybe the sequel would be better.
I remember hating it worse than the first one!
The plot is basically a retread of the first--a spooky cemetary in the Maine woods has the power to bring the dead back to life.
The first one was a cruel, stupid horror film.
The fact that there is too much violence and not enough atmosphere ruins this movie (the first one sucked too).
After i had seen this movie i compared it in my head with the first and how the first one was based off the book i can see that it was extremely better in my eyes but to all you people that like it can you tell me what was going through your head when you saw this movie.
Not that I expected much, but this was my first walk out.
"Pet Sematary 2" is a totally unnecessary sequel to the first "Pet Sematary",which has to be one of my favourite horror movies of all time.Instead of suspense it is loaded with gore and repulsive violence.The acting is pretty bad,the characters are one-dimensional and the film is completely idiotic in places(for example how our boys managed to carry the body of Gus through the quagmire?
The first Pet Sematary by the same director, Mary Lambert, is genuinely creepy and scary and contains couple of great shocks which stay in your mind.
Plot includes again a dead person who leads the characters to the mysterious cemetery from the first film, and soon they decide to try that wonderful idea of getting someone dead back to life with the "help" of that old burial ground which has been used by indians.
And the violence tries to be more brutal than in the first film but it fails pretty miserably.
See the first film and don't rush seeing this sequel.
When first saw Pet Cemetery II I wasn't expecting anything that would come close to the original, and I was right.
First off the film isn't anything like the original the only thing remaining from the first film is the pet cemetery all other aspects of the first that made it good have been changed.
The film although directed by the person from the first was nothing like the first, whereas the first film used suspense and dark atmosphere with only very minor gore effects, The second film skips the suspense and atmosphere and goes straight for the gore, It seems like the director wanted to go in a different direction with this film in order to make it more action-packed, it really doesn't work.
Overall this film ends up being everything the first wasn't, predictable, weak and just downright stupid.
If your a fan of the original I wouldn't recommend this to you at all considering all the things you loved about the first have disappeared in this one.
IT has nothing to do at all with the first movie, and lacks a plot- and a heartbeat for that matter.
The first Pet Sematary is truly a classic and Stephen King would let Gage Saw his achilles' tendon (as he did to Jud) if he saw this god-awful sequel.
As luck would have it, the father and son move, out of all small towns, to Ludlow, Maine, the nice little backwater we all know from the first movie...  "Pet Sematary II" is a (boring, badly made) drama about the struggles of adolescents more than it is a Horror movie.
There is simply hardly any suspense in this (probably because the screenplay wasn't written by Stephen King, as it was the case in the first movie), and many scenes that are meant to be creepy are, if anything, more funny than scary.
The first "Pet Sematary" was definitely no Horror masterpiece, but this sequel makes it look like a Dario Argento movie.
I enjoyed the first "Pet Sematary" and rented this because I wanted some cheesy entertainment.
For the record I actually liked the first Pet Sematary.
At least the characters in the first movie had a method to their madness.
I should have been forewarned with the bizarre spelling of "cemetery" -- why they didn't spell it correctly in the first place...
Hard to believe Mary Lambert, director of the first film, is responsible for this major disappointment of a sequel to the superior original.
It wasn't even scary, the first hour and a half was just a waste, then they tried to pile all of the "Scary stuff" into the last 5 minutes.
The whole movie pretty much left you wondering why you rented it in the first place.
Well let me be the first to tell you --- This is a complete SHAM.
The movie starts off very slow and bored me to sleep in the first 30 minutes.
Dan Rowan and Dick Martin, famous TV cut-ups from the then-current hit show "Laugh-In", go a curiously different route for their second theatrical film as a team (the first was "Once Upon a Horse" from 1958).
For the first time ever i have noticed how absolutely beautiful Kate Hudson really is.
Now the bad: The first line of the movie is "I need Cox", I a movie were the main character, not just that but the movie, is named Dewey Cox, you can really only use that once.
Example, Dewey Cox is in a hotel room living it up after his first taste of weed, he is on the phone with his wife.
When Richard Clark arrives at the high school the first time, the writers (reject writers from Mad Magazine, by the look and feel of it) spend a disproportionate amount of time convincing us that this school is baaad.
It's not just that, terrifying but true, he looks like a young Tom Hanks but his acting is clumsy, his voice weak and he occasionally looks unsure of how to act to camera: hard to believe that you're watching the first steps of a future screen great here Â indeed, just about the only line to ring true is when Stanwyck tells him "I'll see you in 1966.
And that's sad, because apart from being the first "talkie", the JAZZ SINGER is a very clichÃ©d and old fashioned film.
It looks promising at first glance of the case, the Canadian version is called "Kinky Killers" and the woman on the cover is practically in bondage.
Ming-Na Wen's first love scene is a complete joke.
No doubt if that's the first film of the set you watch you'll be disappointed, but if you watch it (like me) after such atrocities as "Death Run To Istanbul" or "Flight To Danger" it seems comparatively better.
The movie was unintentionally funny due to the strange choices of voices (we thought Tutu was a girl for the first 20-30 minutes)and the corny writing.
I liked his first two blockbusters, but I also liked his lesser efforts like THE SWARM (at least for camp value).
How did I miss this when it first came out?
I ran this at a press screening and it was obvious from the first minute this was a disaster movie of it's own kind.
Problems first arose on the set of this movie when William Holden discovered Paul Newman was to get top billing for the project.
Once Mananui gets bored with the half-hearted soap operatics and blows its top, it's women, children and top-billed stars first (this being the kind of film where the characters die in reverse order of billing, and if your character doesn't even have a name, you're toast), with a small, economically viable group of hotel guests facing tidal waves, fireballs, narrow ledges, rickety bridges and a script so riddled with clichÃ©s that the only surprise is that no-one sacrifices a maiden to appease the volcano god or that Elvis doesn't turn up to sing the Volcano-a-hula.
-And when the guy predictably falls, we first see him fall backwards away from the 'copter, but them the immediate cut-away shot shows him clearly falling in a FORWARD roll.
`How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days' is not the collaborated work of all the first dates I have ever had.
I got a kick out of this film for the first half of it, but it got so stupid with the main characters that I had a hard time finishing it.
The first sign that Lover's Prayer was going to be a loser was when I realized that the people who were supposed to be Russian were speaking with British accents.
That should have been my first clue as to what I was getting.
My first reaction to the dual title was that this writer is so self absorbed that he couldn't decide on ONE movie title, because he simply admires every idea he has, so he simply *had* to call it both!
My family knew Bill almost from the first day he was born to the day he died thanks to the close friendship he had with my parents.
Well, that's what you're led to believe in the first half of the film.
And by the way, when I first saw this a few years ago, I thought that henchman "Bob" was head and shoulders better than anyone else in the film.
Although Peter Pau got his first Oscar for wonderful cinematography, his direction skill is not ripe enough.
For the first half of the movie, the plot unfolds like many Jackie Chan-away-from-HK flix: reluctant hero, naive sibling, overly-evil Caucasian.
The first hour you will admire that the sets aren't cheap and Ben Chaplin does a halfway decent job of playing Eric.
For example, when the alien lands it causes power cuts that extend as far as the rocket launch site, so it not clear why the alien needs to enlist the aid of the children in the first place (anyway, why not work through adults?).
It starts well enough, with the arrival at the missile base, the landing of the alien, its discovery by the children and its first communication with them.
The Indian women in this mess talk like they're reading the script for the first time.
He was good in AIRPLANE and the first Frank Drebin film, but then he sold out: he started to use his 'talent' in trash like MR. MAGOO, RENT-A-KID and that stupid EXCORSIST spoof.
On opening weekend Saturday matinÃ©e there were about 15 people in the cinema and half of them walked out during the first 10 minutes while making loud offensive comments.
Mel Brooks could do no wrong with his first 5 movies.
"Give him an enema" was funny the first time, but the fourth or fifth, it just lost its humor value.
While the story is solid the decision to turn the film into a silly slapstick comedy first & foremost is one that doesn't work, surely Dracula: Dead and Loving It would have worked much better if the filmmakers had worked around the principal that they were making a horror film first as per the original novel & structure the comedy, the gags & the spoof material around it.
As it is Dracula: Dead and Loving It is a comedy first & horror a very distant second while I think it would have been much better the other way around with it being a horror first & comedy second like The Evil Dead (1982) or Dog Soldiers (2002), I mean you can't really add horror to comedy yet I would say you could add a comedic element to horror.
Another big problem with Dracula: Dead and Loving It is that it's just not very funny, in fact as to prove my point the best scene is when Harker & Van Helsing stake Lucy through the heart & are covered in gallons of blood, horror first guys, horror first...
The actors are excellent  and, at first, the mystery is well drawn, but when the main actor (A  writer falling under the spell of spirits - rings a bell ?)
Now watching it the second time I hope I can forget it just as easily as I had the first time.
At first the movie is promising, the big house has potential to make a good haunted house movie, the hallucinations telling you you only have a few days to die would be very scary and here it gives hope for a creepy movie, but as it goes on you realize its going nowhere.
When I first turned on the movie I though it was gonna be horrible,and not to my surprise it was horrible.
They meet, fall in love, he woos her traditional Italian family and they waste no time in getting married - Teresa's first marriage, Ken's third.
Eventually, Teresa becomes pregnant with her first child - something that was NOT in Ken's plans, and he is visibly irritated by the news.
The 1 star rating is for the DVD which may be the worst I've ever seen, and my first DVD was the original "Blade Runner" release.
The first instance sets off a heated accusation-and-denial confrontation between Forsythe and DeHavilland.
I misconstrued the first look between the effeminate Villain and his fat banker accomplice as a look of homosexual satisfaction!
Rent first  I saw this years ago in the theater when it came out upon release and my first impression still stands.
I can only assume that this episode was presented as a filler to supplant the other two episodes first aired on that date.
Spaceballs is the first spoof movie and Mel brooks movie i saw, and i loved every minute of it.
The movie is interesting only to the first half, then it begins unleashing the crappiest elements of a romantic comedy.
Now, his plan is to find all the people he feels are responsible for putting him in the booby hatch and exacting revenge--and killing him just like that first group of people; So far, all this is a very good setup for a film.
As a kids show it could make the grade, but anyone who has a little knowledge about human behavior and language couldn't bear to even watch the first twelve episodes of season 1, like I just did.
I very much wanted to believe I had found a decent sci-fi show, otherwise I would shut it of and cleansed my computer of this refuge after the first five minutes!
Having seen the first ten episodes, I must say this show sucks.
The first scene where they are outside in another world is in the mountains, with lots of pinetrees where it looks cold.
The X-files had better effects when they aired their first episodes in 1993.
Also, a tip to GK for any future screenplays: Introduce the first plot event LESS than one hour into the show.
When the movie first aired, I was married with three children.
Perhaps that colors my perspective, but watching some of these episodes in 2008-09 hasn't done anything to change my opinion of the show back in 1978-79 when I first saw it.
The Movie does not get off first base.
It felt like the FIRST rehearsal, the cast assembled together for the very first time, maybe at like 5AM on a Monday morning, and everybody was tired and cranky and didn't really want to be there, and they knew the script sucked anyway so there was no point in even trying.
The script felt like a rough first draft--of an artless hack.
Only Angela has the first instinct: something is wrong.
At first the family is in denial.
The dubbing and editing is hardly first rate.
People always want to know if the book (made first) and the movie are as what actually happened.
Or is there more to the case than first meets the eye?
The story is more than predictable, ever so much due to the fact that we see the death of the characters during the first scene as a previews of the gore end.
The first half of the movie is pretty slow.
However, the first half of the movie hinders Madman from getting a better rating.
Even the killer, who was sorta formidable looking from a distance during the first part of the movie, becomes ludicrous when we finally see him up close.
The only surprise in the film is when the "hero" suddenly gets hung out to dry in the first half of the film.
gains two stars because, first, it is so horrible it will make you laugh.
...This was the first impact.
But personally, this wasn't much of a sequel, but rather a rehash of the first film.
But if you liked the first film and would like to see a jazzy update, then Blues Brothers 2000 is for you.
When I first saw an episode of this series, it seemed quiet funny to me: a sexless-Christian-perfect-family-universe with countless daughters who are each engaged for about the 20th time while not ever having married, and in the end, the parents ly in bed and cry because their son wants to marry a Jewish girl.
But some days later I saw another episode and another, and soon found out that the first one was not satiric - their serious with this terribly unrealistic drama stuff!!!
Now of course, I was only 11 when I was watching the first season and I guess since it had grown up's in it, I assumed it was true to life.
Now we have major problems with this show that I realized, first off Aaron Spelling casts unbelievably good looking teens(who look nothing alike, when they're supposed to be siblings), not to mention their unrealistic reactions to their problems.
So, having said that, and, subsequently, not having seen nor read Marlowe's play "Dr Faustus", I can honestly say the first 10 minutes of Burton's film adaptation bored me so senseless that I didn't even bother sticking around for the always-compelling Ms Taylor to make her entrance...and couldn't have cared less.
Devon Sawa was damn good, considering this is the first thing I've seen him in.
He gets the girl way too fast and it doesn't even leave you time to think how he scored with her in the first place.
Basically, I have no idea what the main story is about, but it's a bit like Harry Potter (since the first movie, everyone begins to imitate J.K. Rowling's success, but nevertheless fails to generate everlasting appeal) and a dot of Winxclub (which seems of plagiarize the former, plus lots more from other original anime preferences), which results in a badly mixed barf bag which older audiences have to consume to imagine its horrible taste (think of one event in Fear Factor where contestants are required to pick up garbage from the road and eat it!).
4) The accomplice kills a dude in an alleyway by first throwing a noose around his neck.
The girl then shakes her head in dismay, even though she wanted her brother to save her in the first place.
The accomplice appears in the middle of the forest soon after with a bandage on his head, as it appears that he planted first aid kits in the wilderness .
And seeing that I am the first one to review it, I set the tone hopefully.
Otherwise, if you're easily offended, avoid at all costs or else you will die of a heart attack after the first 10 seconds of the film.
For the first ten minutes, I was going "What?"
(They come in the first 15 minutes and while never explicitly stated, they're pretty hard to miss.)
The number of Oscars they won, totaling six - two for Davis and four for Hepburn - meant nothing because Hepburn won one for MORNING GLORY, which is now a historical curiosity, and one for GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER, which she knew was a joint one for herself and Spencer Tracy, while Davis' first Oscar was not for Joyce Heath in the badly written DANGEROUS.
One of the big stinkers, BUT well worth watching the first third to Irene Hervey, surely one of the most beautiful women in her day, in a very form-fitting leather, sharkskin gown.
There isn't a novel or comic book lurking in the background to excuse the arbitrary plot developments, or to explain the fact that someone took an interest in this material in the first place...?
At first the doctor sees no reason to pay her at all; after a while, he offers a token payment of "a few shillings" a week.
BY BARBRA WALTERS   Unfortunately, many have forgotten and still countless others have never known how Ms. Fonda betrayed not only the idea of our country, but specific men who served and sacrificed during Vietnam   The first part of this is from an F-4E pilot   The pilot's name is Jerry Driscoll, a River Rat.

It's exactly what is says, a movie about the first spaceship on Venus.
There are so many things wrong within the first few minutes that you start to tune out what is happening and just start enjoying the garbage being thrown at you.
Then there are some excitingly unnecessary characters like Brinkmann's mother and Arsenjew's wife, who were cut from the first part of the film for US release, but for some inexplicable reason can be seen at the ending, thus making the whole mess even more perplexing.
Please don't waste your time on this film, otherwise you'll want to waste some more time to write a comment about how you wasted your time in the first place.
The constant narration in the first half of the film seems to neglect the players instead of letting them move the story along through their own interaction.
If you enjoy cheesy movies, and are willing to sit through the first hour or so of not so good viewing, then check it out.
His first, 'May', was weird but brilliant horror with some genuine shock moments.
The first hour is actually very slow paced and in terms of horror there isn't a whole lot.
in their first dialog raised my palm to my face.
You know you got something pretty sick when one of the first scenes include a guy having sex with a goat and then killing it off.
The first hour was a bit slow, but in the end I understood that, they had to build the back-story in a way that it would be believable.
First I'd like to say that I LOVED the first Angels.
I'm not saying it's dreadful but it really isn't as good as the first.
While the first movie at least orbited around realism (even the dodging bullet bit was well directed) this movie flies off into outer space.
I loved the first movie, I gave it a 9 of out 10.
The sequel, Full Throttle, was terrible; the best parts of this movie were those that referenced the first.
The first movie had the Angels doing totally impossible stunts but you knew it was C.A.
The best actors in the first film were Bill Murray and Tom Green.
The story is rehash and the cinematics get annoying within the first ten minutes.
I'm really glad that he dropped out of the new "Superman" movie and let the supremely talented Bryan Singer direct, because if he had directed it then "Batman Begins" would have been the first and only great DC comics movie.
By the first 10 minutes, though, you wish they would just get it over with.
The first thing we saw was this freakin Chinese lady that was naked (she had pretty big boobies for a Chinese lady)she was dancing to rock music for like 10 min for the opening credits.
Consider the whole situation, first of all.
Not for the first time, I'm out of kilter with the majority view.
Because it came from HBO and based on the IMDb rating, I watched the first season of this series, what a waste.
Okay first i want to say even if i'm a Turk i don't like these type of movies but still i wanted to say a few things.The first movie 'DÃ¼nyayÄ± Kurtaran Adam' was a total disaster everyone in Turkey makes fun of it because it was made seriously as a sci-fi movie and they stole many things from Star Wars.But the second movie is a comedy.Now the MOST important thing in a world class comedy film is to make EVERYONE on the planet laugh,but it doesn't mean that you have to make everyone laugh to make an ordinary comedy movie,i read that one commenter said that its not even close to funny,now i'm from turkey and believe me there are MANY European and American movies people from here don't laugh at and there are many movies you people don't laugh at,this films aim is Turkish population because Turkish sense of humor isn't same with the others,actually EVERY countries sense of humor is different with other countries so MY OPINION is that it doesn't make sense to say 'not even close to funny' to a 'comedy' movie that isn't in your country because it may not suit your sense of humor but people here liked it not very much but still they liked it,so please make your comments on comedy movies according to these things..i'm sorry if my English was bad..
It supposed to be a sequel to the original "Dunyayi Kurtaran Adam" but the only thing that reminds you the original one is that the characters keep honoring "Dunyayi Kurtaran Adam (The man who saved the world)" As a sense of irony the first one was way much funnier even it was not cut as a comedy movie.
Lots of curse words thrown at each other(I witnessed it first hand).
But it is a comedy we must assume - at least the first 30 minutes lead you to believe that.
The first time I saw this on Comedy Central, about a year ago, I thought it was incredibly funny.
The show wasn't nearly as amusing the second time around, both because the shock of hearing uncensored bigotry on cable was gone and because of something my friend noted at the end of the first viewing: Lampanelli says that it's fun for us all to make fun of ourselves... but you'll notice she really only makes fun of minorities.
Within the first minutes of "The Woods" one can see that director Lucky McKee and writer David Ross are horror film geeks that came of age in the video age of the 80s and feasted their eyes on films like Dario Argento's "Suspiria" and Sam Raimi's "Evil Dead" series.
"The Woods" does pick up some steam towards the hour mark with the reappearance of Heather's parents and the first words spoken by a formerly silent Bruce Campbell, who plays to his adoring cult following once more here.
Watch it first and decide for yourself before considering showing it to your kids.
Whether it's Organized Rhyme, his own "The Tom Green Show" both pre and post MTV, or his first forays into film, "Freddy Got Fingered", "Road Trip", and 'The Chad' in "Charlie's Angels", I look forward to watching what he will do next.
As I missed the first few minutes of the film, I have no way of knowing this - but if no rape is involved, this would be a major plot flaw.
It's been best done in movies as various Robin Hoods, Zorros, and Lone Rangers, but has also served uncounted zero-budget "B" westerns, costume actioners, serials and cop pics since fiction film first unspooled, particularly during the pre-WWII period.
Yet this potentially moving and engaging stuff *is* just padding, stuck in between very occasional action scenes as long, loooonnnnnggg vignettes which are then either just left behind or just magically resolved: e.g., after 20 minutes of closeup on the oldest girl's first 48 hours of stages-of-grieving, we jumpcut to some action, and she is just next - and last - seen frolicking off on a tricycle at her new home, daddy's loss just no longer to be at issue, and the part just as suddenly becomes an 'extra'.
"The Woods" is David Ross' debut as scriptwriter, and while of course it shows some of the common problems of a first time writer, it also shows that Ross knows his influences very well (in more than a way, the story is a homage to Argento's "Suspiria").
maybe seeing the remake first clouded my judgement a little even so its still crap, over all my rating is 1 out 10 and that is purely cause there is no Zero score.
The first hour consists of random 5 minute bits that make sense within themselves, but don't have anything to do with one another nor do they logically flow.
The best recommendation I could give: Skip the first hour, watch the minis do their stuff, then turn it off.
After fans of McKee's first film, "May," waited and waited as this was shot and reshot and constantly pushed back by the studios, "The Woods" is finally here.
All in all, don't watch the movie if you haven't read the book and if you watch the movie first don't expect the book to be related.
Usually I first see the movie, then, the book it is based on, as not to get disappointed by the differences in it.
It will always, forever be known that the first version of this book was put into screen in such a horrible way.
The made the character of Doc a wimpy old guy who at the first chance abandons Peekay.
Seeing as I hate reading long essays hoping to find a point and being disappointed, I will first tell everyone that this movie was terrible.
And not, surprisingly for the reasons mentioned in the first review.
Let me be the first to say, "Wow!
Everything is said, about the filmmakers intentions and abilities, in the first killing: you have this stupid magnifying of every single sound details (climbing the rocks, steps, panting etc..), showing a mind who thinks only in terms of technical matters and envelope, and has no clue about what's a character and what's storytelling.
Its not fun and no one wanted to be there in the first place.
The first, whose set up is established very early on, is glaringly obvious.
The second twist, which acts not only as plot but supposedly as a thematic comparison to the first, is what left me wanting my money back.
ALong with some of their first promotional films for earlier songs, this is more a collection of MTV-videos than a movie.
Brian Epstein, their manager and mentor, was dead, and this film - their first movie project without Epstein's guiding hand or Richard Lester behind the camera - was thrashed mercilessly by the critics, and this clearly still rankles with Paul McCartney decades later.
At first, you don't understand why Mr. Turner can't pick up his daughter and later, it kind of filters in that he is a very busy man.
A sparse and atmospheric cross between Suspiria and A Watcher in the Woods -THE WOODS delivers subtly for its first two thirds and erupts in a rushed finale that deserved a more thorough and complex screenplay.
But at least they have singing and dancing and singing and...  	For the first fifteen minutes or so of the film-- or maybe longer; it seems MUCH longer-- we are `treated' to Molly and Terry's Vaudeville act.
The first 25 minutes of this movie are a barrage of musical numbers meant to launch you into the narrative and to sum up the hoofers life in vaudeville.
When I first saw the 1952 version of the tale, I felt impressed.
they always travel huge distances to destroy us or our planet - we must be important ;)   this time they are doing it out of some silly ethical reasons - we are destroying the earth, so they will do it first - no comment so here some logical mistakes: - they take samples of the flora and fauna of the planet - does it mean the nano bugs will destroy everything?
The original movie has an extremely clear storyline with no idiotic story twists, no decidedly crazy and astronomically improbable behavior like this one has in spades, and is excellent from first moment to last.
The first reason: The Army isn't retarded.
It isn't really plausible that the US military would allow a civilian to be the first contact for alien visitors.
For about the first thirty minutes I could not stop wondering what was going to happen next.
The first thirty minutes of this movie had me expecting something good.
It didn't help that the part they wrote for him was as a spoiled brat who needed his buttÂ.. (I wish I would call an adult who is now my mother by her first nameÂ.)
But what I didn't appreciate about the remake is that it completely changed the story and the moral the first movie brought to us.
not as intricately paced as May but still a good film....i do have to correct IMDb on their error comment dealing with the lesley gore song mention....in the film, the dj clearly says, 'you first heard her at the ripe old age of 17 with the #1 hit, It's My party, Heres lesley gore' and then it goes into "you don't own me'.
2, The UFO "lands" and the first people out are the scientists.
Honestly though, this is the first time I can say that Reeves's presence in a film has absolutely nothing to do with why it is unwatchable.
Gale - read the script first and look for a good story.
Of course, such metaphysical feats of interpretation are intended to add an air of spiritual legitimacy to White's music: the film, after all, is a search for the world described in White's first album, "Wrong-Eyed Jesus."
Heather doesn't seem to fit in at the school, and has a rough first week there, getting in scuffles with a snobby bully named Samantha (Rachel Nichols).
Ozzie swallows one coin, and they hide the rest, while taking one to a Pawn Shop Owner (John Volstad) to see if they are valuable, and obviously Leprechaun kills the collector to get his first coin back.
Simple, I thought maybe during my first viewing I took it the wrong way, but honestly this time it wasn't any better.
Let me say that I know now why I managed to snag the first three in the series for a measly $12.
Hell, I can't figure out how the damned movie even managed to get distributed in the first place (despite the Jennifer Aniston factor, which is really no factor...her feeble powers are completely overwhelmed by this amateurish nightmare of a film).
oh, and btw ask yourself who is the craziest; weird michael, paranoid bashir, insane crying screaming dancing fans, or me for watching this document in the first place?
In 2002, director Lucky McKee made a big impression with his first full feature film, the oddball horror 'May'.
Furthermore, this story seems to have some truth as Heather suffers nightmares which focus on the surrounding woodsÂ   The film is really slow paced for the first hour, and despite some mysterious goings on at first; there isn't a lot of horror involved.
While The Woods doesn't feature much in the way of blood and gore, McKee skilfully manages to work some schlock sequences into the film, and the frenzied final third brilliantly offsets the slow build of the first two.
This movie in my opinion was trying to go for the music, not he plot, while in the first one, it had a plot but the music wasn't as good as the second one.
In the first fifteen minutes, our main character is guilty of theft, lying to the police, reckless endangerment of a child, using a child to perform a crime and the biggest one, assault.
Everyone first meeting him thinks he's an aristocrat, not a policeman (he is both), if they don't know better (or see that Inspector Fox is with him).
The first one really wasn't too bad, and even occasionally entertaining, but seriously nobody needed a sequel.
"The Unnamable Returns" carries on where the first film stopped, with Howard and Randolph escaping from the cursed Winthrop house.
Notwithstanding the fact they quietly walked away unharmed at the end of the first film, they're now being taken away in ambulances and under massive police supervision.
I didn't see the first movie, but I don't think I needed it to review this.
The first probably three minutes of the film is repeated frame for frame a little more than half way through.
But you know you are in trouble in the first minute of the film, when rocker Joan Armatrading tries to channel Joan Baez with an utterly tuneless ballad while a 007-ish title sequence flashes up images of suffering Africans.
The ending is puzzling at first but we can see that the problems of some people are often easier to handle than those who are their strength and support.
The expressions on the children's faces when they first see Slappy was priceless -- and the final scene was nothing but laughs.
But I saw this for the first time recently, and this film just did not work for me at all.
The same sequence reappears twice later, first as the source of still photographs (the existence of which had been indicated by instantaneously superimposing rectangular frame lines on the screen during this introductory sequence), and as a videotape.
This was my first comment in IMDb but I just had to do my part to make sure that anybody doesn't spend any money on this crap.
first and foremost, I'm an American.
He wants to be the legal guardian for the mentally disabled Chuck McMann, who is first seen breaking the window of a pastry shop so he can eat the displays.
He also befriends drifter Stacy Keach, whom he first meets while Keach is causing a drunken disturbance in a greasy spoon.
Rodriguez, who is angry both at white people, as well as blacks who don't try to rise above their station in life, at first resists Arkin's intrusion in his life.
Stacy Keach is only in the film briefly in the first half, but makes a nice impression as the multi-layered drifter who has become a social outcast that only Arkin understands.
After watching the first ten minutes or so, the acting seemed okay, the plot seemed to have potential, and the cutting on the titles section was first rate.
Find those "normal" people (not the extremes, which is what we were shown) and talk about their problems and why they get into debt in the first place.
She is the one who is responsible for her first dog's death as she allowed him to escape, and then she has the nerve to put the blame on her neighbor.
A movie that has three dogs dying in the first hour cannot be called a comedy.
After needed psych treatment Peggy feigns resurrection by first returning to her home and job (yes her employer actually takes her back) and then in a flash turns her back on all.
For the first time in her recent life Peggy is also, can you believe it, PETLESS.
Even first graders have a better vocabulary.
In short, it's the first movie we've watched where my fiancÃ© has said "We can turn this off if you want - this is horrible."
I can't Begin to put into words how bad this is, its long, drawn out intro of the film and then a rushed ending really spoiled it and made it hard to watch as it became boring within the first 20mins.
Thirty years after first seeing this movie, it still stands up, and still touches my heart in a way few movies have.
or act like an ugly B!tch and go out again and kiss or flirt with the first sleazy a$$hole she meets???
At the first sign of any problems she will look somewhere else then, when it all go wrong, she'll go back and the idiot Ben will take her back.
Kosashvilli's film is one of the most annoying, poorly-scripted (first year film students would be able to construct the plot better than he does), badly-acted and sloppily-directed pieces of muck that I have had the misfortune to see this year, and I have seen many poor films in the past nine months.
I waited some action in the first half, waited, waited and waited.
In the first half, no action, it is just visually well movie with Steve McQueen.
I went in being optimistic of catching a horror movie but I burst out laughing when i saw the first supposedly 'scary' scene where the God of Death appears.
I was hoping the second movie of Death Note would be better than the first one.
The basic storyline, if you haven't seen the first, is the carrier of the Death Note book is able to write names in it and they die.
Also, the morality question is lost and also the humor that was in the first movie.
All in all, this movie is a long experience that isn't as new or as interesting as the first one.
When I first approached this, I was not half expecting something more crude and nasty, but instead I found this to be mildly entertaining and an inoffensive ode to the classics of the genre, e.g.
i first heard of the film years ago, lots of hype about it being a great little indie zombie film (i am a huge huge fan of the genre), then when i eventually got hold of a copy it was well packaged and the cover looked good......after the opening sentence i had already made up my mind that this film was complete and utter tripe but i still gave the movie a chance.
Bookwalter is still at it today, nearly twenty years later, and is just as talent deprived (ie- Ozone) as he was when this piece of trash first came out.
BEWARE -- SPOILERS (sort of)  The first thirty minutes of this psychadelic flower-child generation-gone wild paranoid fantasy percolates to its 60's beat.
Her cousins (one of whom she meets for the first time and who weeps with shame at how his own father--Julius's brother--changed their name to Roberts and refused to even see his two nephews) are complete strangers to her.
Well first the acting isn't very good though, this isn't very surprising.
Vin Diesel didn't talk in the first one yet he does so in this film and that's not a good thing.
This made the film ruin the first one and made Riddick seem a lot weaker.
Watching the film again on cable reminded me how impressed I was when I first saw it.
The Chronicles of Riddick manages to completely lack the first and to somewhat ruin the latter.
The movie drops you right into the middle of this mess - I suppose that it was meant to be an intriguing way to start the movie but after the first 30 minutes you'll still be scratching your head trying to figure what the heck's going on.
"); a main character who is the walking, beefy definition of a Gary Stu (look it up) to the extent that he can tame giant, spiky rats just by staring them in the CGI-balls; a Lady Macbeth who shares a closet with the Borg Queen; dialogue very possibly stolen from a group of 12-year-olds playing ninja; and an ending that deserves catcalls of disbelief, this movie is saved -- even if, like the annoying Kyra, who you KNOW would get splatted in the first ten minutes of the movie if the Aliens were involved, it subsequently dies again -- only by the few minutes of Dame Judi Dench lowering herself to appear in it.
The first time I heard about this film, I was expecting a twisted thriller on space like Pitch Black.
It doesn't have any connection to the first film.
One of the first lessons of movie-watching; never waste time on a movie where the lead actor is also a producer.
The first 20 or so minutes of this film are really hilarious.
I saw this movie for the first time when I was 12.
I could barely get past the first 15 minutes.
thanks to this film (my first "christian" horror film), i won't be seeing any other religious brainwashing movies aimed at the family market.
Alan Arkin is memorable as the deaf mute and Sondra Locke, in her first screen role, also shines as the second lead.
Revelation was suppose to be their first big screen blockbuster.
The first two people to fall under the spell of the Devil Messiah are the blind girl who has just been hanging around for no apparent reason and wheelchair bound superhacker who wrote the basic code for the evil program (and who by an amazing co incidence happens to be the half brother of the leader of the underground.
I've not seen the first of these films Apocalypse in which a united world government is established and the rapture has taken place.
Who in his city include former news anchor Leigh Lewis who in the first film had been the first to denounce Macaluso for being Satan.
This was one of the first movies I bought for my VHS collection and would like to see it brought out in DVD with additional commentary.
Someone decided to cut some action and plot points into the beginning of the movie, giving away most of the story line in about the first 5 minutes.
So first it confuses you and then it puts you off.
The problem with this movie is summed up in the very first scene where Rubin " Hurricane " Carter fights Emile Griffith for the world welterweight championship in 1963 .
Awful, miserable film probably remembered as it was Joanne Woodward's first motion picture.
The chemist who preys upon Thymian is shown to be an evil lout from his first closeup, so it's hard to understand why she would ever talk to him.
For the first half of the film, indeed, one at least can be forgiving to the film because the characters inherent (and physical) beauty at least provides some sort of motion to the storyline.
At first this discursiveness seems rather stunning and unexpected, but a quick look back over a few points of the first half of the film start revealing that indeed, it seems Pabst really didn't have a clear understanding of overaching tones, themes, motifs.
It goes to extremes that seem at first to show the incredible level of conformity, decadence, ignorance, or whatever, but eventually go to far and fail to make an organized statement.
What father would tell his daughter to kiss the first bozo that comes along, just because he can drive a race car....
What is disappointing though is that the film could very easily have been much better if the writers had decided to just rehash the first film.
When I first saw this show I thought I was hearing David's self-congratulatory inner thoughts through the mic he has on his desk.
But the box did contain a quite good copy of BECKY SHARP which will be remembered as the first feature in 3-strip Technicolor.
OK, this was Oliver Stone's first movie, so I'll cut him some slack (although Satyajit Ray and George Lucas didn't need any pity points for their stellar debuts, "Pather Panchali" and "THX 1138", respectively).
I think this group has a chance to make top grade productions in the future, but this first attempted was tossed together.
You get used to the not so hot animation after the first few minutes.
It seems quite churlish to excuse a novice director's first feature-length outing (especially when you have not yet made one), and since this director, Marfield, was introduced at "Deepwater's" SIFF screening this past June, his direct and humble appearance made it a film you wanted to like.
Unfortunately, "Deepwater" is fraught with the flagrant over-eagerness and lack of restraint that can plague younger director's first outings (which is forgivable), as "Deepwater" doesn't so much resemble a movie as a does a really long movie trailer, vigorously painting the lily when you're already working with a pretty narrow flower.
Set in an anonymous rural America (though it's swamp setting seems to illuminate that this is either in or nearby southern Louisiana), we first meet it's sort-of hero Nat (Lucas Black) as he's just being released from a mental institution, headed towards Wyoming to become a sheep farmer (or something like that).
And when Coyote's young and lovely new wife Iris (Mia Maestro), initially resistant at first, vigorously seduces Nat and then hatches up a scheme to pilfer Coyote's "reward" money and escape, everything seems to be set.
Hopefully we can pardon David S. Marfield's first feature as a well-intentioned but completely turgid would-be potboiler, and perhaps if he finds time to relax and cannily craft a film with a decisive identity, he could very well find his own voice in popular modern noir.
That was the first time I asked for my money back based on a poorly made movie.
After seeing the first movie of the director, a very interesting movie,I expected a better movie.
The first complaint is the glaring inconsistencies.
The first movie, "White Fang," was an outstanding adventure story.
It abandoned all the good ingredients the first film had just to get in its politically-correct nonsense.
When I saw this film in Sydney when it first came out I thought it was a mini-masterpiece.
You know it's gonna be bad when the first two lines are: "My friend, what are you doing?
In fact, I saw first the play in the 70's, in my city, Barcelona, in a very good performance, and the public was very delightful.
I love both A and B horror but this was the first film in years that actually had me screaming in agony in my head.
You immediately know that you're in for a fun ride here when, in the very first minute or so of the films running time, an impromptu fight breaks out between our hero, played by the always superb Alexander Lou, and a somewhat gaunt looking chap who appears to be wielding what at first sight looks like a piece of guttering!
If this was made by a first year student filmmaker it would still be a result of the grossest incompetence.
Jeremy Beadle hosted it for the first 7 years, Beadle is a very funny man.
We also get southern beauties who present themselves with three names like "Amanda Ray Ross" and "Becky Ann Culpepper" and you just know that the first thing Fletch does is make a rather suggestive remark that the women find irresistible and they immediately jump in the sack with him.
The director, the script and the producers who greenlighted this stillborn project are first and foremost to blame here.
If you're making a movie about the music industry, please get some good music first because the whole reality of the film falls apart once we hear the crappy music.
I remember the first time I saw this movie the year was 1996 and I just couldn't stop laughing at the fake ninja tree fight scene.
It still made me laugh just as hard as when I first watched it.
(this is my first IMDB comment BTW, after using this site for years)  I found this movie the worst movie I've seen in a while (I've gotten good at avoiding them).
Dharmesh Darshan after melodramatic messes like BEWAFAA returns with AAP KE KHATIR a remake of A WEDDING DATE  The film also reminds of PYAAR TO HONA HI THA(FRENCH KISS remake) which was tad better  This film tries hard to look like a modern love story but falls flat The first half focuses on comedy scenes which are too in your face, the scenes between Akshaye and Priyanka too are awful especially their sudden love angle  The director suddenly forces the drama in second half and Punjabi stuff which is bad and the sudden Dino-Amisha angle is forced  Direction is bad Music is saving grace  Akshaye Khanna looks bored and though better then the rest yet he got typecast in such roles Priyanka overacts badly initially but is good towards the end Dino is okay, Suneil is horrible Amisha is bad Anupam and Lilette irritate and so the guju family
When asked why he surrendered in the first place, he stated that it wasn't important, so we never do find out.
The only relatively interesting part was seeing Scott Valentine strip nude in the first segment.
It's my fav KungFu movie, I first saw it back in 1993 and taped it when I got the chance...but I lost it.
A really warped uncle tell his nephew three different stories to try to convince him to sleep: the first is a sort of faerie tale with a couple of witches and their young male servant that try to resurrect one of their kind.
In the first, two witches are trying to revive their dead relative by getting their nephew to invite guests over, who they promptly slaughter and throw in a cauldron for ingredients.
It isn't frightening, the first two stories long outstay their welcome and the attempts at humour mostly fail miserably.
The first story deals with witches, as they perform stupid experiments.
The first story is kind of weird and creepy, and has some good parts when the corpse comes alive.
Truly recommended as a pure fun movie which value is in stupid dub, silly dialogs, trashy look, great action with obvious usage of dummies and wires... And after 20 years it just got better than the first time I watched it!
The stories told were not very good---the first was lame, the second goofy, and the third..interesting--but a little weak in the ending(it was the best of the three I think).
Let's start with the worst news first: the second story is really stupid and a complete waste of Donald Pleasance's horror talent.
The first and last stories are watchable, yet the quality level never surpasses your average 'Tales from the Crypt' episode or something.
The first story is about a wealthy, pale faced creature with few friends who falls in love with the hired help.
The stories start at various times and are interesting with the first being the best, but the silliness surrounding them lessons their impact.
The first and second stories are merely satirical, and in a very silly way.
The first one, which introduces the monster species 'Shadmock', is amusing, in a way, but unfortunately also quite tedious.
Once we've waded through that gibberish (and how it must have pained the eloquent and mellifluous Price to utter it) we sample the delights of a stripper who takes her performance all too literally, and are told three tales, the first and most atmospheric of which is about a 'shadmock' (the lowest on the monster food chain) who possesses a deadly whistle - the Roger Whittaker variety, not the referee's aid.
At first, Mr. Taylor's confident cockiness rubs everyone the wrong way; but, he earns his comrades' respect, through charm and ability.
I've seen first 60 minutes of this movie and it was the longest movie hour ever.
Its not that he doesn't look the part, HE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE AN ACTOR in the first place.
I first saw it when I was about 13 or 14 years old, so it has a great deal of nostalgic value for me.
I should have rented this movie first before I bought it.
"Chasing Sleep" is from the first minute it rolls over your screen a perfect and decent psychological thriller.
The movie like I already wrote starts from the first second on when you hit the play button as a damn good quality thriller!
Well I think I'm not able because I was so disappointed the first time.
What did I miss, if I did miss something in the first place!
The first couple of scenes between Pigeon (the CO) and Ruth Hussey (the CO's wife) seem a little awkward and the banter seems forced, but they get better.
Red Skelton's role as "Mugger" seemed artificial and forced -- unusual, I thought, as he usually seems very relaxed in front of the camera, but I have heard this was his first movie.
first, don't watch the trailer.
Unlike Tom from Santa Monica (the other reviewer), I didn't read any newspaper reviews - I just sat through the first 45 minutes and couldn't take any more.
As for the supporting roles, Paul Kelley and Red Skelton (apparently in his first film appearance) both deserve mention, as do the script writers.
Once the hero (Sir Gullible) found his wronged romantic love for the first time, all he had to do was to put her on his horse with him and ride out of the 10-acre kingdom for 24 hours...and the middle 2/3rds of the movie would have been completely unnecessary.
The worst is that there is nothing literary left - not the first time a director's agenda betrays that they just don't get why literature exists in the first place.
Not to mention that she was NINE YEARS OLD when she first got to Mansfield.
I've often joked in the past about some people's boundless (my words) affection for the later incarnations of The Dead End Kids but, actually, this and GHOST ON THE LOOSE (1943) are my first encounters with them.
In a scene which was, unfortunately underexploited by the mediocre script, Dr. McCoy rises to the occasion and, surprisingly, fills both his usual role and that of the great first officer.
Finally, this (and the great earlier City on the Edge of Forever)is one of the first episodes to exploit the (unfortunately largely overlooked and unrecognized) subtlety of William Shatner's acting ability by placing Kirk's personal life in the way of his professional practice.
We start this story after the end of the first Snow White.
When I first found this film existed on Wikipedia by chance, I read that Filmation, the company behind this movie, was planning on making a series.
Unfortunately, their first two films Happily Ever After and Pinocchio and the Emperor of Night were so disliked by critics that Filmation lost its reputation and eventually went bankrupt.
The final episode of the first season is a straight-out action adventure, a crackerjack alien invasion thriller.
Okay first of all this is just like Dr. Strangelove and even more like Fail Safe.
"Operation-Annihilate" is the final episode of the first season.
Some may think of her as the first lady of exploitica, I don't.
The commentary track on the DVD release was almost funny at first but soon it made me want to strangle Mrs.Wishman, irritating and selfish b***h!
In the "Purple Rose of Cairo," Woody Allen finally stays behind the camera for the first time since 1978's "Interiors," stepping away from constantly playing these neurotic show- biz/writer characters to brings us more of a romantic comedy that celebrates film as a form of escapism rather than a form of art.
It might very well be a rare find - and the video copy I tracked down was of pretty poor quality - it is first and foremost dreadfully boring.
The plot is lame.It's not very well paced and it's contrived with glaring errors (not least of which being why Hong is teaching Bernhardt martial arts in the first place seeing as how he was so proficient in them to start with.
If the movie had just been about a man and a woman having an affair after their partners first had an affair, this might have been a good movie.
The first unfaithful pair consisted of a guy who was a serial adulterer who should have needed a case of Viagra just to keep up with his many affairs and the lady was a self-involved neurotic.
With a few unforgettable Allen moments, like when Cecille herself goes into the movie (and one character's self-realization after discovering the wonders of, gasp, improvisation), or when Tom can't pay for a meal cause he has 'movie-money', Purple Rose of Cairo is one of those fuzzy but rare treats in the movies where we're reminded why we go to the movies in the first place.
Amount of disappointment I am getting these days seeing movies like Partner, Jhoom Barabar and now, Heyy Babyy is gonna end my habit of seeing first day shows.
The comedy part essentially lasts for the first half an hour or 45 minutes of the movie and is okay, not anything new or hilarious, after that, it's all the same old typical bollywood story with emotions and sad sobs thrown in.
However, within the first five minutes I knew that I'd been worrying about nothing.
Scenes like these only go to prove that Director John Landis has lost none of the excellence he showed in the first blues brothers movie.
The first half is such a drag that I thought 2 hours has passed whereas in reality it was just an hour.
and in that case i thought it be interesting and funny to see a sweet girl trying to buy pot for the first time.
The first time I watched this, I was confused and a little sad.
Like all of Woody's films the photography, and sound are first rate, and as usual technically very good.
The first half is the Sandler brand of immature fart jokes, while the second half is a tragedy that seems perfect for date movies.
I'm not exaggerating when I say that after the first half of this movie, the whole film was a big letdown.
Having said that, it is still generally more sweet content than deep and complicated satire- in fact it's just like the popcorn that Daniels' character Tom Baxter first tastes- brittle, the stuff is sweet, and like Baxter says, 'gets annoying when you keep chewing on it'.
For the first part of this film, I regretted having missed some of the cool decrepit sites depicted in the movie when I was in the Long Beach area years ago.
De Niro's ex-wife Maggie (some Patti LuPone) is quite hot in the MILF class, you can see her tits in her first scene, when her son comes home at night.
The problem is that in stripping the story down to the basics of the murder trial, it becomes obvious that the trial isn't all that interesting in the first place.
He is first bemused by a man walking an invisible dog -- when in the streets of his character's alleged hometown, people hold conversations with entire invisible people daily -- by the guy in the diner (pretty "fly" for a white guy), and then by the concept that a zillionaire, especially in the South, would keep loaded weapons in the house.
What stereotypes and clichÃ©s do we have, in just the first hour?
The story is not nearly as exciting as the first movie, probably because Ralphie Parker, fourteen-years old in this movie, has moved beyond the crisp imagination that he possessed as a grade school student in the first movie, which produced a film mostly from his childish perspective, and one that many could enjoy.
Of the two sequels, "My Summer Story" was much better, though neither could ever be better than the first.
Two flashbacks tell the story, the second being set earlier in time than the first.
The producer, played with gusto by Robert Morley, quickly falls out with the play's authoress, the marvellously eccentric Margaret Rutherford, and after the first rehearsal he rips out 27 pages of the 30 page script.
I believe this is my first one-star rating for an IMDb comment entry, and the only reason I award it one star is that there is no zero star setting.
ÂThe Purple Rose of Cairo', a title that says nothing about the real content of the movie, belongs to the first category.
At first the movie seems to be serious.
The first time I watched this movie I thought it was hilarious but the second time it just really rubbed me the wrong way...
In the first and most memorable scene in this movie, 'Jackson', while wearing a hockey mask and meandering around the streets of London one night, and grabs a guy from behind and peels back the flesh from his face and then punches a hole into the guy's chest and then rips out his heart.
Then, in the first of several changes in tone, we get annoying attempts at humour, where Jackson tries on cowboy hats in a store while still wearing his hockey mask, a cornball sequence where they go for a stroll on the beach one evening at sunset, while Jackson is still wearing his hockey mask(!)
Okay, first why steal the title from a classic western if not just to yank a few more bucks from their clients (us) when the so-called remake is butchered beyond belief.
Beautiful model in New York has to decide between two marriage-minded suitors--unfortunately, the one she decides on turns out to be a jealous psychotic, turning her back into the arms of the first boyfriend.
This movie should have been released on DVD first because its only worth a one day rental.
I would rather choose the first of these.
I remember the first time I saw the box for this DVD at Best Buy.
"The Purple Rose of Cairo" was the first Allen's movie I saw back in Moscow in the end of the 80s and it started my eternal love for his films.
It is not the first or last time Allen has played with the concept of the thin line (in this film, the silver screen) that divides film's world and reality but rarely has he created the film as sweet, gentle, sad, technically realized and simply terrific as "Purple Rose of Cairo".
I can still get my husband to throw things at me when I sing the first bar of that song...  
Animation: zero Sound quality all over the map: zero Dialogue (are you kidding me): zero Poster (a well done rip-off of the Finding Nemo design): 1 out of 10  I only log into IMDb to comment maybe three times a year and this is my first of 2008.
He promised he'll find the most beautiful pearl in the ocean for her (in the film, when a fish gives a pearl to another one, it means the first fish wants to marry the other one).
Ever been to a film where you are looking at your watch within the first 5 minutes?
My 2 and 4 year old daughters watched it, like they do every new movie, 6 times in a row the first day.
"Greeks on the Roof" is another example of the brain dead, banal, lame and dull witted Australian comedy which apparently can't seem to get by without referring first to some bodily function.
This is another one of those "intelligent art films" you need to read the review first before you can understand the movie.
The first major mistake was giving Harry Belafonte improvisation priveleges.
Let me mention the positive aspects of the film first, because otherwise I'll likely run out of room.
Great tracking shot in the opening, fine premise set up with the film's first (and principal) villain, then the scene cuts to Joseph Cotten, Edward Sloan, and Ruth Warrick, and suddenly it is like the driest stage play one can imagine.
Its funny at first, but by the end it is old.
Yeah, so you think its going to be a bunch of predators and a bunch of aliens whoopin each others asses... well its not.... its 3 predators.... and you don't see them or the aliens until after the first hour of humans walking around this temple confused and lost with pointless dialogue and this "I'm going to touch stuff that I don't know what it does yet" frame of mind...  when the 3 predators finally show up.. your thinking YES... carnage is coming... the reason I came to see this movie.... well...
I'm sorry... the first predator dies instantly to an alien... the 2nd puts about about a 20 second fight before dying to another alien... then after that awe inspiring 21 seconds of alien vs predator action, it goes back to the humans being lost and stupid again for an additional 20 minutes... then you are rewarded with another 20 seconds, where it shows the remaining predator kill an alien... but its not the uber fight you think its going to be... it takes all of .5 seconds for him to slice through the head with ninja like reflexes... im glad at least one of the predators wasn't a total weakling right?????
For an indicator of how long I have been a fan of the series, I will tell you first off that I saw Aliens when it came out on video tape in the late 80s and saw Alien 3 in theaters, I obviously saw Alien after its mid-70's release, and it scared me like few movies have ever been able to do since.
There were 3 of them in this movie, and it seems that the single predator in the first movie could have killed, not only all of the people in this movie by itself, but all three of the Predators in this movie by itself.
I was intrigued about how the first time a Predator blew itself up on top of the Pyramid it did not damage the construction at all.... Of course, the second time that another Predator did that, the whole thing fell apart.
I wonder why the Predators first came down from the sky shooting the hell out of the other guys who stayed in the abandoned whailing facility, no questions asked.
At first I thought I was insane and then I saw that this was an actual move.
(Then an alien bursts out of his chest and he DIES)   Alien: One of my favourite movies is ALIEN, and ALIENS and ALIEN 3, I like Pieere's ALIEN 4 but it was not as good as the first three films.
Firstly the gore is gone in Great Britain this is the first "Alien" or "Predator" film not to be an 18, this shows as there is nothing worth even flinching at in the film.The second is that the film tampers with alien biology it actualty hurts.
Every time I see a Paul W. S. Anderson movie, I watch the first twenty minutes and think "Hey, this might actually be good!"
Gradually at first, almost as if Anderson was thinking that if he just gave us a great opening we might forget about the fact that the rest of the movie was terrible.
Well, I saw this movie for the first time today.
Any mildly entertaining characters were immediately destroyed in the first twenty minutes of the film with zero payout.
The first was human interaction.
AVP also marks the first Anderson film I have seen in which the shaky-cam technique is used.
Seriously, why on Earth didn't they just base the script upon the first comic book series?
Much like the first AVP battle it is disappointingly short and 90% of the battle focuses on lex fighting the queen than it does focus on the Predator.
It turns out that this pyramid was part of the first human civilisation ever, that the Predators built it for the humans long ago, and in return, the humans worshiped the Predators as gods and acted as hosts for the captive alien Queens eggs that are in the pyramid, to make Aliens for the predators to hunt, not for sport like in the previous Predator films, but to prove that they are men.
A good first 45 minutes or so quickly melts into underacted pathos (Nobody emotes in this movie, cause they are all tough guys see.)
Packed with derivations from films that weren't any good in the first place (DANGEROUS MOONLIGHT, BEETHOVEN'S GREATEST LOVE) we get the studio-with-location-insets romance of classical pianist (wouldn't you know) Margaret Lockwood, who is not quite as awful as she would be in her post war efforts, and soon to be blind (he practices walking in mine shafts !)
There's an intense boredom involved because nothing really happens, we know from the first minute these are all dream sequences and hallucinations.
In fact for the first half hour FEAR RUNS SILENT has the same sort of structure as the dismal NIGHT OF THE DEMON with a voice over , a gory severed limb , a couple of dead teenagers , several college scenes that I just knew that I`d be watching a big pile of bigfoot droppings so I switched off
Pusher was a great movie no doubt so clearly i expected A lot from this one but i'm sorry to say that it does NOT and i repeat NOT at all reach the heights of the first one.
it's generally boring and not so tuff and scary as the first one cause i can remember in some scenes from Pusher i was really frightened but not at all in this one.
i hope pusher 3 goes back to the original environment from the first one and i'm glad to see that Zlatko Buric is back in this one cause he has only a very small role in pusher 2 and that sucks!
It wasn't cool, dramatic, or interesting the first time and yet it kept happening, as if it were the most dramatically meaningful thing that ever happened.
All pretense at actual drama in Alias died in the first half-hour of the pilot, and all that was left was a fashion show masquerading as a spy thriller.
Having watched all five seasons, the only reason i did that was because i watched season 4 & 5 first so i had to watch the first three for closure.
I was quite amused by the first series of Alias and am now ploughing through series 4, having seen the quality drop remorselessly since the opening.
The two first series are great, the third one is not too bad (fortunately, Melissa George was here), but then it got really bad.
It left me a bit confused, but mostly disappointed that the filmmakers seemed to rap this film up at the end without really taking time to make the ending as unsettling as the first 3/4 of it.
Yes, "Last Project" was made first, but there's a reason it's not as well known.
The first problem with The Last Broadcast is that it doesn't play like a documentary.
As with the sequel to THE GODFATHER, they all said it couldn't be done, but the makers of the RETURN TO THE BLUE LAGOON really managed to make a sequel that's even worse than the first one.
Again some bland teenagers (one of them the son of the couple from the first film) strand on the same island, try to survive, fall in love, make love and so on.
I loved the original version, well, the 1980 original version, and I found this to be basically a copy which wanted to cash in on the success of the first.
It seems that the filmmakers felt, in spite of the bad critical reception of the first Blue Lagoon, that an exotic island and two teenagers discovering sex and then fornicating (though we see none of that) was enough to create an entertaining film.
Unlike the way the first one ended, Richard and Emily are dead when they are found, but their son, Patty soon renamed Richard after his father is adopted by the only mother on the ship, Sarah who has another child, a daughter, Lily played by a new successful actress, Milla Jovovich.
The house has change a bit, but I guess it can't always stay the same, but Sarah raises the children more different than in the first film, Lily and Richard know the ways of nature and let their love blossom after Sarah passes from being ill.
I watched this movie for the first time last year because I loved the first one.
I don't understand why they took the parents from the first film, who were alive at the end, and made them dead in this one.
I don't understand why if Brooke Shields, at the age of 16, wasn't allowed to bare her breasts or rear end in the first one, why Milla was allowed to, at 16 also, bare hers in the second film.
There is beautiful photography and music, composed by Basil Poledouris (also the first film's musical composer) of course!
and mod '60's fashions, but a meandering story that makes all its points within the first half-hour.
At first you might think, "_Chuck and Buck_...critical praise...independent film."
I rented this movie because (a) I come from Orange County, CA, and (2) I wanted to see how Colin Hanks did in his first starring role.
Kidulthood has a good first ten minutes, but after that the film falls a part and is no more then a 2 out of 5 star film.
The first 10 minutes looks at the bullying of Katie (Rebecca Martin), who is attacked constantly by the girls and Sam threats he would kill her if she told her parents.
I saw this for the first time recently, and simply had to comment even though the film is a few years old.
Frankly, it has not aged well and having now watched it for the first time in 2007 it made me roll my eyes in disbelief.
John Woo's Ying Huang Boon Sik/A Better Tomorrow(1986) was groundbreaking when first released because of the stylistic depiction of the action scenes.
The scene where Mark tells of his ordeals at a nightclub as a first time gangster is nostalgic and touching.
The first of many elaborate gun battles that dominates the films that follows A Better Tomorrow(1986).
When Michael Keaton's character is first seen as silhouette in the morgue door, a totally original comedic character was born.
The scariest part of this movie happens in the first 3 minutes to a farmer's chicken.
Even when I first saw it years ago, I wasn't too impressed.
The first movie was similar in description, but I think it surpassed the show in several ways.
See the first one.
Well, first of all, there are some pretty poor quality characters.
Now, I must admit that watching "Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie" again after all these years wasn't quite the same as watching "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie" for the first time earlier this year.
However, I guess the fact that I actually saw it in my childhood is a major part of this, and if I just watched it for the first time, it probably would have been very similar to the experience I had with its predecessor, watching it for the first time way too late.
My thoughts: I really don't like this movie, first off, it's not a movie, it's more like a 90 minute episode of the TV show, as a matter of fact, that's what the movie should have been, a 3 part season premiere, second problem: the title, why is it called Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie and not just Power Rangers: Turbo just like the show, also, why isn't this a sequel to the first film?, I mean, come on, can't you just at least make a more proper sequel, I know this was after most of the original cast left, but dang, also, the special effects were worser than the effects in the first one, they look like something a nerd would do on After Effects, the Justin kid was so annoying, he's not even worthy of being the Blue Ranger, the Lerigot character angered me, he looks like a cross between an Ewok and a troll baby doll, the villains are dumb, however, I did like the soundtrack, and there a few decent action scenes, but that's it.
I remember reading the Roger Ebert review for the first Power Rangers movie and above all else he hated the fact that the Rangers were, essentially, color coded clones with only thin streotypes as personalities.
I don't hate boy bands, I can name all the Pokemon, and I enjoyed the first season of "Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers" as I'd enjoy an old Godzilla flick.
I loved the first movie, but this one is so horrible, you couldn't pay me to sit through it.
I am probably one of the minority of intelligent teens who liked the first movie (even though I have just turned 18).
The first movie should appeal to children under the age of 8 and had one decent villain followed by the worst $0.02 CGI transformation sequence in the history of mankind.
The first film, 1995's "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie", brought the six butt-kicking teens from the Fox Kids series to the big screen for the first time.
Also, the script is much worse than it was in the first movie.
Or better yet, release it as a TV movie, were this series started in the first place.
The first hour of this movie (including commercials) is truly a mess and completely unbelievable.
Dean Cain is really the only convincing male actor of the five (at least in the first 1/2).
Although his coming out of the bank,with guns blazing is just plain stupid,along with the fact that he's wearing guns under his tuxedo in the first place.
When Andy is the first to get shot and then the FBI shooting up Cain and "Hamlet's" get away bus in a scene somewhat similar to the ending of Clint Eastwood's,"The Gauntlet".
That being said, this movie features some of the funniest lines I have ever heard in a movie, particularly from Michael Keaton, who made one of the GREATEST entrances ever in what was his first film.
While rather good and relatively fluid, it shows that more money went into making a lousy movie look good than actually starting out with a decent movie in the first place.
That being said, this movie features some of the funniest lines I have ever heard in a movie, particularly from Michael Keaton, who made one of the GREATEST entrances ever in what was his first film.
the first 3/4 of the film have nothing at all to do with the storyline and just consist of drawn out character development for characters i care less than nothing about.
I really have no idea how come people get ready to FUND such kinds of movies in first place.
The first time that I'd seen this movie's title and didn't know anything about the movie, I assumed that it was a horror movie.
While eventually the meek are supposed to inherit the earth, first they stop in Japan to inherit two million yen off the Yakuza and Baby Yakuza as portrayed here by the Keystone Kops.
But I found it quite unforgivable that you simply can't believe in the first part of the movie the main character is a man.
Or, if this was too much a hard thing to do, why they didn't choose a real man to act in the first minutes.
Some familiar music, some of which you may like; some nice moments - the first breakfast scene is nice; some sentimentality; but don't look for a story that makes too much sense and has you feeling totally good inside by the end, for you won't be like that - you'll feel somewhat empty but of course not fully empty.
This film deserves recognition by virtue of its cinematography and for the first class (almost brilliant) job done by the leading actress.
The first half of the film probably devotes more time to nothing much happening than it does to dialogue.
I saw this film for the first time in the 70's in a funky little theater in Manhattan on a double bill with Joe Cocker/Leon Russell's "Mad Dogs And Englishman".
It feels like a first year film school project gone horribly wrong.
Besides, Bob Rafelson and the Monkees did this kind of thing first (and more slickly, to involve a wider audience) with "Head" in 1968.
Somehow, early parts aren't devoid of promise... the first scene with O'Quinn actually has some dialog and points that were interesting, and the first episode, "A Clean Escape," did at least show some quality to it.
It should be noted that we only got to see these first two episodes, as our local ABC affiliate chose to air pre-season football instead of the two episodes following it... and ABC buried it in a spot in the summer, when they would be watched by hardly anyone.
The first episode of this series was a ham-fisted political statement with little merit.
Viewing of the second episode ultimately left the same impression as the first.
While initially promising, and a much better use of actors and a wider, more involving setting, this episode succumbed to the same preachy, heavy-handed political dogma that marred the first one.
While there, Winkler meets a rambunctious, hyper active "idea man" played by a pre-Batman Michael Keaton in his first leading film role - also the one that made him famous to begin with.
The only part that made appeal to me was the first part, the 80s setting.
The first 45 minutes of 'The Laughing Dead' is very tedious viewing since they're presenting us a character drawing nobody really cares about.
There's no intrigue and the acting is very lame so the first half is very tough to sit through.
Why this flimsy film was made in the first place seems only due to lasting resentments on the part of the Australians at the arrogant and crude behavior of Frank Sinatra when he made an appearance in Sydney during a world tour: he insulted the press, caused the labor unions to react in defiance by cordoning off his connection to the world outside his darkened hotel suite and demanded an apology from the star, an act that Sinatra refused to do.
When this opened in London - today - I attended the first performance and found myself alone.
The first episode didn't turn me off.
In the first story, called "The Missing Ingredient," written and directed by Alison Anders, Ted checks in a clan of witches who try to perform a resurrection but can't because they lack a certain component in their spell.
The next segment, called "The Wrong Man," written and directed by Alexander Rockwell, is equally as bad, if not worse (it's a tough call) as the first.
The first half is a painful experience, while the second half is simply not good.
The first segment ("The Missing Ingredient") is, quite possibly, some of the worst drivel I have ever watched.
I got the strong impression that it was written very quickly, and that it was written with the intention of being humorous by a person who doesn't know the first thing about humor.
I can't even remember the 2nd story ("The Wrong Man"), which is a testament to the poor quality of the first half of this tape.
I give the first two segments a 3/10, I give the latter two segments a 6/10.
I really can't understand those who like this movie, and I really can't understand this movie!The first two episodes are totally nonsense, and I think the first is the worst of the movie.
1982's "Night Shift" which was one of legendary director Ron Howard's first works can now be considered a comedy classic.
Okay, i'm a guy so i had to like all the toplessness in the first Room, the second room was quite annoying, 3rd room was humorous, gotta love the children, the little boy is from desperado.
I think Tim Roths character got annoying after the first 10 mins, obviously tarentino or rodrigous didnt pick the music for they're rooms, all in all, Dont waste your money, but if your a True Tarantino fan you must get it.
(a couple of the four "acts" play out at the same time and while at first glance seeing both sides of a phone call in different segments seems novel, you realize that the timing would not allow Ted the bellhop to be in two places at the same time.)
I swear I heard the phrases "rats leaving a sinking ship" and "women and children first" in the foyer as people left.
This is in fact the first time I've ever walked out on a movie, so that tells you something.
It seems that I'm the first person to review this movie on IMDb.
Some of the shots would make a first year film student proud.
If you want to see a quality Bond/spy spoof, try the Derek Flynt movies with James Coburn or even the first Austin Powers flick.
You will find the 20th showing of any of these movies more enjoyable than the first viewing of Spy Hard.
I was ready to walk out on this film within the first 5 minutes.
I was happy enough with the Naked Gun films when they were first released.
You should too, if you're into first rate comedies about prostitution and pimp daddies.
Just not enough to raise it above a slightly below average slasher film.It IS however better then the first film in the franchise.
For some reason, the killer dons a mask to kill the first couple, but then shuns it to kill most.
Of course, there's no connection to the first two- why the killer chooses to use a drill when a knife, a machete, a gun, or any number of other things would make more sense.
I figured this one would have been good since it seemed that'd it be much like the first one.
The first killing occurs pretty fast into the movie, just as was the case with the original, which keeps things going pretty fast from the start on and doesn't make the movie drag as much and be such a total bore as "Slumber Party Massacre II".
As a matter of fact this movie is just very similar to the first movie.
I love the first SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE partially for nostalgia value but mostly because it's a genuinely fun movie, so I figured I'd give a go at this one, ignoring warnings such as the 4 Star Joe Bob review on the front of the video box.
But what's really a bummer is that the killer is revealed in the very first flashback of the film, so why Ulmer threw away the element of surprise is a real mystery.
The first two waves have the effect of causing a small part of it to glow red.
The name Samuel Z Arkoff appears first on the credits.
The meteor got killed in the first reel.
I hated the first Urotsukidoji, but this one really SUCKS!
The first law of storytelling says that you need a conflict in order to have a story.
This movie also features one of the worst battle sequences using swords, starting from the very first one on the bridge.
I, like several others, was inspired to write my first review because of this film's blatant failure to deliver.
I really loved the first seasons of the Simpsons, but I think their humour is not fresh anymore.
This was the first Swedish movie (except Josef Fares' movies and Vuxna MÃ¤nniskor) that I saw from the beginning to the end.
Finally, the ahead-of-its-time cast includes Shannen Doherty as a junior girl scout, Richard Belzer as a grotesque gangster pimp, Kevin Costner as a frat boy, Clint Howard (Ron's younger brother who starred in Gentle Ben and a classic Star Trek episode) as Keaton's first limo customer, Murphy Brown's Pat Corley as Hecht's father, and Ghost's Vincent Schiavelli as an obnoxious deliveryman.
I was watching this movie, and at first, I was enjoying it and finding it somewhat powerful.
When the femme non fetale first arrives at the PI's office it's this dreadful side shot which just sits there for about five minutes while the two of them fail to act in each others general direction from the opposite sides of the screen.
I caught the first twenty minutes of this on the Fox Movie Channel, and was so intrigued that I rushed out and rented it last night, after finishing a 3 1/2 year project.
There were a lot of little things that didn't quite work (for me, at least)-- The first loophole that Douglas rules on made no sense both logically and legally.
You can't even find what the storyline for this movie was in the first place!
After almost two hours of poorly done homosexual-dildo jokes (as if they could be done in good taste), horrible improvised "acting" performances, and overall immature storyline, I am questioning how this movie could even have been produced in the first place.
The first half's plot is from Maitrayi Devi's Bengali novel "Na Hanyate" (English translation: It does not die) which was written in response to world-renowned scholar Mircea Eliade's semi-autobiographical novel "Bengal Nights".
I am no fan of Salman Khan and while I am still willing to give Ash a chance, this film is the sort of junk that gave her a bad reputation in the first place.
Incredibly, you start being bored after just ten minutes, as the first of many endless dialogues flows quietly.
Even though John Steed and Emma Peel are supposed to be meeting for the first time as this picture begins, it is assumed that we viewers know the characters and everything about them already, so the action begins without any delay.
Consequently, fifteen minutes into the movie, one feels like they've missed the first hour of the film.
ralph fiennes was laughably bad and Sean Connery finally gave his first truly horrible performance.
I first saw the movie at the cinema upon its release and, at that time, I did think that it was one of the worst films I'd seen up to that point.
It's not hard to imagine audiences feeling a bit short-changed when it first came out, especially as the film was a big-budget, would-be summer blockbuster.
Nicole Kidman, to whom the role was first offered, would surely have been better, in particular, she's displayed flawless English accents in films such as The Others and The Hours.
Handled properly, the film could have been a wonderful success for all concerned, the first chapter of an entertaining and lucrative franchise, stretching well beyond the 1990s; instead it's one of the most embarrassing flops of that decade.
I was ridiculously excited for the arrival of this film and had nauseated all my friends when the project was first announced about who was to be our two spies.
They say that horror film series like these tend to deteriorate after the first film, and this is exactly what Scream does.
They didn't keep a dark enough tone like they did in the first and second.
It doesn't match up to the first 2 with their wit, thrills and quality.
Watch the opening of Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard or read the first page of Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man after Toto and you may catch my drift.
In fact, the plot is "tricking you" into thinking it's going to get good, and then when you're interested again, it's like - "hehehe... got you sucker...", and then continues to unfold as lamely as you subconsciously assumed it would after the first 15 minutes.
Why does the film show Halsman alive and well in America in the 1950s spoiling any dramatic tension - we already know in the first 2 minutes of the film that he is going to be free, whats the point watching any further?
Salman's comedy films like HELLO BROTHER, MAINE PYAAR KYUN KIYAA are terrible But this film is even worse A remake of BRUCE ALMIGHTY, but a bad one It's boring and keeps getting worse First few reels between Salman- Priyanka and Salman- Anupam are as boring as ever and Salman's shouting worsens And if this isn't worse Enters Sohail Khan trying to do a Akshay in MSK and the film gets even worse, unbearable their scenes together are so bad, that you will surely get a headache the twist in the tale too seems illogical and the second half gets even more childish The lie detector is okay but the way the film ends it's even more stupid  Rumi Jaffrey seems inspired by his mentor David Dhawan and follows his Style too much but sadly fails in handling the film Music is outdated SFX too is bad  Performances are mediocre Salman is unbearable in first half, he shouts too much and his dial delivery is also bad, in second half he is better but sadly nothing even good enough Sohail is even worse, he is bad Priyanka Chopra doesn't have anything to do Dalip Tahil, Anupam Kher are average Amitabh seems to have walked out of a Rein and Taylor ad and just moves around with a know it all smile but his presence does uplift some scenes
Yes, Loic is enigmatic and incredibly attractive, and the film could have developed well based on that, but instead it wanders hopelessly after its first 20 minutes and becomes essentially 90% talk and 10% plot.
This film suffers where many first time films fail (gay or straight) when a director chooses to film their own script.
Its not romantic, dramatic or clever and (ladies) if you drag some poor schmuck out to see it on your first date it will probably be your last.
If you go to see Lethal Weapon 18, you expect F's and GD's galore, but it really took me by surprise in a romantic comedy, especially since there are so many GD's in the first 15 minutes of the movie.
The only good parts were the first and last songs.
Why were they attracted to one another in the first place?
The first movie from Belgium director Jaco Van Dormael is pure magic.
It's so bad that the first word of the title is misspelled (I'd be willing to allow for the possibility of it being some awful pun if everything else didn't suggest that it was out of the intellectual league of the producers to allow for this.
Kirk, always the first to kill a god (see the awful STAR TREK V movie and the "Val" episode for more about this), orders a sexy crew member to refuse Apollo's love in order to tick him off--even though she really does think the guy is pretty buff and sweet.
I saw this movie when it first came out and was impressed by its slacker(the film)-like construction.
We first watched it in early 1980s on TV and became capitvated by the strength of these women.........you become wrapped up in the lives of each one of them.
OK, that covers the first 10-15 minutes of film, and it's the only part of this 2 hour fiasco that makes any bit of sense.
There's also a really fine performance buried in the film by Cathy Lee Crosby (as the distraught wife of Matthau's first partner).
As someone else on this forum noted, it works well for about the first 15-20 minutes, then decays into pointlessness.
It isn't necessary for every film-made-from-a-novel to stick exactly to the original, word-for-word, but the only good part of this film was that first 15-20 minutes, which is transported fairly closely from Stockholm, where the original was set, to San Francisco.
Tenko is a series I first watched at the tender age of 13 years back in 1981.
She plays the scene where she first learns who Edward is in a very haughty way.
Hind's Rochester at first felt spot on, moody...but then he just started yelling giving it a less than nuanced delivery.
Yet some scenes less with Mrs. Fairfax fussing around and some scenes more between Jane and Rochester would have been very helpful to make the audience understand why the two latter fall in love in the first place.
This is the worst, but there are many others scenes which are similarly absurd and ludicrous: the first scene of Rochester galloping in slow motion through the mist before he falls into a brook, Grace Poole coming out of the lunatic's room to sniff at Mason's wounds like a wild beast, Rochester sitting on the top of an archway of Thornfield as if he were the court jester and Mason jumping on horseback over the church fence to prevent a marriage of which he has heard only heavens knows how.
Rochester and Jane are far too disrespectful to each other at first and later far too hot.
The first time I saw the trailer for this film was about year ago inside a movie house.
Within the first half hour, the characters were already getting on my last nerve.
I grew up on the Navajo Nation, and right away in the first 30 minutes I see that the movie was filmed over 200 miles away from the Navajo Nation where the story takes place.
The first movie based on a Tony Hillerman movie had actually been filmed on the Navajo Nation.
Redford's first effort to adapt Hillerman (which his company now tries to pretend never existed) was Errol Morris's "The Dark Wind."
The book had some scenes that would have made wonderful cinema such as the interogation of a murder suspect who gleefully confesses to the committing the crime but claims to have used a rifle instead of a knife, the surprise reception for Chee at his first session as a healer, the discovery of the true identity of the shotgun artist, Leaphorn's rescue of Chee that unintentionally delivers him into the hands of the real murderer, and the ironic circumstances that rescue Chee for the second time.
What was the reason for discarding these potentialy terrific moments and replacing them with a script that was almost on the same level as the type of Hollywood TV detective series that gets justifiably canceled in its first season?
I was born in New Orleans in the first half of this century, and I have watched sadly as the music I came to know and love as a child has quietly died (pace, Don McLean).
It just falls apart like one of those cartoon characters that's been hit in the head with a falling anvil: first, the head, then an arm, then..., well, you know.
The first reviewer here remarked on the retiree stereotypes and the gags wear thin, thin after the first run through.
In the first act, we're bombarded with senior citizen stereotypes: getting to a restaurant in time for free soup, ogling young women, having weak bladders, playing Bingo, etc.
Voice overs worked great in The Wonder Years (tv show) but I don't need a voice over for the first 45 minutes of any movie.
Despite occasionally seeing tiny glimpses of Lee in the first 2/3 of the film, he is the clear star of the final portion of the film--the only portion of the movie that should have included Lee in my opinion.
Clouse and Wood weren't the first graverobbers on the scene, to be sure, but they both came away from the boneyard with unclean hands.
The only thing shocking and disturbing about the film is that it was ever made in the first place.
This is my first Ruggero Deodato film (Next on my list to view is his 'Cannibal Holocaust' film).
I WAS very nervous and fearful throughout the first half of the film in not knowing what to expect after psycho Alex (David Hess) and his friend hit the party.
Flynn's first film in 1950 but the miles and trials were taking a toll on Errol.
Nevertheless, the Technicolor cinematography (Calabasas Ranch)is first rate plus production values make up for the drab characters.
An unarmed, young Mexican shepherd becomes the first casualty with a bullet in the back.
Stick with the first film in the series, which is funny and scary and exciting, all at the same time.
I have not seen the first two movies in this series, although I have seen a lot of Larry Cohen films.
At first I thought my friend had some issues.
Ann Bell plays Marion Jefferson,the bored army wife,tired of all the endless tea parties and receptions then when she is evacuated with the other women,the first real shock is her best friend Vicky(Wendy Williams)drowning,Tenko certainly got shock you with the death of a popular character when you least expected it.
In the first series we met elderly but defiant Slyvia Ashburton(Renee Asherburn)who refuses initially to sleep beside Eurasian girl Christina Campbell(Emily Bolton) but gradually the woman start to see each other as people and strong friendships are formed particularly when the women build a new hut,much to the surprise of camp commandant Yamauchi(Burt Kwouk) When Cockney prostitute Blanche(one of my favourite characters)is caught escaping with Debbie(Karin Foley)whose mother has just died,the whole camp is punished with a real feud developing between the English and the Dutch,headed by the formidable Sister Ulrica(great performance by Patrica Lawrence)and the selfish Mrs Van Meyer (Elizabeth Chambers) the feud is resolved as the women work towards Blanche's release.
Crash just consists of a bunch of random sex scenes between two characters we don't even know in the first third, then consists of sex scenes between two characters we don't even give a damn about in the second third before trying to end up as some sort of tragic, poetic love story about two people who have now discovered what really sexually turns them on.
I discovered this series when it played on A&E (back when A&E was actually "artistic" and "entertaining"), but unfortunately, I never saw the first half of the first season.
The cheesy art of the box cover was the first clue.
I was unfortunate enough to catch a screening of Experiment at the Phoenix Film Festival, although I'll be honored to be the first on IMDb to warn you all of what you'd be getting into if you were to see it.
A woman named Anna (Georgina French) wakes up in the middle of the street in Prague (where I'm assuming it was shot for cost reasons - first bad sign) without knowledge of her identity or even what language she speaks.
In the movie he never seems fascinated, but ultimately annoyed -- he seemed patronizing and dismissive from the very first.
I am so sick of them, particularly of her, what was at first her appealing acting style, the same in movie after movie after movie, now makes me want to shoot the screen.
Robert Forster is semi-interesting as an predictable love interest for Mia and an ecologist who can predict the entire movie in his first scenes if only the screenplay had allowed him.
Rock Hudson in his early 50's (his first foray into the 'disaster' genre) appears like a disheveled modern-day version of William Shatner.
I absolutely adore Tenko - I saw it on video for the first time when I was 19 years old and was absolutely hooked!
For those people in the US who want to see Tenko again (or even for the first time as I don't know if it was ever on PBS), you can simply order it from Amazon.co.uk and have it sent over.
For those new to this series, the first episode of season 1 is a bit clunky, but give it time and space.
Like that film, it was also made in colour (the first three were in black and white), but the end product shares very little else in common with any of it's four predecessors.
I remember watching this film for the first time, and thinking to myself "Will somebody PLEASE slap her?"
I saw this film as a student, when it first came out.
Never repeated on BBC television, and only the first season available on video (and long since deleted), Tenko still holds strong and popular places in the memories of its audience.
The first series deals with the Japanese invasion of Singapore, disrupting lives of the ex-pats living in the British colony.
After viewing this film I wound up scratching my head with so many questions of how this thing ever got made in the first place.
However, someone must have really had it out for Ameche, as in addition to saddling him the with Ritz Brothers, many of the songs they gave him to sing (in particular the first one) were simply awful.
This is considered, at least by IMDb, as Stanley Kubrick's "first feature made in color" and it was long thought lost.
Well, first, it isn't a feature film but just a dreadfully boring promotional video for the Seafarer's Union and the narration makes Jack Webb's delivery on "Dragnet" seem emotional and off-the-cuff in comparison!!
For a more fair idea of his potential, try watching his real first features--KILLER'S KISS and THE KILLING--two exceptionally well made low-budget films that proved the man could make a lot with nothing.
There are only two things noteworthy about 'The Seafarers' - it was directed by Stanley Kubrick, and it happened to be his first film in colour.
It also shares its ability to bore me witless, with the quantity and quality of sex seriously waning after the first half an hour, and very little in the way of decent gore, despite featuring more of the undead.
I nearly wanted to cry after the first 15 minutes (and 2 scenes).
Nanette Newman is adequate as Velvet Brown but her involvement in the story offers little more than comforting moral support for the first half of the film.
It is clearly not up to the standard of living in the first world, but it is an improvement.
In the first TB movie, it seemed that Sakurazuka Seishiro's romantic advances were targeted more towards Sumeragi Hokuto than Sumeragi Subaru, and in this one, they were almost completely absent.
But he fails worst as producer as that makes him overall responsible for putting this mess together in the first place!
I mean, when the first scene of a movie is a sex scene, you know two things.
Well, I was right about the first thing, but horribly, horribly wrong about the second.
Having abandoned quality after the first one the series has opted for repeating a formula with usually increasing flesh and hoping that word of mouth and shear deluge of films will make money.
If Liam arrives at what looks like a fully intact city at the end, was it really harmed in the first place?
I really loved the first movie Mimic.
A movie or TV series is first a story.
Mimic: Sentinel is set in New York where a sufferer of the disease Stricklers which is mentioned in the first Mimic (1997) named Marvin (Karl Geary) lives with his mom Simone (Amada Plummer) & younger sister Rosy (Alexis Dziena) in an apartment block, he can rarely venture outside his sterile room as he is apparently 'environmentally sensitive' whatever that means.
Petty Mimic: Sentinel is the third film in the Mimic series & you know a series is in trouble when they stop numbering them after only the first two & as if by magic my fears are confirmed with this distinctly average at best horror/thriller.
He also has this bag of stuff which I presume is the killer bugs blood so they won't attack him but I'm only guessing because that's what happened in the first film.
Why the only relationship between the main character (the brother) and the bugs, is that he was one of the surviving children of the plague that the bugs were created for in the first place?
Like if it were not for this fact, viewers wouldn't be able to link this installment with the first two.
For that matter, was it important to the storyline in the first place?
The first two Mimics I liked a lot.
I'm more interested in the mindset of those who would waste their life watching this kind of nonsense in the first place.
(Don't worry about me, I've already gone mad..) And if all that still hasn't put you off, get this.. Our muscular, tough-as-nails lead character's real, non-acting first name is.. PETER.
This is writers Michael Carnes' and Josh Gilbert's first writing effort.
This would be the first problem I had with this film.
Due to being a fan of the first Scream and having liked James Tobacks Black and White.I was keen on seeing how this film would be with both of them working together,and though it tries to be a smarter Indicent Proposal (a film that is referenced a lot during the movie)is just ends up becoming very boring and painfully slow.
View on the film:  For the first twenty minutes writer/director Toback gives the film a bit of a similar feel to Richard Linkletters great first film Slacker.With the characters meeting up in very loose over-lapping scenes.Disappointingly after this,the camera for some dumb reason is kept about half a mile away from anyone in the rest of the film,and whilst this could have worked for a few part of the film to give it an "intimate" look.but due to it being constantly used,all the passion and intimacy in the interview in naked scenes is completely lost.And for all of the apartment scenes Toback has a very loud piano playing the same three or four notes,for the whole of the film,which gives the impression that there is a ghost badly playing a piano in the apartment!!.
The highlight was the first 2 minutes with Neve showing us all the goods.
I think this is the first movie I've ever regretted watching.
There is only one interesting conversation here, between Campbell and the Count as he first attempts to proposition her.
If you haven't seen the first one, by all means watch this but given half a chance watch the first one first, give this film a miss.
Give this film a miss if you like the first and if you haven't seen the first film...give this one a miss anyway!
I was really fed up watching the first half itself not to mention about the second half.
for the frustrated guys amongst us: watch the first five minutes and then turn it off, no more boobs from that point on (I know it was a real downer for me too) for all the rest: don't even bother looking at all, jeez.
Why the film was even made is the first and lesser of the two puzzles I came away with.
That was okay, too - because the story didn't have anywhere to go to, and after the first 15 minutes, you don't want the characters to develop - you want them to either make sense or go away.
Neve Campbell plays Vera Barrie, a poor little rich girl who, at first glance, appears to be fending off the efforts of everyone around her to use and control her.
I have to (somewhat educatedly) guess that we're looking at the old Jeffrey's Ranch Speedway in Burbank in the first racing sequence.
The first half hour is a long, drawn out affair I guess to establish Elias Koteas' character, who seems to be nothing more than a series of ticks.
This is the first bad review that I have given.
And the first half hour is the most grueling 30 minutes anyone has the displeasure to sit through.
The movie looks like someone grabbed a camera for the first time and thought, "wow, I'll make a movie."
As a guy from a relatively square state, I have news for Wally White... first, you might be part of a minority, but this kind "better than thou" behavior isn't far off from what fueled such lovely historical eras such as Nazi Germany.
"Shiryo No Wana 2: Hideki" is a vile and repulsive movie which tries in vain to emulate the success of the first "Evil Dead Trap" but ultimately ends up as a vastly inferior sequel(in name only).
The acting is really bad, especially in the first episodes.
Just let me tell you what happens during the first 15 minutes.
By now you will know that you are not watching a movie, but are instead trapped inside the dream of some pathetic drunken 80s squatters, "a bunch of mindless jerks who'll be the first against the wall when the revolution comes".
During his first trip, he meets a girl, Jackie, who he remembers from his past.
At first I just thought she'd be a sign to Jack that he's time traveling, but then she ends up helping him and being the love interest?
There are warning signs from the start, with the first five minutes being so heavy with exposition that you want to shout, "Enough!
Why does this worldly but essentially decent woman take up with a repressed family man in the first place?
But the film does come across as a cross between Bonnie & Clyde and the first half of A Clockwork Orange.
Nothing to make you give a hoot about the main character in the first place.
His first movie "The Craic" was terrible, and this may be worse.
My first complaint is simply that the screenwriters/director/producer seem to think they are better storytellers than R.E.
I love the first film.
Now, the whole point of the first Blues Brothers film is that these guys can't stay out of trouble.
And that's the first three minutes of the movie.
(Or might have even been the first MINUTE).
No effort is made to build any characters or make us care about anyone..and no one is likeable or cool enough to care about them at first sight.
Having said all that, while I found Ms. Bara's vamping pretty entertaining near the end, the first 30 minutes of A Fool There Was almost put me to sleep since that time mainly concerned the man she was fooling with's family.
I hate movies that destroy the spirit of the first film.
Seriously, when I first saw the styling of the new baby dragon, I expected it to swallow a turtle any moment on the way and sprout angel wings.
Well, given that the first Dragonheart was no Citizen Kane - heck, it wasn't even an Excalibur in itself - my expectations were low for this movie.
Dragonheart: ANB builds on the contrivances of the first and offers its own; now there's a new semi-evil ruler guy (you'll love his beginning speech decreeing that citizens must always speak the truth), a new convenient dragon (whose 'ice lung' ability is just a little too powerful) and a wimpy hero who learns to deal between the two, sort of.
For those of you who saw the first Dragonheart, which was a WONDERFUL MOVIE and I suggest you see it, you should know the second one makes VERY LITTLE SENSE.
I thought this movie was lacking plot, good acting, and it made little sense prior to the first movie.
You'd think the fire and ice would cancel out or explode or something, but anyway, If you liked Draco in Dragonheart, see this one because Drake (The young dragon) is the only similarity to the first film.
I loved the first Dragonheart.
The first Dragonheart was an action-fantasy epic, this movie is just a dull kids version.
I'd watch the first one with them.
The Dragons looked very very fake, and the fact that the first movie was made in '96 and had much much better effects shows the lack of care put into the sequel.
The first one had a serious storyline and was awesome to watch.
I enjoyed the first Dragonheart very much.
This new one was certainly inferior to the first, but I found it worth my time.
I have already unfavorably commented the first one: "Imperium Augustus".
Stay away what ever you do - the running time is so long that I was able to read Harry Potter's first book faster than the time it took to view this tripe.
He did not torture, kill and maim for pleasure, he was the first emperor who BANNED the gladiator fights.
AUGUSTUS by Roger Young, the first IMPERIUM movie, included at least Peter O'Toole but what does this movie include?
Nothing in it made any sense , even by horror movie standards.The premise wasn't too bad but it just fell to pieces after the first 5 minutes its an Australian movie and the male actors have Australian accents but the women have these terrible fake American accents and one of the womens accent is so appalling i have no idea what country she is supposed to be from .
This is the first movie I have not liked Dustin Hoffman in, and Natalie Portman's performance is also poor.
If your expecting laughs a minute like the tv show you sadly wont find it here unlike it's first live installment which remains the best.
I know it doesn't sound same but first see Scarface and tell me if there is a difference..
This is the first film I have ever felt the need to comment on and I am doing so because I was completely offended by the portrayal of the Marines and I want prospective viewers to be aware.
Ultimately the morality of this film portrays the Americans not only as 'shoot first, ask questions later' types but also as plain bloodthirsty.
The only good thing is the stunning black and white photography of the first part of the film.
If you like GOOD movies that are stimulating and profound just from listening to conversation while enjoying good actors, check out RICHARD LINKLATER's "Before Sunset" -- or make a double feature of it and watch "Before Sunrise" first.
The only good thing is the stunning black and white photography of the first part of the film.
"2000 Maniacs" was much better than this (at least for the first half), and his "Blood" trilogy was somewhat better.
The first 20 minutes are an absolute blast.
Well, first and foremost, the gore effects are some of the worst I've ever personally seen in a 70s movie.
Unusually for a horror movie, it features a young professional woman in one of the leading roles -- and she doesn't even get raped and mutilated in the first five minutes for being a harlot!
Rodney who at first went outside to check the hoods car is startled to find the wounded Kendell in the back seat with a gun pointed to his head.
- which we learn from the first 5 minutes of the film?
Lost in Translation is one of these movies that at first you might be seeing a terrific movie, but as it progress it become drab, droll and tedious without justification in substance.
The first one Wiseguys vs zombies was as cheap as they come and somehow got chosen to be on this set with another bad offering Meat For satans Icebox, the second half of the feature.
This was the first of two Swedish entries that were released in the same year.
They say that if at first you don't succeed then try again, and try again she certainly did.
There's one point in the runtime where Constance begins singing (about pretty bunnies, naturally), and for a moment I had to double-check that this wasn't the first slasher musical.
Get rid of all that and make the fight against the Black Knight the first of Gawain's adventures.
"After the first 5 minutes there is nothing worth watching in this film" (xnix444).
Yes, but even the first 5 minutes are really bad.
When I first heard about this movie I knew right off the bat it would be hilariously bad.
Think about it...first off it's made by Cannon, one of the most incompetent movie companies of all time (just about 95% of all the movies they ever made were laughably bad).
At first none of the knights are willing to accept his challenge, but then when the King gets so frustrated at his weak kingdom and offers to accept Sean's deal himself, the brave Miles O'Keefe jumps in and accepts the challenge instead!
After the first 5 minutes there is nothing worth watching in this film.
the next time I go to a Ram Gopal Varma production, I'm gonna make sure I don't got for the first day show, it would be more sensible to ask someone who has already seen the movie ... it seems he is losing his touch ..
the first one was so cute.
and the dennis character can't hold a candle to the first!
the first one was bad enough , why didnt they quit while they were ahead??
If you have seen the first contemporary version starring Mason Gamble, don't see this.
Justin Cooper ("Liar,Liar" and "Home Alone 3") in not even half as good as was Gamble in the first.
The first one was absolutely great and I can't believe they bothered with this and thought they could pass it off as a DTM movie.
To say it's not as good as the first is so far beyond an understatement it's ridiculous.
The first live action cartoon based film with Walther Matthau and little Mason Gamble is quite amusing, and this was straight-to-video sequel attempt.
This film fails on the first part, and passes barely only thanks to Paul Bennany and David Thewlis on the second.
Jane Wyman and Allen Jenkins team up as the reporter/detective pair in their first but also the series final episode.
And of course, all that follows is from beginning to end is completely standard from the black guy getting killed first to the divergent brothers forced settle their differences when their lives depend on it.
At first, I was all hyped up to see this film, mainly because I am a fan of Michelle Rodriguez.
2) The car in the garage that has been sat rusting for years works first time they try and then....surprise surprise.
7) The black guy dies first.
YOU Know the Expendable Black Guy is going to be the first one to get it, because the Expendable Black Guy is always the first one to get killed in movies like these.
The footprints of a personal vendetta are all over this film, from the very first minutes.
At first I thought this was a documentary about Noam Chomsky).
They then attempt to build sympathy with the audience, appearing shocked and indignant first when they ambush him (What?
For the first 45 minutes, the film is slightly enjoyable.
Maybe that's your problem in the first place.
Susan Cabot plays the good girl with first a yen for McNally and then for Murphy.
Since I didn't watch the first part of this movie, I will probably sound stupid now, but was there some sort of an accident.... or several accidents all over the globe since all these people 'suddenly' died and left Ralph from America take over????
For example, when playing a pick-up softball game back in 1996 Orens stepped to the plate and Baumann yelled from his first base position, "hey, it's King Ralph."
I was first introduced two thirds into it and I was immediately ready to sit down and watch it at three in the morning staying up till five am.
What amazes me most is that this being his first film, Moretti was allowed to make a second one.
There must be a Michele in his past who left a lasting impression on him, After all, there is no lack of male first names in Italian; why not Mario, Alberto or even Dante?
This happens continuously for the first 96 minutes of this 113 minute movie.
Actually rent it for the first half, but be prepared to dislike the second.
Abdul Salis plays a character based on the real person of Eugene Bullard, the first African-American combat pilot.
The first 20 minutes starts out honest enough, but the disappointment followed shortly thereafter.
The first problem I have with this film is in it's opening titles claiming to be based on a true story.
This sets you up with anticipation that the filmmakers have developed this film aiming for authenticity, recreating what it was like to be the first fighter pilots in the first modern war.
For the first time films makers have the tools with CGI to truly accurately portray the visceral effects of WWI dog fighting to put the audience right back into the thick shell smoked 1916 western front.
This is nothing more than a boys own story; where the first casualty is truth or realism.
Admittedly, some reviewers have pointed out Tony Bill's part-time profession as an aerobatic pilot, which in essence appears to compromised his interpretations of World War I combat, as he seems to have derived his perception of first world war fighters from having logged too many hours in Pitts Special as opposed to having derived genuine insight into the performance capabilities and limitations of such elaborate contusions of fabric and wood.
The result, hardly a first, looks like an inferior remake of the much-maligned LIFEFORCE.
The first in a poliziottesco trilogy featuring Maurizio Merli as Commissioner Betti; the first and last entries were directed by Girolami under the alias of Franco Martinelli and the second by Umberto Lenzi.
While first such case is somewhat understandable the second one is beyond dumb.
That's right there isn't, because this movie doesn't deserve to be next to the immortal first film.
It has none of the wit and snappy humor nor charm of the first.
It is sad to see how the Superman franchise simply evaporated after the first 2 films.
From the Salkinds brothers, the same producers of "Superman" saga, comes the first and, for the moment, last adventure of the new heroine coming from DC comics: was Supergirl: the Superman's cousin.
Selena is at that age where she's not the spring chicken; she develops lust for the handsome school gardener Ethan and spikes his beer with a potion that will make him fall for the first woman he sees and of course this women is Supergirl; she and Selena come into conflict.
Nineteen year-old Helen Slater in her first film appearance is a perfect choice as Supergirl; she looked like she had jumped right out of the pages of the comic books for Supergirl, she's charming rather than sexy, graceful and convincing in the flying scenes with her little costume and her nice blonde hair.
Helen Slater as Supergirl was an okay choice, but it was her first film.
Clearly the magic was gone in the franchise after the first two films, and perhaps "Supergirl" was seen as a means of taking the same idea in a new direction.
The version I first saw was the original American theatrical print, although even the extended cuts of the film don't help explain much.
In the backhoe sequence, we're asked to believe that the entranced landscaper could wander around the crowded town without actually looking at anybody, because Selena's spell dictates he'll fall in love with the first person he sees.
Of course the first person he sees is Supergirl.
One tedious sequence takes place in the Phantom Zone, which has morphed from the flying plane of glass in the first films to a desolate terrain where it's possible to set up a roughly-hewn home, and they even give you controlled substances.
Sure the difficulty of production not must have helped Odell: at the last minute Cristopher Reeve, that must have been Superman in a little cameo, leaved the project (perhaps because he their have realized the narrowness) and Dolly Parton that was the first choice for the villainies role disowned, judging truly grotesque and silly.
There are three pointers in the first ten minutes that tell us where the film is going in its refusal to glamorise, to mythologise.
Helen Slater is hot for sure,but that doesn't make the movie necessarily good.the Superman movies,at least the first 2,had an epic quality to them.this movie just seems like it was slapped together with very little thought.if you're not gonna have a villain worthy of the hero,then what's the point?that's an element that should be essential in this type of movie.the scope of the movie is just too small.at the end of the movie,there is no real lasting impact.while it wouldn't say this movie is abysmal,it certainly is not very good either.it won't likely be the worst movie you see, but it should have been so much better.the most i can squeeze out for this movie is 4/10
Tim Robbins is in this for the first five minutes and about the last five minutes....I'm sure he got a decent paycheck but his acting looked flat and as ridiculous as the rest of this thing.
My daughter who is 6 (and God knows the movie tastes of 6 year old girls runs pretty parallel to this dribble)could not even stay awake through it, and it is probably the first movie ever she had no desire to watch again.
This was the first Bud Spencer/Terence Hill movie I saw and it is probably the last.I just wanted to experience it since it is a very famous formula.The quality is inferior though.Everything that made the 80's such a terrible decade is in this movie.
I got up to write this review after the first 10 minutes of the July 7th show and I'll never watch this show again.
I don't normally ever watch network TV, and i'm not really big on reality shows at all, but i have been watching this because i thought it would be somewhat interesting.. turns out to be a poorly executed show that'll probably never recover from it's first season without some major changes (although it has already been renewed for a second season in '07).
this was changed after the first few episodes into an "approve or disapprove" system where the judges vote afterwards on a winner, and a majority vote from the American public decides a second winner for the round.
first of all, the judges suck.
how did these people even get on the show in the first place?
It is a fine first effort, or a mediocre second effort, or horrific life's work.
If one goes by the writing style, this film is the first in a series.
But dear "Hollywood", you can't make a box-office hit if you first of all take the Danish humor away, and then take out some scenes from the movie, just because (my own opinion)you think it doesn't suits the American people.
And it's a pity because the first hour is genuinely eerie, with a fittingly claustrophobic mortuary as the ideal setting.
(I'd be the first to sign up if they were looking for volunteers to take that baseball bat and bash the heads of the writers of this nonsense.)
"When I was first sent to boarding school I used to get the s*** kicked out of me a lot," he explains, and it's no surprise at all.
But with nothing of note to report, and Sacred Weeds' under-cranked and over-cranked cameras affording scant compensation, why bother in the first place?
That said, one short scene in which Bluto first trips through the woods (in both senses) comes close to capturing the spatial dislocation common to the psychedelic experience, and one wishes the film offered more moments like this one.
After the first few initial jumpy moments, it's really slow and then to top it all off it has the worst ending ever.
Within the first ten minutes we're given: the typical idiot stoner, the nice girl in love with the 'bad boy with a heart of gold' foreigner, the travel deep in the woods for less-than-moral activity, being stranded due to hitting an animal, the shady forests 'looking for dinner,' etc.
The music is very good, and it surprised me when I first heard it, and surprised me even more when I saw the composer.
Before they discover the first of the victims, we have an extended scene of a blonde rushing around shouting BLUTO BLUTO that could have been cut by a couple of millenia.
When they reach the intended spot, one of the first things their buddy Jake does is take away their cell phones.
It's the first time I've ever seen a horror film with a talking cow.
When I first heard that my local movie theater was going to be playing a movie called "Shrooms."
Reading the poster tag line, the first few movies I thought about were "The Tripper" and "Idle Hands," both had a comedic edge to it.
It appeared to me at first to be a fairly basic horror flick.
I understand that it was their first time taking them so that's the writing leeway that they allowed but there is a big difference in taking mushrooms where your entire physical senses are changed and thinking you heard a twig snapping.
The only idea of mushrooms that stays with the "plot" after the first forty minutes is the supposed special black headed mushrooms our heroine takes that allows her to see into the future.
If you took a sip of your Irish coffee every time someone in this movie said "shrooms," you'd be dead before the first jump scare.
I absolutely despise when somebody reviews a movie that they did not even watch through, but *I* could not finish this movie.. for only the third time ever ( the first, being the pitiful remake of Rollerball, and second being that miserable piece of rancid feces, Freddy Got Fingered).
I'm not even going to be able to be polite here and say something re-assuring like "good first effort'.... these guys just don't have the talent to make movies.
this movie was the first ever i saw at the drive-in and even if i was 7 years old , it was an exceptionable film.even if it is an 80's,you have to look further than special effects to like or love this movie.the acting is simple , so is the storyline , if you saw the first one , and the fight scenes are human.it's the best of the film of the duo,and no one should destroy them before seeing the rest.you have to accept the fact of the budget they had and also the music in wave at the time.the in sync of the fight was a choreography to make ballet cheap.and do not forget that it was shot in Italian first,they had to transcript all of the scenario.i just think it was a gem.
I only kept watching after the first five minutes in the hope of one solitary laugh to give me something positive to write about.
I'll admit that when I first turned on ABC family at 8 I was a bit skeptical about this movie.
This isn't the first time this exact plot has been used.
And look at his CV: he already had done ten roles before his first BH2010 episode aired on 4 October 1990.
The things that we funny and subtle in the first film-Elwood's parking ability, Jake's transformation at the hands of Reverend Cleophus, the miracle performance of the Bluesmobile, the new jobs of the former band members, were hackneyed and overdone in this film.
With its daring use of ellipsis, is this the first art-film, the first 'Cat People'?
She brings such an alluring knowingness to the role that it becomes difficult to believe why Bob would want to cheat on her in the first place.
In his first major role, Elliott Gould keeps Ted as an amusing, sympathetic figure who keeps dancing between disgust and envy with increasing alacrity.
In my consumer guide mode, I should first mention one very simple way to tell whether you might like Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice--do you like films that are almost all dialogue?
The masterful opening scene (it is hard to believe that this is Mazursky's first movie) replete with nude bodies sets the mood well and tells us that what we're seeing is something different, something new.
I sat through the first ten minutes without once touching the fast-forward button.
it was (and remains) a brisk paced "fun, and funny" movie that still holds up in this somewhat jaded time we now live in - most viewers today would not have a clue how racy this movie was thought to be at its first showing way back in 1969.
I can still remember my wife and I discussing the movie for weeks after first viewing it - with a little bit of embarrassment but over-all just plain laughter!!
In the first one the entire band's clothing "magically" changes for a concert, but if you know that this is merely a representation of the character's psychological state and not a literal change, then the film works much better.
Well, in the first film the car flew, performed flips, and was nearly indestructible.
In fact, if you watch the DVD of the first film, you find in the deleted scenes and "Making-of" section that the Bluesmobile is supposed to be "magic", because it was parked each night inside a power transformer.
How is that for cheesiness on the first film?
The funny moments are priceless: the tennis instructor asking for a glass of Pernod, Dyan Cannon in the therepist's office--probably the funniest and most perceptive take on the "therepy experience" ever shown on film-- (along with Kirstie Alley's therapist melt-down scene in Woody Allen's  "Deconstructing Harry"), the opening group therapy session in the beautiful  California countryside, that first dinner in the restaurant with Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice all declaring their love for each other in front of the table of bemused gay diners--it is a film filled with endless, perceptive and highly  amusing details.
It's a much nicer-edged movie than the first Blues Brothers, too.
Victor, the son of a prostitute, tries to hook up with Elena, a druggie with whom he'd had a previous tryst (his first).
However, the first time viewer should be warned not to take the circumstances too seriously.
This was my first Almodovar movie and I was impressed.
I liked the frantic pace of the first scene, the humor of his birth and the justice of the ending.
Like so many other movies by Aldomovar it would be a real spoiler to reveal things as the magic of the movie is to be found in its surprising storytelling that at first doesn't make that much sense but develops itself into a perfect, surprising story.
You really get to know and love these people, and if at first, you wondered why anyone would put themselves through the aggravation of all those cattle calls and cold calls, and useless callbacks, by the end of the movie, you realize the love that these extras have for the movie-making process.
Well, although he seems to have moved away from his bright colors and chaotic chasing sequences, and although Live Flesh is to the best of my knowledge the first movie where he openly praises the post-Franco era, it was as tasteful as its predecessors.
Great music, cinematography and direction give this movie an even more satisfying look, and make this a well-achieved movie that ends up being the first part of an unofficial trilogy of Almodovar's best works.
I have loved this movie ever since the first time I saw it years ago when I was a preteen.
However, I think the simple, sweet story of first love is a nice escape from the harsh realities of todays world.
Sandra Dee gets to play the first "Gidget" (combining "Girl and Midget").
I remember when I first received that movie.
Amitabh won his first Filmfare Best Actor Award in this movie.
I'm 15 minutes into the movie and I'm already in tears, I couldn't believe a movie like this had so much impact at the first 15-20 minutes.
We get to the journey of the three young men and we find out that Akbar & Anthony are very close(Well at least in the first half) so anyways Anthony always refers to the old woman as his mother and so do the other two I think.
Also the girl who fell in love with Amar did horrible acting at first she said she stole money because there family was poor but she looked like she was giving false information(worst crying in a movie I've seen) I wouldn't believe her no matter what but it turns out she told the truth.
The movie goes through many different moods and emotions, but after the first 15 minutes of melodrama the tone is generally kept light and pleasant.
There's also the songs of course, though not too many - especially in the first half of the film.
Although the first half an hour didn't have me terribly engaged, the film does just keep getting better and better (and more imaginative) as it progresses.
The first segment is about a swine nephew who kills his uncle in order to inherit his fortune; the second segment is about a blind woman who gets an eye transplant; and the third segment is about a former Nazi who is trying to escape his past, but a Holocaust survivor denies him of that.
The first segment, the one with Roddy M. and Ossie Davis, was by far the scariest movie, tv show, etc.
The first time I saw it I was 13 years old and it scared the wits out of me!
The first segment, 'The Cemetery', is terrific; Roddy McDowall and Ossie Davis play off one another wonderfully, and it's a pleasure to see Roddy's nasty little character get his comeuppance.
A creepy crucifixion painting depicting one's suffering leads us into Strobe and Bleum's first meeting..and, for a reason you'll find later, is as important to this tale as the fisherman painting.
I guess the first one is closest to the "Night Gallery" series, but this film is much better than what comes after it because of Serling's strong involvement in every tale presented.
The first tale involved that of a young man (Roddy McDowell) who kills his uncle to inherit his fortune, only to find himself haunted by a painting that hangs in the house.
While this part of the movie was okay, it was definitely not as enjoyable as the first part.
This segment takes a more serious tone than the others and I cannot decide whether I like this segment or the first story the best.
This one is creepier and leaves a more lasting impression, but Roddy McDowell's performance in the first part is more striking.
The first of the three stories is the best.
I was there when Night Gallery first appeared, in my early teens.
The first story concerns a young upstart nephew (Roddy McDowall) who stands to inherit a fortune from his artist uncle (George Macready) and decides to help him a little along the way.
If you like classic shows like The Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits, The Nightstalker, and others, and classic Horror, Crime, Thrillers, Dramas, and interesting films then I strongly recommend you to go over to Amazon.com and buy this film that is also included with the complete first season on DVD today!
The first segment is appropriately spooky; the second ingenious and unconventional (for TV); and the third, even though it is the weakest, a worthy capper on this film.
My advice: watch the first two, then stop, rewind, and eject.
The execution is first rate, with a terrific cast, good production values (music, editing, photography), and inventive visuals from directors Boris ("The Omega Man") Sagal, Barry ("Across 110th Street") Shear, and Steven Spielberg (in his maiden effort).
Steven Spielberg's first professional directing job was segment two of this anthology, which also proved to be one of Joan Crawford's last acting efforts, certainly her last worth noting.
The first and best is "The Cemetery," a variation on the classic ghost story.
And never is it apparent that it is Spielberg's first crack at professional film-making, so sure is his use of the camera and setting of mood.
Though it had some strong episodes at first, the "Night Gallery" TV series fell out of Serling's control and eventually became sort of a ghost story version of "Love, American Style," a crude mix of cheap jokes and heavy-handed suspense.
the first stars Roddy McDowall as a bastard nephew who kills his uncle to take his money, then is haunted by the ghost of the uncle (or so he thinks) to death.
Steven Spielberg directed the Joan Crawford segment, "Eyes"; it was one of his first director assignments.
When I first came to this town I was gonna be... oh there were a lotta things I was gonna be- become famous.
Finally, note the appearance (in his first movie role according to this board) of comedian Tom Poston as a police officer, who gets involved in a situation that is far from amusing.
It's an odd first role for such a funny figure to have played at all.
Indeed, this delectably dreadful dreck was paired with the equally atrocious, yet somehow oddly endearing dippy hippie terror trip-out "The Curse of the Headless Horseman" on a twice-the-tacky-terror twin feature offering that must have caused anyone who saw them together to either make an immediate beeline for the exit door 15-odd minutes into the first film or slump into their seats in a comatose stupor after the ending credits of the second picture finished rolling.
For me Timothy Spall out-classed the rest, my first thought was that I would have liked to have seen more of him but on reflection I actually prefer him as a side kick.
Monotonously paced, it never gets out of first gear and there is scarcely a funny line during the entire film, let alone an original one.
The story more or less revolves around her version of events, and after the first 30 minutes, you get the feeling that everything is not what it appears to be.
After a long search, the advanguards of the two factions reach on earth, having a first encounter with 3 kids, who will aid the Autobots in their fight with the evil Decepticons in a journety to the coquest of all the minicons.
This was the first Transformers series I watched and I literally grew up with it.
I gave it try when I first watched it.
But first he has to appear to be an authentic westerner.
Overall this is an amazing first effort for Justin Kanew.
So watch the movie for the interplay going on and the well written story about waiting for the right one to have sex with first, and when you hold off, the complications that arise in the male partner.
(I love the song he sings to Eve on their first date)And of course, Emanuelle Chiriqui is as lovable as ever.
It is entertaining and not predictable at first, but when you find out what is actually going on it does get a little silly.
When it arrived and I watched it for the first time I was pleasantly surprised.
At first the virginity thing doesn't pose a problem, but during their nine month relationship and Eve's reluctance to lose her virginity Adam's frustration causes him to question leaving the relationship and the woman he truly loves.
This is a great first date movie or for any guy still trying to get his girl into bed.
After great National Lampoon titles like "Van Wilder", "Animal House", and the "Vacation" movies, this one feels like the first attempt of someone straight out of film school.
It's slow upfront but when the first person ('Franky', Frances) dies of starvation because the girl is on an extreme diet, the movie gets intense.
I like the twist of how Goku isn't he first Super Sayian and is no where near strong enough to defeat Broly.
Also this is the first Goku villain that's held a grudge against Goku before they meet either on TV or movie.
At first sight it may seem complex but the truth is it's just not well thought out.
I first saw this film when my children were so small that they consumed my time and energy and things went in one head and out the other.
The first time this film was made available in English, it was completely wrecked.
I first bought this movie because i had grown up with Robotech and absolutely loved the Macross-part of it, plus that i love Macross Plus, and I thought that the original could'nt be that bad.
One of my first thought were that Robotech was just the pale copy it is.
I first saw this film in the late 80s.
Just the name itself conjures up nostalgic memories of yesterday, running home from fourth grade to catch the latest episode of Robotech, to attending my first Anime convention and realizing the true power of the unedited series as well as this incredible film which retells the story.
The music, the characters, the animation and the story are the very things that attracted me to Japanese animation in the first place.
SDFM:DYRL on the other hand, becomes a beacon of light to remind us of the reasons we fell in love with Japanese films in the first place.
I'll be the first to admit that I'm no expert on the Robotech series - in fact, I know pretty much next to nothing about the other instalments in the Macross/Robotech series.
However, even this you can except a lot of "stupid" but some of that is part of Varney's charm as the lovable "Ernest P. Worrell," a man he made famous first with TV commercials and then with a handful of inane-but- Innocent comedies.
I had been aware of the  antics of the Three Stooges, Laurel and Hardy and Abbott and  Costello, but now I could see first hand the live slapstick of  involved comedy.
I had been aware of the  antics of the Three Stooges, Laurel and Hardy and Abbott and  Costello, but now I could see first hand the live slapstick of  involved comedy.
The quality of the actors that take part in this movie was only possible because they are friends in real life and didn't see the movie as a commercial product in the first place.
As Kiera Knightly's first leading role, I must say it goes against the glam sexy characters she so often chooses now.
DER EISBAER is the first movie German mega-star Til Schweiger directed, and starred in.
I was so thrilled to see the movie coming out, accepting that it is the original story from the first game so Blair would be young enough to be played by someone like Freddie Prinz Jr.
The cloaked "phantom fighters" that made their debut in Wing Commander II would still have been in development at the time of the movie, let alone well known skipper missiles for the first movie.
Wing Commander was one of the first real interactive movies when the third installment was released in 94, it pushed the boundaries for graphics, acting and storyline into uncharted heights for a video game.
I remember this being the first movie I ever felt like walking out on, and only stayed because I figured at the time that there had to be some redeeming value to it.
I remember thinking that Wing Commander 3 would have made a great movie (even though the video game was among the first video games to have a full cast of actors and sets).
First of all, I avoided this movie when it was first released because of the bad reviews.
I saw this movie for the first time on DVD, sat down with a low expectation, and cranked up my Dolby Digital 5.1 sound system.
I know enough of the game that they got the first person outside the ship view and that's cool.
Sure, the Kilrathi looked pretty dumb at times, but it was better than not seeing them at all, which was what they had originally planned, and yes, bullets in space does sound a little strange at first, but for me, it's a welcome change from the old Star Wars/Star Trek clichÃ©s out there; laser blasters, photon torpedos, all that bull.
My second favorite part is when we finally see the Kilrathi for the first time.
But for the first full hour and a half or so, we don't even know what a Kilrathi looks like.
I'll admit, I haven't been a big fan of the teen slasher movies, so this was my first experience at seeing a lot of these guys.
The acting by all is first rate & all production values are equally good.
He directed the first German movie after WWII, The Murderers Are Among Us, in 1946 with Ernst Borcert and Hildegard Kneff.
As for first impressions, I have the feeling it's an idealist's wished-for 'dream of a perfect world and perfect people' that never quite comes true, unfortunately, for many in real life.
He is portrayed as a husband to die for, thoughtfully preparing a surprise for his wife's birthday which is more or less thrown in his face because the selfish needs of the children come first.
The first real clue was a prominently displayed "Borbetomagus" sticker.
Let's set the scene first.
Despite its baffling ultra-rarity, the film is peopled by an interesting pool of talent both in front and behind the camera: Lancaster is in his third adventure flick; Gilbert Roland is his usual laid-back, womanizing Latino self; John Dehner the proverbial rotten apple in the group; George Tobias (perhaps thankfully) sacrifices himself early on; Nick Dennis and Mike Mazurki are among the rowdiest of the 'Ten'; Gerald Mohr adequately provides the required villainy; this was the second product from Norma Productions (which first partnered Lancaster with producer Harold Hecht); writer Roland Kibbee would much later go on to share directorial credit with Lancaster on THE MIDNIGHT MAN (1974; which I will be revisiting presently); associate producer Robert Aldrich would later direct Lancaster in four movies Â including TWILIGHT'S LAST GLEAMING (1977; which I'll be viewing for the first time during this ongoing Burt Lancaster tribute); and, most interestingly perhaps, this was multi-talented Willis Goldbeck's most notable directorial effort but, at least two of his screen writing credits are highly impressive indeed: Tod Browning's FREAKS (1932) and John Ford's THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE (1962; Goldbeck's last film work)!
The issue I have is that they seem unhappily resigned to a situation of mutual, coexistent alienation in the first place.
After the first scene and the following horrific flashbacks, audience expectations are very high for a truly terrifying film.
I imagine there is this kind of film that would be overtly depressing and boring for first 80% of the time on purpose, just to caliberate audience's mind-set, similiar to cleaning the palate, so the final 20% would really make some impression.
It's true that it is a rather depressing movie, at first sight, when you don't look closer and don't get involved in the story.
I first fell in love with Caroline Brouquet in FOR YOUR EYES ONLY, which is my favorite Bond flick, btw.
This is the first movie, I can recall being about the French resistance also.
My favorite moments were the first four years when Brenda and Dylan were the couple!
I'm watching this movie for the first time on Sky One, and am trying really hard to feel surprised at the twist and turns of the (yawn) action!I read all of uncle Jules' books as a boy, and saw all the action movies of the 50s and 60s.
For the first time, in a Hollywood version of MYSTERIOUS ISLAND, Cyrus is correctly surnamed Smith, and Pencroff (not, as in the Cyrus Harding translations, Pencroft) becomes a Confederate Colonel desirous of the gold the pirates seek, as played by Kyle MacLachlan and Jason Durr, respectively.
The acting is first rate from the leading five, though Embeth Davidtz, an experienced actress, is confined to a character with little scope for the talents she has displayed in previous films, and I find it disappointing that her acting skills were curtailed by such a restrictive screenplay.
I'll go right ahead and admit that I had extremely low expectations for the show, it's made-for-TV, first of all, and I've yet to see a single competently made Jules Verne film adaptation, but I've seen better acting in an elementary school drama class, and the script could not possibly be dumber.
The first version of the story ends with everybody coming out of the hole happy and smiling, but the psychologist seems to believe it.
You have a wonderful scene where Mulder tries to comfort her and states for the first time his wish for her to leave him behind and try and have a better life as a result.
The first deleted scene for this episode gives out a lot more information.
I remember the Monday morning after THAT SINKING FEELING received its first broadcast on British television in 1982 , all my classmates were discussing it: " Did you see that bit where the guy said ... " and I remember thinking that my peers had been watching another film because I recalled distinctly hating it .
I found the Canadian show this year, and i really loved the first time i saw it, first i thought it was a movie, but it isn't.
The first time I saw it was last year and I thought it was intense.
I cannot say less, at the beginning I didn't want to watch it, I thought: "another mix of gore and mystery with nothing good to make you think" (something like millennium) But finally I found at least three good reasons because the Collector it's one of the best shows 1- Unpredictable: from the first episode you'll never know when there's a "happy ending", the stories are very dark but there's no use of unnecessary violence, everything has a reason.
More reason: the acting it's good, the specially effects, and as I said in the first point: This is the kind of show where the producer don't have fear to make the necessary changes to make the stories better, so it's very unpredictable.
I saw this 1978 "made-for-TV" film the first time it was aired, and once or twice since then (though not recently) and have never been able to forget it.
It plays on my regular DVD player and I watched it last night (first time since 1978).
Just watching the first five minutes of this movie I wanted to shoot myself in the head, and remove my eyeballs.
Nothing in this film is anything less than predictable, from who will be the first to die (always the old guy) to the fact that the stereotypical young blonde hero who arrives on the scene in the middle will be the one to save the day.
Absolutely nothing happens for about the first 50-55 minutes except a lot of garbage talk about the way things were and how retarded man is for destroying everything.
I've been anticipating this film for a while since it is Thora Birch's first role since American Beauty.
The first is that it doesn't exactly live up to the hype in the British press.
The first half hour or so is much more straightforward, and for me, the film was cruising along at about an 8 for at least that length of time.
The plot, from a screenplay by first time (and only time so far) scripters Ben Court and Caroline Ip, based on a novel by Guy Burt, is unusual for being told primarily from unreliable characters' perspectives.
Court and Ip cleverly do not change the scenario as much as you might expect after the first couple variations.
At first things seem alright but that that doesn't last for long as Gail begins to change, she starts to sleepwalk, talk in ancient Latin, her voice suddenly becomes very deep, she spouts obscenities & begins to undergo a dramatic & horrifying change of personality.
The possessed teenage girl trapped in her room & tied to her bed, an early scene with a Ouija board, frantic parents seeking help first from doctor's & then priest's, the final climatic exorcism which is so badly written & handled it's untrue & a few of the notorious trademark scenes from The Exorcist are clearly replicated here such as the spider walk (quite literally here as Gail walks up a wall), speaking in an ancient language, lots of unintentionally funny porno dialogue as Gail spouts various obscenities & of course the final exorcism itself which is performed by a priest wearing sunglasses!
The beginning I liked the no sound and just music at first I thought there was a sound problem and I kept turning the sound up and realized it was all action!
It's like the movie was hopeful for the first half but culminated in a complete meltdown at the end.
During the first half of EL DIA DE LA BESTIA I thought this was shaping up to be a fantastic film.
I first saw this movie in the classroom during Spanish lessons (in Spain).
So this was the first movie in Spanish that I fully understood.
You saw it first here!
Finally after a long wait I got the chance to check out this flick, and what a damn shame I wasn't more safe when buying it the first time, because this was a really good flick.
After watching this brilliant movie,I came to conclusion that(besides "Braindead")this is the best horror/comedy of the 90's.The acting is great,the characters are captivating,the photography is nice and the humour scenes are excellent.This is the first horror/comedy from Spanish director Alex de la Iglesia.Hey guy,I hope to hear about you soon.The funniest sequence is when the priest is looking for the blood of the virgin to summon Satan.On the other hand,this creative film beats any of these expensive pseudo-horror movies from Hollywood.If you are a real horror-fan like me you should check it out.
OK. First things first.
I first saw the film on UK TV as a child under its alias, 'Secrets Of The Phantom Caverns', and it really stuck with me.
It was over 20 years ago that I first encountered this small cinematic treasure, on the now-defunct indie KHJ-TV, channel 9 in Los Angeles, but it was not at all by accident.
I desperately tried to like this having first seen it aged eight, but what seemed exciting / scary back then, I find pretty lame now.
And YES I do enjoy the first 30 minutes where the characters are in their teens, even though it seems a little far-fetched how short time it takes for the boys to start killing the competition (I am not spoiling anything this is 20 minutes into the movie or something).
The first 30 minutes was reminiscent of BOYZ N THE HOOD (which of course is a good movie) but the rest 90 minutes was reminiscent of SUGAR HILL (Wesley Snipes) almost a copy of that movie actually but with a lot more twists and stuff.
It is first class.
It is first class.
The movie does a great job of allowing the audience to witness first hand and laugh about how difficult it is for a very average-looking middle aged man with no career to juggle his well-off wife and his ambitious mistress.
The first is the hysterical RÃ©gis LaspalÃ¨s whom nearly steals the entire film away from everyone else.
The dean of the school hear's her plight and taps her as a front-runner to become the first female member of the 250 year old fraternity whose membership doesn't end at graduation.
(and is still more inspiring than anything produced today)..the character of Stash also amazing....but Burnadette Peters with Ashtray Lopsided Hat is beyond PERFECT...this is perhaps MY FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME...PLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEASE RELEASE ON DVD...Merchant/Ivory has never produced anything less than a first rate film!!!!
I enjoyed over the years watching this film for several reasons, first one the artwork that is featured in it, next is the music, another this could have been a good lead in for a television series(not the big reason, but part of it.
Being a diehard Les Miserables fan, I first learned the musical and then read the book.
I was surprised that the first(rotating?
Do you know when you start watching a movie and in the first 4/5 minutes you start asking yourself: "why doesn't it end right now?"
Yes that's right, this film "stunk" from the very first minuteÂ   The psycho character is ridiculous!
For the first time 'a chick' didn't annoy me:)and there was more to her than meets the eye.
I first wanted to see this show because I am such a Kevin Smith junkie.
This show has brought me nothing but happiness from the first episode to the last.
Now don't get me wrong, i love Friends/the Simpson's/family guy/Scrubs/South park/dirty sexy money/pushing daisies/west wing etcetc  but nothing quite compares to the originality or catch of this, certainly it is probably the best show i have seen in years in terms of enjoyment  the only negative thing i can dare say about it is the fact the first series is over  long live reaper!
The first few episodes are probably the slowest of the series, but around episode 5 or 6, things start to pick up and you realise that there may be more to this show than it would first have you believe.
It doesn't drag things out NEARLY as long as other shows do and by the end of the first season, certain things are revealed that makes for a change of pace from the usual continuous lying/keeping secrets over multiple seasons.
First off, Tyler Labine (Sock} is the main reason I decided to check out the first episode and I was really happy with what I seen.
In the first episode Sam Oliver learns that his parents sold his soul to the devil he must now serve as a bounty hunter, tracking down evil souls that have escaped and returning them to hell.
The first thing which I should probably say is that, being a surfer, I am probably biased in favor of the movie.
I first viewed this movie in my teens and have watched it on countless occasions since, it never tires, a fantastic movie that gives a great insight into the world of surfing, as well as making you want to learn to surf the moment it ends.
Quentin Tarantino rates this as the best movie of all time,and who am I to argue with him?I first saw this movie when I had first started surfing,and it really captured all that was great about the sport,and the way of life that surfing becomes.
Jack returns from the war in one piece - and the first thing he does is go out to the ocean to find Matt and surf.
I saw this movie for the first time in an old small town movie house in Big Spring, Texas back in 1978.
In the first half hour there are two extended fistfights in the style of Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, you half expect a fiddle to be playing in the background.
I have loved this movie since the first day I saw it, at the drive-in theater.
That's how I felt suffering through the first 30 minutes of "Gable and Lombard".
When Brolin first appeared on the screen, I had difficulty believing it wasn't Gable.
Jill Clayburgh's portrayal of Lombard is lively albeit somewhat over-acted and strained, though the entire production is first rate with a solid supporting cast.
It chronicles how they first meet and hate each other but eventually fall in love.
The problem is Gable's first wife won't give him a divorce and their studios are threatening to drop them.
At first, I could not believe James Brolin was playing Clark Gable, but he is dead on with his portrayal!!!
Our plot device suddenly becomes a ticking clock, with our minds in constant question as to who is going to get to the finish line first.
I don't always like comedy and horror mixed but this one did make me laugh hard and I liked the story.It had some really good kills and some hysterical original humour.The whole revenge storyline is old but a good and effective one.It reminded me a lot of Nightmare on Elm street how a bunch of parents killed a guy and he comes back from the dead to exact revenge on the kids of the parents.Of course Nightmare on Elm street was more of a horror.I hated the first scene of drive-thru.I cannot stand it when white kids act and talk like they're black,especially the well educated ones.Watching the way they were acting and talking made me cringe.
Disguised as cops, three black crooks steal a big amount of cash after killing five syndicate runners and two policemenÂ The New York police and the Mafia react with immediate concernÂ   Tough police veteran Captain Frank Mattelli (Quinn) resents the intrusion of Lieutenant Pope (Kotto), a black detective, in the case, while Mafia boss Don Gennaro (Frank Mascetta) sends his paranoid son-in-law, Nick D'Salvio (Anthony Franciosa), to reassert control over the Harlem branch and see that the money is recoveredÂ   The black syndicate, headed by Doc Johnson (Richard Ward) and his assistant Shevvy (Gilbert Lewis), rejects D'Salvio, while promising only token help, and accuses Mattelli, who has been on the take from Johnson for yearsÂ   Anthony Quinn plays well the ageing detective who has long ago perceived that all his efforts are not going to do more than raise the very small part of the cover of crime, but he is not above taking a bribe from a racketeerÂ His method of dealing with a reluctant witness is to hit hard first and ask questions laterÂThe rigorously legal approach to police work, as exemplified by Yaphet Kotto, is not for QuinnÂ This is his territory, his little kingdom, and he keeps the peace as best he knowsÂ
Well, here is a first.
A lot of contemporary scholarship into film history creates debates as to where the first "music video" came from.
Possibly we could then argue that Eisenstein's and Alexandrov's "Romance Sentimentale", an attempt to create a narrative for an Opera that they call "that old Russian song", is one of the first music videos?
Eisenstein in particular is good for this approach because one thing that ties music and imagery together well is rhythmic editing, something he is famous for in the first place and also something that he had previously successfully used to create sound-like impressions in completely silent films (like, for instance, quick cutting between a machine gun and its firer to represent the sound of the machine gun unloading).
This was the pair's first venture into "talkies," and I must admit to being impressed by the film's complex mastery of this new medium.
The first, comprising the opening five minutes or so, is a frenetic and zany montage of trees falling down, intercut with crashing ocean waves, which are spliced so ingeniously into place that I could swear I saw a shot of water actually engulfing a forest.
At first, I wasn't so sure.
At first, I must say, I hadn't great expectations for this French adaptation of the British play "Private Fears in Public Places", by the acclaimed Alan Ackynbourn.
My first being Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol.
I first saw it on PBS back in 1972, I think, and it has haunted me ever since.
In addition, most of the kills take place off-screen, and at first glance the story is also highly unimaginative - a teenage girl called Mackenzie Carpenter ('Mac' to her friends) discovers that pupils at her high school are being killed by a maniac who's dressed as Horny the Clown, the mascot of the Hellaburger fast-food restaurant chain (he looks like the secret love child of Ronald McDonald and Satan).
Then, the first banner headline word zooms across the screen: "COMMUNISM" Almost immediately, Stalin is equated with the first three.
I first had the privilege of watching The Hoaxters in 1974.
It turned out that of the first 48 vetoes of the Security Council of the U.N. from 1945 to 1953, 47 were from the Soviet Union.
Louis B. Mayer's answer to his most cooperative of stars was to cast him first in A Yank At Oxford and then in The Crowd Roars.
In the first film, Taylor rowed crew for dear old Oxford where he was a matriculating student.
The first time I ever saw this Warner Brothers short was @ a pizza parlor over in Irving, Texas.
Just hum the first few bars, everyone knows the song!
The hateful bunny is about to gong him off until he gets back to singing "I Love To Singa" and wins first prize.
Out of the first one comes an beautiful opera singing owl chick, whom his parents adore.
The kid takes up the number from there, wowing the deejay and the radio audiences, taking home first prize, sealing his bright future in jazz and claiming his place in the sun!
It was one of my first real search efforts and I found it!
Splendidly done from the first frame on.
At first glance "I Love to Singa" looks like it will be just another cute and fuzzy animal cartoon.
I saw this cartoon for the first time when I was under the age of ten, didn't know it was a "movie spoof" (which is mentioned in other sources)until I became an adult.
I think I was about 6 or 7 when I first saw this amazing takeoff on the Jazz Singer.
Pretty heady stuff for a first grader.
This was my first introduction to the Ritz Brothers, and unfortunately, I was not impressed.
This is my first review on IMDb, okay here goes: So this movie is about a seemingly supernatural killer clown, the mascot of the extremely popular local burger joint (Hella Burger) he murders teenagers all of whom have some sort of connection with the main character Mackenzie.
There is, in fact a "real" gorilla on the loose (played by Art Miles - the makeup, while not great, wasn't as bad as some that I've seen), who can't be the murderer (because first, gorillas can't write notes and, second, he hasn't been on the loose long enough to have committed the murders) but still he provides plenty of comic relief in his scenes with the Ritz Brothers.
(The first is a silent, of interest only to the Charles Gillingwater fan club.
The first title of the "11 hours of entertainment" was _The Gorilla_.
Believe it or not, this would be the first Lugosi movie I would ever see outside of his small role in _The Wolf Man_.
Upon first viewing, I said out loud, "Are these guys suppose to be funny?"
The storyline revolves around Mario, a cocky young up-and-coming photographer from Little Italy who literally falls in love at first sight with with Nicole Yeats (hence the title - I <3 N.Y.), the daughter of John Robertson Yeats(Plummer), a prestigious actor starring on Broadway.
There's some great dialogue between characters, particularly Mario and Nicole when they first meet and there's a few funny moments too.
in the first episodes) is the soundtrack; albeit in general japanese pop music sounds pretty childish to most listeners, the songs from "Bubblegum Crisis" have something special to them.
Those who first saw the series and became loyal followers in the 80's had every reason to be impressed back then.
Alas, by now, the same formula has appeared so often, be it under different guises, that there's little left to be amazed about for one watching this series for the first time now.
Animation quality has aged a bit better though, with only the first episode looking genuinely old hat by now.
It's as if Return of the Jedi was missing from the first Star Wars trilogy, for instance.
I loved City of God it was a classic and when i first heard this was coming out i was overjoyed.
Still, this film will be constantly compared to City of God, so let's get that out of the way first.
It took me awhile to understand or pick up on the storyline Â one must pay close attention during the first 30-40 minutes to the characters and dialogue.
Instead, there is a difficult reconciliation between the two boys, on the brink of eighteen, despite a stunning revelation about their lost fathers, and one of the fathers comes back into the picture and, reluctantly at first, chooses to be a warm presence in the life of his son.
Both of the boys endure moments of terrible loneliness and isolation, which reveal how isolating the world of shifting and dangerous loyalties and hills fought for and lost is for a boy who in the first place lacks parents.
Acting is first class, music is melodious and integrate to the scenes, photograph is similar to City of God.
Normally I disgust pulp movies.. so I also was thinking of this movie the first minute.
Starting at the end and working back the first thing I, take issue with is the dedication at the end credits "To Walter Lord" the one human who strove to explore and find the truth about the wreck of the Titanic and all things related to it (his uncle was captain of the California, the ships captain charged with not coming to the aide of the Titanic, finally cleared of the charges after his death).
The film is full of irony, and looking back, I must admit that the whole episode is great work of the writers because the ordinary first part is a mere tool for creating this irony, creating a huge fool-the-audience-scenario.
I found watching the scenes outside and inside the wreck to be as exciting as watching the first pictures from Mars Pathfinder... a sense of excitement and wonder in seeing something so remote and so exotic and bizarre.
why should someone make two times the same movie, or worse: why should a director want to make his first movie another time?'
When I first heard about this, I was intrigued, I had been interested in the Titanic long before the movie came out and underwater exploration of the shipwreck had always been fascinating to me.
Using the then latest technology he first located the wreck and then filmed it with "Alvin," a submersible of amazing capability.
I hate to say this but I preferred the first family, the Pembrokes to the Powells, but beggars can't be choosers.
I remember when the show first aired on CBS television.
The Powells were prettier than the Pembrokes but I liked the first family better.
I enjoyed the first family more but the banter between Mr. Powell , the grandpa , curmudgeon military man vs. silly,naive, party animal, reckless Buddy Lembeck was truly magic and fun to watch every episode.
I loved watching this show back when it first aired, and I loved watching it recently on DVD.
At first I thought this would be a Santa Clause rip-off, but after seeing it, I would recommend it to anyone.
The first 48 Hours was a bonafide hit that started and/or influenced the cop buddy film genre for years to come.
It was Eddie Murphyâs first film and along with Trading Places made him a star.
Nothing that worked in the first film works here.
The first time I saw this movie I thought it was kind of dumb but after seeing it again I began to realize it was'nt so bad.
Sure a lot of the scene's are pretty much exactly like scene's in the first one but there was plenty of good action and new scene's to make this movie strong.
Also, the dialogue scene's with Nolte and Murphy are just as funny as the ones in the first.
Sure its not as fresh and original as the first one, but its still entertaining.
Director Hill does alright but the film looks & feels a lot like the first, the action scenes are well handled & it's suitably profanity ridden.
Interestingly James is third in the opening credits while Murphy & Nolte come first & second although unlike the first film Murphy is now credited first & Nolte second which says something all on it's own.
Oh and on of the bikers, who are supposed to kill Reggie is the brother of the bad guy in the first movie.
All that happens in the first 10 minutes of the movie.
It's very similar to the first movie.
And a lot of scenes are kind of just copied from the first one (I mean storywise) Since Walter Hill had 8 Years to come up with a new and entertaining and sometimes funny story.
But the movie just hasn't the charm of the first movie.
Well it's a typical "Buddie Movie" as they did back then (like from the middle 80ties to the beginning of the nineties)... like the first Lethal Weapon Movie.
It's also another spin for Hill on the dying embers of the West, with a motorbike gang (I sense this was first drafted in the 70s) proclaiming themselves the last true outlaws and bastions of freedom before offing some random cops and entangling themselves with Nick Nolte and his amazing never-ending revolver (I count 11 shots in the final barrage of bullets into the bad guy alone).
Co-written by the director of the first installment, Walter Hill, (who had years to come up with something good) gives the fans of the original a HUGE letdown.
What's even worse, one of the killers is the brother of Ganz(The killer from the first movie who stole Cates' gun).
Unlike the first one, there were some biker action.
This one has a little more carnage than the first I should say.
When I was little and saw the first 48 Hours, I thought Eddie Murphy looked pretty scrawny in that suit and that, upon seeing the sequel, he looked a lot more fashionable.
Other than considering this film to be a fairly entertaining rehash of the first, I guess that's my review.
If you liked the first 48 Hrs.
many of the scenes are just like the ones in the first movie.
Because ANYONE who saw the first film could see the plot holes.
Whereas the original 48 Hours was a well written and acted version of the "buddy-cop" films, the sequel is uninspired and drawn out version of the first.
Unlike so many superstars (Nicholson, Pacino, Hoffman), you forget he's Duvall within the first couple of minutes of his performance.
That's what it was like for me, my salvation came to me in stages, and this was the very first one.
Would an officer wait that long to arrest a man for first degree murder?
Living in Texas (where the first part of the film is set) I know that the preaching he does in this movie seems as real as a Texas outdoor revival!
In addition, some of the scenes, especially in the first half, could have been edited out.
I resisted seeing this film at first expecting that it would be the usual tired, antireligious stereotype that late twentieth century script writers revel in.
The supporting cast is fine, with Rick Dial and John Beasley getting kudos for their work, but the movie is first and foremost about The Apostle.
After affixing the Disney brand to five--count 'em, five--Air Bud installations, all laughable after the first one broke some modest ground (and prompted rumors from PETA that Buddy the dog was killed by bone spurs resulting from wearing tennis shoes in filming), any affiliation with this travesty must be purely contractual.
Supporting him extremely well are Beau Bridges, as a former competitor turned ally, Pam Grier, as his loving and supportive wife, Cleavon Little as lifelong crony Peewee, Vincent Gardenia as blustery redneck sheriff Cotton, Richie Havens as mechanic Woodrow (Mr. Havens also sings the catchy songs very well), Earl Hindman as arrogant star racer Beau Welles, and Noble Willingham as slick Billy Joe Byrnes, the man who gets Wendell into racing in the first place.
This one has been a favorite of mine ever since I first watched it on cable in the late 70's.
Richard Pryor is just perfect as Wendell Scott, the first black stock-car racing champion.
Okay, this film is clearly inspired by "Indiana Jones" with the same comedy spirit that made "Kellys Heroes" so great... Plus a few hilarious exaggerations of the technology, even if they are mush more realistic than the silly (but funny) machines in "Wild Wild West" The story begin in the wild west, were the the friend (our heroes) are dynamite crazy bank robbers, that finally get caught and are sent to the first world war front, as alternative to a very long time in jail...
And Max Steiner's score is the first to orchestrate a "talkie" from beginning to end.
This may well have been the first "throw the girl into the volcano" movie.
Plot holes and a very crazy story detail (the first time Eric Banas character and Rachel McAdams character meet is .. well wrong!
First of all, it immediately removes the mystery of Henry's first meeting with Claire at the Library, when he is 28 and she is 20.
A few things that are major events in the book are treated as non-events in the movie, for example, the fact that Henry's first time travel was out of the car when his mother died is the very first thing revealed in the movie, when it is something of a breakthrough mental moment for Henry in the book.
The film is kind of a mess for its first half before finally finding somewhere to go.
By now in his late forties and sporting an obvious, bright red hairpiece, Charlton Heston seemed an odd Antony when first seen.
Jason Robards plays Brutus like a wooden Indian for the first two acts.
I wasn't a big fan of Eric Bana when I first saw him in Hulk and even Munich.
Not only do we see young Henry's first travel through time, but we also witness the regular occasion of him meeting another version of himself at a different stage of life, as well as the incident that shapes his life foreverÂthe passing of his mother in front of his eyes.
The CGI effects of Henry's time traveling are unspectacular but first rate while the overused musical score was melancholic, adding to the tragic tone of the movie.
The first part of the film obviously introduced the titular character, his condition, and the love interest.
This was done very cleverly, as she had known him for many years, but it was the first time he had met her.
We first see 6 year old Henry (good Alex Ferris) singing with his mom Annette (beautiful and strong Michelle Nolden) in a car.
I had read the book three times when it first came out, so I was excited when I got tickets to an advance screening.
The most depressing thing about the time traveller's wife is how it breaks your heart within the first five minutes.
I was overjoyed by how true to the book the film stayed, only varying in a few unimportant places, the film dared to be as heart breaking and sad as the book and did not feel the need to justify the logistics of the time travel instead choosing to summarise it in the first scene.
Lots of people have complained that their favourite part from the book isn't in it (Rachel's disastrous first date with another man and Henry's revenge for it, The Gomez situation, Ingrid, Christmas at Meadowlark etc) but really, there is enough in this movie to sustain it and to give any newcomers to the story a decent enough reason to run off and read the book to fill in the blanks.
At first I thought I was only going to view the first 10 minutes then hit the bed, but I simply couldn't stop.
Favorite Part: When Mary, Collin and Dickon are in the garden together and Collin learns how to walk for the first time.
Also when Collin comes face to face with his father for the first time!!
I must admit being young the first time i saw the movie i had a huge crush on Dicken!
When I first saw this movie, I was deeply touched.
I love this movie & often wish that my family could live where they did.I first found out about it when I was little from my mother- it's a good mother/daughter movie.I don't own it yet but will very soon so my daughter can watch it.I hope that she loves it just like I did (still do) The are some sad parts in the movie where it shows how Collins mother died & the garden was never open again.It took a little girl with a kind heart to win over her uncle-in-law in order for him to let her have the key.To me this movie says that anything is possible with love & care & that children are brilliant,not only do they learn from us but we can learn from them as well.I think that the parents that are too busy & have way too many things going on in their daily schedule need to take time out to watch this movie & do something with their children.There is a plot of land next to us here where we live that I want to make a garden out of & I want my kids to help with it (: thanks mom & to all mothers everywhere (patting myself on the back- I'm a mom too (:
When I saw the movie for the first time I was 14 and I was really astonished how she could make me identify with Mary Lennox, a 10-year-old girl from the beginning at the century, in a story line no one would give a damn about in our days.
(SPOILERS)Considering the depth and power given her character by author Burnett in the first half of the story of "The Secret Garden," it's ironic that with the introduction of Colin Craven, her cousin, Mary seems to be elbowed out of the way in favor of a bigger emphasis on Colin's story line.
Sure, Jason Robards is a little stiff at first, but he gets better as the film goes on.
I first saw The Secret Garden over the Christmas period a few years ago, but didn't really see it for the beautiful film it is untill a viewing or so later.
The screenplay omits two short passages that are important to the plot: (1) Cassius' avowal in the first act, after his attempt to persuade Brutus to oppose Caesar, that if their positions were reversed and he, Cassius, stood as well with Caesar as Brutus does, and Brutus made a comparable appeal to him, he would certainly not listen.
There are also some major holes, like there is a point where everybody is surrounded by zombies right when they first get attacked, then the scene changes and some of the team are just running, wow, I guess the zombies just let them by eh?
The first time I herd this film was going to happen i was Extactic I thought that this was going to be a film based on the game.The computer game holds a simple story which leaves you guessing what has happened, This film doesn't keep you guessing you can almost tell who is going to die and what is going to happen that a virus has spread through the facility and these people who go in are heading for trouble, which can somebody tell me how the hell they could of built that under a city.
I first viewed the film when I was six and then I didn't understand English good.
The first installment of Resident Evil was true enough to the video game to make it a great movie.
But the first movie was good because it had stayed true to the fact that zombies (whatever the virus infect-ant was) were the main theme.
Resident Evil (the first movie) was really good.
Movie - Game *Alice's "husband" Spencer - Spencer Family Mansion *Matt's sister Lisa - Lisa is a character from RE 1 *The dogs *The Hive and most of the action takes place under the Mansion - Under the Mansion is where we find out why the STARS members are in the house in the first place  Granted, that's a small bit that I can think of, and yeah, Anderson could have had the original characters used, but if you saw the interview with him on the DVD, you would know that he said that he created the movie this way for people who had never played the game, but used things that the game fans were used to.
When the film was announced I thought it was going to be rubbish because mostly films that are based on games are completely crap especially the ones made by Uwe Boll, but I still went to see it the first day when it came out in the UK and it was sooooo amazing.
I was speechless after I seen the film, the story is truly original and one of the best thing about it is that the first 10 minutes was slow & peaceful but then it went really fast & relentless just like a roller-coaster going up slowly & zoomed down.
Recently I saw the theatrical trailer for Resident Evil: Extinction and it occurred to me, I have never seen the first two Resident Evil films, and I always wanted to see them.
So I rented the first two Resident Evil films and watched them last night.
Quick disaster with a mystery to it, jarring deaths, naked Milla, all in the first few minutes.
To be honest, the first time I saw this, I didn't care for it.
Upon realization that a video game is "dumbed down" for the players to be able to concentrate, however, I opted for a second viewing and came to realize that this was not the waste of time I first believed.
Considering this is first and foremost, an action movie (with horror elements), that would not be considered a good thing.
We took it and, in retrospect, embraced the first attempt, as well.
The acting was above par for a Resident Evil, certainly much better than the first game.
I also like the inventiveness shown at the end when the film takes a number of unexpected twists and turns I never saw coming on first viewing.
Back in the '70s, when cable TV first came to Northeastern Pennsylvania, subscribing meant the addition of three channels: WPHL 17, out of Philly, WPIX 11, out of New York, and WORTV 9, also out of New York.
It's this last program where I first saw "Deathmaster," and at the time, I was too young to understand why it would be considered a bad movie.
There's no happy ending, and the final despair stayed with me a long time after that first viewing.
This isn't exactly up to the standards of the Count Yorga movies, at least the first one, but it's OK for a hippie vampire movie.
There is also a reporter who is more important during the first stretch.
This is the first manga film that I watched, and the reason to develop my interest and look for more movies.
I saw this movie when it first came out.
The stooges start first as starving artists in Paris, and then Foreign Legion soldiers (with familiar "about face" marching routines), Santa Clauses (There ain't no Santy Claus) and harem girls.
I first saw this Three Stooges short a few months ago, and I really loved it!
In My Favorite Wife, Cary Grant wants to restore his first marriage to Irene Dunne.
By contrast, in Too Many Husbands, the normally lovable Jean Arthur plays a character who at first seems torn between her two husbands, but increasingly seems to just bask in the egocentric pleasure of having two men pursue her.
When the first husband turns up alive after a year on a desert island, the woman has two legal husbands.
In the man remarries versions both husbands waited the appropriate amount of time and only just declared their first wives dead and remarried the same day.
So they just started their honeymoons and the first wives stopped it before the honeymoon night.
Businessman's wife, widowed for one year before marrying her deceased husband's best friend, finds out her first husband is still alive; he was believed by the Coast Guard to have drowned after the sinking of his ship, but instead was rescued off an island.
When I first heard the premise;a spouse declared dead comes back home after months alone on an island , only to find his beloved wife has re-entered marital bliss with his best friend, I thought 'it'll be interesting to see if they come anywhere near the brilliance of "My Favorite Wife"' And I also presumed this had to be a rather blatant rip-off of the Cary Grant-Irene Dunne classic released ,incidentally, in the same year.
After her first husband, Bill Cardew (MacMurray) was lost at sea, his grieving, lonely widow Vicky marries his friend and business partner, Henry Lowndes (Douglas) six months later.
The first half of the film moves quickly and is well-edited.
Look fast for a young Walter Brennan in the first ten minutes.
This is one of Griffith's first really great outdoor pictures.
It contains (as far as I can tell) the first reference of cocaine use in any American film.
This Howard Hughes piloted film was considered for "Best Production" at the first Academy Awards, as "the most outstanding motion picture considering all elements that contribute to a picture's greatness."
From the first moment you see her on screen she looks like you could reach out and touch her, she is so realistic.
I commenting Mega Man 2 after beating it a lot of years since I beat it the first time.
Mega Man 2 is not only a sequel made to cash-out the success of the first Mega Man is a step forward in many aspects.
Also Mega Man 2 is not as difficult as the first one because the worlds of Dr. Willy's creations are easy to learn and memorize.
When I was ten (1990) I bought the first Mega Man game there ever was.
In the first Mega Man game Dr. Wily reprogrammed six of his peaceful robots to conquer the world.
If only for its unique storytelling perspective, 'The Red Man's View' is essential viewing for anybody wishing to experience yet another aspect of America's first great director.
On the cover of Scary Movie i got it had an Ape on it ,what was that all about.I watched the movie expecting to see King Kong was disappointed when there wasn't.I like the movie otherwise.Another comment is why do they keep bringing back some of the characters that was killed off in the first 1?
Right up front I should say I've never seen the first three Scary Movies, I probably should.
I don't even know really why i went to see this, the previous 2 were just as rubbish, the only good one was the first one that actually said "No shame.
At first I thought it would be bad acting because that is the case with a lot of soaps.
We then go to our hero from the first three, Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), who has taken a job looking after an old lady in an old mansion.
I would rank this second out of the series, just under the first one.
It is hard to understand who is making the comments, sometimes they come in the first person, sometimes in second, and several times they are referring to things that are totally out of the time of the Roman Empire - like the comment that the gladiators were sold as it happens to the football players, or the quotes from Suetonius.
I found confusing the mix of first person story telling and historical comment in the off-screen commentary.
Instead of being purely a documentary, the narrator introduces us to Verus, our lead, within the first few minutes... after which, he joins in the narrating.
I want Jack to die already,(sorry) so Jen and Frankie could have a chance with their marriage, and i think Jack is just spoiling it, and Maggie moves around so fast first she was on Austin's rooftop and then the next scene she is at the infamous hospital baby sitting Jack.
I will admit, the first 40 minutes of the 90 total minutes had my head spinning at what this is all about.
I definitely agreed with the "blood" part of the first name, but was/still am confused on the "creek" and "town" words.
Just do what I did, brave through the first 40 or so minutes and let the pieces fall into place and have fun.
Well, what's there to say - the first part wasn't overly exciting to watch: The acting wasn't that good, the actors appeared pale in their appearance and performance, and I did expect a bit more true-crime excitement.
I remember seeing this when it debuted on TV (well, the first part at least) and finally got to catch up with it again.
I stopped watching the first time the show got ultra religious and had Marlena possessed and John turn out to be a priest.
I remember when I saw it first in the early nineties that it got bad reviews at the time.
The husband (Coyote) offers Nigel the chance to sleep with his wife Mimi (Seigner)but first he must listen to his entire story regarding his relationship with Mimi.
Why remain in a relationship where there was never any love in the first place and there is clearly no love now?
Over time, Nigel will become more and more intrigued by what it is Oscar has to say about a certain carefree dancer on the boat named Mimi (Seigner), who is linked to Oscar in more ways than is first apparent.
Untalented American writer living the ultimate petty-bourgeois life in Paris, and who thinks he's Hemingway, falls in love at first sight with a young French woman while riding on a bus.He gives her his ticket and leaves the bus.
I will admit that when I first started watching it, there seemed to be more romance with the main couples (Bo and Hope, John and Marlena) and that some of the story lines in recent years have really affected these relationships.
Oscar is entranced at first with her and delves into all kinds of sexual games, then his passion for her begins to subside and he rejects her and leaves her alone on a plane.
The acting in the movie really is first rate and there isn't a weak link there, especially not within the four leads.
Google for Jack and Jennifer clips (and Steve and Kayla) and you will come across a goldmine of clips that will tell you the entire story of the Johnson family - from Steve's arrival onto the show to Jack and Jennifer's first wedding.
This coupled with the pressure of her first major role is too much for her, so once again she finds solace in drink which threatens to destroy the project.
The Writer is James Lee Bartlow (Dick Powell) a southern intellectual who's first book has just been published and Sheilds intends to adapt it for the screen.
Bartlow is a happily married man who's home-life has always come first, however Sheilds believes that his wife is interfering with his work, so he engages his dashing leading man 'Goucho' (played by Gilbert Roland) to turn on his Latin charm and seduce the lady away from her husband while the screenplay is finished.
When he first came to Hollywood, Hitchcock was under contract to producer David O. Selznick for years.
THE BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL was the first of four films director Vincent Minnelli would make with Kirk Douglas, the others were THE STORY OF THREE LOVES, TWO WEEKS IN ANOTHER TOWN & LUST FOR LIFE.
(There may have been more in the first third of the movie but I missed that part.)
The first classic shot is when Lana Turner is doing her character's powerfully emotional final scene in the movie she's shooting.
This was one of the first in an extensive sequence of films, some acerbic and disparaging, that lampooned, speared or studied the making of films on the gaudy Hollywood back lot, including the same year's and studio's Singin' in the Rain, Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard, Truffaut's Day for Night, Kazan's The Last Tycoon, Robert Altman's The Player, and sundry more.
And budding star Lana Turner's first movie role associates trade novels with tasteless teasing and garish mise-en-scene.
The main departure from "Kane" is that Jonathan, as is apparent from the very first scene, ends this picture very much alive and with the chance of redemption.
Ignited by Kirk Douglas's terrifically brutal performance as Shields, the film is incessantly watchable - similar in structure and perspective to Orson Welles's "Citizen Kane" - as the story tracks his rise to the top and fall from grace through three primary relationships - the first with Fred Amiel, a director with whom Shields partners early in their careers, the second with Georgia Lorrison, an alcoholic bit player and daughter of a Hollywood legend whom Shields grooms to become a big star, and the third with James Lee Bartlow, a writer whom Shields tries to make a screenwriter in spite of the constant interruptions by Bartlow's southern belle wife Rosemary.
The Bad and the Beautiful was the first and Two Weeks In Another Town was the second.
Similarly Von Ellstein congratulates Jonathan on being the first producer whose treatment of a book resembles the work of a director.
Also the first time Georgia and James Lee discuss a film script they accidentally (by lack of knowledge on his part, and by temporary failure of memory on hers) hurt each other without realizing it.
Post World War II Hollywood, whenever it had a part for a tramp, first call Gloria Grahame.
Jim dislikes Johnathan at first, in time, seeing him as something better.
Fred recommends to Johnathan, that the two do a picture that is at first deemed impossible.
His first victim is Fred Amiel, the talented director who Jonathan bypasses in favor of a more established one.
When we first watched this film, it seemed much better, than on this viewing where a lot of things surface to make some of the story much weaker than before.
Rest assured, though, if they ever made a Thundercats movie with feature-quality animation, I'd be first in line...
I was so excited when I received my package that I thought I'd have a Thundercats marathon with my older sister (who also loved it) about halfway through the first disc (there's about 14 discs all up) I couldn't remember why I loved this cartoon so much?
My favourite episodes from the first half of Season 1 are:  Exodus: The origin episode,if you will.
Berbils: The first appearance of these robot/bear soon to be allies of the Thundercats and this episode is where Panthro builds the Thundertank too.
At first I found it boring but as I persisted watching the show I realised it that it's not that boring after all.
The action scenes aren't as good as I recalled them--I saw it the other day for first time in probably 30 years and was actually quite disappointed.
Time apparently really does play tricks with your memory; I recalled this picture as having much more action in it than it really did, but other than Reeves' fight with Primo Carnera, pretty much nothing happens in the first half of the film, and the action that does occur in the second half is mostly perfunctory and, as noted, not very well done.
Of course he gets away, the first of Ompahle's slaves to escape her net.
You helped establish my first guilty pleasure, as the beautiful killer Kari Von Fursten.
The first ending has the people at the end being attacked by the Aunt's cats.
A very interesting plot.Is the hero of the plot in it for the money or is he really an ok person?I saw this film in my late teens and have overall seen it about five times enjoy it on every viewing.Like most films because it has some complexities and twists and turns keeping you guessing all the way the first viewing really stuck in my mind.Well worth a watch,unpredictable in my opinion.Again why is this film not available especially on DVD?
William Castle's first excursion into the horror genre is not really scary at all.
Still, it's worth a look as the first of the William Castle "gimmick" films.
Everyone I know likes it, it was the first film I've seen since Notting Hill where you could sense the entire cinema were enjoying it (and people of all ages, colours, shapes and the like) and with a few more votes it should get some better marks & reviews.
The first time I watched this movie was on a flight to the States, watching on a very small screen.
Especially in the first half the whole story revolves around one joke: that it is inappropriate for civilized ladies to pose naked.
"Calendar Girls" just opened in New York and I was at one of the first showings.
The first is I watched this movie on DVD and found myself needing the subtitles and after I put them on I found myself enjoying the movie more.
The first portion of the film is admittedly not the best editing, but after that it is bordering on great.
At first, I actually had no idea that Billy Blanks was an actor, but after seeing the poster for this film, my interest had been captured.
What made this one original was the difference in fighting style between the 2 leads first lead: roddy piper, who does the wrestling style.
This Movie appears just be a cute day with the boys at first.
My first experience with the film came with the special features of David Gordon Green's 'George Washington.'
I was really shocked by how much I continued to think about this film in the days following my first viewing.
When this first began, the faith of Giorgio's father in their fascist government is unwavering--Mussolini is STILL his hero.
The Bassani family adjusts to Mussolini's racist laws with success at first, their father stating that despite their new limitations they can still live a reasonably secure existence.
I found it every bit as moving as I had remembered from my first viewing.
I first heard a radio adaptation from the Garden of the Finzi Contini and afer that read the book.
I certainly understand it more this time than the first time I viewed it.
The only fun things about this episode were the Doctor's obsession with those edible ball-bearings, the way he first parks the Tardis, and Roses's "Council" conversation with the tarmac chap.
I liked the movie the first time I saw it probably about 20 years ago on TV.
And when the news report of the eruption comes on, the first thing they say is that Harry Truman was at his lodge and David Jackson, the 'Young Geologist' was on the face of the mountain when it erupted.
Ingmar Bergman certainly ranks among the elite of film directors, yet missteps with this, his first (of two) English language film.
This magnificent open end film is another wonderful work of Ingmar Bergman, his first English spoken movie.
There were times while watching the film, mostly in the first fifty minutes, that I thought this was one of Bergman's best, by giving his control somewhat over to the actors, who are all sensational.
But David is not the most stable of people, and it shakes Karin up at first.
the first is John Candy's hilarious cameo.
I enjoyed the film's first half, which is really funny and clever.
This was the first movie I saw Jennifer Connelly in and just like the main character, immediately fell in love with her.
During his first night in the store, he meets a beautiful woman who also has some boredom issues coupled with anger at her father.
And being that negative attention is better than no attention at all, you can understand what brought her to the store in the first place.
And of all the people Josie has ever been with, Jim is the first gentleman she's ever met.
And for the first time in both of their lives, a true connection is made.
The dialog is simply laughable from the first line spoken to the end, both in writing and delivery.
I say this because it is well known on the circuit that this is Mr Ikimi's first picture.
At first I was worried that the show would milk his OCD too much for humor value and make it a mean spirited run-on joke, or that it would become too sappy with fawning sympathy for him.
I have to start my review with some kind of reasoning for why I have given this movie an 8 out of 10, as i will proceed to give it a raving review... Its the directors first film, and as his first film I have reserved the 9 out of 10 and 10 out of 10 for his next two films (pending he keeps putting the same amount of passion into his future work).
Watching this movie, you would never guess that it was made with a budget of under $10,000 or that this is writer/director Thomas Ikimi's first film.
First time director, allegedly ... first movie, allegedly ... ridiculously small budget, allegedly ...
A conceptually and literally dark and pensive, quasi-thriller, which unselfishly and also uncompromisingly dives head first into moral debates on life, human nature, free will and religion.
McCrea is first rate in the role, never over doing the hard-nosed side of the character and garnering believable sympathy when his guard is down.
There's a small complaint that the final battle is all too brief, but that's a touch offset by a hillside C Troop/Apache battle that takes place in the first third of the film.
The first 7/8 of the movie really isn't about anything other than a couple of people running away from Dracula and his magical death lighting bolt ring which lights people on fire... And there's some sort of weird-science thing at a Coney Island haunted house ride that involves a midget getting killed by an ax, some strange scientist and a couple naked women.
; on the other hand, the Frankenstein monster is saddled with such a (literally) squashed appearance â generally recalling Charles Ogle from the very first, i.e.
Thanks to "Uncle Forry," I was one of those kids who had lined up to see Dracula VS. FRANKENSTEIN when it first saw theatrical release: the co-stars of this one had turned up on the cover of FAMOUS MONSTERS OF FILMLAND (which had featured an article on the movie without advising those of us who cared about such things that it might be something less than entertaining- on any level).
This has been and continues to be one of my favorite cult films of all time, i first saw Dracula vs Frankenstein as a very young teenager, about 13, at the only theater in the town of Riverhead where they showed horror and cult films to pot smoking teenagers.
i remember first hearing about this in the great magazine famous monsters of filmland.8 out of 10,check it out.
I have just finished reading the first three books and have started the final book out of this series.
The first and second books were the best: The Face on the Milk Carton and Whatever Happened to Janie?.
The first twenty minutes were okay because it was not boring, then holy crap, the rest of the movie was flat out dreadful!
Most movies like this usually receive my adolation and praise, even if it may take me time to recover from the first viewing  But in my opinion, A Clockwork Orange takes the grand prize as the most disturbing movie I've ever seen, and it does not get much easier with repeat viewing.
I've seen it three times now, my first time being over 12 years ago, and it's no easier to watch now than then.
When I first saw this movie, I was around 9 or 10 years old.
This is William Castle's first "official" horror movie.
My first experience of watching this movie was inexplicable.
I first saw this movie three years ago and I have been in love with it (and Stanley Kubrick) ever since.
From the very first frame to the very last... amazing.
From the eye-grabbing first shot of the film to the confusing yet fulfilling last shot of the film, A Clockwork Orange remains to be one of my favorite films.
the way Alex stares into the camera in the first scene just freaks me out, he has a little smirk on his face that seems to say you may hate me, but you'll never be rid of me, because there can never be good without the bad, and i am the bad.
Stanely Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange" is one of the first movies that proved that cinema can be the most enlightening and amazing art form around.
The first viewing left me speechless, unable to describe how weird and terrible I felt.
However, with all the perversity bursting out of this film, you will probably NOT like this film the first time you see it.
I have watched this movie about 3 times in the past 2 years, the first time was while I was in Iraq for my second time.
However, first there's a question of jurisdiction - was Mike killed on the street and then dragged to within the base's property line?
I'm not a Crash hater, but I'm the first to admit it's far too heavy-handed and sloppy to be considered to be a great movie.
At first, it seemed like a gripping crime drama, but quickly started showing its true colours.
On the plus side, Tommy Lee Jones gives a tremendous performance, and for the first time I realized just how good of an actress Charlize Theron truly is.
There is a gray area as to whether this is a military or civilian matter, and the father (Tommy Lee Jones) finds himself stuck between an incompetent civilian police force and an edgy and defensive military police force, neither of whom really gives a toss about the truth, the first because truth is too demanding, the second because it's too embarrassing.
At first thought, this film flashes out like a 'who dun it' thriller, but it gradually dawns on me that the smoking out of the murderer is of lesser importance than the implied warning its story has to unfold.
Loosely based on the story of Richard Davis who was killed by fellow soldiers in Columbus, Georgia after returning from Iraq in 2003, In the Valley of Elah, Paul Haggis' first feature since his Oscar winner Crash is a poignant reminder of how war robs people of their humanity.
Mr. Deerfield seeing his mutilated son for the first time, also towards the end when he realizes that his own rigid personality alienated his son from himself and Cpl.
Further exposÃ©s on the aspects of coping include the side story of the soldier who first held down his Doberman in the tub until it drowned and subsequently repeated that action with his wife instead.
Enter Detective Emily Sanders (played by a very strong Charlize Theron), who at first just wants to get through her job for the day, but soon gets wrapped up in also discovering what really happened to Deerfield's son.
The first 20 minutes are the wildest I can remember in the last 10 years of Cinema.
I've become a big fan of the Japanese cinema but these are the first Kitano films I've had the pleasure of viewing.
I think I'll give it a couple days and watch it again because there are lots of details I missed the first time around.
The first two films are Violent Cop and Boiling Point.
I first wrote a review of this film here on IMDb back in June 2000.
Two Yogi-isms in the first scene and then we don't hear from him again.
The first one was the most beloved Yankee player at that time while Maris came to the team just in 1960, so he was not so admired as Mickey.
Billy Crystal(not to my surprise)knew exactly what he was doing for the movie and made it to be the best baseball movie I've seen since Field of Dreams(no offense to Rookie of the Year,Little Big League or the first two Major League movies).
This movie made me like the Yankees for the first time in my life.
The acting all around is first class, with great performances by young actors barry pepper and thomas jane.
first, i was aiming to say few words about this amazing series in the forum..afterwards,i decided that such a still in made masterpiece must have the gratitude..which-believe me- it deserve.
It was so held sacred that former sportswriter Ford Frick who was baseball commissioner at the time and former Babe Ruth ghostwriter decreed that it could only be broken in the first 154 games, that if it was broken in the new 162 game schedule, separate records noted with the asterisk would be in the books.
Elston Howard in his first year as the regular catcher hit for the highest average on the team, .348 and contended for the batting title.
Maris on the other hand was a family man first and foremost.
He was also very conscious of the fact that Mantle was there in New York first and fans wanted him to be the record breaker.
this is the first Simbhu movie i've seen and wow!i just keep watching this movie over and over again.is it because of Simbhu himself?is it the songs?is it cuz Simbhu wrote it?or is it because of the twist?
However, Simbu is the first to have penned the story on himself!
But seeing as I hated it, let's take a look at the positive aspects of this movie first: - It's excellent for aspiring filmmakers to watch, so they can learn what NOT to do.
It's right up there with, a CB christmas, first kiss, short summer and Why CB why?
It is the first Peanuts television special since 1993, and I was interested to see if it would be any good.
But I knew within the first 2 minutes that this was oh-so-much-worse...
If you're going to write a movie about climbing, wouldn't you learn SOMETHING about the sport first?
This first episode of "Monk" and the next ("Part 2," originally released together with it as "MONK: The Premiere Movie") are essentially everything that television should be.
From there the series rose again for most of it's first season, but never as high as at its inception.
I think it was the first scene: Karl Koch takes his key and walks to his car, "accompanied" by "Child In Time".
The country setting is beautifully photographed and Herrmann, in his first collaboration with Hitchcock, provides a nice score.
The only positives I can say about this film is that it had beautiful Vermont scenery, and it was fun to see Shirley McLaine in her first movie, as well as Jerry Mathers before he made it big on "Leave it to Beaver"!
The film, however, is a delightful entertainment, beautifully photographed amidst the Vermont fall foliage, and filled with indelible performances by Shirley MacLaine in her first screen role and veterans Mildred Natwick, Edmund Gwenn, Mildred Dunnock, and John Forsyth.
I saw this when it first came out and by the end of the first reel I expected there would be some sort of wry humor would emerge out of it but no, it just went on and on, and got sillier with every scene.
When they meet with death, their first reaction is to feel guilty for a crime they assume at once they have committed.
It was MacLaine's first movie and it shows.
Also look at that doctor, first so preoccupied, stumbling over the dead body twice, and not being aware, and then confronted with the police, running away, perhaps in fear of his life if he were to divulge the truth, or not wanting to get involved, which is perhaps a comment about general society.
A couple of behind-the-scenes facts are worth noting - Robert Burks' superb cinematography capturing the colorful autumnal glory of New England and Bernard Herrmann's rhythmic soundtrack, his first of several classic scores for Hitchcock.
It also marks the first collaboration between Hitchcock and Herrmann who brings a light, airy, and playful score that helps make the concern of the story less of 'how' Harry died, but what exactly to do with him.
The Trouble With Harry will at first glance appear to be Hitchcock kind of taking a break from "serious" films, the thrillers and suspense films that he is best known for, and relaxing a bit with a light comedy, but there is much more going on in this film than that.
John Forsythe gives a brilliant, perfectly cool and laid back performance as the hugely likable Sam Marlowe, and his exchanges with Arnie, played by Jerry Mathers in his pre-Beaver days, are some of the best moments in the film, and this is also the first of a great many tremendously successful collaborations between Hitchcock and composer Bernard Herrman.
Shirley MacLaine (in her first role) is delightful and Edmond Gwenn perfect.
"Introducing Shirley MacLaine" in her first screen role threw that enduring actress into an astounding mix of old pros: Edmund Gwenn, Mildred Dunnock, Mildred Natwick ("old" in more ways than one) and Forsythe.
"threshold" for the first time.
At first he seems like a nice young man,he likes opera,cooks and seems like the perfect roommate till he decides he wants Marty for himself.
After her first choice is found murdered, she lets psychotic Alec (Adam Baldwin, known for NOT being one of the Baldwin brothers) move in.
At first he seems too good to be true and they enjoy a romantic tryst, much to the chagrin of Marty's jealous over-protective ex-boyfriend.
You know how they're going to get from point A to point B to C. So no tension to be had, leading to boredom and apathy to why you even watched this lame film in the first place.
The build up is simply far too slow and basically nothing good or interesting is happening in the movie its first 30 minutes.
In 1967, Dr.Christian Barnard made world history by carrying out the very first heart transplant operation.
We first see him on a B.B.C.
The direction by John Robertson was first class, again considering that he was not one of the more well known directors of the time and the photography was the usual high standard that we expect from William Daniels.
"If These Walls Could Talk" is a disturbing and yet emotionally powerful film that's set in the same house on the same street over three different decades (the first segment takes place in the early 1950's, the second is set in the mid-1970's and the third in the mid-1990's...all tumultuous eras in which issues affecting females and their bodies have been brought to the forefront).
This film shows up as well now as I did when I first saw it in 1996 and was amazed.
She delivers an amazing performance in the first piece, giving those of us who dont remember a glimpse of the pre-Roe v Wade situation for women who found themselves in a less than desirable situation.
I have just seen 'If These Walls Could Talk' for the first time, and I am completely in awe.
I Watched it again for the first time since I saw it on TV, and was impressed.
There are two main subplots which revolve around the 1941 Pearl Harbor attack - first is the relationships between MP Colonel Jason Forrest, his wife, and varied others under Forrest's command, notably his XO Captain Calvin Lanford (a particularly effective performance by Robert Wagner).
The film gets some details wrong - when Nagumo gets word that the first wave has sunk numerous US ships, he orders the launching of the second wave; in fact the second wave took off an hour before the first wave made contact with their targets.
The film also gets wrong the exact time the first wave broke off its attack and also shows torpedo planes in the second wave, when only the first wave had such.
OK first of all, i hated it.
First off u forgot some characters Eddies sister, and Page's older brothers, Pages best friend, second, you casted not one person that was in the first one in the second one, I loved that movie u just ruined it with the second one, Some of the characters i had no idea what the hell they were doing or who the hell they were.
I recommend to just not waste your time with this movie because it will ruined the magic and awesomeness of the first one.O and no wonder it went straight to DVD!They knew how horrendous that would had been for them!
The sequel had none of the charm and believability of the first, Whatever on-screen chemistry Julia Stiles and Luke Mably had in the first is completely lacking in the sequel.
She had none of the sparkle, determination, honor and depth of character as written in the first film.
Unfortunately, the writing wasn't nearly as clever as the first, and subsequently, left Mr. Firth with nothing to work with.
It's so predictable and bad that I switched of the TV after the first 15 minutes.
While the first movie was in my opinion great and I still watch it sometimes, the second one is a disaster!
the first movie rocked.
they didn't make her as "normal" (maybe common) as in the first film, they also made her completely dependent on the prince- having no hobbies other than him.
it does not remotely remind me of any bit of the first film.
Bad acting (The lead female actress was last seen in another bad spanish production, Beyond Re- animator, a terrible sequel to the cult classic from the 80Â´s)and direction (take a look to his terrible boring first film, Second name), and more than dissapointing visuals, this film is good for one thing: curing insomnia.
While I truly enjoyed the first movie, this one stinks, I mean really stinks.
why is the father alive and well when he was dying in the first movie which is why the prince couldn't have a normal life and had to come home to save the monarchy.
I loved the first and was captivated by Luke Mably!!!!
Luke Mably played Prince Edvard as wonderfully as he did in the first and to be frank, he was the ONLY reason I continued to watch the film.
as he did in the first!!
The girl who played Paige was not my favorite and would not have been my first choice (Actually she would have been my last choice and I would have had to be desperate to pick her).
I had seen the first movie some months ago and loved it, so when I saw the sequel came out, I couldn't wait to see it!
The producers obviously made more money than they thought with the first movie, and decided to make a second but came out with such a lousy result, that I think its a pity now that my image of the first movie is seconded with this sequel one!
So if you loved the first, resist the temptation to spoil your memory with this second one!
Although I didn't let it change my feelings on the first one.
I thoroughly enjoyed the first movie.
There's a line in the first movie... Paige's mom says to Paige... "chemistry doesn't just happen in the class room and you two have it."
They destroyed the beauty of the first movie by trying to find a replacements for its remarkable cast !
So, I met Paco Plaza's work through his first movie ("The Second Name"), sort of a satanic-thriller, made in Spain but played by foreign actors and in English.
SAVE YOUR MONEY...DON'T RENT THIS MOVIE...rent the first one!
this movie just screws, reputation of first movie.
And what happened to the actors from the first movie??
The actors in the first movie were great, but in this second movie the girl who play Paige SUCK!!
Better to chase down the first episode, or The Princess Diaries or even The Princess Bride if you're feeling the need for a dash of royalty in your life.
I enjoyed the first movies, so I assumed I would enjoy this movie.
It had potential, but somewhere that was lost in the first 10 minutes.
Having seen the first movie you would know that Paige or Eddie would find themselves being manipulated by someone that is so obvious.
But what I had the biggest problem with was that this was supposed to be about a Danish prince, and that most of the movie is supposed to take place in Denmark, yet there were no Danish actors (in the first there was at least one), and the actors who where supposed to be Danish couldn't even speak Danish properly, and they almost didn't speak the language at all!
I heard the first movie was inspired by the love story of our future king and queen, Frederik and Mary, and in that case, I'm offended on behalf of the royal Danish family.
Paige was just too fru fu for the Paige that was introduced during the first one.
And the queen wasn't mean enough when Paige screwed up as she did in the first movie.
Luke Mably comes across as a whiny snob of a prince that was the complete opposite of the guy everyone liked in the first movie.
Although the movie was funny, slapstick, and lighthearted, it felt like it lacked much depth of feeling and lacked the more timeless quality of the careful acting and writing and siting of the first version.
It's as if someone took the characters in the first movie and put them on a faster time machine, with all that fast talk.
Upon reflection, I think I was shocked and made quite angry to find most of the original cast gone, so great to the first movie.
It was so sadly not there.....they were so great together in the original movie, so well written and so in-depth with serious issues and real love....you could feel the chemistry betwenn all the actors in the first one.
There are just to many movies that don't have the same characters as the first movie.
The first concerns an optometrist (Heather Graham) haunted by the death of her child and no longer able to make a connection to anyone, including her estranged husband (William Baldwin).
Isabel also falls in love with the some 75 year old bachelor who for the first time in years feel that he's wanted for himself not his talents; in his music and his art.
At first, I was afraid it was borderline stalking, and I kept on waiting for something bad to happen to the young man.
Though I liked "JapÃ³n" better (Reygadas first feature)this film is in many ways different to his past movie.
The real burr under my saddle was the potential I thought was there from watching the first scene, which seemed so erotic and new and animalistic and folksy and deeply visceral.
At first I was engrossed by the first minutes of the film.
This film at first seemed boring and slow, but once reflected upon can be added a few extra points.
And in the first few scenes this state of being is depicted very clear and immersing.
The film begins and ends with a blow-job, which may be too much for many viewers to handle (one theory is that they'll delete the first and last scenes for an American debut).
If you can make it through the first few minutes, you'll love the rest and you'll be amazed by what can be captured on film today.
This one lacks everything the first one has.
When it first came out they actually had an advertising campaign telling guys to take someone they loved and lost to this movie--it might bring them back together (!!!!)
It reminded me of a similar scene in the first "Naked Gun" only this was supposed to be serious.
The romantic song: "If ever I See You Again", which Bob Morrison once wrote for his first love Jennifer,leads you through the whole film.
I first saw this movie when it came out in theaters in 1978.
When Joe made "You Light Up My Life," the first decision he made was to dub Didi Cohn's voice with Debbie Boone's.
This artificiality might seem at first disconcerting; yet it is of a Hitchcockian efficiency, and strictly functional.
Also it again pairs Truffaut with actress Lafont, the two hadn't worked together since his and her first film 13 years before.
Pacing of the story is poorly synchronized: everything happens way too slow in the first half of the movie.
However when you read Christ stopped at Eboli and Yaban what strikes you first is the patterns of similarity in peasant life and experience of the intellectuals visiting these places.
Seinfeld has surprised me in the past by turning out a show that I didn't 'get' completely the first time - but later I did.
Save your money and rent it, watch the first 45 minutes, then call it a day.
first barry graduates and doesn't want to work in the the hive doing boring work.
which is what he wanted to be in the first place!
Jerry Seinfeld isn't really known for being anything BUT Jerry Seinfeld,so when I first became aware of this movie(sometime in early summer of 2005,and they were doing preview trailers BACK THEN!
When first looking at the trailer, I did not have much high hopes for this film.
I must admit, my first impression was it would be just for kids.
At first his wife does not want to be with another woman but soon enough she likes it.
Marty, after first enjoying his new Âdream come true' freedom, comes to realize that his wife spends more time with the girls, has reached a new level of strength, freedom and happiness, and he's the odd man out in his own bed.
A series which borrows liberally from this first outing for its topics and somewhat silly presumptions about female sexuality and men's abilities or inabilities to stay "constrained" by marriage.
After being a huge fan of Neil Burger's first big movie, The Illusionist, I was very intrigued in seeing his next film.
Oh gee and Tim Robbins isn't the first actor to have political views.
At first glance, it doesn't even seem to be anything more than an ordinary dog.
At first I thought that Rachel McAdams' character was simply too naive to be true but it soon became apparent that she was much wiser than we (or even she) knew.
At first I thought that Rachel McAdams' character was simply too naive to be true but it soon became apparent that she was much wiser than we (or even she) knew.
This is a hell of a shame as what we have here is the first great movie about the Iraq war.
The story is great, recalling "La Pacte des Loups"; the cinematography and effects are wonderful; and Julian Sands and Elsa Pataky have excellent performances and chemistry, with the story centered in their romance first, and in the rage of BÃ¡rbara for Romasanta later.
That's why I watched the movie in the first place.
I can't wait to see it on DVD and pick up what I missed the first time.
I've been a fan of John Dye, since his performance in Touched By An Angel on TV and when Once Upon A Christmas first premiered on family channel it looked like a charming Christmas movie.
I watched it as the first part of a double feature (the second film being Mildred Pierce), and I hardly remember a thing about it.
Apart from the latent debauchery creeping out into the open from the cozy interiors of a model town, the film also has multiple strings of side puns that keep its pace up at all times Â from spot-on character studies (the mayor, the artist, the butcher...) to hysterical history sidekicks (using a fork for the first time, Spaniards wondering what "beer" is, impious remarks on Dutch painting...).
Before you judge someone for carrying out a bombing, you have to first put yourself in his shoes, and picture yourself carrying a 10 year-old bleeding, lifeless girl.
I'd recommend catching the more highly rated ones first, though.
Chronologically, this is the first movie I have seen with Paolo Malco in it, without the beard and moustache that we saw in Lo squartattore di New York or Quella Villa Accanto di Cimenterio.
The first one is a bit pedestrian but the fantastic bath scene killing and the one backstage with all the costume are worth the admission price and if the ending is a bit abrupt, it is conclusive and brought a smile to my face.
Watch for Eric Roberts' sneaker/tux combo when he and his team first enter the hotel.
2)ICE T falls asleep in the first half hour and does'nt get up.
He should have just left in the first place.
When i first saw the movie i couldn't actually determine if it is an action movie or a movie mocking other action movies.
I played this game when it first came out to the UK in 2005, and rented it from a local movie store.
And at first, it was a very challenging game, and I thought the lack of dialogue might have been a disadvantage.
You may want to play ICO first as it adds that extra icing that makes SotC experience slightly better, and it ties the games together quite well.
When I first saw Shadow of the Collosus, my brother had borrowed it from a friend.
My first thought was, "How in the world am I going to be able to beat that!?
), but everyone knows, and I know it should of gotten first.
You might not like it at first but you will get hooked, like me.
The first giant is beaten simply by climbing onto him and stabbing marked areas of his body, but other enemies are beaten by interacting with the environment around you, which by the way is one of the most jaw-dropping visual features of this game by far.
The first part is simply an unabashed Liberal love-fest with big plugs for the Times and NPR, and the celebs are all big Liberals, from Bill Clinton to Jon Stewart to Ken Burns, the Indigo Girls, etc.
Then, we get profiles of the top players, from the young prodigy who first entered the tournament at 16 and is one of the favorites to win at 20; the veteran who always is in the finals but never can do better than third; to the gay guy who is seen at home playing pinball with his roommate.
Bristling with intellectual playfulness, this worthy homage to one of America's favorite systematic stumpers, the daily New York Times' crossword puzzle, first starts out as a witty documentary on the history of this fixation but eventually evolves into so much more.
The first type presents some source whose story offers up a world or view of a world that we never had the privilege to see before.
There is the history of the form that centers on its development by the NY Times and the paper's first and current Crossword Editors.
The first part introduces us to New York Times crossword puzzle editor Will Shortz and a number of puzzle constructors, primarily Merl Reagle.
This was a rather cute film...a little slow at first, but quite amusing as it went along.
Dreamaniac was David DeCoteau's first film, and it shows.
I could only watch the first 1 hour.
Come on, 42 years old, living in New York and behaving like it's your first crush.
It is easy to see her as a wide-eyed American, flying in for a three-hour tour of the horrific Asian brothel, then telling us her amazing facts as if she was the first person to discover them.
This is actually my favorite Travolta role and this was the first time that he really dug beneath that cool and cocky exterior to show himself as a real actor, displaying a wide range of emotions.
Although the second part of the film may be a slight let down after the strong first part, this movie is a definite treat for those who are sick of standard Hollywood fare and for the fans of Sean and Robin Penn and Travolta.
The Penns play Maureen and Eddie with absolutely NO charm, with as result that the first half of the movie is almost unbearable.
Give us five or so great performances, from the two Penns in love in the first half to John Travolta in the sunny (and shorter) second half, and you have something that really gets under your skin.
Festus Haggen would not have gotten one of the first in 1873!
At first Gray is prim and proper and later on becomes attracted to Morrow.
If you have never seen Coleen Gray, it is worth watching the first 20 minutes or so (until she lets her hair down and bathes in the river.)
This movie had me hooked from the first scene the first time I saw it, but it has that rare quality of actually getting better with every viewing.
By the way, the first scene is very grisly and cold-blooded, and you *know* it's gonna be a great movie when that happens even before the opening credits.
Some friends wouldn't even give the movie a chance (to the point where they didn't even want to look at the box, they were so scornful) until I had to beg them to watch it- they thanked me after the first few scenes.
At first it seems like Maria might be able to use this to her advantage, but since Torq is so psychotically religious that he thinks any human emotions are the work of Satan, things just get more complicated and intense from there.
Also, if they haven't tortured you yet and you confess first to get it over with?
I saw this for the first time when I was six or seven, and the memory of it really stuck with me, since we didn't have too many TV programs in Romania, back then.
The best one is the classical first line.
Howard Huges produced this picture for UA and was the first film to win an Academy Award for its direction.
sort of mad max (see the prisoners and the atlantean first cities ) meets sinbad (SFX would still be poor if dated 20 years earlier ) meets cable TV tripe, like those "lost/treasure island" short telepictures from the 1960-70s for a young audience.
Directed by Kevin Connor this was the fourth & final 'lost world' film he & star Doug McClure made together, the first being The Land that Time Forgot (1974), the second was At the Earth's Core (1976), after that came The People that Time Forgot (1977) & Warlords of Atlantis rounded of the loose series of films which is probably my favourite overall.
This was one of the first movies I saw at the cinema as a kid.
Brill film for youngsters, I loved the film as a kid, first saw it on bbc 1 or 2 in about 1985 when I was 8.
At first, Vitti doesn't like the idea, but goes ahead.
The first time that Vitti and Ben Sobel (Billy Crystal), a calm shrink meet face to face is okay, but the events that happen after that are serious and down-right funny.
You have to see it to experience how rubbish it is, watch this film but don't pay anything more than a dollar, or pound or a euro... try and see if you can last till the movie ends...I couldn't the first time and missed the ending the second time, it now sits proudly with the rest of my DVD collection as it should with everyone, so you can say, I own the worst film eva made
In his first directing role Anthony Chan gives us Kindergarten Ninja.
Presumably Chan approached the city council to make the film as part of the DARE anti-drugs programme so that he could get his first feature on his show reel.
Found it kind of amusing that the Stiller and Baldwin characters last names came out to Isabella Rosselini and their first names equaled Joey Lawrence.
The first time I saw this movie I was blown away by Liam Neeson's portrayal of Briar Gates, he brings his character to life as much as any actor as ever brought a character to life in any movie.
It just loses appeal to fast and it especially does so after the first wedding.
The film starts off interestingly enough, diving right into an action sequence involving the first of many appearances of the monster, in this case it is a vampire/zombie.
Rule #1 broken: in a horror flick, never show the monster, and certainly don't show it in the first 5 minutes of your movie.
But in fact, the action from the first sequence was not only as thrilling as the rest that followed, but it was also far superior to the anti-climactic final showdown.
Where most films save their best for last, "The Era of Vampire" gave it all away in the first 15 minutes.
When I first saw this movie at the video store, I thought, wow cool bunch of monks kill vampires.
I sat there for the first 30 minutes wondering when the thing was going to f***ing start!
This is the first Miike Takashi film I have watched.
I will not go into details so I avoid spoiling it for people but the very first scene was superb and set the highest of standards for the rest of the film to follow.
It's got some scenes that don't work early on, or maybe its just so strange to really get into the mood of it at first.
That it's not for everyone will be known right from the first scene.
First things first, this movie should not be mentioned in the same vein as other movies that "go to far."
The first scene is just the tip of the iceberg compared to the rest of the movie, but I would spoil the fun by telling you what you are about to see, just go ahead and see it.
My first port of call was highly rated director Takashi Miike's highly rated 'Visitor Q'.
I also have to note the hilarious scene where the two guys come face to face for the first time, in Crystal's office.
And Joe Viterelli, who's been in other movies but I first discovered him on this one, is great at playing the bumbling henchman and I hope to see him more often.
At first I was worried by the use of video as it normally seems cheap and crappy but then I noticed the angles that the director was employing and his abundant technique.
History has shown that the first actors were prostitutes.
And also De Niro' first visit to Crystal's has me rolling on the floor in laughter.
I saw it on sale, bought the first series, watched it, and loved it.
When I first watched this show, I was little disappointed but after watching it again.
At first, this is an unlikely pairing but you know if you know anything about the great Dame Judi Dench (even though she prefer you call her just Judi, no Dame Judi or Ms. Dench).
Sickening and chilling is the account of how both Mayer AND Judy's mother virtually forced her to abort her first pregnancy because it was the "wrong" time for her to have a child.
At first I only wanted to see the movie because of my father but I enjoyed the film.
I want to see it again so I can hear all the lines I missed the first time because I was laughing so hard.
There's a great thematic consistency to all of Potter's writings, and it's easy in retrospect to see everything he wrote prior to 'The Singing Detective' as leading up to that masterpiece (he was shameless about self-plagiarism), a view which also explains the relative vacuity of his later work; and this means that watching 'Blue Remembered Hills' today, it doesn't quite have the impact that it may first have done, before elements present in it were reworked (together with elements from all his other dramas) in his landmark achievement.
The fact that all children's roles are played by adult actors (albeit strange at first) works tremendously well.
Maybe I'm being a touch harsh on it as I've seen far worse but I'm fed up of wasting my time with crap like this, having said that I'll still be stupid enough to be the first in the queue when the next low budget piece of crap gets released.
I could go on for pages about how horrible it was, but being the optimist I am, I will mention the only two good things about the movie: It was the first movie I have seen, containing Ninja-Priest-Mummies and it contained quite some large boobies.
I can only talk about what was wrong with the first half because that's when I walked out and went to the pub for a much needed drink:  1) someone's standing on a balcony about to jump and so you send a helicopter to shine a searchlight on them???
I would be more forgiving if this was the Hayley Cloake's first attempt at directing, however, it is not.
At first, after doing her grief work, Miko comes on the Nichols, smooching him up, her wide-open lips revealing glistening incisors of frightening dimensions.
At first it had all the things that make a horror freak happy.
And at first, pieces of the movie seem to be in place.
I only saw this movie once, 30 years ago, when it was first broadcast as a TV-movie.
I have not seen it since it first aired and I was an 8 year old living a life similar to that boy in the movie.
(not oddly, my own first two initials) and I couldn't find out anything about it.
I was lucky enough to experience it when first broadcast in 1969 when I was seven.
I have not seen it since it first aired and I was an 8 year old living a life similar to that boy in the movie.
I hate to sound so melodramatic, but that's how this movie affected me as a 10 year old seeing it for the first time.
I cried like a baby seeing it for the first time since 1969/70 The price is steep at $54.00 post paid,(VHS)no DVD available.
I first saw J.T.
for the first time in nearly 35 years, in color no less!!!
I remember seeing it many years ago, the first time it was shown.
I remember that Doris Day (a great animal lover) introduced this second showing, saying that the first had been "a happening."
"JT" has a kind of double ending, the first so tragic, so sad, and the other hopeful.
in December 1980 and after that hadn't rerun it again until Thanksgiving Day, 1987; at that time, my family had their first VCR, and I was very lucky to have videotaped the show.
Julia Duffy was so memorable and funny as the spoiled, self-absorbed Princess Ariel that when she re prised that type of role as Stephanie on the 'Newhart', for the first season she was on that show I just saw her as The Princess...and that alone kept me watching 'Newhart'!
Joe peso excels in this piece of courtroom comedy where he takes his first murder case as an out of town lawyer in the deep south.
And there's even a bit of good craftsmanship that goes unnoticed by some in it as well (the first scene at the bar shows this if you look close enough).
When I first saw My Cousin Vinny, I then realized the difference in those movies that were done pre-2000, and those done today is like comparing a juicy orange to a glass of rancid milk.
I still laugh at the same scenes I laughed at when I first saw the film over fifteen years ago.
I watched it first on a VCD and later found a featured DVD a few years later for a few extra quid.
Tasting hominy grits for the first time, meeting a judge(Gwynne) who doesn't play around, and dealing with his argumentative fiancÃ©e.
This is one of the rare movies in comedy that i could watch over and over again,, this movie is sooooo , freaking funny it's like a laugh a minute,, especially how Vinny,, "bag of donuts" is woken up constantly every morning,, first the train,, then the pigs i think the owl, and o yeah the steam whistle... i can relate to that stuff, and living relatively close to N.Y. for years i can relate to the accents in the movie,, very Brooklyn if i'm not mistaken,, i loved Joe Pesci in this movie,, this is one of his finer moments ever in a comedic role,, Marissa Tomei however stole the whole show for me,, not only is she sexy and pretty she can act too, her accent fits her like a glove, Ralph Maccio,, hmm well, not everything can be perfect.. i Loved Fred Gwynne the judge,, he is so hilarious,, i just bust out every time he gets Vinny on Contempt of Court or something,, and order him to some jail time,, overall the plot was simple... yeah some of it's corny,, i guess you kinda have to be a Pesci, Tomei fan to appreciate all the slapstick,, but hey it's one of the funniest movies that you'll ever see and you won't regret watching it that's for sure,,
Joe Pesci as a lawyer with no legal experience from Brooklyn whose first case just happened to be defending two "youtes" in a first degree murder trial, and Marissa Tomei in the dresses that are so magnificently out of place in the muddy Wahzoo City, Alabama but so deliciously fit her like a glove, make one of the best screen couples ever but I like the supporting characters and small cameos, too.
The film made me root for Vinny, wishing him victory in his first case, and he won gloriously with the help of a lovely, lovely expert in the general automobile knowledge in this lovely, lovely comedy.
Vinny Gambini, a budding lawyer from the Bronx comes to handle is first murder case in the South-with one of the defendants being his relative.
It'll still make you laugh continuously, but not as hard as the first time you saw it, when what was coming was a surprise.
On first viewing, it gets a 10/10.
This is the first film I have seen where Pesci is the lead role and he proved to sore beyond what his talents are, he's definitely one of the most under rated actors of all time, I feel like he's Hollywood's hidden secret weapon.
It's about two boys who have been accused of murder, with a lot of pressing evidence against them that can get them executed, but one of the boy's cousins, Vinny, is a lawyer, well, just graduated and starting his first six weeks.
Launer has also written things that at first appear throwaway at the time like eating grits at a diner but then incorperates them into the plot later on .
One underrated bit is the one where Pesci first meets his cousin's friend (Mitchell Whitfield) in the jail cell.
For decent comic book adaptations look to X-Men, the first Batman movie, and (to a lesser extent), the Superman movies.
I remember the AMAZING SPIDER-MAN from when I was a kid,it was one of the first memorys I have when we came to this country.
Notwithstanding the brief step away to RKO in 1939 with The Flying Deuces, this was the first of the duo's nine post-Roach movies.
If this was the first Laurel and Hardy film you'd seen you'd never know what the fuss was about, something lost on Fox who promote their Stan & Ollie output on home video with a trailer announcing "four of their best-loved movies".
However, I never found one thing to laugh in the first half of this film, got discouraged and brought the tape back to the video store.
I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who wasn't a fan of the great duo, but seeing it for the first time was a revelation after all the negative things I'd read and heard about the Fox movies.
All in all, it's a funny movie, especially the "first breakfast in the mess hall" scene and the "wrong side of the target range" scene.
GREAT GUNS was the first Fox feature for Laurel and Hardy and it was inspired by Abbott & Costello's huge army hit, BUCK PRIVATES, which had been released early the same year and made millions at the box office.
This wartime comedy is one of Laurel and Hardy's first movies for Twentieth Century-Fox, so it isn't nearly as consistently funny as the ones they made at MGM.
The first half is very slow, but once they get involved with their Sergeant Hippo, it picks up a lot.
When we first see them, they are celebrating the wedding of Isabelle.
It will remind you why you liked him in the first place.
But be reassured "La faute Ã  Fidel", her first fiction film (coming after a pair of interesting documentaries) isn't a carbon copy of a Costa Gavras movie in any way.
The first person is played by Billy Crystal, a calm, cool, and collected psychiatrist named Ben Sobol, who is divorced with a young teenage son and is engaged to soon wed a resigning TV reporter named Laura MacNamara (Lisa Kudrow).
The first confrontation sequence between Ben and Paul is quite engaging.
But during the movie and especially at the end of the first con on Penelope he was very passive and he lost lots of credits as he is just about to fail during the play of the con and actually fails in the end... That made the character and the movie look very soft... disappointing for me... After all I thought that the character is not cool at all...
The pacing is so slow, that I felt so bored after the first twenty minutes.
But it sags in the middle because, for all its charm, it feels like an artificial construct from first to last.
Johnson's style in The Brothers Bloom seems to almost mimic Wes Anderson's at times as several scenes (especially the first ten minutes or so) have a similar feel that seem to be shot in the same way you'd see in an Anderson film.
When Steven realizes Bloom cannot talk to her, he plans a con with the first step being Bloom talks to the girl.
Their first con that we see, when they are 13 and 10, get them 30 dollars from the neighborhood kids, and a kickback from the local dry cleaner!
He is in his first major English-language film in ages, and he is wasted here.
The other crimes---when the seeming brothers are children pulling their first big con, their scheme to seemingly masquerade as antique dealers and seemingly commandeer Weisz's fortune, the almost displacing effect it has by seemingly falsifying every reality it presents-- -for all their far-reaching wit and larcenous archery, boil down essentially to be just what we expect from a con film.
It fell completely flat leaving you wondering why they even left it in the film in the first place.
The first thing I asked myself when I walked out of the theater was: "What's with the silly hats?".
I particularly enjoyed her goofy/passionate reactions when she's kissed by Adrien Brody's character, Bloom (that's the only name he's addressed by in the film; it's one of the few things that's never explained), and we realize this is the very first time Penelope has EVER been kissed by ANY man!
I particularly enjoyed her goofy/passionate reactions when she's kissed by Adrien Brody's character, Bloom (that's the only name he's addressed by in the film; it's one of the few things that's never explained), and we realize this is the very first time Penelope has EVER been kissed by ANY man!
Unlike Brick, most of these arts are devoted to making us laugh, and the first 1/2 to 2/3rds of the movie are very funny indeed, and well worth seeing.
Stephen, the more inventive one of the duo (or rather, the one that will whip up a plan with a quirk or two not unlike Owen Wilson in Bottle Rocket), devises the first con to be that of intriguing the hell out of a group of kids- first part introducing Bloom to a girl, which he likes right away- and then leading to a cave that tricks them all into believing something is there which, of course, is not.
More because of Adrien Brody and Rachel Weisz, who play off each other wonderfully as an at-first awkward couple who get further romantically involved (there's a wonderful, spot-on charming scene where we see them kiss, and we understand clearly Penelope is having her first French-style) and connect closest with how Johnson casts them.
As the sophomore effort of Rian Johnson, after his first very impressive debut Brick (which, I should note, also tooled playfully with conventions of a genre as he attempts here), he's aiming quite high.
This may be my first review of a movie for IMDb.
The actors are all first rate.
Yet, here comes the first "what if" of the film.
Very slight on first appearance, it is the fact that it's so well told that makes it seem simpler than it really is.
into the first reel this reviewer craved the blissful relief of an untimely death before the next zoom-in close-up of Peter Spelson's heavily lidded psychotronic stare!
The great news is that for the first time an exclusively authorized, digitally enhanced 2 DVD set of "Psychotronic Man" is now available.
For many of us it was our first introduction to Hudson.
This was the closing film to Singapore's first Korean Film Festival, so for those interested to follow Ki-duk's movies, add this to your list.
Those familiar with Kim Ki-Duk's films will no doubt find this to be true to his directing form; Slow pacing, subtle performances, first class cinematography, a simplistic story, and very little dialog.
Like L'ATALANTE, THE BOW is seagoing fare of the first order... except for the ending, which harks back in some ways to films like WARM WATER UNDER A RED BRIDGE.
Although at first the old man might seem like a kindly, albeit creepy, grandfatherly figure, the man's plans for the girl are not so pure because he plans to marry her on her seventeenth birthday.
Being that The Bow is my first introduction to the films of Kim Ki-duk I am a little at a disadvantage to understand the themes of his films, but I can say that I truly enjoyed watching the film.
I adore the first three minutes of the film and have just watched them several times now.
Its also a film that doesn't play to expectations, so much so that I really will have to sit down and watch the film again, there are a couple of things that happen that seem odd or out of place on first viewing that may not be that way once you reach the end.
Rocky starts having strange visions, like himself flying around in a car and such similar tomfoolery, and he gradually becomes the world's first and only Psychotronic Man.
At first, Rocky doesn't comprehend the powers that have been granted to him and even seeks professional help to make the unbearable headaches go away, but then he gradually learns how to control his skills and use it against the people he doesn't like, like his own wife who's in the way of his love affairs.
At first.
The answers first appear in the soul, in a state of meditation (the shooting of the bow).
A bad element is that some romantic moments can be remarked as a little bit artificial, but we must not forget the environment, the circumstances of those years (between first and second word war)with a snobbery society.
Now he is old but he written history with his achievements and he will always be remembered as the first greatest Romanian actor and movie director!
At first glance it looks like Sergiu Nicolaescu as old prince Morudzi performs rather flat, however the character he plays is supposed to be flat with few emotional variations.
I do not know what absolute idiot chose to comment this movie first...but it is obvious that he did not understand anything from it....probably his intellect is to low...
It was the first feature film made entirely in Chicago since the Essanay era before WW1.
Like many first efforts it is crude by comparison to the things that follow it, but it is truly one the beginnings the of modern American independent movie trend.
The two story lines first are independent and gradually merge.
His first magazine was entitled "Household Words", and while publishing it he decided to enhance it's readership by writing a novel.
I do have one regret - and if you want to read the novel first do not go beyond this point below: SUPER SPOILER COMING UP: In the novel, Mrs. Sparskit is jealous of Louisa marrying Josiah, and when Louisa has her affair with Harthouse she spies on her.
The first hour was spent with a smile on my face.
Almost like a James Bond movie for kids, The Flyboys devotes itself to action first, realism and morals second.
Kyle (McClendon) is the new kid in town and after a little trouble on his first day of school, he befriends Jason (James).
While it might be better served with a few nips and tucks through editing and in structure, it is a hell of a ride for two hours and an incredible first time effort for its director.
When her estranged(..and very rich)mother dies(..ruled a suicide, though it's obviously not), teenage Nancy(Jenny Tamburi, twenty at the time, but succeeds in her portrayal of a coquettish Lolita-type of teenage girl who might not be the dense, naive simpleton they at first suspect)returns home from years of various boarding schools to enjoy life on the wilder side, living with lothario step-dad Marco(..the handsome Silvano Tranquilli)and successful photographer Gianna(..the sensual Rosalba Neri, so divine you can't take your eyes off of her).
The first ten minutes, when we see how Jason and Kyle become friends, set the tone really.
Big thumbs UP to the first detail, and a big thumbs DOWN to the second.
I only watched the first 4 episodes of Dragonball Gt and when I saw the atmosphere, characters (especially Pan), and synopsis, I rejected to watch DBGT.
at least, it was that way for me during the first couple of minutes but then i realized it was more about the man behind the cars.
Flashbacks start with Enzo's first experience of race cars as a child to race driver, marriage and mistress, Alfa race team, children, World War II, his own factory, and failed Ford merger.
Because this is the Undertaker first and last movie, and i am the big fan of "dead man".
The first half moves on relatively slow (similar to Silvio Amadio's above mentioned earlier Giallo), but the viewer already gets enough information to know that the plot isn't as simple as it seems.
But the most remarkable thing in this intriguing Giallo is the lush, ear-catching main theme that will never let one go after being heard for the first time.
But the first Hulk movie I saw as a child was Mr. Nanny.
I missed the first half of it, where Shep blows up General Suitor's spaceship.
Notes:   The first version of Suburban Commando released has a special message by Hulk Hogan before the movie starts.
when i first watched this with 2 other people i was slightly tipsy....but that just made it better...for 1 and a half hours we were on the floor laughing it's that funny....and the best part is it's funny for all the wrong reasons it's so bad it's great, the dialogue is hilarious and hogans acting is even better.
This movie is about a schizophrenic detective who is trying to track down a serial killer who is killing kids who have the same first and last initial in their name.
The only thing this movie will be remembered by is for being Eliza's first topless movie after she said that she will never come out nude in any movie.
A handsome and lonely gym teacher Eddie Collins can't perform sexually due to his constant watching of his mother undress while he hid in her closet as a child.His only recourse is to kill the women he tries to sleep with and stash them in a pigeon hutch on his roof.He hires a prostitute to dress as his dead mother,the only way he is able to achieve sexual gratification..."The Arousers" is the first film of director Curtis Hanson.Originally shot in 1971 under the title "Sweet Kill",this film lingered on the shelf until 1973 when executive producer Roger Corman had Hanson shoot two days of nudity inserts to spice-up the film.Angus Scrimm of "Phanatsm" fame has a small cameo here.Overall,this is a good piece of sleaze from the early 70's that should satisfy the exploitation fans out there looking for plenty of nudity,sex and violence.7 out of 10.
For the first 15 minutes, the film started very well and I was hoping to to be thrilled and suspended for the entire length of the movie... No such luck!
With low light levels and muted colors, combined with creepy background music, the film's first half creates an effective thriller atmosphere.
Artistic license is one thing, but these two go off on such amateurish tangents, you'd swear they were first year film students desperate to impress their teachers and peers with their cleverness.
For the first time we hear " Trust no one" which became a catchphrase later on.
The first season of the X-Files went out with a bang.
This marks the first time that the tag line changes at the end of the opening credits.
We get our first glimpse of the alien/human hybrid experiments and their toxic green blood.
The first season was fine and all, but this episode really jump-starts the popularity of The X-Files.
I like how that shows that the first season has come full circle.
What a great way to end the first season of the x-files.An apparent unrelated.minor car chase leads the agents to the discovery of what seems to be concrete evidence of a government conspiracy.The early sequence of the man being chased who then is shot emits green blood which has toxic properties is a classic.Also Deep Throat plays an important part i this episode though can the agents trust him after his lies in E.B.E?A stunning moment happens when Mulder enters the warehouse and before his very eyes is bodies in tanks of water.When he returns with Scully the bodies are gone much to Mulders disgust.He thought he had irrefutable,indisputable proof.This episode must be watched!
"Mercenary for justice"- surely a candidate for oxymoron of the year -is the first Stephen Seagal movie I have seen since the excellent "The Foreigner" and I am disappointed to report that the dear boy has let his love for the folding green overcome his artistic sensibilities once more.What are you like,Steve?
The first ten minutes made me laugh more than the whole of "The Bucket List".A blonde - haired lady with muscular thighs and some sort of circus costume jumps on and off lorries killing highly - armed soldiers before disappearing from our ken rather mysteriously.That bloke from Bros should have stuck to causing pre - pubescent girls to lose bladder control because there's more future in that for him than in acting.
And our hero?Needs to hang up his black combat pants at least until he can find a proper movie to work in.Perhaps "Under SIege 3",set in a Franciscan Monastery where the chief monk geezer is holed up in the bell tower with an Ingram and Britney Spears.No?Well stranger things have happened,and if it ever comes to pass remember you read it here first.
The first 30 seconds is the worst logo for a movie I have ever seen and the remaining time is spend on credits.
But with Streets of Rage 2 also available, it does kind of render the first one somewhat obsolete.
He is at his best when he lays out the town in the first act description.
Henry & June has a place in film history as the first picture to be rated NC-17.
It got the first NC-17 rating ever (Which is pretty much a kiss of death, like the film "Showgirls.").
It tells an interesting story that concerns the famous and scandalous American writer Henry Miller during the period of work on his first major work, "Tropic of Cancer" in 1931 in Paris and two women without whom the book would not have happened.
Anais is also known and praised as one of the first and the finest female writers of erotica.
Kaufman wrote the script together with his wife Rose, and made a brilliant, disturbing, outrageous film, which had made history by having been the first USA film to receive the NR-17 Rating, so called "kiss of death".
Well, the first time I've seen this film was 7 years ago.
In all fairness, I only watched the first three quarters of this movie, but that's all I could stay awake for.
She was one of the first women to really explore the realm of erotic writing, and certainly the first prominent woman in modern Europe to write erotica.
Henry and June holds the distinction of being the first film to receive an NC-17 rating.
Director Phillip Kaufman stirred up quite a bit of controversy when this film was first being released, most likely because of the intensity of the love scenes, but after watching the DVD I am now thinking that this film could have maybe slipped by with an R rating.
Historically, this film was the first with that rating-- the MPAA created the rating specifically for this film since they deemed it to risquÃ© for an R. By today's standards, this film is an R. If you're looking for softcore, watch "Emmanuelle" or something.
The cast is first rate.
So far as I can tell, it has been the best reviewed film of 2006 as of the first quarter of the year, and nothing else for which I've seen trailers thus far looks likely to unseat it any time soon.
Also, note that it will only go out to a few screens at first and those who don't go on opening weekends will miss the chance to see it the second weekend.
As Stephanie opens up to Lydie, Lydie begins to acknowledge her own conflicts about her current pregnancy with her husband Paul (Timothy Hutton): their first pregnancy resulted in a stillbirth and the current pregnancy began three months after that unresolved tragedy.
The camera was slightly swaying sometimes and the light not perfectly chosen so you felt like you do in real life: not always in the best spot to witness life unraveling, which is a characteristic of most movies, where any viewer is sitting in first row.
For a director's first feature, I take my hat off to Mark Lee and also to the writer/producer who for reasons previously stated in another post did an amazing job getting this movie to our screens.
It is a brave film from a first time film maker.
Mark Lee directs his first feature here and has a great command of the medium.
The first time was hilarious, but again?
I was bored of the movie after about the first ten minutes, but I made myself watch it, hoping it would get better.
I don't know if you should buy it at first sight, but I do suggest you rent it, or watch it next time it comes on TV.
I saw this movie when it was first released.
OK first its soft-core porn, if you don't like a lot of soft lesbian scenes you may as well go elsewhere.
I just saw the film for the first time tonight, so these are some brief impressions.
I first saw this film when I was but a young lad, and loved it - the fact that some of the film was set in Australia played something of a major part in this - although some bits frightened me for no apparent reason.
But money can't buy you brains: learning nothing from their real mistakes, they still throw logic to the wind at every opportunity, this time working from a script by Jim Vance, the first movie's hipster boyfriend.
While they spend great chunks of time rehashing plot points from the first movie, don't pay too much attention because they alter details at will; for instance, Julie Andelman is nowhere to be seen in spite of part one's tease ending.
And after we spend the whole movie watching Wayne earnestly trying to solve the mystery, he duplicates the first movie's fatal conceit by announcing himself as a cult conspirator at the very end, thus transforming "Blood Cult"'s dubiety into outright fraudulence; it doesn't just make no sense, it is a frontal assault on the viewer's intelligence.
A movie that totally blew me away when I first saw it.
I first heard Noel Coward's play as a radio drama on our local listener-supported radio station, and I immediately started searching for anything I could find out about it.
Which is to say, the film IS a bit diagrammatic and stilted during the first act: two American bohemians in Paris (Cooper as -- get this -- a modernist painter, and March as an aspiring playwright) meet-cute with a fellow American art lover (Hopkins) on a train.
She works at an ad agency in Paris managed by Edward Everett Horton, who, having failed to get to first base with the ripe young tomato, has resigned himself to act as her ersatz-guardian.
The first twenty minutes of the movie are too stage-bound, but once we're fully introduced to the players and their circumstances, the script starts to take off.
This was one of the first times Lubitsch had made a movie with little or no music on the soundtrack; previously, in his musicals and his sublime "Trouble In Paradise," he had used background music to cover up potential dead spots and carry the film along.
I mean for instance, the characters within this movie see each other again for the first time in 10 years but yet they seem hardly affected by it all.
Sure the nature environments are beautiful looking but it slows the movie a bit down in the middle, which also is in big contrast with the serious and dramatic first part of the movie and the action filled final part.
Personally, I was hooked after the very first scene.
In fact I re-scheduled my first marriage so as to fit it in.
Ben Irons (David Carradine), the main outlaw, is hunted down by the new Marshal of the town (Michael Pataki) and his posse, setting in motion a not-so-epic struggle that could have easily been resolved by never making this film in the first place.
Also, the aforementioned references to the original seem to be merely a buildup to re-examining, albeit too briefly, the courage (or lack thereof) of the town folks who left Kane alone in his predicament in the first story.
I didn't at first connect the red hair of the girl and the fox until it was pointed out to me by a friend (who also has red hair!)
I first saw this movie in a theater in France a year or so ago.
I didn't quite like the remaining twenty minutes(the deal with the prostitution ring resulting in heavy violence and the whole rain ordeal as it destroys the dam) as much as the first hour as Powers Booth's Bill was amongst a culture of people he knew nothing about.
As an impressionable, short attention spanning eight year old, I loved about the first half hour -- then I lost interest.
The very first image of the movie shows a mountain ridge in early morning autumn mist, and my thought was: "This is almost too beautiful."
After my first viewing, I was certain that "Daddee" Bill had blown up the dam.
And I don't think that's what Margheriti expected, so I was wondering if he experienced the same kind of reaction from the audience when he first screened this film back in 1980.
And then there's just the story, which covers the first days of a viral outbreak as it begins to spread and people begin to wake up to what is going on, which is also pretty fascinating.
I would even credit Cronenberg's "Rabid" (1977) as being first on this one, and a definite-influence on this film.
This is quite different to other Italian Cannibal movies that are set in the jungle, as it takes place in the city almost entirely (only the first five minutes take place in the Vietnamese jungle).
is one of the first infected with the cannibal virus, and Radice excellently portrays the Vietnam veteran's blood-lust and insanity.
If your a person who's seen it or is thinking of seeing it first read the book>scare your pants reading it>then watch the film>get board and see that the only thing close from the book is just the bloody title.
The last Hammer Horror film features Nastassja Kinski in only her third film, and her first major role.
He's a heretic priest with fiendish plans for ravishing young "nun" Katherine (Nastassja Kinski, in her first big role).
Honor "Pussy Galore" Blackman offers a bright performance as Widmark's agent and Denholm Elliott of the first and third "Indiana Jones" films is perfectly jittery as Kinski's guilt-plagued father.
The first problem is the script, which apparently was being constantly rewritten right up until the end of production.
For starters, the plot is fresh and compelling: Sinister excommunicated renegade Satanist priest Father Michael Rayner (a wonderfully wicked Christopher Lee) plots to impregnate sweet innocent nun Catharine (a ravishing and beguiling Nastassja Kinski in her first big role) so she will give birth to the spawn of the Devil.
"To the Devil...a Daughter" is a well done film that demonstrates what a first rate director is capable of with a limited budget.
In her first scene, it is apparent that there is more than a passing resemblance between Nastassja and Ingrid Bergman - innocent, clean beauties.
The cast is first rate and included Richard Widmark (who was pretty disgusted with the film and threatened to walk out on it), Christopher Lee (of horror film fame), Honor Blackman a renown actress at the time in Britain (known to American audiences as Pussy Galore of the James Bond "Goldfinger," and Denholm Elliot as the German bad guy in "Raiders of the Lost Ark."
At first it was fun to play as several of the Simpsons characters but when they started repeating their dialogue for the 50th time it became mighty tedious and tiresome.
The Emerald Forest was the first film to bring up the issue of the destruction of the Amazon.
The first major clichÃ© we can see in the movie is when the white men come they bring with them guns and alcohol and of course they exploit the natives.
At first, the "Andrews Sisters clones" get on your nerves, but you grow to like 'em after a bit!
"I'm...well, to be perfectly honest with you, I'm Miss Carlotta Marin's husband," says Brien when he meets Nanny for the first time.
Beautiful Peggy Ann Garner, not the plain little girl that played Francie in "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn" is all grown up and plays the part of a female predator out to get her man in her first drama in living color.
I was a kid when it first came out and I've seen every episode.
The first person i talked to (a guy doing the charity stuff on the street) turned out to be one of the flat-mates of the girl!
Although I try not to miss any episode of "7 vidas" now, I have to say that I never watched it on its first seasons.
Girija acting in her first movie was the center of attraction as she suited for the role and acted very professionally.
great movie,great music and fantastic direction.it is not possible for any directors to direct such a story with heart touching scenes.even the one who hates love will have a thought of doing love if he/she watches this movie.it is very hard for everyone to believe that this is the first movie for both hero and heroine.they played such an attracting role.songs like "OH PRIYA","OM NAMAGA",OH PAPA LAALI" make to watch this movie repeatedly.the movie's story is simple but the way of direction and cinematography makes us to love this movie.this is one of the biggest hit for the director in all major languages in India.definitely a must watch movie for all ages.
I first became aware of the term "ecology" when I signed up for a masters-level college class of the same name in 1965.
It was the first formalization of the study of ecology on the West Coast.
It provides the movie with some tense sequences between the killer and Lt. Columbo, since Columbo is obviously somewhat reluctant at first of making accusations against such an highly respected man, that also above all things is his wives favorite candidate.
The movie coupled with the fantastic soundtrack,meant that in years gone by it was always first amongst the movies on video night.Two movies which l feel a similar and most definitely be appreciated by fans of The Wraith, are two Australian films made slightly prior to The Wraith.The obvious movie being Mad Max,however the second less obvious is the movie "Running on Empty",similar plots lines,identifiable characters and outback,desert type settings are all evident.
Essentially a revved-up sci-fi version of High Plains Drifter with 80s teens and the cute young spirit of vengeance driving the Mad Max Interceptor instead of riding into town on a horse, The Wraith is one I've remembered fondly since first seeing it on Monstervision with Joe Bob Briggs in the 90s.
After seeing again Deliverance, which was thrilling when it was first released, and Excalibur, poetical, Wagnerian but a little bit out of date (regarding the shining 70's fake armors), Emerald Forest deepens philosophy and ethnology.
I have loved this movie since the first day I saw it.
From the first moment Flynn appears on the screen, there can be no doubt that Sheen will take her to the mat---or in this case, an Arizona hot spring---and there can be no doubt that Cassevettes and co. will receive their devilish comeuppance.
I have been quite interested in seeing this zombie flick from the first time that I had heard it was being made.
most of the people in this film were first time actors and they did a great job.
For the first 38 minutes, it's average; not bad, just average.
The acting was bad, and that could be attributed to this being the actors first film ever.
Ganryu even goes so far to point out Kung Pow had a $10,000,000 budget and Ninja Bachelor Party did not - which is ironic since this was my entire point in the first place - Kung Pow was annoying to begin with, so just imagine how much more annoying seeing the same thing is on a shoestring budget.
The first thing you notice is the color; pastel to a fault so that even the bright red trousers of the dragoons seem somehow muted.
It is the only indicator to why the movie was named 'Godfather' in the first place.
As this detachment first enters the town marching in order down its main thoroughfare, a beautiful woman (Michele Morgan) appears on the balcony of her fashion shop and catches the eye of the regiment's dashing and handsome Lothario who has already compiled a notorious string of conquests (Gerard Philipe).
I'd seen only the great films from the 30's by this director, before enjoying this first color film from 1955.
When he arrives home he finds his mother, Virginia (Sally Eilers) has been seeing a lot of Brett Curtis (Warren William) - a man who Paul feels uneasy about at first sight.
Brett's first plan is to convince Virginia to marry him and then to have Paul committed to a sanatorium.
This is what causes all the trouble in the first place.
SLIGHTLY DANGEROUS gave 21 year-old LANA TURNER her first big starring break in a film not dominated by a male star.
I wanted to see it first and foremost because it was filmed in Madrid, Spain (having lived there, some things were recognizable), and I am a fan of supernatural horror flicks.
I hate movies you can figure out in the first five minutes of watching them.
Despite a lovely murder scene that takes place in the middle of a load of bed sheets, the first half of the film is largely rather uninspiring; but as the film moves on, it mutates into one of the most grisly assaults that I've ever seen from Italy.
Many people that have seen this movie have labelled it a Giallo, and while the film does have it's Giallo moments in the first half - I'd put Spider Labyrinth in with the robust Gothic horror films such as Kill Baby Kill, Inferno and Suspiria before listing it amongst the likes of Solange and The Bird With the Crystal Plumage.
Spyder Labrythn is the first film in years that I can say caught me off guard and drew me in...It is this weird mix of Suspiria and The Beyond...but where The Beyond was stupid...story wise and in presentation...this film was not and where Suspiria dragged in parts of the narrative for the illusion of suspense...Spyder Labrynth doesn't.
My first knowledge of "The Spider Labyrinth" came from Travis Crawford's review in the 'Eyeball Compendium', as other reviewers here have pointed out this film is easily obtainable on 'boot-leg', but cries-out for a better DVD release.
Slow and indistinctive at first, "Spider Labyrinth" marvelously unfolds into a hugely macabre and unnerving thriller.
The first time you notice that something is wrong is when we get our first closeup of our heroine.
I watched the first episode on a whim.
VARALARU is a great movie, and lot of hard work in that film, P.C.Sriram, work is excellent, and A.R.Rehman, did a wonderful job.All songs are feast....The Director, K.S.Ravikumar, has add his stamp from the first scene itself.
She at first declines but Jim urges her to take up the offer for the sake of the business and the family.
Though the character seems to be a supporting role at first, as the feature rolls on he becomes more central to the storyline and therefore much more effective.
If you have to see this film but don't want the film's secrets given away early then keep your eyes closed for the first three to five minutes.
I had high hopes for this movie considering what a big deal the box office made this movie into but when I watched it for the first time, not even half way through the movie I was so disappointed in it.
From the first glimpses of the mansion and the surely wonderful scenes I would see, I was ready to go.
The spoiler would be having to see this movie in the first place.
This 100-minute yawn fest lays out the storyline within the first half an hour, but continues to meander here and there without really accomplishing anything.
VARALARU , is a very good movie, and lot of hard work in that film, P.C.Sriram, work is excellent, and A.R.Rehman, did a wonderful job.All songs are feast....The Director, K.S.Ravikumar, has add his stamp from the first scene itself.
When I first heard that Eddie Murphy was going to star in The Haunted Mansion, I was initially disappointed.
His first 'Doctor Dolittle' movie was pretty decent, even though he'll never be able to truly replace Rex Harrison.
He also did pretty well in 'The Golden Child' and the first couple of 'Beverly Hills Cop' movies.
The movie starts great but unfortunately gets cheesy after the first half hour.
When I saw this movie for the first time, I was amazed by what a good job they did, and when it was over, I want to see it again.
I relaxed in front of the TV tonight, and started to watch "The Other Me", The idea of having an identical duplicate of the main character, that they only know about has been around since Disney first made "The Parent Trap".
D.W. Griffith's first film, 'Those Awful Hats (1909),' was designed as a comical public service announcement of sorts.
I first thought the film was okay, but I enjoyed it only because of my curiosity stemming from the film's rarity.
When I rewatched it, I started getting bored within the first minute.
This film has a first rate cast including some famous faces like the wonderful and missed Madeline Kahn, the brilliant and subtle Barbara Barrie, the under-appreciated Julie Kavner, and Emmy Winner Edie Falco in the title role as an aspiring actress from Long Island.
The shots are quite first rate and the film has a slow but steady peace.
But the director, Eric Mendelson, making his first film, captures all these people in the same way Allen does in all their humour- but also suggests a level of sadness that Woody hardly ever did.
A good friend of mine is her first cousin.
This is the first Sharpe film I've ever seen, and according to other reviewers it isn't the best.
Helmed by Robert Radler, TNT fails miserably as a generic stupid actioner, the movie is mercilessly boring for it's first half only to be undeniably hilarious it's second half.
BOMB THE SYSTEM definitely falls into that category and for the first half, had the makings of a cult classic.
I went into this movie thinking it would be a non-clichÃ©, modern portrayal of graffiti culture in NY... only to see in the first 2 minutes, a guy Break dancing with a boombox, in front of a muraled wall.
In the book, when they discover her floating corpse, they at first think it is Molly Â which leads to the conclusion that the murderer might have been mistaken, too.
It was in fact Pops Racer who drove his first son Rex Racer to the brink of destruction with his strategy of how to best use the technology he developed.
i first saw this when i was around seven and enjoyed hearing the catchy opening.
For me, I was far more disturbed by the first minute of the film, seeing the animal slaughtered.
Clerks is a very unique movie in itself this is the very first B&W movie I could sit through.
It was interesting to compare it to Kisses And Caroms, both were first features, both are one location, both are about 2 guys, but Kisses and Caroms has hot naked women in it.
Clerks is the first movie of five (the other four go in order: Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back) and fixates itself around Quick Stop store clerk Dante having to go in on his day off.
I remember when I first bought the season 2 DVD set and watched the episodes in sequence.
This is the first episode of a two-parter and this takes place mostly in the travel agency, and plays out like your typical hostage crisis storyline with the task force talking to the killer and doing everything they can to get a shot on one end and the hostages and shooter on the other end.
Jay & Silent Bob make their first appearance here but its Randall and supporting characters that have the best lines.
I see I am clearly in the minority here and it wouldn't be the first time, but I just didn't find this movie all that entertaining.
We see this in Mallrats, but this film...clerks, his first one is a bit out of the league.
And let's not forget that this was his first real movie and that it took him from nothing to Hollywood in like a second, now thats impressive.
They're also the two crudest, and the first and last in the series, respectively.
Kevin Smith has delved into action ("Mallrats"), drama ("Chasing Amy") and philosophy ("Dogma") in his Askewniverse, but Clerks, the first film of the series, is still the best.
This is his first film and it's flawed, to be sure.
The directing, acting, editing was all above what I expected from what appeared at first glance to be a "Low budget" type of movie.
Honestly when I first started the watching the movie, I thought it was a Showtime series and not a movie.
Since I first saw Joe Pantiliano as a pimp in "Risky Business", I've always enjoyed him.
I realize that, "sweet," would not be the first adjective out of one's mouth after seeing Second Best, but sweet is what it is.
He is very much a part of a network of friends, family and community, and he is even on tolerated terms with those who have moved on with their lives, including his re-married ex-wife and son (who might be the first handsome gay dental hygienist ever portrayed in film).
He is the true hero of the movie, as improbable as that may seem at first.
At first she tells Mulder that what Duane Barry needs is a "friend, someone who appears to understand him and can appeal to his sense of reason."
My mom and I first saw this in the mid-1970's and even back then, we joked that the name of the film should be "Joe Nameth Goes to Mexico to Get Laid".
I think this is one of the first Belgium films I've ever seen so I didn't really know what to expect.
I was reluctant to see it at first, but when I did, it completely blew my mind - the acting, the directing, the writing, the cinematography - perfect!
Several scenes made no sense at first and I am not sure that some ever did make any sense.
This was the first movie I saw with Kurt Russell, and have been a fan of him ever since.
I remember seeing this as a kid in the theatre, and saw it again for the first time in many years on cable recently.
My first encounter with Vincent Gardenia was in All In The Family, as he played the ditsy neighbor who cooked.
It was my first encounter with Cronyn, and I've been a fan ever since.
As the movie began, the first lines were in English, on the Italian language track.
Why were the first lines in English???
In encountering the Satan character for the first time, the woman appears nude, while we get a close-up of Satan's eye...talk about undressing someone with your eyes!
Other figures vaguely involved include the enigmatic owner of the film's central castle setting who is something of a wry observer and eventually Master Of Ceremonies at the climatic would-be satanic orgy, an even more ambiguous and unhinged manservant (the first time we see him he is lying on the floor with a knife stuck in his throat Â don't ask!)
I have been looking for this film since I first saw it in 1989.
The parents here, along with their victimized daughter, all moved more slowly than postal workers on Valium for the first 1 hour and 50 minutes -- then screamed like Banshees on "Speed" for the final 10.
I first watched this movie when I was like 12.
That thing with the meeting and the moon eyes and the first date sex and the brief comedy misunderstanding leading to the immediate reunion and forgiveness cause you're just both so much in tune.
There, in the same flight, she will know Daniel (Tom Hollander), a young man that will fall in love at first sight of her.
Alone she will fall in love at first sight with Lawrence, to who she will know accidentally in the airport.
Everyday he meets attractive women but falls in love with Potter at their first encounter.
As a romantic comedy - of a sort - it beats anything that ghost town Hollywood be capable of; there are elements here which won't be obvious to you on first viewing and that's to your advantage.
The first time I saw it I was incredulous, and the second time, even more so.
i didn't know about Paul McCartney's role in the band from the beginning and how he was actually stuck on drums first.
All the historic sites written about over the years are shown -- the house where John Lennon grew up with his Aunt Mimi on Menlove Ave. (now a part of the National Trust), the Woolton Parish (where John and Paul McCartney first met), Penny Lane, Quarry Bank School for Boys, etc.
I don't know about all you people saying, "oh this was so accurate", because i watched the first part of this movie.
The first time she said her name, all I could say is "Her name is Pizza ?".
Among the standouts are Anthony Perkins as the vicious, confident, and, of course, unstable Lou Kramer; James Mason as Admiral Sir Francis Brindsen, a stock figure at first but who, thanks to Mason's skill, turns into a character of barely noticed wry humor; and Michael Parks as Kramer's key henchman, possible lover and explosives expert.
But I walked out because a boom microphone drops down into view about 20 times in the first 35-40 minutes of this film.
When I first saw this movie I regretted spending my money on the ticket.
When I first saw Disturbia I regretted spending money on the ticket.
However, once you get past the impressive first five minutes, the film falls completely flat!
The first time I saw this preview, the first thought that came into my head was "Oh, my God, how could they rip off Rear Window?
There are a couple of "shock" moments, but they appear and leave in the first 5 minutes of the film, after that, the teenage love puppy story sprinkled with tepid moments of "tension".
At first, it's no big deal, but later the man becomes angry--how could they be so self-absorbed that they didn't notice or care?!
At first, I thought I'd missed something when the film ended--there were just too many dangling plot points and things that just confused me.
That would be because the great Alfred Hitchcock used it first with his famous suspense thriller Rear Window.
And then Shannon Doherty as Rene, first of all she really didn't seem thrilled to be in this movie, she never hung around the set, she would take off when she was done working.
It is so slow that after the first half hour, I put it on fast forward (the advantage of subtitles is you can watch a movie like that).
This was the first Jay & Bob flick that i saw and it made a great impression on me.
Here are my reasons (spoilers): (1) The soliloquy given by Jason Lee in the first two minutes of the film is one of the funniest yet sickest stories of all time.
One hour after takeoff, the first flight of America's first S.S.T.
Jason Lee is great in his first major movie role and he easily makes the most of his dialogue.
Kevin Smith's second feature is actually very similar to his first.
Mallrats has been made in 1994 and was portraying the first generation of grown up kids put up face to face with mass capitalism.
Watch "Clerks" first (even though this one takes place first in chronological order).
After seeing the truly excellent 'Clerks', director Kevin smith's first feature, I had high expectations of 'Mallrats' and have to say that I was dissapointed.
I'm not a big fan of Smith's work, as I've only caught his first three flicks and I still think his third film "Chasing Amy" is the best.
Marc is at first perplexed, then he confronts his wife and fellow workers with the fact that he just shaved off his mustache and no one believes that he ever had one!
The first is Billy Mummy (the kid from "Lost in Space") turned out pretty well.
At first i had trouble discerning whether it was based on a true story or not, but i found as the film progressed that this became less and less relevant to my viewing experience.
I was utterly enthralled in the first half of the film, the revelation that there might be something supernatural at play was realised beautifully, with some truly terrifying moments.
I'm not really sure why IMDb lists this as a horror first and foremost.
I expected a straight forward ghost movie and at first you kind of get what you expect.... except for that the movie is entirely shot in the style of a TV documentary featuring mostly interviews with eyewitnesses, some old family video footage etc.
The atmosphere is really dense and even though you barely see anything than blurry photos I was pretty creeped out in the first half of the movie.
And speaking of story, unlike most of the other first person horror movies, "Lake Mungo" actually has a good one.
Don't wait for the Hollywood re-make already in the works, there's no need, the Australians got it right the first time (unlike you, Hollywood.)
hoping the movie would not end without an explanation and to my surprise it did, well googled and found this is one of those movies.. read many reviews skimmed through the movie again and finally understood.. or i think... so here goes people, the first half is his dream!!
From his days as "Gazoo" in "The Flintstones" to his first appearance in weekly variety on Danny Kaye's variety show to his glory days as part of the weekly ensemble on Carol Burnett's variety show (who can forget him as Eunice's husband, or as "Rhett Butler" or in the Charles Dingle part in the spoof of "The Little Foxes" - using the word "chitlins" as a minced oath), to his long association with Mel Brooks...Korman carved a nice niche for himself, frequently as partner to Tim Conway.
His 1970s series, "When Things Were Rotten" was his first attack on the Robin Hood myth (later revisited in one of his movie spoofs), and despite some decent scripts did not succeed.
The script by Robert Sabaroff was based on the novel 'The Seventh' by Donald E. Westlake can be divided into three chunks, the first third of the film revolves around the recruiting of the team with some fun set-pieces to make sure each member is up to the task, the second third of the film is my favourite when they carry out the heist & there's that feeling that you root for them & you want to get away with it & all the close calls they have & watching the plan unfold is pretty fun, then the final third of the film is perhaps the weakest as several random events come together & tear the thieves apart & it becomes a rather dull runaround after the money which goes missing through no fault of their own but does obviously cause problems as they don't know who to trust.
The Split was apparently the first film to be given an 'R' rating by the MPAA thanks to some fun fights, a few shoot-outs, a bit of mild bad language (although the 'N' word is used here in a casual fashion, something unthinkable these days especially when the IMDb flags it as a 'Prohibited Word' as I have just found out...) & a bit of blood.
I watched it only to see Mommie Dearest to get some understanding of possibly the second-most self-destructive Hollywood actress, Monroe being the first.
When he first sees Sadie, he is mesmerized, almost unable to speak.
Crawford's first and final appearance is simply impressive.
For one of the first films in the early thirties, it's an entertaining film.
A total bomb when it first hit in 1932, Rain today holds up rather well for today's audience to enjoy.
The acting in this film was first rate.
This story, by Somerset Maugham, has been filmed many times in the last seventy-odd years, but this is the first.
Rain is a deceptive work, at first glance it appears quite dated, but in reality its quite relevant for today.
The first talkie of the classic Jeanne Eagels' play "Rain", it was effective in every way even though it uses many old-time editing cuts and inserts.
At first, Charlie is what is needed - his presence means they're safe from the outside world, but gradually, even his supporters among the children begin to see that he's a danger.
Bogarde is in top form as the at first lovable Charlie, who, as he does in "The Servant," gradually becomes more sinister.
There is a close-up of her face at the moment she first realizes that her mother has just passed away.
Charlie is masterfully portrayed by Dirk Bogarde who was in his more fruitful period with such masterpieces as "accident" "king and country" "la caduti dei degi" "morte a Venezio".He keeps people waiting for he only appears after about forty minutes.But when he's on the screen ,the chemistry between the thespian and the children is so obvious that there's no hiatus.At first sight,he resembles some adult Peter Pan (hairdo,swagger,clothes,not to forget the name:Hook!
From the first scene of the film one can already tell that there is fine cinematography.
It's a quite gruesome film, emotionally draining and heartless, an obvious comparison would be "Oliver Twist", or perhaps a dark fairytale from the brothers Grimm... At first, before the father arrives, I thought it was a Christian parable, where the mother represented the dead Jesus, and the children the acolytes and worshippers.
Have watched this film many times and enjoy it just as much as the first time,a mark of a good film.Joe Orton certainly had a strange sense of humour very evident in this black-comedy.A must see if never seen.Perhaps immoral,so what the blazes its entertaining to say the least.Great performances from the cast.
So, if you want to enjoy the mystery first, then stop right now...and come back after you've seen the film.
This is where the writer/director weaves two fundamental issues together: first, there is the male angst about whether his wife still loves him - which generates the bizarre dream set in Paris (while they are both on holiday in China) and second, there is the deeper philosophical issue about reality itself.
I first saw EMr.S as a teenager who had just come out of the closet.
Sure, it's a horror movie, but the paranoia and the absurdity come first.
This movie started out to be okay at first.
He starts having nightmares after his first night about going into the attic of this place and finding a locked trunk, but someone is inside.
At first, through the first third of the movie, I was sure that the film was an allegory about the architect's family and friends never actually noticing him (or his moustache).
It was as if I was watching "Evil Dead" for the first time (not that I want to draw similarities Â it was just a similar viewing experience).
In fact, maybe he never even had the thing in the first place.
Kasten is a first timer.
The Attic Expeditions was a superb film, from first time director Jeremy Kasten.
I was first interested in this film because Seth Green was starring in it, but i got a lot more than i bargained for.
Jeremy Kasten does a great job for his first movie.
This was the first of these movies written by Bertram Millhauser, who always came up with witty dialogue for Rathbone and Bruce and snarky bits of malice for the supporting cast.
My 7 yr old had some issues" with it as well the first night but has since resolved them after considering the whole of the film.
I actually went to the theater to see this when it first came out and was surprised to see that it was filmed in a very familiar location, The Biltmore House in Asheville, N.C. Don Knotts is the overbearing lead detective as Tim Conway is the clumsy assistant trying to solve a homicide at the huge mansion.
The plot itself, while admittedly spoofed, is intriguing, and I didn't expect the ending at all the first time I saw it.
is the first question of a recent online interview conducted with Emmanuel CarrÃ¨re.
Indeed, 'La Moustache' is one of these attention-grabbing cinematic mysteries that first baffle the spectators, and then leave them behind with a bunch of questions unanswered.
Especially the first part of 'La Moustache' is intensely compelling and dark, examining the relationship between Marc and AgnÃ¨s, and closely focusing on Marc's progressive battle to keep his emotional and moral nature under control.
I saw this movie for the first time when I was eight years old, and loved it from the start.
Definitely in contention for first place for "Most Unashamed Use of Stock Footage in a Motion Picture", along with Jackie Chan's "Master of Cracked Fingers".
So, you should only preview this movie to see if you really like it first, but I don't recommend buying right away, especially without a preview.
On first glance I felt the part was weak.
a first for Gerald.
Second, the first mini-series was so one of a kind that it really left an impression with people.
he is rivaled by George Carlin in a dramatic role a first for Carlin This movie shows us how the tale Ends but to me it still leaves a lot out maybe to lead to another story in the Lonesome Dove universe about the Final Years of Woodrow Call.
One of the first things I do after watching a movie I really like, is checking reviews of others...professionals and amateurs, as listed here.
i was so looking forward to this film... methought the title held much interesting promise... i was cozy to it at first, however, as the film progressed, I couldn't understand why the director chose to propagandize rather than tell a story depicting the human condition... all the material was there to tell a great story of two peoples, but instead the director prostituted himself to covert politics instead of the art of storytelling... too bad.... the content turned me off as i was never given a chance to make my own mind up, but rather I was constantly told how to 'feel and think' about the story's dilemma... the director missed a great artistic opportunity... that's why i'm giving it a score of 1(awful)...but I did like the score!
In the first half of the film, while the narrator is explaining how Islam moved through the Middle East and across North Africa, scenes of men mounted on horses or camels are shown riding through desert.
Contrast this with later discussion of the first crusade where vivid scenes of fighting and death are shown along with narration explaining how horrible it was for the unsuspecting Muslims who were attacked in their peaceful towns and villages by the evil Christian soldiers from a Europe just emerging from the dark ages.
But unlike the first half of the film where they've downplayed the military aspects and refer to it as the Islamic expansion, now the military aspects cannot be ignored and it is referred to as the "Ottoman expansion."
For instance, it does not talk about stars named with Arabic names in the first observatory founded by Muslims.
It covers, at about 50 minutes each, three aspects of the religion: Mohammed and the origins, the culture and the first Christian crusade, and the Ottoman empire.
This is the first documentary that is fair to Islam and the Muslims.
It is a first rate production that describes the faith accurately and recounts history as it was.
We begin with in Stardate 43997 during the first Borg attack on Earth in the TNG episode "The Best Of Both Worlds", where we see the soon-to-be Commander Sisko (played by Avery Brooks) as an officer on one of the Federation ships trying to attack the Borg cube (under the command of the newly assimilated Picard - now known as the Borg Locutus).
It is stable, a first for the Federation The Cardassians and Bajor were both relatively young races for Star Trek, but both were interesting and had so much room for development.
Doctor Julian Bashir, an annoying at first character but who blossomed into one of the show's best.
Oh by the way, in the first season of TNG they mention gold as being valuable still - so that's weird.
On arrival the station's new commander, Benjamin Sisko, isn't too keen on his new assignment which is first since he lost his ship and his wife in a battle with the Borg three years previously.
We begin with in Stardate 43997 during the first Borg attack on Earth in the TNG episode "The Best Of Both Worlds", where we see the soon-to-be Commander Sisko (played by Avery Brooks) as an officer on one of the Federation ships trying to attack the Borg cube (under the command of the newly assimilated Picard - now known as the Borg Locutus).
Even meeting them for the first time in "The Emissary", it was obvious that these were people with unique pasts limitless futures.
Although the acting in this first episode was occasionally a little stiff, given the scope and convoluted plot, and the newness of the complex characters which would evolve later in the series, I think this is understandable.
Deep Space Nine's first couple of years weren't THAT great, but then the show started to rise with a great storyline and great situations, such as the Klingons' separation from the Federation, Sisko's destiny and the Federation's war against the Dominion and Cardassian alliance.
But I mean anyone who watches this flick now for the first time will give this maybe a 4 if they are a post apocalyptic flick lover type like me, and a 1 or 2 if not.
Damnation Alley was first a short story and then expanded to a Novella (probably to make the movie from).
Hell Tanner (yes, his first name is Hell) was not Jan Michael Vincent, George Parpard would have been better cast as Hell Tanner.
Ever since the first time I saw this movie, I have loved it.
Okay first of all, forget the egghead, moviegeek, fanboy rumblings you will read about this movie.
The first fifteen minutes are unimaginably dull and handle about absolutely nothing, really.
The first hour of the movie is probably the best one .
There are classic scenes such as the first scene where Tinkerbell meets Peter or Peter on the pirate ship meeting Hook .
I was in first grade when I saw it for my birthday and I remember liking it then.
When I first saw this movie I was 12 years old and I would come home from school and run to the T.V.
Love the cast first of all.
He's not the first actor to be seriously robbed of an award.Morgan Freeman in Shawshank Redemption?
When I first came to IMDb to look up this movie, I was very surprised at all the negative criticism and backlash that it had generated.
If you look at it from the idea that she is like a little girl who has never really grown up - but is somewhat frozen in time to back when she was 6 years old, when she first meets her "soul-mate".
As to why he left Never Never Land in the first place.
The first, say, 25 minutes of "Hook" are brilliant: Williams is a workaholic who has no time for his kids, when they are kidnapped by the villainous Cap'n Hook.
He made a horrible directing choice when showing the first (non-bird's-eye view)shot of Neverland.
I was expecting a breathtaking, sweeping, panoramic first view of Neverland (which is lush and green in my imagination).
I was 10 years old when I first saw this movie (and I was born in 1993), and it was one of my favorites.
With the writing staff and cast of the excellent Animated Series, Batman: Mask of the Phantasm became the first Batman movie where Batman was not overshadowed by the villains since the Adam West era.
Batman hunts down the Phantasm to clear his name, but soon his arch-nemesis, the Joker, is hired to take out the Phantasm first!
Mask of the Phantasm was really the first Batman origin story on the big screen, and in many ways it tells the story better than Begins.
The first and primary plot focuses on Batman tracking down The Phantasm, a mysterious vigilante who has been systematically killing off mobsters while Batman is blamed.
The only negatives about the movie would be that the stories are very tight, which causes some scenes to feel rushed and less significant than it should, such as when Bruce first suits up as Batman.
This is the first film from the "Batman: The Animated Series" in which the film's plot involves Batman being framed for killing a group of gangsters; but here's the catch, the new villain is identical to Batman in terms of the cape.
The villain is known as the Phantasm in which he makes his appearance in a gray cloak, a blade for a hand, and a silver mask (almost identical to Doctor Doom) in which his weapon is not only hand-to-hand combat, but also uses smoke as a weapon as well for distraction, and that's what he uses to kill off the first two victims in the story; by leading one to crash his car on the street from a garage to crushing a mobster with a headstone at a graveyard (this might not be suitable for young viewers); and yet, both the gangsters and the cops work together to kill Batman and the only person who believes that the caped crusader isn't a murderer is Commissioner Gordon.
Throughout the film we encounter a beautiful woman name Andrea Beaumont who makes a fool out of Bruce Wayne, and in a flashback of Bruce Wayne, its explained that the woman was the first love of Bruce Wayne, but it tears him apart when Andrea abandons Bruce by leaving with her father to France after in tides with a local mafia.
At a party, he thinks back on his first romantic love with a beautiful heiress named Andrea Beaumont and what his life could have been like with her.
On top of that, he's got the emotional turmoil of reliving his first love and the reasons she left himÂand the fact that maybe he's tired of being Batman, that he wants a normal life but he still feels driven to work off the guilt of his parent's death and the pressure of the vow he made to them.
This was the first Batman cartoon I have seen I first seen it when i was about 5 years old and this is how i got the cartoon batman also staring Kevin Conroy as batman and mark hamill as The Joker.
All the performances are top notch, Mark Hamill is wild and crazy as The Joker and he really goes to town and has a lot of fun like Nicholson in the first movie, and Kevin Conroy is absolutely stunning as Bruce and Batman, his voice is so intimidating and kinda scary.
In this first animated film based on the animated series, the creative team does both a prequel and a sequel to the show as it introduces the characters of Andrea and Phantasm.
traitor has just been released in here..so i have just watched it..i found it on good intentions..especially surprised when i saw Steve martin's name as a writer..Don Cheadle was great..so Said was... but as a Muslim  being in mostly Muslim country(Turkey) i can easily understand there r many people are being used because of their faith..but most of Muslims have normal life..rare of them in those kind, though Islam; as every religion forbids to kill anyone even anything...the first important thing is being human...i know this, i can see this from here..but a European or a Japanese or an American person who has no knowledge or cultur about Islam what does he or she think?i accept as a Muslim we weren't able tell ourselves rightly to whole world but i think if Hollywood or the film makers want to seem pretty to Muslims or to understand and tell the world about real the Muslims, re-sit and re-think...when they r making films about Islam or Muslims; they should quit to write about agency, terrorism, bombs, poorness,weakness,revenge, sleeper agents.......etc..there r real Muslims never confirms because Ä±slam never confirms anything of these..normal lives r being lived...obey the rules..no "takÄ±yye"..its forbidden..its seem however u r..pls quit showing Muslim women ugly..as a good example look at Turkey..u can see really good looking but covered women...please read "Mevlana", "Said Nursi"..u will find great stories to take or adopt...please keep on taking films on this way so u can contribute the tolerate..understanding..
At first I thought Samir Horn(Don Cheadle) was trying to infiltrate the terrorist organization who are suicide bombers that believes in something like the Qur'an by earning there trust, but later it seemed that he was actually loyal to the terrorist organization or even a double agent.
The first hour of "Traitor" was simply great, but after the first hour it started to lose it's entertainment value and became a bit tedious.
The parts after the first hour wasn't bad, but just wasn't good as the first hour of the film which kept me guessing.
After the first hour, things start to get predictable, not that I knew what the ending was going to be or Samir's last plan, but I knew what direction it is going.
Overall, I recommend the movie, but also feel there are a lot of other films in the theater now that should be seen first.
I'm not sure exactly how Samir pulls it offÂand this is probably a first in the history in the fight against terrorismÂhe manages to arrange for 50 would-be suicide bombers to be on the same bus and they all blow themselves up at the same time.
i was lucky enough to be part of the "first audience" to catch this at a pre-screening, and i have to say that i really enjoyed this film.
When I first saw the previews, I was expecting a bourne supremacy/bond film with whoooohoooooo action that makes you say "kill, kill, kill" and gets you all worked up.
** On a side note** To the one reviewer who thinks Clooney shoots Brad out of no where, if you had actually bothered to pay attention during the movie you could see that when Clooney opens the closet the first thing he grabs for is his gun hanging on the wall.
Other highlights include all the scenes that take place at the CIA (the concluding dialog between JK Simmons and David Rasche is a killer) and the first phone conversation between Pitt and Malkovich is deadly, too.
As their first feature since "No Country for Old Men, "Burn After Reading" radiates barely a modicum of the customary Coen luminosity.
Bo came across as an empty-headed, blonde for the first half of the movie and it was hard to believe that he developed passion in the end.
Why would any substantial French wine experts attend the first year of a competition setup by an ex-patriot Brit wine seller with no customers?
I loved it - from the very first scene to the end.
It was so surprising when I first saw it, that at first, I didn't even know what it was.
The first time I watched this movie I thought it was hilarious but the second time it just really rubbed me the wrong way...
first of all I would like to say I thought the movie was hilarious and it's one of my favorite movies today.
FIrst things first I had no idea that this was a PG-13 rated movie, I saw the first few minutes of this movie on TV and decided to rent the movie on the basis of the hilarious scene about the campaign posters.
At first, we see these actors in an ad for the father's gubernatorial campaign arguing and pushing each other on a basketball court, and they do seem very tough.
This movie was very funny, I was laughing out loud the entire first half.
At first, I thought it was a little weird.
I first saw this TV movie on late-night British TV in the late eighties and was thrilled with it's simple, yet effective sci-fi edge; obviously, the film was made for a prospective television series that never happened - Which is a shame as the end result was far better than many of the series' that were approved and syndicated at the time.
my favorite parts of this movie are when the lead android was first seen behind that log cabin home when she tried to attack the male actor's role managed to turn the tables on her and he terminated her by nearly running her over with the jeep that he drove.
The story involves the inaugural flight of "Maiden One" the first supersonic transport plane.
(The movie ignores the fact that it was a British-French conglomerate that first built the Concorde, and had to sue for the right to land in America during this time.)
At first I did not know there was going be a Cinderella 3; but after I watched it, I thought Cinderella 3 (as well as 2) are great sequels for everyone: kids and adults...like me.
I will say that when I first saw the trailer for this movie, I was impressed.
lol that's why we all need to read the title of a book and then flip it over and read the back of it before buying, or sometimes we open the book and read a page or we just decide to give it a shot and give the first chapter a read then when were done we are hooked or not.
and give it a chance and watch the first 30 minutes on Toon Disney or Disney channel like I did and if that's too much at least read a summary for the movie or watch a trailer.
It is reasonably entertaining, if you can get past the first 15 minutes.
The story is very well crafted including homage to just about everything from the first.
Though my child (again, she's 3) was a bit scared at first, she was excited by it, and Cinderella's comment at the end of the scene made both she and I laugh out loud together.
Still this the first sequel i was actually rating from awful to great.
When I first found out that they were making another movie and what was going to happen in it I was a little upset because I didn't want the story to change and I didn't want it to be turned around in a 360 degree turn, but I'm really glad what happened and it was a really good movie.
Lady Tremaine magically rewinds time to the moment when the Grand Duke shows up with the glass slipper in the first film.
Thus the first segment of II, starting right after Cinderella's honeymoon, has already happened in the beginning of Twist, but time is then rewound; the third segment with Anastasia and the Baker happens entirely after Twist; and the second segment, which was the stupid little story about the mice, is completely irrelevant.
Most of the sequels and "final chapters" never have the chance to hold their own and try to be at least as good as the first, but this movie does it.
We see the Stepmother turn more wicked than she was in the first film after she gets the wand.
although when you kids see this and also the first sequel (cinderlla 2 dreams come true) they will learn that something might happen to their magical person and that when you sit around doing nothing you wont get anything near of what you want (ofcoarse friends would also be helpful) also in both sequels Cinderella is much more independent and you learn a lot more about the other characters like the princes mother and the kings past and the stepmother is countless times more evil.
I was excited to see this movie when I first heard about it.
They give personality to each character that was lacking in the first movie.
The prince actually wasn't a smiling idiot, the step-sisters were the evil-step sisters but had more spunk, and the evil step-mother was just as wicked and ambitious for her daughters as the first.
Furthermore the plot is far superior to the first.
Step-mother gets hold of the Fairy Godmother's wand and turns back time to the shoe fitting scene from the first film.
Although what follows seems a bit hokey when describing it (The magic of the wand is not as powerful as Cinderella and the prince's predestined love) it is handled maturely and time is given for the couple to get to know each other a bit more (in the first film they had said, what, four words) before getting married.
Personally, I can't get enough of "More Than a Dream," Cinderella's balled that sucked me into the story and told me that we'd be dealing with a much more pro-active Cinderella than ever before (somehow I cant' imagine the Cinderella from the first film singing "There's a better life that's waiting past the mountains I must climb.
Cher puts on an extraordinary performance, as usual, and proves that she can act, this being her first film.
Read the book first and you will enjoy the movie more.
In fact my only real problem was that, on first watching, I sometimes found it difficult to distinguish between Meryl Streep and Cher.
The all star cast delivers all star performances in this first rate drama.
I'm bringing attention to this film because movies get lost very quickly these days, and this is a great one with first rate performances all around, including Cher and Kurt Russell.
For instance, the first 30 minutes of the movie spend way too long dealing with Karen's relationship with her three children, who are now in the custody of her ex-husband, but never appear in the movie after that.
Along with the obligatory Streep nomination (she lost to Shirley MacLaine in Terms of Endearment), Cher also received her first nomination.
Woolf is pretty much the only film of his that holds up today, and he's made a ton of stinkers in his career (first and foremost being What Planet Are You From?
When I first saw this film a year ago, I thoroughly enjoyed it.
When I first saw the film, I was very upset but also intrigued.
The first half of the film, which concentrates as much on Karen's tangled personal life as on the main theme of nuclear safety, can seem particularly slow.
Don't fast forward the first hour - really pay attention and see how much you learn from the small details that will enrich your viewing of this film.
Being the third in the Metroid series, "Super Metroid" takes everything that was ever great from the first two "Metroid" and "Metroid II: The Return of Samus" and makes everything better.
I turned the movie off and I suspect I'm not the first doing so.
I am only familiar with her from her first rate performance in Moll Flanders.
I've loved this movie since its first airing back in 1980.
My favourite Hammer film is the first version of 'I, The Jury' which benefits from some superb noir imagery.
I first saw it back in the eighties when I was about 8 or 9 years old.
This show, when first seen was bright, fresh and most importantly funny.
In the morning paper, I read about some new movie for the first time ever.
If you're a musician, and especially if your first instrument was a hand-me-down, you might appreciate the peculiar tendency of a musical instrument to absorb and even accumulate the human soul, and find its way into the most appropriate hands.
The theme of the movie, first hummed by the violin-maker's wife, becomes the voice of the violin, linking the human soul with that of the violin.
This movie is of a flashback to history "genre", but I think it is the first I have seen which runs on three time lines.
I watched it first without the subtitles and was so taken by the movie, I watched it a second time with the titles and realized I had missed very little.
When you learn how the violin acquired its captivating shade of red you will most likely be stunned at first, but then touched by the thought behind it and the bittersweetness of the moment.
When many first see this film, they will be surprised when they notice that it is a silent film even though made in 1931.
I thing channel 7 screened it in the first place.
Well, "hero", you've actually magnified the problem, because if the "audience" didn't happen to catch it the first time, you went ahead and spelled it out for them immediately afterwards.
But first, he must find the requisite funny "sidekick" (he chooses young, black Antoine, whom Blake likes immediately despite his fear of the cliche their relationship creates).
It's a first.
For the first few minutes, I thought, "This is going to be a bit lame.
Richie havens, Joan Baez,country Joe and the fish, and ten years after Alvin lee were great, all the footage made great documentary of the first and only real rock concert.
when the movie was first released, I saw Woodstock in a theater with my great uncle.
As I have seen this many times since it first came out on in the theater and then on VHS, I now just fast-forward chapters on the DVD to the music, enjoying my favorite performances in this epic documentary of the most famous rock concert of all time.
I also took one star off because at first, the levels seem like they are long, but after you play them for a while, you start to get bored and you realize that the levels aren't that long.
This has to be one of the first films that has been able to make me laugh uncontrollably at some parts of the film and think and question the character of humanity in others.
What kind of people visit others without calling them first?
I have to admit that at first I was captured by Echo.
The original film, "Sigaw", was the first Filipino horror for a long time to be very atmospheric.
Followed his career since his first movie "Class" - lots of sex scenes in that movie!!!!!
When I wrote about this show for the first time, I did it after the pilot episode.
As I said for the first time, Candace Bushnell knows a lot about women and New York and that's why she has a lot to tell.
All of them has well designed personalities but none that we haven't seen before as the insecure and family troubled Wendy (Brook Shields), a movie producer that despite her insecureness she makes right decisions in her work but it's kind hard for her to tie work and family; the self confident but unhappy Nico (Kim Raver), a magazine editor who is moved by challenges and is tired to be ignored by a husband that never gives her the attention she deserves; and the lovely and believer Victory Ford, a fashion designer that wants to conquer the world in her own impulsive and sentimental ways and is dealing for the first time with the downs of her career.
I watched the first episode out of curiosity, but I really did not expect to like it.
But once the first episode was over I couldn't wait to watch the next one, and it's continued to be that way!
From the first episode I was a little impressed.
THIS is the first time i think this has been portrayed by a man in a sitcom, i mean in this honest way - a man, in the position a woman usually is/or was, after her kids grew up and shes there suddenly having no plans in life, being angry that she didn't foresee this day coming - because she didn't take time to work or achieve her personal goals, in order to take care the rest of the family.
I never intended to watch this show in the first place because I thought the name of the show was ridiculous and I don't particularly like Brooke Shields.
My friends have talked about this show since it was on, but I figured since i missed the first season it would be hard to get into it, but I was wrong.
I also noticed that several times they left a door open at night and a light was seen, Other than these two items, I must praise all involved with Foyle's for making not only a first class murder mystery but such interesting background into the war.I read somewhere that they hopes the show would go on till at V Day.
I highly recommend this show and would urge viewers to watch the series sequentially, starting, of course with the first episode.
In Series 2 and 3 Foyle appears as a more self-confident man, and therefore I prefer by a small margin the first series, where he seems less sure of himself and less ready to brook authority.
Pontecorvo's first feature is an emotionally powerful film, driven by his usual, but earnest political and sociological motivations.
Apart from its classic murder sequences (particularly the first with its bloody pay-off), this one has an original, audacious structure (criticized at the time because it was not understood) with the narrative following minor characters every once in a while and veering off into seemingly unrelated subplots - a half-century prior to Tarantino's would-be seminal PULP FICTION (1994), but also Luis Bunuel's THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY (1974)!!
i really would love to see this movie again.i would like to see if the movie is as scary as when i first saw it.
The problem was I didn't particularly feel any sympathy for any of the characters (well, only the first victim) and the film's final revelation is rather flimsy and truly unfulfilling.
The first death scene is a perfect example.
The very first scene in the film has the cat loose means that there's plenty of opportunity for attacks spread throughout, and there's something for the film to go for in terms of action.
The first confrontation is it's best overall scene, as it's inside an exceptionally creepy location with some great action scenes and a fantastic conclusion that is far ahead of the types of attacks generally shown at the time and becoming quite violent and brutal.
The death of the first girl, Teresa, is the most obvious example.
The stars are kind of weak and the script isn't as good as the first couple of Lewton Bs, but there is moody photography and a few scenes of real suspense.
Pontecorvo's first feature is an emotionally powerful film, driven by his usual, but earnest political and sociological motivations.
I first saw this movie in the mid '90s, was not that impressed, but gave it another look when I acquired the Lewton set.
On the first night of Kiki's act with the big cat the leopard gets startled by an angry Clo Clo who put her hand-clickers almost in it's face.
Even though "Leopard Man" touched upon a lot of psychological aspects of the human, as well as animal, mind it pre-dates the movie "Spellbound" which many consider the first major Hollywood film about the subject by two years.
The first concerns a young girl forced by her mother to buy cornmeal in the middle of the night.
For the movie, the two filmmakers re-cast the star of their first success, the big black leopard, in this movie, who once again plays a big black leopard.
Match 3: Jeff Jarrett vs X-Pac in a Hair vs Hair Match - The first good match of the night.
Watching the film is like being on amphetamines - the first half is hyper-frenetic and luridly self-congratulatory, but then the "come-down" happens.
Still the finale in the prison is very violent and shocking so the ride through the prison won't be an easy or pleasant one at all, and why would Ringo do such a pointless and light film that wouldn't have its message and anything to say in the first place?
The idea of rat creatures at first doesn't seem that scary, but they do SO well with these.
I thought the first quarter of the film was moving a bit slow but, boy, did it ever make up for it.
The first half hour establishes the protagonists, which are all a nice mix of "real" New Yorkers who are under threat of eviction.
This is my first review on IMDb as a side-note.
The first time I saw the show, it was just for fun - to see just how bad it was going to be.
A feeling of dread infects the first third of the movie; dark figures shamble around alleyways as the characters walk past, a man sits silently in Kay's bar sweating and acting strangely, rats scurry around nearby gutters and televisions begin reporting strange events.
It was very Indie-looking from the beginning, with gritty film stock and no-name actors, but after worrying for the first few minutes that this could mean "cheesy", I realized that the film felt authentic instead.
I really haven't been this freaked out by a movie since The Shining (albeit I only first saw The Shining only a couple years ago, but still...)   Not to say there weren't some parts that could've been better.
It's a little jarring and annoying the first time it's used, but you get used to it.
Clutch, a retired boxer, nervously awaits the homecoming of his soldier daughter, but first he has to protect the other tenants as the rat-zombies are quickly infesting the entire neighborhood.
At first I had difficulty deciding if this was a comedy or drama.
A few years ago, a man named William Ryan directed his first and only film to date, called "Reach the rock".
At first I wanted to see this film because Alessandro Nivola was in it.
I can say from experience that the first segment of the film, "Fiction", is a rather accurate view of a college creative writing class.
The first story "fiction" is by far the worst of the two.
If this was a first time director then I would expect this type of result....but it isn't.
In the first story, "Fiction," Solondz shines an interpretive light a creative writing class.
The first half hour, "Fiction," is devoted to a story of a college student, Vi, who is tired of "dating the undergraduates" and ends up a violent and racially charged sex scene with her African American creative writing professor.
However, the brilliant last hour, "Nonfiction," more than makes up for the first half.
But, because of the ho-hum first hour (yes, ho-hum, even with "that scene" and all), all the pieces don't quite fall together.
Storytelling is worth seeing for the great acting (in both "Fiction" and "Nonfiction") and the excellent second section, but you can clip your toenails or stare out the window for the most part during the first half hour.
The first one, fiction, involves an interracial relationship between a student and her college professor.
The second story is where all the meat is and the first was pretty good too.
I have seen this movie twice now, and I'm wondering what is up with that large orange block in the first story?
"Storytelling" has two parts, and while both are very good, it is somewhat of a pity that the first story was so brief.
Side note: I had to watch "Fiction" twice, as I failed to see its correlation to "Nonfiction" when I watched it the first time.
Even though people tend to criticise the first, short part, it is quite interesting.
I actually thought it added to the message of the first story, and the uncensored version is also on the DVD anyway.
At first viewing I though this was the weakest of director Todd Solondz films, however like all of his works, it's impossible to forget once seen.
Our first story deals with sex, political correctness, race, and fiction writing, as a young liberal college girl has unpleasant and ironic sexual experience with her Black writing professor.
The first story deals with a young lady who has enrolled in a writing class with her handicapped boyfriend.
If Solandz would have just pulled one character from the first story and show a glimpse of them in the second, I would have found the movie a lot smoother around the edges.
It is not surprising that the first part (fiction) seems to be more non-fiction than part 2 (non-fiction).
The first part is the very raw and painful story about a young girl who is raped by her literature teacher.
As many other viewers, I didn't care much for the first half(well, part... it's a third of the projects full length, with a running time of about 25 minutes), "Fiction".
I will say that my rating would almost certainly have been higher had the first part been improved upon... or removed entirely.
The first part, titled Fiction, focuses on a creative writing student Vi (Selma Blair), her Cerebral Palsy-stricken boyfriend Marcus (Leo Fitzpatrick) and their professor Mr. Scott (Robert Wisdom).
The second PPV title match for these two, the first with Austin defending.
The first book in the series of four books is obviously a set up and the movie acts like this too, which is unfortunate.
She's one of the better young actress out there and shines this bright light at us that we fall in love with her the first second we laid eyes on her.
The first one I thought of was Arthur C Clarke's haunting novel Against the Fall of Night.
This may be a film that succeeds in capturing the magic of the family film glory days of the 80's, (it took me right back to when I was ten years old and for the first time in years allowed me to become totally engrossed in the world that was portrayed before me) this does not mean you have to stay true to the 80's in your marketing campaign !!!
At first blush, City of Ember seems like it would be a thrilling sci-fi adventure, a page out of Jules Verne's playbook, but ultimately it fails to completely scale the dizzying heights of its creative premise.
That means approximately nine generations after the ones who first lived there, and in often there are three generations alive at any given time.
But apparently the first generationers vowed never to speak of their upper lives again, or something.
At first she minded me a bit of Peggy Ann Garner in "A Tree Grows In Brooklyn," but maybe two years older.
My first impression going in to see "Brokeback Mountain" when that one came out, was; "How boringly common gay love seem to be".
This film which purports to chronicle the childhood of the Babe is almost entirely a fabrication....he didn't grow up in some small town....he grew up near the waterfront docks of Baltimore,MD for the first few years of his life where his father owned and ran a saloon that catered to a very rough crowd.Young George was largely unsupervised most of the time and was continually getting into one scrape or another...as a result George Sr had him enrolled in the St. Mary's Industrial School for boys and pretty much stayed out of young George's life from then on...I'm sure this film's version made for better publicity for the up and coming Babe as well as for the Yankees...Colonel Ruppert was very mindful of his team's public image and making a film about the real version of Babe's young life at that time would have had a lot of negative consequences
I had been aware of the  antics of the Three Stooges, Laurel and Hardy and Abbott and  Costello, but now I could see first hand the live slapstick of  involved comedy.
I had been aware of the  antics of the Three Stooges, Laurel and Hardy and Abbott and  Costello, but now I could see first hand the live slapstick of  involved comedy.
However, things gradually become more complicated, as Tommy and Shelly (Cordellini), the daughter of Dr. Hunter, meet and become fond of each other; moreover, Tommy's case is not as simple as it first seemed...
The actors were magnificant, Andy Garcia in his best role yet and Vincent Kartheisser, oh my God, he gave me the creeps, I think it was his first major role.
Hesitant at first Michael agrees to talk to Tommy who's about to be released since he's doing so well, psychology and is about to reach his 18th birthday,at the school.
The ending of the movie "The Unsaid" is a bit confusing at first with Tommy going wild in his effort to get out of the Holly Health School and almost murdering his psychologist Dr. Wagner and then taking Shelly hostage in the process.
John Turturro (the reason I started watching the film in the first place) plays Benjamin a character facing death attempting to make the best of it.
Young Wong Chia Chi (the luminous Wei Tang in her first cinematic role) is asked to join the theatrical group and she consents primarily because of her attraction to the leader of the group, Kuang Yu Min (Lee-Hom Wang, a commanding and handsome actor).
In China's repressed sexual climate, the relationship between Kuang and Wong - for, of course, from the first he loves this dazzling girl Â is a sub-plot that stirs in a real sense of pathos.
The first is a travelog that was shot somewhere south of the US border.
Jiazhi devoted herself into the love of Mr. Yee that she chose Yee rather than her first love and let Yee ended her life (she could have taken her pill).
She had the chance to kill Yee while having sex with him but she didn't and she refused to kiss her first love, Kuang.
Based on the late Chinese-American writer Eileen Chang's short story of the same name, the focus of "Se, jie" is the relationship between Mr. Yee, head of the ruthless Japanese-collaborator security forces (played by Tony Leung, leading man of some 80 films) and a young actress with the resistance, played by Wei Tang, in her very first film role.
Here, for the first time, he plays not just a heavy, an ugly character, but a scary, unhappy, murderous man, literally a dark figure, lurking in the shadows.
I had been hyping myself up a great deal for Lust, Caution ever since I first heard of the project, so I'm glad to say that it did not disappoint.
Because of the nature of the film's protagonist Wang Jiazhi (played by a newcomer named Tang Wei - not shabby for your first feature) as an agent working under a second identity to ensnare a dangerous collaborationist (Tony Leung), all the scenes where Wang masquerades as the bourgeois Ms. Mai are fraught with a psychological tension, doubling with the political agenda at stake as well as her womanhood.
And their rawness shows in the way they clumsily set up their traps for the coming of the prey, and fumbling even with their first blood.
All we know about Yee, is that he's a Chinese traitor in the employment of the Japanese, while enjoying immense power under the protection of his master, readily bolts like a running dog that he is in the first signs of trouble.
For the first time, I didn't feel a diamond ring is so superficial like in the TV commercials.
were all first rate.
The first one, Punch and Judy, is about a puppeteer with seemingly lifelike puppets.
The first section deals with a Punch & Judy puppeteer who has to deal with his nagging wife and disobedient son.
I would definitely recommend this for the first two segments, which are quite well done.
The first story wasn't very original but it was fun none the less.
By the first song, I was loving it.
I love that UNLIKE movies like "Snow White" and "Sleeping Beauty," the main characters in this movie don't fall in love by first glance.
A while later (I can't remember exactly when), I saw it on the small screen for the first time, and while I don't think I ever liked it as much as Disney's "Aladdin", it was enjoyable enough for me to watch several more times.
You see, "Beauty and the Beast" is the very first Disney cartoon to use computer animation techniques, notably the backgrounds.
When I first saw Beauty and the Beast, I fell in love with it.
The first and possibly last animated movie to be nominated for best picture, and it should have won.
I first saw Beauty and the Beast when I was a little girl, around the time that I watched the other Disney classics.
So impressive is this film that it was the first cartoon movie ever to receive a Best Picture Oscar nomination, an award it conceivably might have won had it not been up against the mighty Silence Of The Lambs in the same year.
Prior to this film's completion, Rescuers Down Under had enjoyed the distinction of being the first full length animated feature in CGI.
So, first point for the movie: it's French.
A beautifully rendered and realized film that successfully transcends it's genre, it is the first animated feature ever to be recognized and rewarded with an Oscar nomination for Best Movie (quite a feat in itself, as it received the nod over such films as `The Fisher King,' `Fried Green Tomatoes,' `Thelma and Louise' and John Singleton's `Boyz N the Hood' that year).
I remember the first time I saw B&tB so vividly; I was completely enthralled by the movie that all I could do on the way home was smile and cry.
The first time is most magical.
The first animated film to ever be nominated for best picture and after you see it, you could understand and agree with it's nomination.
This was actually the first movie that I ever cried in, the ending was just so beautiful and heart felt, you'll have to see what I mean.
His childhood friend is Frey, who also happens to be his first real love, although she doesn't know exactly how much he loves her--at least not at first.
That first hour doesn't add anything decisive to the story nor explores characters in a fascinating way.
The first victim looked hot in her black bra and panty, who needed that robe?
This movie looked liked a drama at first, but when I watched some more, it was much more interesting.
She's a pretty good actress, too, especially considering that this is one of her first roles.
I actually saw this movie when it first came out when I was just eleven years old.
they were the first and couldn't get over personal differences and opinions.
The first half- the Twickenham rehearsals, which drove George Harrison to temporarily leave the band- will only leave you wonder, "Why were they even bothering?"
I saw this movie when it first was released.
I saw this movie for the first time only a few days ago.
The first,filmed at Twickenham Studios finds them rehearsing songs,getting in some heated debates,all the time with Paul McCartney trying to be boss of the band (at least in front of the camera).
As a life-long Beatles fan don't expect objectivity here - I first saw this in the early 70's and found it riveting Â and got the same feeling tonight.
John, Paul, George and Ringo got together first in Twickenham Studios then in the Apple basement in January 1969 to rehearse some new songs with the assistance of almost-5th Beatle Billy Preston (and occasionally actual-5th Beatle George Martin) and with the hope of playing live again sometime soon.
The Rolling Stone review of the film from 9th July 1970 that I remember so well was typically over-reverential but had some telling points Â the first being how deliberately grainy the photography was which still can take some getting used to and that there was over 800 hours of footage from 4 cameras to edit down to the brief 80 minutes we got.
At last but not the least, Ringo Starr is shown for the first time ever playing a song - Octopus's Garden - that would later take part of Abbey Road - the LP that marked the end of the Fab Four as a group, but the begining of the Beatles as an universal legend.
I watched this Beatles documentary for the first time when it was released for the second time in the Spanish theaters in 1980.
British actress Susan Hampshire plays 'Althea Hall', making her first and only trip to New York as she is suffering from a brain tumour.
Although the setup was a bit clunky at first, this movie ended up grabbing me by the gonads and did not let go until the very end.
This wolrd is shaken up by the arrival of Johnny Black, the first person to arrive on the screen who actually knows what he wants.
Through the first half I found myself droning along with a bunch of perfect skin, conditioned hair Sh*ts fresh out of a teen hunk magazine, supposedly living in a punk squat.
When I first heard that, I was shocked and I wondered, "What does this film think it is?"
I first saw this movie on HBO as a child.
First things first: I know the anarchist cookbook.
Okay, so I only watched the first nine minutes while making something to eat - but it did the trick; I turned it off.
Please, even the first house party scene was a complete remake of SLC.
Genre-star Maurizio Merli stars in the role of Comissario Betti for the third time (the first two Commissario Betti films were Marino Girolami's "Roma Violenta" of 1975 and "Italia A Mano Armata" of 1976, two priorities on my list of films that I haven't seen yet).
Umberto Lenzi's "Napoli Violenta" is a first class cop movie that really shocked me.It's exciting and really memorable with some nasty bits of violence(including a fence post impalement and bowling ball facial).Maurizio Merli is great as a veteran cop named Betti.He sets out to clean up a protection racket run by the Commandant(Barry Sullivan).Along the way,Betti befriends a little boy whose father is murdered by the criminals.Since Merli passed away in 1989,"Violent Protection" attained almost a cult status in some places.There are some great car chases and plenty of exciting gun-play.So if you're a fan of Italian crime genre give this one a look.Highly recommended.
The first few are usually policy oriented, the next one or two is about the politics and the number one is a Keith Olbermann written special comment or a puff story on celebrities or something very stupid.
Olbermann makes his show into fun satire and moments of levity following the first half just the typical lot (though an interesting lot usually) of talking heads, with his "Best Person" and "Worst Person" listing, Oddball moments (videos of crazy Santa's or deer jumping over a car as it's driving, among many, many, many other classic bits that most often would be left in the dregs of you-tube).
I first learned about "Countdown w/Keith Olbermann" when I read a transcript of Keith Olbermann's special comment "Liar in Chief...the president who makes things up", identifying that George W. Bush had claimed that Democrats had made certain claims (which of course they'd never actually made).
I said in my IMDb review of "Ed Wood" that it was the first R-rated movie that I'd ever seen in the theaters.
I remembered a few months later that "Serial Mom" was the first R-rated movie that I'd seen in the theaters (followed by "Backbeat", and then "Ed Wood").
I first took notice of Olbermann from his well articulated clips from youtube.com.
Doris as the tomboy first baseman hasn't quite discovered men yet, that is until she almost shoots Gordon MacRae.
This is the first of two movies about the same characters.
At first, I had a problem with the leads, who seemed too old, playing teenagers.
I mean...when I first saw this movie, I didn't wanna see it, there was nothing else on t.v., constantly zapped out of this prehistoric black&white film, tennis on 2nd channel, rubbish on Tele-5, so I finally landed on this "AhÃ­ estÃ¡ el Detalle" again, it was just beginning...I had a laugh, then one more, laughs got into outbursts of uncontrollable laughter, decided to turn on de VCR and recorded it almost wholly, I had to see it three times to get it all in (Mr. Mario Moreno talks so fast you have to listen twice) .It's the only one I liked by Cantinflas but the best comic movie I've ever seen in my life.
This is one of his first films and, in my humble opinion, his best.
I still think of this, one of his first movies, as his best.
Simultaneously, it ties in the first "Sheik" AND this story; Rudy has to reinvent the first character - very clever.
Give me a time tunnel and the 50's wouldn't be the first number I dial up.
The first thing one needs to know is if certain members of the Valiant cast are playing it for laughs?, or, as I suspect, they are badly hamming for all they are worth.
It isn't that this film is terrible (it isn't), but there just are a lot better and more entertaining films out there to see first.
Since the first time I ever watched LYC it has remained very special in my memory, so much so that since the recent re-run on UK TV I have come to write my first ever review regarding viewing or reading material.
'I've been doing nothing else since we first met.'
LOYC has a terrific cast, first and foremost, which was essential (as so often) to be able to pull off this kind of script.
The musical sequences may appear strange at first, but once one gets accustomed to them, they actually give us a nice distraction from some of the tension that goes on.
At first, you might think he's a director who happens to own a CGI company.
However, what they didn't include in this movie (which in my opinion the first war of the worlds used better technology and special effects) was good actors, a good script, emotion, half the time it looked like the lady was smiling when she was obviously supposed to be doing the opposite.
Everything is done in a style that's not even remotely naturalistic but which somehow manages to convey some real insight into human behavior Â it reminds me of the old saying "Live in the skin you're in" and there's a sign on the window of the bar that's the first thing we see in the film that expresses much the same sentiment.
Both O'Neill and Saroyan were middlebrow; but while the first was experimental, _avantÂ_guarde, Saroyan was popular and plain, so they're not really alike.
For about the first half, one is engaged by the variety of characters coming before us, and the "slice of life" ruminations and quasi-philosophical discourses.
The first meant doing whatever the studio said, and the second meant that what the studio told him was to play the racketeer personality that had sold "Public Enemy" in film after film.
It says a lot about James Cagney that this is the first film his production company choose to produce.
After directing his first movie in the U.S., "The Dead Zone" in 1983, Cronenberg was chosen to direct his first big budget project in the U.S.: the remake of the classic movie "The Fly".
While in the original movie the doctor turned himself into a giant fly, in Cronenberg's movie Seth Brundle doesn't change instantly, his mutation is progressive, at first not apparent but later he becomes a new creature, something that has never existed before, as Brundle describes himself, he becomes "the offspring of man and fly".
This was my first look at a David Cronenburg film.
I watched it when it was first televised in 1993 and watched at all again recently.
A typical Cronebergian gem, with more layers, meanings and elements in it then you would see at first sight.
All three major performances (John Getz does a good job as Veronica's former boyfriend and current editor; he comes off as a jerk at first, but eventually moves into sympathetic mode and even heroic mode at the end) are very entertaining.
This question, I think, could well be the definitive mark of really effective horror, and it was certainly in the back of my mind nearly all of last night as I was watching David Cronenberg's "The Fly" for the first time.
With both these thoughts in mind, I suspect that "The Fly" could well be the second best horror film of all time (behind Kubrick's "The Shining", which, I admit, got to first place by completely different criteria.
When he shows his invention to romantic interest Veronica (Geena Davis), it is not quite ready to handle living tissue (demonstrated on screen in the first instance of quite confronting gore), but as the two grow a relationship and fall in love, the wrinkles in the technology are ironed out and so Brundle takes one small step for man and tests the machine on himself.
Everything seems fine at first, until a cut he got earlier starts to have tough hair Ronnie notices.
When it seems that Seth is first frightened of what the results will be, he starts to embrace it with his amazing strength and ability to crawl on the walls and wants to become Brendal Fly!
The ending is stunning, almost leaving the first time viewer in shock.
I remeber seeing this film for the first time when I was five years old and telling my friends about the gore scenes but as I got older and viewed the film again I realzied how much of a tragic love story the film was.
I just saw this movie last night for the first time and taped it off of TCM as part of the Errol Flynn festival for April, and am I glad I did!
I just saw this movie last night for the first time, and I thought this was a very funny movie.
In the first twenty minutes, there is really nothing to distinguish it as a "horror" movie, more as a kind of suspense thriller.
As the first victim succumbs to a mysterious illness and then his wife apparently dies of the same the general's mind becomes affected by the old ways and he falls prey to imagination.
The characters are superb (this was the first thing I ever saw Ewan McGregor in) and the situations genuine.
Working from a script from Ardel Wray that was inspired by Arnold BÃ¶cklin's painting of the same name, this was the fourth of five pictures Robson directed for Lewton, and the first of three pictures that Karloff made with the talented producer.
As absorbing (and as unique) as its predecessors, ISLE OF THE DEAD belongs among the first rank of fright films.
I first saw this movie on late night BBC (I was living in England at the time) a couple of years ago.
This movie isn't worth renting, I rented it when it first came out on DVD what a waste of 4.50 this movie is someones idea of a sick joke.
I watched this show when it was first released on television, more than ten years ago, and loved it, and after a recent viewing, found the show had not lost any of it's edge!
When I first saw the ad for this, I was like 'Oh here we go.
The first ten minutes starts out OK, and the movie has potential at this time.
William Powell, less than month before his first appearance as wealthy gumshoe Nick Charles in "The Thin Man," is the uncorruptible Manhattan DA who saved Gable's life when they were kids.
And Myrna Loy, less than a month before she first appeared as wealthy gumshoe-ette Nora Charles, is the Woman Who Loves Them Both.
The first, and most obvious, was the prevalence of criminals like Al Capone and John Dillinger, who were glorified by the national media.
Van Dyke (director of the first four 'Thin Man' films), whose decidedly non-gritty aesthetic style at first seems at odds with the required mood.
Firstly, Hollywood was now working, for the first time, under the active supervision of the Production Code Administration.
From the moment they first look at each other in this first film together, a unique screen magic was born, and lasted through 14 films.
In the first scenes of the film, we see that they are orphaned and taken in by a man who has lost his son in the same fire that killed the boys' friends and family.
Recommended, but please don't judge it by the first 20 minutes which are rather slow-moving, but still entertaining.
I saw this movie first in the early 90's when I was a kid and watched it again yesterday, 10+ years later.
:)  The first part of the story reminded me of Harry Potter and the second of Lord of the Rings, however it solid on it's own and has enough unique features, so you wouldn't be bored.
When I watched ''Mio min Mio'' for the first time, I was a kid with 7 years old.
I first saw this film when my mother bought it on VHS in a store...
I loved it from the moment I first watched it, and even now, at nineteen, it's still one of my favorite movies.
As a 40 year-old man, childrens fantasy films usually aren't my first (or even second) choice of movies.
At first, seeing that this film is on Sundance's ASIA EXTREME-I could've sworn it would be horror rather than a disturbing drama.
This is my first time watched movie directed by Kim Ki-Duk.
I hated it for the first 30 minutes..
That is what made you attractive in the first place; do not forget it."
I won't profess to be articulate writing comments about movies (in fact this is my first one on this site), but I found this film wholly unsatisfying and disappointing to watch.
The first 20 minutes or so actually promised a lot and I was intrigued.
The central protagonist had a peculiar lack of lines and the college girls venomous retort after his first unwanted advance made you wonder who was really the bad guy.
But I say "Don't ever say never... because the first rule you will break will be your own"...
Which I didn't notice until the 3rd time in a row when I had first watched the film.
The lives of these people even when violent or mundane and self destructive are very easy to comprehend.It is the first film I have seen by this director and it will definitely not be the last.
The answer comes later in the film when we do hear him speak for the first time.
The thug spends his first night with his love, an unconsummated encounter after which she sleeps on the floor beside him.
This type of criminal(or gang-star)films have been made from 1920s, at first,probably in America, then everywhere in the world.
As for style,plenty of video-effects simply make the film like serial of music clips with no serious contents, or some kind of parody of gangster films.If one wants to show drama,tell some story,then he must select only minimum needed effects which will not irritate viewers.The first half of the film is especially bad,the second half is better(less effects), but even this fact is only an another evidence of inconsistency.
I was quite confused myself the first half an hour but later everything came clear.
Ever since the holiday special "A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving",first aired on CBS-TV in November of 1973,this was one of many "Peanuts" inspired specials that brings out the kid in all of us,but at the same time have a message in between the lines.
If not to mention the first four installments of the classic "Charlie Brown" theatrical features as well,which sometimes CBS would show on special holidays which included the first-ever 1969 feature,"A Boy Named Charlie Brown",then in 1972,with "Snoopy Come Home",and from there with "Race For Your Life,Charlie Brown",in 1977,and finally the last theatrical installment "Bon Voyage,Charlie Brown,And Don't Come Back",which was released in 1980.
I remember seeing this special for the first time back in the early 1970's,when I was small,but today I get a kick out of enjoying every minute of it when it comes on.
His first dinner could be for his friends, the second could be at his Grandma's.
Maybe it's because this was the first time I ever saw Kate Beckinsale, and I was just stunned.
Maybe that's not quite the right description but it's the first thing that came to mind while watching it.
As the grimy first five minutes of the film rolled by, served with Tadanobu Asano's ever ethereal facial expressions, my mind automatically started processing and investigating the odd display of family oriented affection between a man and a woman.
Five separate faiths are suddenly connected by a murderer, each in its own way, all the stories which are not connected at the first glance suddenly make sense.
The best analogy that I can think of is a bit like the first time I ever went into a sushi bar.
The first thing that struck me was the brightness & colour of the film.
This movie is absurdingly complicated in a first viewing, yet it delivers with, yes, absolute style.
All that, and I'm only describing the first half hour or so...
Really, there is no movie I can adequately compare with SURVIVE STYLE 5+ because it seems like the first film of an entirely new genre.
As first glance, "Survival Style 5+" would seem a totally bizarre film-going experience.
The wife is not able to please the man with her cooking at first because she is feeding him what she wants to feed him, not what he wants to eat.
At first, the man is repeatedly killing his wife because he is a killer and that's what he is supposed to do.
But this was the first time I saw and heard the great man.
This tenth Bobby Jones short feature is the first one in this series I've seen and I was pleasantly surprised.
When you see the movie remember the very first scene.
At first the Champ is unpersuaded.
He is comic as the street-wise kid meeting his half-sister for the first time - "The dame is goofy" he remarks.
When I first saw this movie it was my first look at either Wallace Beery or Jackie Cooper.
I suppose to fully appreciate Amelie, one would first have to appreciate the work of Jean-Pierre Jeunet.
Finally at the end they meet and the first thing they do without saying a word is kiss and have sex.
with watching the film numerous times i have now picked up on the camera work and the magnificent colours, with noticing in the first time i watch Amelie the fantastic camera work and special effect which bring the film to life and help tell the story with out the translation, the camera work has defiantly made up for the storyline in Amelie and you notice something every time you watch the film.the colours also help the film and always give your eyes something to notice.
Amelie's first sexual encounter, the orgasms, the object of her affection working in a porn shop with a stripper and putting price tags on didoes.
I slowly began to realize as I watched Amelie skip stones in the canal that for the very first time, a film deserved all of hype it had been accorded and more, and I felt so blessed to be a part of this revelation.
It was just so refreshing to watch a movie where your imagination was free to soar rather than feel confused by the apparent deja vu from last year's first installment of the same pointless drivel.
`Amelie' is the first film where I adored the subtitles and in fact, had a nagging urge to go out and learn French that is still with me today.
Later on, she catches a man groping for lost photos under a photo booth (Nino Quincampoix, played by Mathieu Kassovitz), and it's love at first sight.
At first, this movie seemed like your typical Playboy film.
Two sex scenes within the first 20 minutes, woo!
I had the great joy of watching David Lean's MADELEINE(1950)for the first time ever on TCM early this morning, and can say without any reservations that though it is one of the great director's lesser-known works, but it is by no means lesser in either acting or direction.
There are some fairly routine examples of this in the first half of the film Â eerie shadows of Emile twirling his cane, the blaring bagpipe music of a village dance at Emile and Madeleine's secret meeting, and so on.
All the psychological set-up of the first forty-five minutes becomes forgotten.
My main criticism of the film is that virtually nothing is told of how Madeleine managed to meet her lover in the first place.
Some accounts I've read indicated that they first met in a Glasgow park.
Worst of all is that where as the first two had the coolness appeal of Lee Marvin,Robert Forster, Martin Balsam,Robert Vaugn, John P.Ryan, Billy Drago,Richard Jaeckel and (maybe) Chuck Norris, Delta Force 3's biggest name is Nick Cassavetes.
The first trivium is that silent-film star Louise Brooks appears in this film as a chorus girl.
Riskin does a respectable job for a first time director, but displays a poor sense of pace and allows the picture to become plodding.
His surprise when he first sees the couple in an embrace, and his look of both great disdain and knowing when he later sees the prince flirting with a servant girl says it all.
When Stone finally catches on, he manipulates the Prince into accompanying him on a moonlit tiger hunt, but first empties the Prince's gun of bullets.
Garbo is most alluring and gives a first rate performance.
The film's first rate production values make the heat & hedonism of Java come alive for the viewer.
Young Mr Morgan will be an actor to watch for many years, This is not his first film BUT the reason is obvious why he got this plum role/ HE WILL BE A STAR.
The supporting cast is likewise first class and the musical score by Claire Campbell, Alex Neville, and Brian Petway fits the film like a glove.
Having greatly anticipating seeing this film since I'd first heard about it over a year ago, and knowing a bit about the story as well as the cast and crew, my expectations were admittedly a bit higher than usual.
This was my first film here at Woodstock and it got me good.
It is on this canvas that writer/director James Ponsoldt, in his first feature, crafts a work of art that is simply one of the most poignant love stories imaginable.
I'd seen his work before (He was Ponsoldt's first choice, largely based on his performance in the indie classic "Mean Creek"), but he carries this film so confidently and easily that I left the theater shaking my head in wonderment.
However, the pacing does pick up after a draggy first hour, and the supporting players are interesting.
Including, Rita Hayworth's Alzheimer's and an actor who had a part for the first six weeks of filming.
There were one or two scenes that dragged bit - the first guy that was killed in the forest plus why didn't he say anything?
One of the great things about the internet having become a semi-official film distribution channel is it giving people the chance to view films they never otherwise would have had a chance to see, particularly first time film-makers and those trying to make a name for themselves.
With the constraints of first time film making, especially lack of experience, it is always good to focus on the positives in reviewing these films.
What puzzles me with LEM, given how much Mr Morwick got superbly right for a first film, is that it's actually quite silly things that let him down.
A lot of the local stuff that showed there was only so-so but this one really stood out for us - first of all there were tons of people waiting to get in to the screening dressed like the film's major characters (particularly Erin) which surprised us.
After the first murder, college student Peter Bloom (David Morwick) suspects a serial killer on the loose.
This was 20th Century Fox's first attempt to make a movie targeting the Latino community.
From this regard it is an important first step by Hollywood in acknowledging a growing trend in America.
Another reason to consider Ms. Velasquez a role model for teens and to applaud Fox for not offering up an over-sexed first attempt to draw in Latino crowds.
I remember when this movie first came out, it only lasted two weeks and it was directly sent to the dollar movies like a bullet.
Unlike French farce this Hispanic farce relies on a single device: man dates three women all discover this then fall over each other to first get him for themselves, then a subplot involving criminals, then strong women emerge.
My problems is this: a group of women watching this with pizza on a Friday night will enjoy the first 30 minutes and the last 15 but the bit in between just ain't entertainment.
I love this movie so much, and I laughed just as much when I'd seen it three times as after the first.
I admit that when I first heard of this movie starring Sofi'a , I wanted to see Sofi'a topless or in lace nightgowns..but that changed when I watched this movie..
i can't understand y this movie was even made in the first place.
Jaci Velasquez did a fair job, being this was her first film.
The film has no slow points, but does not rush things, the accompanying music is very good and acting first class.
the main thing that i want to talk about it : this the first Egyptian film that scanned to make the color grading and the visual effects on non linear systems ( like Hollywood movies ) , but we didn't see any color grading or great quality like we imagined ?
i know that many people will have the negative point of view from mine , and all the people here in Egypt saying : Wow what a great movie , what a huge budget , what a great cast that met for the first time ... but that's not the green card for the success of any film , we all watched a movie called ( Heat ) by Al Pacino & Robert De Niro and both of them are great great actors , but the movie was not as great as their names...anyway that's only my point of view ...thanks
This is the first Egyptian movie that has a very high propaganda by all advertising means as well as the first Egyptian movie that has been awarded in Tribeca Film Festival & participated in Berlinale & Cannes 2006 & still may be have a chance in the 2007 Oscars in the best foreign Film Category .
The first (Zaki) was previously known as a (Basha) a very well rich man before the Egyptian revolution & now he is a normal old citizen who has his teenage fantasies with many sexual relations with hookers & no job to do except avoiding his evil sister played by (Esad Younes) who kicked him out of his house & tries to send him to a psychyatric hospital at the end to vanquish him forever.
the movie is really so good and the director succeeded in making the movie although its his first movie.
Let me first say that it was an ambitious, well-acted film .
This is my first review so... thanks for reading
The story of the movie is in the first half of the 90's of the 20th century where different kinds of people who have different cultures and sorts of life, The main characters in the movie were: - Zaki El Dessouki (Adel Emam): A desperate old man descended from a former basha and a Tycon.
I know I've not said anything about the acting, nor the unmatched technical gifts of this movie...but they are what crown this magnificent achievement from the first delicate frame until it's bleak uncompromising ending...
this is his first movie and he was able to make me believe in him.
However I have to point out that Mohammad Imam's performance was somewhat shaky, but he overall gave an OK performance for his first movie.
Alaa el Aswani's first novel, Omaret Yacoubian, is published.
Yacoubian is his first full-length feature, but he helmed it like a veteran.
Anyway, he's still a newbie (this is his first film), so he'll probably give better performances in the future.
The first part of the concert has more upbeat songs, so it you want a 45-minute fast-moving mini-concert, the first nine songs will do well.
Since that first and only time of seeing this movie, I have had a desire to see it again -- as an adult.
As mad as he was when he first discovered Cotter/Murphy and his daughter together, I wonder what he would have done if he hadn't caught the newlyweds fully clothed in separate beds.
At first, this makes him a very successful hood (which feeds his ego) and so he takes another risk (feeding his ego) and another and another until he ultimately destroys himself due to his arrogance.
In his free time he masquerades as a cop--even going as far as converting his Ford LTD into a black & white police car--and "busts" prostitutes, offering to let them go in return for sexual favors and/or fulfilling his sadistic whims (the first victim is ordered to "crawl around in the mud like a dog!").
When he sets up the first scene as we see these "undead" monks chanting a rather harmonic tune, the wind ever present, you kind of get an idea that something within the atmosphere of this place in unstable.
Well, first things first...  Jess Franco tries, bless him, he really does, but unfortunately the man hasn't had an original thought in his life nor would he know an erotic scenario if it bit him in the arse!
Like most films by this director, MANSION OF THE LIVING DEAD is best watched first thing in the morning after the caffeine has just kicked in.
One assumes the part was created to afford a little feminine light relief, since the central character is -- inconveniently for the standard narrative curve -- already happily married as a young man when we first meet him, and omits to look elsewhere... At any rate, Niven-as-narrator is a charming scamp, and refreshingly the plot refrains from taking the obvious path of marrying him off to his 'snapdragon', R.J.Mitchell's formidable secretary Miss Harper.
If anything it is a biography of the Spitfire as much as of its designer, and the story effectively ends pre-war in 1938, with the commissioning of the first planes.
Also Geoffrey Crisp was not the test pilot of the very first Spitfire.
Summers became the chief test pilot for Vickers and was also the man who dropped the very first life size prototype of the bouncing bomb over Chesil Beach, Weymouth in 1943.
There is no finer epitaph to both of them, than 'The First of the Few', Mitchell as the genius aeroplane designer, and Howard as the first English actor (albeit of Hungarian parents) to make it big in Hollywood.
The hole linking the two apartments functions first as yet another in a long line of indignities, but soon begins to take on a significance of near-mythic proportions.
It is true that American Sign Language and French Sign Language are quite similar; this is because one of the first teachers of the deaf in the United States was a Frenchman, Laurent Clerc.
i first saw this movie over 5 years ago when i was working at walt Disney world.
after i first saw it i walked out of the theater in wonder... and the comments that i heard from others that saw it - they thought that it was just as good as i did!
It was her first film for the cinema and then it was nominated for the golden globe.
The parts of season 3 that I've seen were even better than the first two (on average).
Why not just blow up the WTC with bombs in the first place (with no planes crashing into them), and then claim it was a terrorist attack (of which they have proof)???
I rate it a 10 by how it affected me when I first saw it on television years ago, probably '78 or '79.
At first it sounds like a fantastic plan for a fictional movie, but people actually believes in it - almost like a religion.
Anyway, just keep flying that flag, salute your first in command, cook your sausages and enjoy the country that was peacefully inhabited by the soulful Indians many years ago.
The Bushes have at least eight years (Clinton's run) to plan their 'New Pearl Harbor' event, of which the first and biggest hurdle is getting their boy into office.
It was the first time he talked of the negative side of progress - the evil that results from some discoveries or inventions when they fall into the wrong hands.
But first they will wreck any boat that comes to the passage, and increase their ill-gotten gains.
I was at first intrigued by this documentary.
Also we heard from the media that there was 20.000 people in the building at the time of the collapse, or at least it was speculated within the first 24 after 9/11.
First things first.
The first, and definitely most important element to put in place is a clever script that blends the best of the prospective genres whilst shedding most of the worst.
The first of course was one of his most popular films 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea.
I did like this film very much both when first seeing it in the theater and now on VHS.
Decoys was a very weird film, in fact my first impression, before I read the back, was that it had something to do with monsters or aliens roaming a snow covered forest, kind of like a Windego themed movie, but I was wrong.
Also there's the fact that the director / screenwriter does not know who the real villains are (the aliens are shown as evil at first, but later come across as being sympathetic).
Upon first viewing of this movie, you may automatically think Species rip-off.
The first time I watched this movie it somehow slipped past me, but it actually seems to work quite well.
The plot follows the adventure of Luke (Corey Sevier), a young man in his first year in college, who just discovered that the two beautiful students he just met are actually murderous aliens who kill every guy they have sex with.
This is director Matthew Hastings' first feature and boy he did it notably well for a debut.
The film progresses at a torrid pace during the first half-hour without any character build-up that would have formed a bond with the audience.
It dragged on for the first hour, until Gwyneth was "ready" to have her baby, then you think the excitement might set in.
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie the first time I saw it ten years ago.
Strange the first time I saw them as a couple going into their loft in downtown NYC they looked like John Kennedy Jr and his wife.
The story might make a bit more sense if the kid remained the monstrous automaton we first meet.
Instead of the kid pretending to love America or creating trust with his new family, he immediately acts like the local chairman of the Hitler fan club--even showing up to his first meal dressed in full Hitler Youth regalia (including an armband).
Emil goes a bit too far when he first comes to deal with Leona, his Uncle Mike's fiancÃ©e, being Jewish as well as his determination to steal Mike's mail that he gets from the War Department.
In fact you could say everything that happened could have been foretold within the first half hour.
This is the first lighthouse type movie I have ever seen, and I think it will remain the best for a while (in my perspective!).
this series is stunning in every way..the story of Suh Jang Geum, the first woman to ever become the personal royal physician is a gripping story with more plot twists than a plate of spaghetti.
A girl that becomes a woman, a chef, a first female royal physician and a mother despite all hardships.
And into this idealized world enters Emil, a character that at first comes on ludicrously overplayed, and yet pulls you in just the same.
She was the first and last woman to gain an official title and be the King's principal physician.
i watched the first few episodes and got interested enough but a rival show got my attention more.
dae jang geum was the first (and possibly only) personal physician to the king.
Being 2006, I'm sure, I'm the last to find this "jewel" (sorry - could not resist) it did first come out in 2003.
The very first time I first heard of this hit Korean drama here in my country was when it was reported that many in Hong Kong watched the finale and it broke the record in terms of viewership ratings there.
Based on the life of the first ever woman royal physician in the now Korea, it will definitely pull your heartstrings and move you.
But as long as anyone is interested in checking out this drama serial, you need to find out first whether there's dubbing and/or subtitles involved if your local TV station is showing it.
This is the first time I have written a comment on IMDb in all the years I have used it avidly to search for worthy videos to watch.
Not hooked but enough interest to keep me going...same with the next one...and then when I finally got to the part when the little Jang Geum became orphaned and out-shone the other little girls in the palace in her determination and diligence, that is when I really got hooked, which brings me to a suggestion ... watch the first 3 episodes in their entirety.
The first set of DVDs I purchased was made in China and had OK English translation.
In closing, none of the episodes disappointed and they were all enjoyable, but it is just a small few minutes here and there of extra details that seem to drag a bit in the first 10 episodes.
In this last (or first), what seems asleep is not so much New York as a city-within-a-city Â the huge old fortress of Bellevue Hospital, where, at night in its wards and among its staff, skulduggery is afoot.
Among them are his bitter roommate, Alex Nichol, nursing some resentments about not being rich, either by birth or through wedlock; ward nurse Coleen Gray, raising a young son from an unhappy first marriage; and chummy elevator operator Richard Taber, who bunks down off the boiler room Â where he runs a book where the cash-strapped interns can play the ponies.
I happened to be one of the few, very fortunate people to see this at a recent screening during the "first annual" NYC (Independent) Horror Film Festival, and let me tell you, it was a real treat!
To the contrary, it is a film that proves the importance of talent first and foremost.
I don't know what else to say besides the fact that I fell in love with this movie after I saw it the first time.
Leslie Fenton directs a first rate cast including Fredric March, Betty Field, Agnes Moorehead and Joan Carroll.
I saw it when it was first broadcast--and some of it again when rerun a year or two later.
I had first seen it as what now called a "questioning" young man in 1972 (the son's character was 14, I was 13 at the time) and remembered it being very important to me as the first sensitive, non- judgmental portrayal of gay men on television.
Today I saw the film for the first time, and am duly impressed.
Well-made TV-movie, largely acknowledged as the first made-for-television film to tackle the subject of homosexuality, has divorced San Francisco contractor Hal Holbrook looking forward to a visit from his fourteen-year-old son who lives out in Los Angeles with his mother; things are shaky when the kid meets his dad's new male friend, and once he figures out that Pop enjoys this male companion more so than eligible women, he runs away in anger and confusion.
Levinson/Link production won raves upon its first network showing, and indeed it is smart, focused, and without stereotypes.
Hal Holbrook's son does not know his father is gay when he first comes for his annual summer visit.
Granted, Ethan Embry isn't exactly the first name off of a casting director's lips when discussing a potential lead for a huge blockbuster, but his talent surely merits him better work opportunities than this.
A charming romance for the first season and a half.
The series takes a romantic stroll from Ben (Laurance) and Laura's (Keller) first meeting through the ups and downs of courtship.
Who could forget their first date with a married couple in the middle of an argument?
In the end of their first date, the younger couple sit in the first seat while the older couple reunite the passion.
Duet was Fox's first show about relationships.
They meet at a wedding of course in the first episode.
The first time I saw it, I found myself laughing out loud.
