Sometimes they can be distracting (for example, you lose the illusion that a movie should create and instead you get the feeling that there are production people behind the camera) but still, the story and some of the characters depictions are so strong that you are still left with a haunting and depressing feeling long after the end credits.
It doesn't have the pace of Last of the Mohegans, for example.
Director Bruce Beresford has addressed the issues of clashing cultures in several of his other films: Driving Miss Daisy, Mr. Johnson for example.
This use of language draws certain comparisons to isolationist behaviour seen in psychological studies of grief and bereavement, for example Colin Murray Parkes' elusion to "the widow who spoke in a whisper for fear of making reality too real".
Consider, for example, the ease with which the movie switches from showing the guys hunting the alien to their realization that they are the ones being hunted.
And he does it imaginatively-- by filling a room with photographs or items that reflect who a certain person is, for example, or simply by training his camera on someone's face and allowing that extra beat that affords the viewer a telling glimpse of what's hiding behind a character's eyes.
Throughout the film, Von Trier shows his fascination with Germany, for example, during a ride through the "Ruhrgebiet", the industrial core of Europe, or the world, at least during the '80s.
Yuri Lowenthal for example.
The same actors often play different characters at the different periods of time (for example, the guy playing the medieval king also plays a Stalinist henchman and a contemporary smuggler).
And film helps you to take account that many people is not as mature as they are supposed to be - for example Martin father -, and other many people is not as crazy as they are supposed to be - for example Dante-.
Alicia, for example, is almost always laughing and having fun, but her eyes are dark, worried.
For me, more important than the technical discussions in the film (some people seem to KNOW that for example doctor Henry Lee sold out to the defense side), is the human and moral aspect at play here.
Some are groan-inducing: for example, when the group starts doing a new piece by the cynical, self-pitying, alcoholic composer, it brings him around and he joins the band.
The movie is mostly fast-paced slapstick farce, a host of retreaded clichÃ©s (the dogs, for example), and quick jokes.
I like a challenge, but for example I was trapped in one (big) level for a entire week before I found out that to progress in the game, I had to shoot a small electro-tube somewhere on the wall... What kind of game-logic is that?!
His inability to do two things at once when it comes to acting (for example deliver a line and hang up a phone) is hilarious to watch.
It's a great moment of comedy, for example, not merely in the look between Stringer (Daniel Kincaid) and Joanna Buckley (Wendy Crewson) as he knows it's Dukakis's campaign manager who's been sleeping around with Tanner, and likewise she knows he knows, but how the shot goes, a quick zoom in on each other's eyes, as if the audience didn't know- which of course we do- and the light touch of theme music in the background.
Tanner '88 is also great entertainment as far as being able to expect "For Real" reality, to quote an episode, as Tanner encounters real politicians, for the most part not knowing that it's a fictional show (Pat Robertson, for example).
There are some other memorable shots that stick with you,for example, the memory of the spilt milk, that hold the magicalness of the chance gathering of all involved in making this film, the essence of something beautiful and perfect that will probably never come together again.
Other than the perfectly-cast Groome, the director told us that he applied no seriousness to finding the 'perfect people' for the respective characters: the guy in the green jeep, for example, was cast because "he had a green jeep".
Writer/director Richard Tuggle relates the compellingly sordid plot at a gradual, yet steady pace, develops a good deal of tension, delivers a vivid and intriguing evocation of the seamy Big Easy red light district, and, most of all, offers a strong and provocative exploration of the extremely warped and disturbing aspects of severely aberrant male sexuality and perversity (for example, Block likes to handcuff woman while making love to them in order to have a sense of control).
This French movie adaptation is set in present day Bretagne, but other than that remains - rather surprisingly - true to the book, more so than, for example, the Diana Rigg version of Evil Under The Sun.
Every one in this world watch one film with total devotion for example my father who doesn't watch films watched 'Shree 420' fourteen times.
Gregory's tactics to get at this might seem far-off at first - his descriptions of his time in Tibet and Poland, for example, seems silly, but it does lead somewhere for the audience, and it opens up Shawn into the dialog.
But, I felt certain parts could have been changed, for example, the ending.
One gaffer for example, so that it's as if you are there, the only one, inside the story, watching like a fly on the wall, enjoying the struggle through the confusion of life, as everyone.
Vince Vaughn, for example, in DODGE BALL.
The horse racing sketch, for example, blows the juvenile "dicks and pussies" speech from team America out of the water.
for example in the film she wanted a tattoo when she got one in the camp it had a completely different negative meaning.
It is like someone being suddenly whisked from this life, for example, blown up in an explosion, and immediately reincarnating another body in another time frame.
for example: larry hankin is in it and if your asking yourself who's larry hankin?
Oh man,"Hausu" is an extremely weird and grotesque horror parody.It is also supremely stylish and visually mindblowing.The plot of "House" is quite easy to describe:seven schoolgirls travel to visit grandmother at her spooky old house.It's not clear whose grandmother she is,as every character in the movie is referred to by a nickname and they all call the old woman Ojii.The house turns out to be a demon that wants to eat them and grandmother is apparently a cat.Words can't describe how positively bizarre this movie is.It plays like the cross between "Suspiria" and "Beetlejuice".There are plenty scenes of kitschy humour plus some scares for example when one of the girls tries to sneak the watermelon out,she finds a human head down the well instead.One girl is even eaten by a piano in a very gory fashion and the dead victim's fingers are still playing the piano after being bitten off.9 out of 10.
The girl who's always hungry, for example, has her head replaced by a watermelon and the musical chick literally becomes consumed by the piano.
Okay, realistically speaking, it is not "excellent" in the grand scope of cinema history...It has virtually no plot, for example.
Back in the 70s i had to have seen all those party movies , for example, The Van and The Gas Pump Girls, and lifeguard was so much of a breath of fresh air along side of those others, i grew up hanging out at redondo beach and Hermosa beach California which is where this movie was filmed, in fact on ricks tower u see the letters HR i believe that stands for Hermosa/redondo and this is also 1 of the beaches that mike love and Dennis Wilson of the beach boys used to hang out at as they lived in near by Hawthorne, I have this movie on VHS not available on DVD yet, and I watch it at least once a month, as i live in new york now and this movie brings back some special memories of my fun days, i even love that song time and tide in this movie, and watching him drive to the beach in his stingray passing all those very familiar businesses, wow, well if your nostalgic then i don't have to explain the feeling.
There are unexpected comedy elements as well, for example, when a post-meltdown Beth blows her nose in the expensive placemat Karen bought for her in Italy.
As far as TV fare goes I'd rate this as a middle rung production, the battle scenes are nicely done and attention to detail in costuming is above average, for example it's good to see soldiers and officers who are not pristine and clean.
Thus they need another horrible sergeant to replace Hakeswill, for example.
4) When the "Taken" mini-series ended,for example, each of the story lines neatly concluded and the questions for each character were resolved.
The scene where he appears in a Japanese school for example, the kids who surely have been taught as worshipers of the dictatorial few leaders, despising democracy.
Like other "journey" films (LOTR, for example) it is episodic - Izo goes somewhere and does something, then goes somewhere else and does something else.
Some scenes during the final ten minutes may make you wonder if you should be laughing or crying; the end scene where the Mayor forces Arthur to keep ramming one of the attackers with the rear of his Cadillac for example.
Unlike Lawrence Of Arabia, for example, the principle characters are real, as are the minor characters.
Take Terminator(1) for example, a low budget production, big hit, nice effects.
Karloffs servant for example.
Further, it belongs to the beginning of the sound age, and William Wellman uses this resource magnificently, like for example, when the truck is discharging coal to disguise the shooting.
A word about Frees' contribution to the film: In "War Games," for example, the computer has a curious sort of empathetic communication style ("Wouldn't you rather play a nice game of chess?")
When I compare it to modern scenes of horror -- the hordes of undead in THE MUMMY returns, for example -- it comes off very well.
Barbara's character, for example, is a much stronger female lead here that courageously assists Ben in kicking zombie-butt.
The use of tools by the zombies for example, is lessened and removed at times, creating more continuity between Night, Dawn, Day and Lands time-line of the undeads abilities.
OK some of the accents are a bit questionable, for example; most of the lead actors playing German officers use an authentic accent, whilst others in minor roles don't bother with one.
Rommel, for example, by his eleventh hour switch to support the Stauffenburg bomb plot, was technically committing treason - and was forced to commit suicide to protect his family from Hitler's full anger.
I agree w/ the strikingly modern portrayal of Slim Thompson-seen almost as an equal in the Mantee clan as 'Jackie Cooper',( it's a better part than Sam Jackson had in Goodfellas, for example._ Contrast it w/ the Uncle Tom limo driver and you see what I mean.
Compare this masterpiece with Goodfellas, for example - it's like comparing a Rembrandt to a Rolf Harris; there's no denying the latter has some quality, but the former is operating on a different level entirely.
Still, due to its few merits and overall Eastern status (meaning there are NOT any stupid lightening "entertainment" elements usually found in, for example, modern Hollywood horror films) make this to 4/10 category.
I know that there were some major time lapses, wetsuit changes for example, but...what?
While the picture does display a kind of moral simplicity (notice for example how all the good guys wear white, and the bad guys black, with the occasional moustache just to clarify) it is an incredibly mature and almost bitter portrayal.
Outsiders (even of Italian stock) who attempt to integrate into it usually meet distressing ends - Matthew and his friend in season 2, for example.
When you want the perfect blend of drama and action, you call Harrison Ford (think "The Fugitive", for example... don't think "Star Wars").
The story has lots of holes and clichÃ©s, and it is funny to see, for example, the car fully loaded with eight persons, and I guess where all of the camping stuff was transported.
A "numpty", for example, is a stupid or foolish person and did you known that your "oaksters" are actually your armpits?
It could have been any of a million other towns, DeKalb, Ill., where I live, for example.
Bo Diddley tries to keep an open mind about it all, for example, saying that Dick Clark couldn't showcase a mixed dance crowd on his "American Bandstand" because the producers wouldn't permit it.
He manipulates many questions, like for example for his wife, and never mentions that he went to jail for tax evasion.
Boyd's lack of a any expressionist inclination with his own statements ('how marvelous') for example therefore not only parallel the plot and introspectuocentricity of the movie, but match perfectly well with personal opinions that, to themselves, hold great value.
I wasn't surprised when Ken Starr got a cheap shot, for example.
It has a number of signature gimmicks that might annoy some viewers, but I like them; Bernie talks to the camera a lot, for example, breaking the so-called "fourth wall."
This is sad, because I feel that Hollywood caters to the lowest common denominator in America (In Paris, for example, I do not think they would market "The Dukes of Hazzard").
I love the whole bizarre set up, the weird coincidences (for example the piece of newspaper stuck on his arm which talks about a man being ripped apart by vigilantes in the very area he can't get away from - and then the weird woman says 'I'll burn it off' - yet more reference to burns) Love the 'Berlin club', and the idea of the plaster of Paris cream cheese bagel paper weights - so evocative of that pretentious era!
The rape story, for example...hard to understand until you've seen it, but it's full of comedy.
Many things happen that make little sense- for example, upon being revived in the nineties after being frozen in ice for fifty years, Captain America is found by a conspiracy theorist who has been piecing together his story for years.
Most of the actors sleepwalk through this film(the Red Skull's daughter for example looks particularly sleepy) and there is hardly any adventure to speak of.
Others, though, may feel that 60+ minutes of one's life could be spent in a better way than watching this - which is about as exciting as looking at a glass of cold water becoming lukewarm - such as, for example, sleeping comfortably in one's bed as opposed to dozing off in a chair in front of a TV-screen.
Even minor characters turn in great performances; for example, Grace's Aunt Edna, who shares a secret that leads to a hilariously dark moment for Grace and Eddie.
A great thing about Futurama is it can go some places where The Simpsons could never touch, seeing as the writers have the whole universe at their disposal, for example we see in the first episode as Fry familiarizes himself with the future.
Clark Gable, for example, plays devoted husband and businessman instead of a tough guy like he usually does.
Betrayal and impossible love for example are depicted by Carol Reed with a sense of realism that feels uncannily contemporary.
Between the interviews we are shown interesting footage of the topic discussed, for example on resource exploitation you might see modern agriculture at work.
The film is packed with visuals - even the sets (Jittlov's room for example) are interesting to look at.
Look at Eminem for example who played a character in "8 Mile" who was based on himself and he was terrific.
Incredibly stupid game shows, which try to force people to call and to give money for nothing, like for example: "Yes now you can win even more, tell me when do you have birthday!...
Air fighters for example had ten times less service at the front than Germans.
The answers he gives throughout the film and define the structure of it, for example, are clearly recorded in post-production; and even when they help the viewer understand, they loose naturalness.
Keep the truth in mind (for example, Chiang did not capitulate at Xian when he was kidnapped) and enjoy this wonderful film.
Take Roddy Piper, for example.
The content range is wide enough to give newcomers a pretty good appreciation of the whole metal family and includes both glam and shock rock '70s/ '80s bands as well as some heavier stuff from Slipnot, Slayer for example.
For metal die-hards, yes there will be bands that are not covered here (the melodic death metal scene, for example, is only noted, doom metal is not here), but the documentary serves as an overview rather than an encyclopedia in moving pictures.
I for example may have liked to hear more full acts of music and I am wondering why Gothic rock did not get some coverage.
Seifer's comment on Zell and Squall for example:  "This is great!
Despite the series brilliance occasionally in the Season you will see episodes that suffer from poor pacing - 'The Troubled Spirit' for example, but these episodes are few in number only about 2 or 3 really, so they are easy to overlook, and all series will usually slip up somewhere!!!
Season 2 provided us with upbeat and exciting stories, exploring often the most bizarre and intriguing aspects of Science fiction 'The Rules of Luton' for example - highly evolved plants!!!
So-called "collateral damage", for example, amounts to a rough utilitarian calculus applied during bombing campaigns where civilian casualties are inevitable.
And I've managed to enjoy a few of them precisely because they are so bad like for example Troll II or Demon Wind, but Neon Maniacs was just too god awful.
Little Shop of Horrors, for example, had a very similar ending, with the grinning plant showing up in the cute garden at the end of the film.
My favorite scene in this movie, for example, is Harry and Lloyd's interaction with a very serious, tough thug.
Against most German films which have a cold and unpleasant atmosphere (for example: Funny Games, The Hotel or The thin drum) this film ended happily.
Catch his Buck Rogers, early Knight Rider or Fall Guy for examples of how the genre CAN work without making you wish that the 'bad guys' would win so the series could end.
It has some very strong moments, for example when the treason of the Cylons is discovered too late to save the human colonies and fleet.
In the latter case the viewers personal reaction will govern the response to such eye candy, (typically for example, regardless of whether or not they themselves appreciate it, many viewers feel that this is very inappropriate for younger viewers and all films should provide advance warning when it is present).
The narrative, for example, is ingenious as several characters (including RÃ©mi) explain the story whilst facing the camera.
This the kind of movie, popular at the time, in which a protagonist who is possibly a murderer is befriended by a girl/woman who's never met him before - for example Alad Ladd and Veronica Lake in The Blue Dahlia and/or in which a street-wise gal like Guild here, has to have the expressions 'private eye' and 'shamus' explained to her.
So he stays generic through his picaresque ordeals, without the specific anguish that distinguished, for example, John Payne or even Gordon MacRae and Edmond O'Brien as they underwent theirs (in, respectively, The Crooked Way, Backfire and D.O.A.).
All the blood squirting on your screen for example!
All the characters are fully realised and perfectly cast, down to the smallest part, for example Maria Lucas who (as far as I know) has been left out of every other adaptation!
You can run a nice and fitting distance before tiring, for example.
I loved the bit, for example, when a villain explains to a radical left-wing writer his business of the last few years, exactly in the exaggerated fashion that a radical left-wing reporter would be inclined to write about a tyrannical bureaucrat.
So for example in the movie there's a scene where King Charles is dressed in drag and it is clear that the audience is supposed to not be taking him seriously.
In middle America divorce was rare, for example.
The execution-scene guided by the moody "I Remember You"-song, for example, is amazingly atmospheric and quite unsettling.
I believe this unforgettable tale shakes with every mature person, and there are many fantastic lines, like for example, "better living in the dark than not living at all" or "old gives space for the new".
Based on a series of short stories appearing in National Lampoon, the movie is slow at some points (the dance scene for example), but it is easily made up for by the absurdly hysterical parts.
It's a reasonable movie with an inspiring story, good message, great performances from the actors, wonderful sceneries, awesome soundtrack (classical music, for example), drama and comedy.
This actor looked so different when he was younger and his role here is completely different from (for example) "Before Sunrise" and "Before Sunset".
At its core it is mainly a western, but not a "realistic" western (for example, Open Range or Unforgiven).
Excessive pride, for example, was referred to as hubris.
I never sided with Mr. Hopkins' Hannibal the cannibal, for example.
There are one or two awkward plot elements--the friend who commits suicide, for example.
Nothing is ever really explained in the film, like for example why La Llorona turned up in New York of all places.
for example,the scene where the main character suggest how to solve the American racial problem, is RAW and i guarantee you that will make you wake up the neighbors.
Unfortunately, the film whitewashes Ms. Metalious' original stories (for example, the abortion becomes a miscarriage), which sometimes leaves the characters too sketchy.
Bergman, for example, has not made a feature film in almost 20 years, and that makes him no less great...  
The film is actually quite enjoyable, but only during the moments when the plot doesn't necessarily have to make sense, like for example the neat sequences of the town in chaos or when the demon possesses random souls in order to gain power.
I was also disappointed that some of the facts were changed (Dr. Kellogg, for example, stayed fit and healthy well into his 90's) to please the anti-fitness people.
One would also assume that a movie made in a Soviet influenced country would contain a certain amount of Communist and Pro-Soviet propaganda (for example, Planeta Bura).
When Gene Kelly arrived on the scene to direct 'That's Entertainment, Part II (1976),' he found no shortage of interesting clips in the MGM archives, but occasionally had to settle for the secondary musical numbers from the most famous musicals, for example, having to settle with "Good Morning" instead of "Singin' in the Rain."
In James Bond, for example, I know he is a vain, brainless army officer with a line in feeble sexist jokes, but I know he is going to get involved in some spectacular antics fighting a mad villain before he's off.
Jack, for example, has an unresolved situation with his father.
Take note of the scenes with `Janay' for example.
Also I watch the Cahmpions league and many of the games from the Spanish league and it doesn't work for me when you actually know what truly happened in those games, for example Madrid lost against Arsenal, and actually didn't get that far in champions that year.
However how the writers of this film managed to twist the plot was very clever.Like for example the fact that Michael Owen moved to Newcastle in exchange for Munez,was a very good twist.
This film is actually much better than you might think - much better than some of the others in this Universal series, like House of Dracula, for example, which features a whole roster of horror characters, but no plot whatsoever.
I've never been clear, for example, on how Kay becomes a vampire; it appears to me that she's shot dead before Dracula ever bites her on the neck.
Early in the film, for example, Louise is overwhelmed by the Van Heflin character playing a section from Schumann's "Carnaval" on the piano.
In this regard, the story mimics many classic works of samurai fiction, for example, where the hero denies his own desires in the name of a personal moral code.
Take Lou and Andy for example.
"Mean Machine" is a memorable Italian crime thriller.It has wall-to-wall nudity(supplied by Malisa Longo and Barbara Bouchet),plenty of gunplay and some nasty bits of gore for example the castration scene.The film is pretty hard to find,but you should search for it.My rating:7 out of 10.
In middle America divorce was rare, for example.
I loved Eva Phillip's ability to torment the people around her (for example - calling her drunk, scarred husband 'Beauty') - it was incredibly fascinating to me.
The first movie is an exercise in horror and scaredthe crap out of me, the sequel (although there are a number of scary scenes, when they see the manifestation of sadako and her mother for example) is more of a thriller come mystery movie.
Take, for example "Are You Ready For Marriage?"
But, since this was a first season episode, it may have been filmed before Leonard Nimoy had fully come to understand his character and the proper way to play him, (for example, he was still speaking with that put-on British accent like when he pronounces the word command as "commond").
Seeing a white shape just at the edge of the screen is much more effective than, for example, the killer's POV.
The stewardess on the train, for example, speaks standard English and seems American.
Even if living in my country is not like living in Germany or UK or USA, we are not beggars... this movie is nothing but bad taste: bad directing (if you look close you will see the same old car filmed twice - for example), bad script and above all... bad acting.
As I know the whole story is true - there is almost no fiction in it (as in Braveheart for example).
The mystery still has not been solved, so art (this film, for example) continues to live.
The superb action sequences are split up by good plot detail and a bit of humour thrown in for good measure, a lot of it completely incongruous to the often violent scenario (the sequence with Yun-Fat dodging bullets while holding a baby for example).
Rimmer (played by the ace Chris Barrie) attempts a ridiculous explanation to how they've ended up with unusual predicaments after a late night party (for example broken legs) and tries to ease everyone's worries by suggesting it was alien communication.
This thoroughly bizarre film contains obvious homages to the great film noir, Laura (1944), from the initial plot (a detective in love with a dead girl, whose painting is on the wall) to the beautiful black and white cinematography, to the detective's voice over narration but moves off into directions that are totally unexpected if not downright silly (for example another homage, this time to The Mummy (1932) where one of the main characters is being sodomised by her father who's dressed as the mummy).
Towards the beginning, for example, Scholar Ku makes a long, long annoying nocturnal investigation of the spooky old mansion where he lives with his mother, finding nothing.
Easygoing atmosphere dominates the whole story (some shots are pleasant, for example, playing sandlot baseball or visiting a show room).
Plenty of other ways to highlight Tok's love for pop culture, the Metal Slug reference for example... All it was was a few second verbal reference and it had me smiling.
I'm not a man that is into mindless movies like Dude Where's My Car?, Bill & Ted Excellent Adventure, or Harold and Kumar Goes to White Castle for examples.
Im a mountain climber and love to watch movies about climbing, that stated most movies in this genre usually have really fake seaming climbing scene for example Cliff hanger with S Stalone climbing a huge wall in the Rockies(really Dolomites in Italy) with all the gear but using none of it or the bolt gun?
The jocular references to wife-beating, for example, do not seem tasteful or funny today.
Sensitivity is required in handling human issues, for example, the spiritual undertone of the characters or the surprise at "calf-branding".
for example), and i must say i loved this one, when we see why the young communist soldier had a flower too, and who gave him it.
SPOILERS  But plausibility isn't something this film seems to want to care much about -- for example, the Luke character leaves a crime scene or shows up at the "West Hollywood Police Department" in a motorcycle, sans helmet without hearing word one about it from a "WH" cop; the Chaz character get not only sliced but decapitated on a crowded dance floor and no one notices, hears about it, or stumbles on him; Eddie ends up at the crime scene where his younger brother (whom he was earlier so concerned over and about) was killed, gets attacked there himself, goes to the "WHPD," runs into his sister and yet no one (not even the sister) mentions to him that his brother was the victim at that crime scene.
the special effects are noting special with the explosions for example.
King Kong, for example, is slow in the beginning, yet I love it.
His presence on any number of these "grade-b" films, including the brief appearance in "Madame Bovary" (with Jenifer Jones), for example, or in the disappointing "Mayerling," adds a sense of gravitas to any of the proceedings in which he appeared, but the scripts and directors fail him, if not the cast.
granted there are even worse, cheaper and misguidedly serious movies than this ("hyper sonic", for example), this still pretty much redefines the term "a B-movie".
Soundtrack is naturally amazing for this 80's TV series, i heard music themes from 'Miami Vice' long before today and the first episode of it that i watched, official 'Miami Vice' theme is very good and likable as well as the music from 80's that was used for this show, for example in this episode we hear well known hits such as 'Girls Just Wanna Have Fun' and 'In The Air Tonight'.
Because of that he uses way too many explosions, and action that completely overshadows the storyline, a storyline that wasn't overall too bad if plots had been kept quiet and filmed appropriately, for example, there's a scene where Christian Bale gets emotional trying to appeal to human emotions, and the scene gets you caring,....for 3 seconds then its over, it should of been dragged out, and really got you into the film before the final battle.
Manu, for example, is basically a happy-go-lucky kid who's just beginning to find his way in life and who demonstrates that he has a tremendous capacity for joie de vive and emotional tenderness - even if his youth and inexperience occasionally lead him to hurt others in ways that he doesn't yet fully comprehend.
Take one scene for example, when Clive Owen's Mr. Smith is having sex with the beautiful Monica Belluci, and right in the middle of it, the bad guys come in.
Kagome for example: She overreacts too much to my taste; she acts like Yuka from Elfen Lied.
It just isn't a great series the way Neon Genesis Evangelion, for example, is generally considered to be.
(Had Sheen been in this picture, for example, I don't know if I would have remembered the character's name, or simply have referred to him as "Charlie Sheen".)
The character oldman for example didn't have enough history behind him to effect me.
I have suggest some friends watch this, but I can't put it in the same category as an Oldboy, Bus 174 or City of God for example.
The prisoners have also decorated the prison, often with text, for example scripture, but also with many beautiful graffiti.
The brutal massacre in the end kills almost everybody, after building in us pure hope, not through melodramatics (no rape scenes or male nudity for example), but through hard realism.
Delpy strikes a good balance of showing the positives and negatives of her home country and the U.S. -- for example, the French are a classy, exciting people, but cab drivers make openly racist jokes -- it's still a slightly backwards place.
In other respects, of course, Jack is not rational at all, for example concerning his hypochondria.
Bava's giallo killers never have as an impulse the psychological imbalance favoured by Argento for example, no Bava's characters kill out of greed but always with a clear mind.
These concepts, which previously appeared in "The Million Eyes of Sumuru," sound terrific, but, despite some intriguing set design & visuals, it follows the same campy atmosphere of, for example, the very dated "Some Girls Do," which came out around the same time and which also featured a female army.
This sounds exciting but there are problems which go beyond just a slow pace; there are many shots which could have used a lot of tightening: one shot of an arriving airplane, for example, stays on the craft as it settles to a near stop, as if this had never been captured on film before.
Lewis Stone, for example, is the man who makes the famous statement about "nothing ever happens" at the conclusion of the film.
It was not surprising therefore than when she turned to directing she did so with her own screenplay La Buche which centered on three sisters and their disparate lives but also offered strong roles to four semi-leads with a handful of cameos (Isabelle Carre's neurotic wife, for example) for good measure.
Jayston is an admirable, subtle actor, who speaks his many lines well and who is really the highlight of this version, but unfortunately he lacks that charisma, that great overpowering presence and natural authority which are necessary to play Rochester and which for example make Orson Welles a more convincing Rochester in the '44 movie, although he has much less screen time than Jayston and does not possess the latter's subtlety.
Screwed was indeed funny, much more so than for example, Anchorman.
Look at, for example, Fulci's ZOMBI 2 or the countless JAWS rip-offs.
I enjoyed it a great deal and I am very choosy, for example I didn't like Star Wars.
There are a lot of superb silent moments, as for example, the first and unseen kiss in the garden, the night meadow scene, each and every shot starring the heartbreaking Dame Norma Shearer and a charming Herr Ramon Novarro.
Once or twice the program lags when a musical number has little special to offer aside from the merits of the music itself and the novelty of being performed by Muppets, for example "Act Naturally" by Floyd and Janis.
Not only is it a struggle to find what could even be considered laugh lines, but Lehr ensures there's nothing funny about his basic character (unlike a show like The Office, for example, where Steve Carrel could stand motionless and still be hilarious).
When, for example, Enrico la Verso's character drinks the milk, the significance of this simple act hits home with the force of a sledgehammer.
Like these for example.
The music in Mississippi Burnin is phenomenal; there are a lot of gospel songs for example the song by Vesta Williams '' Try Jesus ''.
"Hell of the Living Dead" and "Rats: Nights of Terror", for example, are both terrible, yet they form essential viewing for fans of Italian horror cinema.
It definitely looks very artistic at times, for example, the scene where the killer strangles the girl in a hotel while the neon lights lighten the scene.
Elvis Presley is a race car driver who likes to spend money on strangers with sob stories - he buys, for example, a station wagon for a family with five little girls, and newlyweds receive a new furniture set from Elvis.
My recommendation to all who want to write a negative review: make some research before doing so!That is the only way to find out how much truth there is in this film!I, for example found also out that they were using exact the same type of weapons at that time, like knifes made of obsidian.
Jeffrey, for example, states he's shown the script to Van Sant, but his eyes indicate otherwise.
The voice-over is totally hilarious as well for example; "Flower has been the only female in the family allowed to have babies, a) because she loves being the centre of attention, and b) because she's a psychopath" The program is what show like Big Brother and Celebrity Love Island want to be.
Democracy for example cannot be the same thing in China and the USA or France, for the very simple reason that it is not the same in the USA, Great Britain, France of Italy, not to speak of Japan and Finland.
There is a little more to the acting though, for example Asian actress Anna May Wong in the role of the Princess' traitorous slave girl.
A lot of the same folks who worked on her previous series as writers and guest stars (Milton Berle for example) are here too.
Those who feel it worthy to mention him at all usually hand out praise to "The Last Picture Show", but his output since that milestone - such as this and "The Thing Called Love", for example - undeservedly gets lost in the shuffle.
His "Emmanuelle and the Last Cannibals" (see my review), for example, is classic trash, and never less than enthralling.
This, unfortunately, produces little humor when compared to other kidnapping comedies like "Rutless People," "The Crazy Sitter," or "The Ref," for example.
Although meaningless liberties have been taken with this true story - what possible difference, for example, could it have made to acknowledge that Mitchell was married rather than imply bachelor status - it still grips in an understated way.
The latter group is, for example, the first two Prince of Persia games, and both this and the third game(where the focus still laid largely laid in the second of the two categories) of that series attempt for a mix... in the case of both, the result is that you can hack and slash away effortlessly and, more by chance than anything else, take out boss enemies and other players.
There are outright cases of abuse, but it is also hard to believe people may be unaware they are abusing an animal; for example if they are elderly, and have too many dogs in the apartment.
So far we have had Big Brother School and University, Big Brother Prison, Big Brother's Secret House and Secret Luxury Hideaway, for example.
The producers also looks for people who would end up fighting with each other, for example a homophobic and the most camp homosexual alive.
And some scene's had nothing to do with the movie, for example when one of the guys goes home with his girlfriend her sister opens the door, what we have next is nice to see but has nothing to do with the script, and a lot of girls show their body, clothed, in an explicit way.
Take "Buckaroo," for example.
Tara Buckman, for example, must have watched and learned a lot from Linda Hamilton in "The Terminator".
Whenever two people are talking on the phone, for example, they are rather obviously standing right next to each other with a wall in between them.
This is true, more or less, depending on when looking at either man's life (right now, for example, Coppola is fine just making wine with the occasional 'student' film like Tetro).
Like, for example, the entire movie before the school massacre.
I would say that some of special effects could be ...well, more special - for example, the mischievous talking cat Behemoth could be done more interestingly.
It's fascinating to see them all side by side, as it really shows up some of the themes that run through all of Gondry's videos - for example, repetition but with a slight difference, lots of things that look nearly but not quite the same.
Action is confined to indoor sets, and the more spectacular aspects of daily life in ancient Rome (attending the Circus Maximus, for example) are left to the viewer's imagination, hinted at by the sounds of roaring crowds but never actually seen.
Twenty five years after "Symptoms" is a disturbing masterpiece of the horror movies and one of the most romantic studies of crazy love that other prestigious directors in the seventies, for example Truffaut, De Palma, Rivette, Richardson or Losey, did in this past prodigious '70 decade.
If you're a horror film junkie, or even if you're not (for example, my boyfriend doesn't particularly like horror films but is fond of intelligent comedy and was right beside me laughing for this one) you should DEFINITELY see this movie!
for example making Laura normal, she is not normal she is crippled mentally and physically.
He allows himself to become a more marginal figure in some sequences Â for example when Spike Duggan is knocking out one challenger after another, Charlie isn't doing very much, and is off-screen half the time, but it's his reactions to the growing number of defeated men that is funny.
Also a number of things let it down for example: The two twins you see on Cold Reception you are expecting to fight them, however you do not.
It also avoided using simplistic general stereotypes (for example, police are portrayed both in a very positive and very negative light).
This movie has the cheesiest special effects i've ever seen in my life, as can be expected from a movie from 1972. for example, when an alligator is following this dude, you can see that they had to speed up the film.
Our hapless louche 'personal assistant', for example, wanders into a greenhouse.
I remember Zmed himself singing a few times towards the end, for example.
The attention to detail (Susanita's teeth for example); make the characters as believable and endearing as any in recent memory.
VERY MINOR SPOILERS GOING FORWARD:  The characters in both movie stick closely to the story, the Mexican version benefits from freedom of expression in many shots while the Egyptian version had to hint behaviours (homosexuality for example) to avoid censors scissors.
Manu, for example, always jokes and says, `Well, seriously.
The real girl, for example, also had to consume human waste, which is not shown here.
Spike Milligan is a postman who wanders around and delivers some memorable dialogue, for example: "And in come the three bears - the daddy bear said, 'Who's been sleeping in my porridge?'
Elizabeth, for example, is a slut that risks her life to help Laura, inclusive dying in the end, solves the murders of a serial killer in a couple of hours, in a absolute lack of coherence.
Unlike most films that have high levels of violence -- including, for example, Reservoir Dogs or Silence of the Lambs -- this movie genuinely attempts to grapple with the moral implications of what is being shown on screen.
Heck, this film even goes by several vicious alternate titles that sound like they only could have been invented by wicked exploitation distributors (for example: "Orgy of the Blood Parasites" or "They Came from Within").
Impressive as some of the later films of Kurosawa are - "Kagemusha" and "Ran" for example, I have to confess that it is his early work, particularly those set in modern Japan as opposed to its feudal past, that I find myself returning to with greater pleasure.
Stefan Berkoff as Adolf Hitler is quite entertaining to watch for example.....
Like I said, the movie is quite depressing, not very funny even if it talks about stand up comedian (Man on the moon for example, was a perfect movie, which make a combination of comedy and drama, but Lenny is just drama)and from time to time it is quite boring.
The director put a lot of scenes in the movie, which don't have nothing to do with a whole story; for example first 10 minutes we're just watching the lead female character stripping on the stage.
Consider, for example, the hilariously bad 2002 film Time Changer.
The green-screen use is laughable: for example, when standing on a hilltop, next to an animal whose fur is blowing in the wind, we see a too-close shot of the children, whose improperly-lit hair is standing PERFECTLY still... on a hilltop.
The bonus material to the DVD assures me she is a famous horror movie actress who has been in many magazine articles -- Fangoria, for example.
The aunt, for example, is not evil; she is merely an angry, desperate woman who is only struggling to survive just as much as Seita and Setsuko are.
Visually on film we are able to tell things about the characters that stage performances do not, for example as the guests depart from Act 1's party, an old woman steals a silver box from Violetta proving to us that Violetta is not among real friends, these are only fair-weathered friends and bad ones at that.
Take Kristin, for example; in the book, she is, at the oldest, about 18.
Take for example, Hammer's DR. JEKYLL AND SISTER HYDE or the Amicus anthologies or Pete Walker's FRIGHTMARE.
But there's much action, for example a really long car chase scene, and shooting as well.
The teacher who makes this self-reflection moreover has much in common with Bunuel, so for example, when he criticizes the standard level of human life in Spain Â as Bunuel did in an interview.
I liked very much some parts, like, for example, the hypocrisy of the priests in a hotel, praying for the health of the father of a guest in a moment, and drinking and playing cards like gangsters in the next moment.
Very sadly one of the funniest and most active comedians I have ever seen Bill Owen died recently, but although he was almost the main character in the show I'm certainly glad that for Bills memory that the show has continued.One of the great things about the show is that just about all of the actors in the show have made their mark in other comedy's and other shows, yet they all seem like they have been in the show from the start, for example Jean Alexander spent many years as Hilda Ogden in Coronation Street and Stephen Lewis was well known as Blakey in On The Buses.
Or take for example these elegant leather ladies gloves with small buttons.
PÃ©rez-GaldÃ³s would have been greatly angered by any similar treatment of his `Fortunata y Jacinta', for example.
Some of life's more offensive moments were shown for what they were and yet simultaneously rendered hilarious when role-reversed: the executive women's nearly unconscious treatment of waiters at the local bar, for example.
Hitch for example.
While on the Singapore front, save for a few glimpses of Tiger Beer you'd be hard pressed to even notice the seldom-used locale, opposite of what we've come to expect from Hong Kong, for example.
It's great to see all the old Doctors, for example (even if the first Doctor was dead and is played here by a lookalike and the fourth Doctor rather childishly didn't want to be in the show, so is featured via old, unused TV footage), but it's still a bit cheesy to have simply SO MUCH Doctor Who crammed into one show.
There are some flaws in the script, like for example, Emmanuelle does not allow that a priest doctor treats Sarah, but gets her to the macumba.
The story is realistic, balancing dramatic situations with some funny scenes, like, for example, when Batignole is called in the train station to help a German soldier with a twisted knee.
Part of the fascination is how the Taliban managed to be so primitive and backward (basically anything that didn't exist at the time the Koran was written was verboten, with the exception of weapons and vehicles for them to get around in) and the peculiarities of Islamic attitudes and practices that distinguished the Taliban from, for example, the Khymer Rouge in Cambodia or the Nazis in Germany, although there are also parallels.
Also every character has a part in this movie, whether it be for example purposes (the wedding of deception) or to tie in some further plot to the story.
Some thoughts (for whatever they are worth)-    - The Beach has several Trainspotting-like moments of inspired glee mixed within the overall darker elements of the story (Richard's dark dementia broken up with a little goofy video game bit, for example).
thats about it ....................... zzzzzzzzzzz with the budget they have got you would have thought that they would have spent the money on proper sets instead of a car on a rolling track for example when the shots are inside a car the background is whizzing past at 200 miles an hour !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A clever writer could imply a relay of information between characters (for example, when one characters begins to tell another character about something that we already know, cut to something else).
Dahmer was on the cover of new magazines more than once, for example.
Geographical errors: Like for example on the segment Honey-Getter when the two guys Edward and Preshant get off the train, right before the lady Humera starts chasing them.
In 1990, Ron Gilbert released the first and best of the Monkey Island series, "The Secret of Monkey Island" Being a fan of Ron Gilbert/Lucasfilm Games (Maniac Mansion for example) I found this game extremely fun.
The rabbits for example, I have no idea.
Terry Moore's (Rosalinda Amendola) portrayal of a young woman in love was beautifully kind and loving, for example her lack of money paled in comparison to her interest to have a closer relationship with her neighbor (Pete)...."we can manage".
they had many intolerable items in the film that was disrespectful to Sikhism, for example in a song they changed a portion of a holy hymn to suit the needs of the movie!
*SPOILERS* Why, for example, did the martyr-kook Petulia continue to harass Archie, up until the point where she got beat to a pulp by David, whereupon Archie changed his whole attitude and began to really care for her?
The movie has a big philosophical statement to make, that has been lost on many reviewers, for example, Richard Schickel in TIME.
The characters are two dimensional and boring (for example there's a fat girl who was teased for being fat and that's her character).
The black humour features throughout the film and at times is subtle, and at others; less subtle (for example, "we never have practise on the day of a murder!
"Beyond the Door 3" is a pathetic trash.The acting is horrendous,the script is putrid and the music is awful.Absolutely no suspense,no atmosphere,just boring,meaningless c*** OK,there are some good gore bits for example one guy is cut in half by a chain,but the film isn't very bloody,so gore-hounds will be disappointed.The ending is one of the worst ever.The special effects rank from acceptable to totally fake.I'm a big horror fan and I really couldn't appreciate this one.To sum up,"Beyond the Door 3" is okay to laugh at with friends,but good luck sitting through this twice.Don't waste your precious time unless you like really bad horror movies.Not recommended.
If you believe in the Illuminati, you know that they control Hollywood and put their symbols in many films, for example the Nick Cage movies National Treasure 1 and 2.
The Critters (and there sequels) for example, were a poor attempt in trying to follow on from the Gremlins.
Zhou looks cool when she as Mingming.But her acting is limited in this movie,which is awful & boring.From 2003,Zhou's acting is narrow and powerless,for example,Baby in Love,Beauty Remain & A West Lake Moment.
Most of it is actually quite effective, but the sprinkler scene for example doesn't quite work.
There are so many shots to savour, I'll name just a few which caused me an admiring intake of breath;- for example the scene early in the film with a reflected image of the at that point still optimistic newly-weds sitting by the frog-pond, the expressionist use of shadows seemingly radiating out from Fonda's cell as he paces it in frustration and what may have been the first cinematic use of the three possible "Hold the front page" headlines in the press depending on the outcome of Fonda's trial plus of course the rightly famous eerie smoky set-piece where Fonda panics and shoots his friend the prison priest.
Even simple framing shots (one of Sydney to camera looking into the runaway couple's car from Fonda's viewpoint, for example) are delivered with style and finesse, there's no question there's mastery at work here.
Take "Gremlins" (1984) for example.
"Art of the Devil 2" is a gore-soaked horror film which was directed by a team of seven filmmakers known as the Ronin Team.The direction is solid,the cast is pretty good,but the storyline is hardly dynamic.When the gore appears it is unrelenting and disgusting.Miss Panor is an great villain and truly remorseless killer.The gore is rather hard to stomach for example toenails are torn out,teeth are plucked,live geckos burst out of a boy's back,one hapless girl gouges her own eyes out and the skin on man's legs is burned by a blow-torch.Overall,I enjoyed "Art of the Devil 2" more than its predecessor.Give it a look.
The main characters own special powers according to their type (for example the earth guy has powers related to earth and so on) which are necessary when you need to solve puzzles to beat the many different dungeons.
Some of the characters are not well defined the two girls for example but you fell for them anyway.
It's the kind of film that would be difficult to make today as would, for example, Dial M For Murder.
But it's very disheartening for example to hear Frodo yell "Out of my way, you scum!"
The film is entirely about sexual perversions, even though it is not technically eroticÂ Allen has taken some of the most popular clinical treatments of sexual fetishes and has placed them into very unusual situationsÂ   Gene Wilder, for example, falls in love with a sheep; Woody Allen plays a medieval court jester who gets his lance stuck in his lady's chastity belt while the king is off fighting in the Crusades; a giant breast is released upon the countryside; an Italian couple can only find happiness in public sex; and we are taken into the inner labors of a male human body as it tries to seduce a woman in a carÂ  Each individual scene is quite well doneÂ The tales are rapid filled with irony about the overly exaggerated importance of sex in our cultureÂ
Part of the problem lies in the fact that it's difficult to empathise with the characters' plight; I'd imagine that whereas most people would like to get rich quick (The Lavender Hill Mob, for example), few have dreams of running their own railway.
Story elements -- for example, turning the group of captive women into magic temptresses with poisonous breath -- get introduced and then dropped, or brought back for a few seconds' cameo at best (the poisonous women turn out quite pathetic, achieving only one kill among them).
"Eternity and a Day" is his version of Fellini's "Amarcord", with a few bits of "Death in Venice" thrown in for good measure (the ending for example).
for example, why does the main character have an AWB(Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging) tattoo?
Like Karyn for example, mind you.... a woman who met a guy in the elevator then ends up having sex on the same night will always be a woman of bad reputation in Christian Philippines.
", for example.
for example, his encounter with roger bracketts (sp?)
Consider, for example, if you were a viewer who had known little about James Dean.
There could be humor ("black"), for example.
Like for example: there's a piece of clothing flying, but you can see that it's held up by the camera man!
Now, I could have overlooked these many problems if the movie had kept me excited, for example if they had put in some kickass good-guys-fight-back battle scenes (like in Zombie or Demons).
The scene where the three guys are trying to decide how to find the woman goes on for a long time, for example, with little camera movement.
Also, the movie didn't go by all the facts, even though these things were small in nature - for example, Billy Flynn was not a blond guy, he has brown hair and certain things in the film were altered from the true facts that were reported on national television when Pamela Smart was on trial for the murder of her husband, Greg Smart.
for example, something along the lines of "Hey,it's okay,everything will be alright.keep your chin up".this is a paraphrase of some of the so called dialogue.
Regrettably any negative preconceptions of this film are confirmed from the outset, for example, in sticking firmly to genre conventions and expectation the film quickly establishes David as an unfit wimp by him being outwitted by a shop-lifting transvestite (clearly only a transvestite to elicit a smile), it also stereotypes his Pakistani landlord to the point of it being cringe worthy and it reacquaints us with the clichÃ©d "smooth boyfriend" character - brilliantly played by Hank Azaria.
If it had been anyone else (Richard Grieco, Michael Pare, Brian "The Boz" Bosworth, for example), I would not have even picked up the box.
The other type ("Riders of Destiny" and "the Star Packer," for example) are still quite entertaining 75 years later.
The script by Frederick Bailey obviously steals it's best ideas, themes & situations from other, much better films such as Jaws (1975), Creature From the Black Lagoon (1954, 2006 remake if it ever happens) & Humaniods From the Deep (1980) for example.
The writing is just horribly ridiculous and unrealistic (for example: Valjean tells Cosette that Marius was wounded in the barricade, and all she seems to care about is that Valjean finally accepted him), the acting of ALL the actors, except for the guy who portrays Gillenormand, is terrible (especially John Malkovich as Javert and Depardieu (spl?)
A key plot event, for example, entails utterly unexplained and un-anticipatable magical powers being deployed, where Andersen's original invokes more poignant and symbolically instructive natural cycles.
(He is, for example, a recovering alcoholic, and it was his drinking, and drink-fuelled violence, which led to the breakdown of his marriage).
Go rent a "Naked Gun" flick or something by the Monty Pythons ("Hitler in England", for example) instead.
Ultra violence and gore ensues and all the potential that was used to wonderful perfection in Fudoh (1996), for example, is not there in this film.
(i doubt that will happen simply because this administration will prefer private armies ,"blackwater" for example, that are not responsible to the any international tribunals upon killing civilians)it is doing so by TRYING to make choice easier for you to the point you actually could believe that it IS your choice for the "best".
This is one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen, its not funny, plot is dumb, comparing to a pirates of the caribbean for example its really nothing.
I found myself wondering why, for example, I was watching people line dance for a while, and why they went swimming at one point.
Sometimes historical characters can be condensed, for example, but they shouldn't be created out of whole clothe, nor should the conclusion be fabricated.
Watch the eyes, for example; they don't hold in one place, the character will say something and the eyes will go down a little bit, then to the side a little bit.
David Thewlis, for example, seemed to be played by a stand-in, not that anyone else was fully present (again, except for Butler, perhaps he didn't get the memo).
Also the character relationships are often wrong (for example between Chris and prof Johnston) and there are extra characters (who is Francois dontelle?).
If two men are feuding, for example, this is a good way for them to decide who is the better man.
"Malcolm" for example, was both clever and funny and an absolute gem.
The music is well integrated--nothing over-the-top or grandiose, like Lord of the Rings, for example.
When was the last time, for example, that you saw a character in a movie get punched or kicked in the crotch for a laugh?
I thing there are great Mexican movies but this one cannot be included between them, If you are looking for good Mexican movies look at Amores Perros for example.
Anchor Bay have in the past given us some delights on DVD for example Hellraiser, Halloween and Phantasm.
The subplot involving the mom and her new boyfriend, for example, felt completely fake and contrived.
The relationships are never compelling - none of the depth of character or feeling between people in a movie like Solaris, for example.
Take the co-pilot for example: if the real co-pilot, Jim Verinis, had really acted the way he did in the movie, he would most certainly have been charged with insubordination.
Kuba the Alien (Aldo Canti), for example, is an oddity that almost demands a cult following of some sort, or at least to be confused for Michael Berryman.
Prince of Darkness is a bad movie from John Carpenter.the whole thing is ridiculous.take the premise,for example.A priest has discovered a long hidden canister containing the liquid form of Satan himself,or rather his son.said canister had been hidden deep within the basement of an ancient church.upon discovering it,said priest decides to call upon physics Prof and students to investigate it.soon,the liquid ends up in most of the students(don't ask) turning then into mindless drones whose only purpose is to aid the son(said liquid)into freeing daddy aka Satan.Anyway,the whole thing is ludicrous even for sci-fi/fantasy/horror.there just isn't any point.Carpenter really misses the mark here.With all due respect to the late,great Donald Pleasence,what was he thinking?the only redeeming feature of this movie is that it is (marginally)less awful than "Slither" and "Lawnmower Man 2".
We learned, for example, that they had taken human form and had to remain in that form while on Earth or they would die.
There was no water-boarding, for example, but there was an interesting use of boiling/freezing water.
Sergio Garrone's "SS Experiment Camp" is a total failure on every possible level.This film was banned in Britain as a video nasty,but it surely isn't as outrageous as many people claim.In fact it's pretty tame even by today's standards.There is some torture and humiliation and lots of nudity and soft-core sex.Some scenes are pretty mean-spirited for example one woman who refuses to go through the experiments is put into the tank.The temperature is first put up to almost boiling point and then the dial is turned the other way making it icy cold.Still the film is extremely dull,so fans of Italian exploitation may be disappointed.Avoid this one like the plague-watch "Beast in Heat" or "Gestapo's Last Orgy" instead!
Personally I don't think this is quite as bad as some people claim, it's no worse than any other mindless sequel (for example: Saw V) but it's no prize winner either, and it pales in comparison to the original Hills Have Eyes.
While Captain Labesch, for example, is obviously French, and came to the island sent by 'the government', other law enforcement officers of this government have English names.
There are several "inside" jokes in the movie that for example a foreign spectator would not get, and their presence makes you think the director was not serious at all.
(What about a true bio pic about Cheyanne for example?)
But, the pace of the film is plodding, the performances detached and completely unengaging (or maybe the characters are detached and completely unengaging; in any case, you don't sympathize with them), the direction too "arty" (for example, a driving scene with no dialogue runs about five minutes, while one of Karen Black's "melancholy" songs plays on the soundtrack).
The cast is also awful and miscast: for example, the Caucasian Jacqueline Obradors, with her horrible tone of voice, has no chemistry with Wesley Snipes.
After watching Awake,I led to a conclusion:director and screenwriter Joby Harold made Awake with the intention of laughing at the spectator,for the simple fact the movie is full of ridiculous elements.Awake has a lot of plot holes and it is full of absurd and ridiculous elements(for example,the hospital uniform the spirit of the main character uses...did the ghost of a doctor leave it in the floor ?
Let's take Marx brothers movies for example.
After that "forced failure", why didn't they try to send the paper once again to a place he could certainly see it... his home for example... didn't he ever go to sleep?
Genocyber has precious little coherent plot to go with the scenes of carnage it presents, and gratuitously adds sequences (for example) of children being little blown apart by helicopter gunships in slow motion.
This film bored me a little and reminded me very much of Death On The Nile, for example, the man cheating on his fiancÃ© (same as in DOTN) The plot wasn't very exciting and seemed a little bit plain.
When Jean Jacques Annaud made films as for example The name of the Rose or Enemy at the Gates he did a perfect job in carefully creating the moods and atmospheres and directing characters, so in those cases I could actually stand the fact that most of the characters spoke English.
I have enjoyed previous stories that contain the main character.. for example Starship Troopers.. he has really taken a step back starring in this absolute sad joke of a film.
I'm not against adding American elements to a story to make it work commercial - it worked very well in High Fidelity, for example, but Roland's transatlantic transposition leaves all the other characters constantly having to react to his incongruous American-ness - he simply doesn't fit into the character in the novel.
In addition, several *important* characters have been removed, leaving gaps in the narrative - obvious ones - Roland's previous girlfriend for example.
As for the naked bodies and sex, there's better (9 songs, for example), but this couple is attractive and they have very attractive, real looking bodies, IMHO.
Brooks's direction, for example, seemed to me amazingly clumsy and lacking in rhythm.
This film tries so hard for the whimsy of, for example the ealing comedies but fails.
as in, initial reactions to a movie, for example.
But i was not satisfied by the plot...Will finds the signs...for example,on a Tomb(on the local Church),on her sister birthday present,OK totally unexpected and the SUPER predicted and most obvious sign(The Soul)...but for that, Will didn't even had to walk a mile from his home.
In the hands of, for example, the BBC, it could have made an excellent mini-series.
The movie does a good job between not too obviously demonizing hackers and between in fact doing exactly that, for example, when Kevin is shown having trouble getting along with a girlfriend.
Jaz for example.
The maps were confusing to me as quite a few of the place names were the same as here in England for example Berkshire etc.
"The Trip", for example, as well as this imaginatively titled "Gas-s-s-s" can somewhat be labeled as psychedelic exploitation.
During the 80's and 90's,director Abel Ferrara was one of the leaders of the independent cinema making amazing films which challenged the spectator.But,his recent works are far away from his previous works.New Rose Hotel and R Xmas were a little bit disappointing but they were interesting experiments.But,I do not know what was Ferrara thinking when he was making Mary,a tedious and boring movie and,by my point of view,a huge let down in his career.During 83 minutes,the movie shows us three stories which are totally boring and uninteresting.I think Ferrara wanted to make an analysis about the religion but,still with that,I think he had to do a better work to make a coherent connection between the stories.For me,it is very disappointing that Ferrara,who made excellent films with very little resources(like,for example,Bad Lieutenant,The Addiction,Ms.45 and The Body Snatchers),was behind this crap.I hope Mary is only an unexplainable false move in Ferrara's career and that,he will get redeemed soon.But I cannot recommend Mary,which is a tedious film.
There are some very powerful scenes and some frankly unforgettable visual sequences - the scenes of the first world war for example, or the beginning of the workers' strike.
Like for example the little girl who plays "ghost" she was an interesting character and one of the coolest things about the movie.
At least, if you would like to see a good airplane action movie, take one of the old "Airport", "Passenger 57" for example, but not this cheap crap here.
Having said that though, it usually gets a look-see whenever it appears on the box (this afternoon for example), just for the quality of the cast and a look at the fifties; and to remind myself of the crush I had on Muriel Pavlow.
A few of the actors in the production give good performances but these tend to be killed off early, for example the senior cop what a waste having him eaten at such an early stage!
It is hard to believe that THE DARWIN CONSPIRACY was made in 1999 as it plays like really bad TV of the 1970's; indeed, the director's earliest work was in 1970's TV ("Barnaby Jones" for example).
Take for example, the first scene in the movie: a young man eats a bowl of cereal, and his actions are shot in the same manner as the cocaine/heroin usage scenes in Requiem for a Dream; i.e., as a series of quick, disconnected shots.
The 'script' is bad enough to make George Lucas look as subtle as Tarkovsky, take for example:   Chirk: I am going to make you as happy as a baby Psychlo on a straight diet of kerbango.
The bad news, I have seen much better zombie movies which were made on the same or less of a budget than this acting mess....Meat Market, for example.
Of course this film is corny because it is all about corn Thought that there were only one or two good scenes for example micah (bollman) is in Church and has a wooden doll and knife there is someone sitting across from him then micah starts putting the knife up the doll's nose and the guy across from him nose starts to bleed then micah keeps on doing it until the guy dies and the other good part is when micah dies.
There are "guy flicks" that I like ("Resevoir Dogs" for example), but this ain't one of them.
The SFX range from pretty scary and subtle to just plain laughable (see the last scene, for example.)
If the premises of the script weren't so esoteric, ambitious and pseudo-metaphysical, and the direction less on the exhibitionist side (there's a completely gratuitous love scene between Torres and Seu Jorge, for example, devoid of any dramatic purpose; it's there just as an aesthetic exercise), the film might have been more likable.
Someone comes into a room, for example.
Perhaps if she were the Sally from the stage production brought over to film, this would be the case, as sometimes stage actors forget how intimate a medium film is (the severely under-rated RENT does suffer from this occasionally, for example).
In Spain there are also similar films as the films of Paco MartÃ­nez Soria for example.
There are good films in this genre--"The Sting",for example.
Like so many other recent action films (Death Race, for example), the fight scenes and chase scenes and whatnot are cut together so fast that they fly by with dizzying speed, and you move on with the rest of the movie with only a vague impression of what just happened.
There is, for example, a major, major plot development revealed in the third act of the movie that is so bizarre that it's almost like someone slipped in a page from a completely different movie.
There is one scene, for example, where the trio outrun not only a couple of what look like futuristic Stealth bombers, but also their missiles, and they do it on snowmobiles!
Hamlet's famous soliloquy, `To be, or not to be,' for example, is truncated into oblivion.
The movie is something else, in quality it's not as good as for example the Beck-movies, but still an okay movie.
This, and the number of historical liberties taken (James I, for example, discovers the Gunpowder Plot in person) make the story a less accurate guide to the past than even 'Braveheart'.
The character Zeke for example is the most head-wrecking person to ever exist,ever notice in every scene,all he does is complain,most lightly because he has never got laid, and he blames everyone else because of it.
There is no self-discovery in this film; no greater themes (populism, for example, in MD).
And for example, the Swedish attack wasn't lead by Karl XII (because he was wounded and couldn't lead Sweden in battle), it was lead by Carl Gustaf RehnskiÃ¶ld.
In this flick for example, they crafted a thriller that is the core but as usual is not great and neither is their suspense but surely this is not a genre film and therefore they bring the elements of comedy (the highlight of the film), Romance, Foot-tapping Music as well as sufficient skin show make all the difference.
Apart from this most obvious flaw in the movie, we're also expected to believe that these coronal mass ejections somehow keep satellites from burning up on re-entry, so they can take out streets full of people (for example, if the Soviet spy satellite which scattered itself all over the Yukon Territory back in the late 1970s had done so over downtown Detroit instead, the carnage could have been impressive).
For all those people who say that modern mass-market movies made by Hollywood like (just for example) Saw 2 or The Village or Flyboys are 'the worst movie ever made', they need to see this to see how much lower than those bad movies cinema can actually reach; this is a true cinematic nadir.
The main subject makes you think about this whole suspended imagination and alteration of reality, for example if the Chinese won't dance the way we intend them to dance, we'll paint them a few movies that will change people's reality regarding the Chinese; great no more wars!...
There are also some moments where low production values produce moments that might be from a comic strip: the private airport set identified by nothing (such as an aeroplane or runway) that reveals its function but simply by a sign reading "Private Airport", for example; or the box of labelled dynamite.
Jeff Speakman never really made it beyond the lowest ranks of martial-artists-turned-actors (lower than Don "The Dragon" Wilson, for example), and with vehicles like "The Expert", you can see why.
We would see disaster as the result of man's folly - think "The Towering Inferno" for example - but also as the quirky acts of nature they are.
Eponine, for example, was the key to the complex plot of Les Miserables.
the dialogue is dull, and there is zero character developement for some side roles that might have saved at least a bit of the movie, for example daniel craig and lance reddick are completely ignored and wasted.
A must-see sleeper for those who prefer (for example) Merchant & Ivory over Van Damme & Seagal.
Outside of some amusing set-pieces, like the much-discussed Carrie-inspired decapitation by can-opener, Everett's short-tempered surgeon yanking the innards out of his patient to hurl at his derisive colleagues, the use of John Williams' ominous theme from Jaws (the punchline to this bit is best left to the adventurous viewer) and virtually every moment spent in the company of a deliriously hammy Vincent Price, Bloodbath is a dour and po-faced affair indeed, saddled with rather too much genuine tastelessness (Pamela Stephenson rapidly coming to enjoy being raped by a poltergeist, for example) and the most feeble of finales to make much of an impact.
The editing and direction in this movie are non existent..as for example whenever it wants it will show random shots of hands moving things and random shots of characters faces for no reason.
It is hard to believe that THE DARWIN CONSPIRACY was made in 1999 as it plays like really bad TV of the 1970's; indeed, the director's earliest work was in 1970's TV ("Barnaby Jones" for example).
Of course you can come across very good low budget movies, and this certainly doesn't rank as one of the worst I've seen by any stretch of the imagination (see scarecrow or the Pumpkin Karver for that accolade for example), but this could have been so much better.
If you don't understand me let me break it down, for example (this does happen in the movie) problem: they realize the Icarus 1 is still orbiting around the sun, there is a distress call and the crew of the Icarus 2 believe there could be someone still there, or they could take the bomb from the Icarus one and use it in case their bomb doesn't work to restart the sun.
A lot of things are left unanswered, for example the captain dies and one of the crew members is like 'captain...what did you see...what did you see?'
If you watch it more then once in (for example) a month, then there's something obviously wrong with you, and you should seek counselling.
I rarely had a clear idea as to where anything was in this ship; for example, the viewing room was cut into the bomb's heat shield, but there was no impression that anyone had to walk through the bomb area to get there.
There is some unintentional amusement to ZIZEK like for example he describes a child watching television as " narcissistic amusement " ( WTF !?
Some might think I'm nitpicking, and I might be, as in some other movies (pulpy exploitation flicks, for example) I wouldn't point out these things.
It definitely doesn't say life or youth ends when your hair go off but it says that some things should be understood not by experience but for example by other people around us or art depicting these things.
The second one is very close to Dario Argento's style but serves not any other purpose than itself, unlike the great usage of similar effect in Argento's Tenebre (1982) for example.
I really don't believe this witch thing, for example, is healthy.
I don't mind abstract references that would seemingly change the storyline (the four protagonists becoming part of Wonka's candy, but seconds later reverting to normal, for example), but these "Family Guy" style cutaways were so poorly done, it almost made me want to leave.
"Cutting Class" is easily one of the most awful slasher flicks from the late 80's.Brian returns back to college aged 18 after spending five years in a mental asylum for killing his father.He tries to worm his way back into the lives of his ex-best friend Dwight and Paula his old flame.And suddenly a bunch of people start dying,in the most bizarre and stupid ways in slasher film history.There is for example death by pottery kiln,death by photocopier,but my favourite is the old classic,flagpole under a trampoline so the fascist Gym teacher gets impaled on the American Flag.
Take for example the films most memorable moment - the break in to the CIA building to steal half of the 'NOC' list.
In addition to that, some scenes are so illogical that they are already silly, for example the helicopter in the tunnel, not to mention the often criticized fact of making an arch villain out of Jim or the stereotypic dialogues.
It could never be a guilty pleasure for me, like Wrong Turn, for example.
Other sci-fi movies can't even compare for example Gattaca.
There were a lot of holes in the movie, for example with the president's family.
Another poster here noted that 'Moonlight Mile' is so much better than, for example, the trite cartoons of Quentin Tarantino.
There are some fairly good performances, namely Jack, Beth and Hawks, but others are ridiculously bad (assasin droid for example).
Even some rather natural and, frankly speaking, amazing scenes, for example, with strange fish crawling in aborigine's fundament or the reanimation of a monkey with the help of rubber tube can't save the movie from total failure, at least in my eyes.
Some of the editing is very bad, for example, Keitel standing on a elevated road, and a second later getting on a tram down at ground level with no explanation as to how he got down there (that part's probably on the cutting room floor.)
Instead of fixing the glaring problems of the previous seasons, they introduced new ones, contradicting a lot of stuff, and creating whole story lines -the aforementioned "final five", for example- that in the end turned out to be just a big red herring.
I have no idea what motivates Frank Abagnale, for example.
Carroll Baker's character, for example, is initially portrayed as a real bitch that protects her poodle from the burning sun rather than to rescue fellow human beings, but when the climax approaches she suddenly transformed into one of the most amiable people on board.
There are some real unpleasant scenes in the film, and while this might have pleased some people; they are not done very well at all and a scene that sees a man kill a dog, for example, looks incredibly fake and stupid.
You don't actually learn anything, so you can't pick up on normal social clues that everyone else does - Charlie, for example, gets beaten up in school because he doesn't pick up that a tough guy and his sycophant in the high school bathroom are people to avoid.
This was Flynn's first Western, and he doesn't really look at home among the grizzled cast: he's too fair-skinned for that weatherbeaten crew, too well-groomed in a world of straggly facial hair (the trademark Flynn pencil moustache isn't really appropriate here), too neatly dressed to fit in with the rest of the town, and a somewhat self-conscious grin has a tendency to turn up at inappropriate moments (as he disclaims the role of Sheriff, for example), suggesting that he was not entirely certain of himself in the part.
(wished his character was in it longer) and kudos getting Al Jourgensens music and some of the special effects (head in microwave for example)...but other than that.......Unless you are a crew or cast member STAY AWAY!
Errol Flynn would later play some great roles in westerns (for example, They Died with Their Boots On), but here he is really just playing Robin Hood in a Stetson, and only the vaguest attempt at an American accent (although, like Captain Blood, he's supposed to be an Irishman here, making his plummy English tones even more bizarre).
Crap movies like "The whole 9 yards" for example, had much, much more financial backup so they get more attention and credit.
Maybe the golden years of sleazy & campy "Women in Prison" were long history by then already; maybe it didn't get properly promoted or announced in trailers (like "Reform School Girls", for example) or maybe it's just not good enough to compete with other & more successful films with a similar theme, but "Hell Hole" is a totally anonymous & overlooked 80's exploitation flick that only a handful of genre fanatics have heard of.
Most movies that show non-urban, non-coastal US cities fall into a trap of playing the setting and the characters for laughs, or at least exaggerating the local color for effect (witness Coen Brothers movies, for example).
Jones would later make some far stronger patriotic propaganda films that managed to be both informative and entertaining (the wonderful 'So Much for So Little' for example) but 'Old Glory' always leaves me yelling "For the love of god, somebody drop an anvil"!
What did these actors for example eat: were they on speed or what?
The Ricky-character for example is good for a few unintended laughs , but I think the director told him to say whatever words came to his mind, so that he could mumble through the film.
The opening sequence, for example, could've been a moment in the movie that all moviegoers will remember just like in the first Ring, but instead it was in short... stupid.
How is it possible that the people are so dumb to go watch rubbish like that and wanted for example.
Meanwhile, Mr. Carson has married another womanÂ   Even for the time, the comedy dialog in "John Loves Mary" must have sounded remarkably unsophisticated; listen, for example, to the scene when Reagan explains how he dealt with "loneliness" during his four years of service.
You can't, for example, make a scene with a little kid having a touching conversation with a lonely homeless woman and immediately follow it up with wacky cartoon antics.
Compare for example the acting in Star Wars - a new hope, with The empire strikes back.
Today an actor can convey a world of meaning whilst quietly sitting at a table by, for example, just raising an eyebrow and uttering the word "Really" in an appropriately questioning tone.
In silent days a one word caption "Really" would be almost as effective but the scene at the table, filmed from 5 or 10 metre away, would not do justice to the raised eyebrow in the same way as a modern close up, filmed from a distance of no more than a metre; so I can watch, for example, the 1925 version of Ben Hur more readily than I can Bullets over Broadway - improved technology has made us much less tolerant of artefacts that destroy the intended atmosphere.
The film makes some curious omissions; it doesn't mention, for example, that both Abbott's and Costello's wives were burlesque dancers, which is where they all met.
Seventies background, for example, is good: cars, clothes, caracterization of support actors...
Besides the rather loose and fast rules about drugs (Calling marijuana more dangerous than heroin for example), the producers also tend to have difficulty with things like suspense and continuity.
Portia de Rossi tries hard, but is hobbled by the bad script (it is, for example,not well explained why she is so good with a gun, and then not well utilized when push comes to shove).
I could go on for a good while yet, mentioning for example the 'influences' from other films that verge on plagiarism (the madness scene in the asylum looked as though it was lifted straight out of the 1930 'Dracula'), or what indeed that whole scene had to do with anything, but what would be the point?
Croghan adds in her own dose of tricks along the way to make sure it definitely sets it apart from other films, for example watch out for the ongoing discussion of a lady's handbag!
Even if some of the incidents could be regarded as comical (for example, the butler's frequent collisions with a tiger's head on the floor), their very repetitiousness engenders tedium.
The opening sequence, for example, is close to genius as it seems to be a clichÃ©d situation but turns out surprising and original.
There's only one good thing about this movie: It's so bad it's funny (for example, the scene with the flamethrower).
for example when johnny is chasing the ex presidents in his car after they had robbed a bank why did he not call for backup to cut them off?
One Fine Spring Day, for example, does a wonderful job of showing the emotional roller-coaster of a typical relationship from beginning to end.
Every time he connects with a previous day, you see it coming - the jail scenes, for example.
The turtle costumes and splinter looked horrible as compared to the other films and the jokes are old and tired, for example - "Im a turtle and i can't get up".
Though its not as realistic as for example Olaf Ittenbach's gore in "Premutos" and "Burning Moon" , but pretty solid.
also considering th ratings of many other soaps/dramas, for example east-enders, coronation street and more recent ones such as torch wood, heartbeat does not really compare.
The end of the movie made absolutely no sense....it made my head hurt and my girlfriend still has a confused look on her face the next morning ;) I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for examples of no talent....otherwise...curl up on the toilet with a nice magazine and you'll probably be more entertained.
Yes, french comedies are great, like the TAXI series for example, which I love very much.
Like, for example, the use of Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song in Shriek III.
Moreover, watching Chinese speaking Italian (some are VERY badly dubbed) is kind of ridiculousÂ Chinese proverbs are scattered in the screenplay, and no one of them makes any senseÂ The ships and the setting are indeed beautiful, but why not spending all the money they cost in other stuff, an average screenplay writer and an average director for exampleÂ oh, I see, they are the same person.
I sort of like the cheap and dirty feel to it - I've always thought cheapness adds a murky atmosphere to horror flicks, take "Midnight" by John Russo for example.
Kirk Douglas, for example, seems to have accepted the role simply to enjoy some saucy nude scenes with sexy co-star Farrah Fawcett.
These kids who watch the shows today will become filmmakers of the future and they deserve to be entertained by the finest...take shows like Young Dacula for example a British show that excels past any other kid show in the last decade of British shows.
The patchy narrative told through little bits of footage means there's a slightly fractured feel about The Zombie Diaries & it feels that large chunks of exposition is missing as certain aspects don't make sense or just seem to happen at random (that woman zombie found in a barn for example along with scenes bookending the film featuring soldiers).
I didn't think it was THAT bad (not "up" to Death in Venice standard for example) but by the end I was wondering what point the film-maker was actually trying to make.
It scores a point for nudity but the kills are pretty lacklustre, when compared to some classics such as Friday the 13th, Halloween 2 and The Burning for example.
"Sonatine",for example, does have moments of great lyrical beauty, a sense of humor and poetic feeling.
The plot, what there is of it, doesn't make much sense and the film doesn't explain why certain things are happening, Price's wifes relationship with one of the guests for example.
They show more than Deodato did in Cut and Run, for example, but as everything around the scenes sucks, it is hard to take the horror shocks too seriously.
There is one good side to this movie however and that is it can be used in video classes at universities to show an example of what not to do when making a movie of any kind, for example, don't even make a movie that is so boring people can tell by looking at the actors faces.2 : spend the extra money and get a wardrobe so the actors can change clothes 3: don't use archive footage and if you absolutely must use archive footage don't get footage that doesn't make sense, like a single car exploding next to a body of water doesn't make sense when matched with an explosion or accident of two cars in a land locked area.
The movies should stick to established fairy tales, and leave making up modern ones to politicians and their spin doctors, for example: We come as liberators, that's why we are building a dozen or two permanent bases in your country!
Some of the scenes in "Apartment 1303" even fully replicate (or perhaps I should say 'steal from') "The Grudge" but are less effective in every way (for example, the scene in "The Grudge 2" where victims are attacked by the ghost's hair also appears here in much the same way).
Certain characters remain on the periphery and are never fleshed out (the portly and thoroughly unattractive - in ever way - police partner of Mickey Rourke, for example), bizarre appendages that don't help the plot at all; scenes that stretch credulity over coals and are literally impossible to believe (the takeover of Ariane's apartment by Rourke and his two pals; what the hell led to this?
Finger-length shorts, for example, isn't just a recommended guideline: it's a rule, the breaking of which can result in being kicked out of school.
Comments: First of all, I have not read the novel, I just rented the movie expecting a good action filled war movie, as suggested by the poster for example.
Nevertheless, the film will interest mystery fans who enjoy the hardcore analytical aspects of detective work as depicted in traditional mystery novels (Agatha Christie and Conan Doyle fans for example), and, of course, Ellery Queen aficionados.
When a helicopter crashes, for example, you only see the the tail after the explosion.
First, the principal characters have been given colorful histories or eccentricities seemingly only to keep them from being completely uninteresting otherwise or to fill time (for example, Luthor's post-coma extrasensory power).
The overlaid 80's Casio keyboard soundtrack for example, made this film seem (well what it is) very very 80's cheese.
If you compare for example, Saphira and Gollum.
There's no reason for Street Fighter to be on this movie, they could have just as easily called it some generic action movie title (Sweet Revenge for example) and taken away the names of the characters and there you go.
Chun Li is meant to be Chinese yet you've chosen an actress who has problem speaking the language in the movie (when for example she asks for help which she asked in a terrible accent).
Take Marvel for example, their world interacts a lot of different marvel characters, but when it comes to their own movie/cartoon, they actually make the story relevant to the characters life(e.g just because Bison was the boss, it doesn't mean that Chun Li's life has to be revolved around killing him (which is what Ryu does)).
for example (in one scene involving the "friendly zombie" bud.. (anyone who had even seen the original day of the dead (which so happen to be my all time favourite horror film btw!
The jokes seem laboured, for example, the drawn out fart joke.
Her fight with Christy Chung for example is extremely tasteless, as Lui imitates martial arts stances and goes through a bumbling slapstick routine, mere minutes after a young girl watched her mother machine gunned before her eyes.
A fighting scene for example: Some bad guys shoot a kid and the hero catches the kid in the moment he's hit by the bullet, so he can die in the heros arms.
Another work, John D. McDonalds' book "Condominium", for example, dealt with similar subject matter but with an intelligence and style that allowed the protagonists to be understandable and even sympathetic characters in spite of their flaws.
Take this rarely seen and obscure piece of Spanish awkwardness, for example!
I thought the acting was over-the-top and too exaggerated, for example, the swell of 'sexy' 40's era music that played every time Scarlett Johanssen appeared in a scene.
"Pet Sematary 2" is a totally unnecessary sequel to the first "Pet Sematary",which has to be one of my favourite horror movies of all time.Instead of suspense it is loaded with gore and repulsive violence.The acting is pretty bad,the characters are one-dimensional and the film is completely idiotic in places(for example how our boys managed to carry the body of Gus through the quagmire?
Yeah OK they were real sideshow performers, but I thought that for example the wolf man, or wolf boy played by veekay, was really a wolf boy/man... but apparently he just had a bunch of hair stuck to his face..
If you like this kind of movies, you better rent and see "Dracula 2000" with Gerard Butler, for example
The film "Manticore", for example was low budget but it did stand up because the acting was good.
), the fight choreography is sometimes clumsy, and there should have been more action - the climactic fight, for example, should have been longer than 1 minute!
In all fairness, the film contains a handful of powerful sequences (like, for example, Christine's exhausting interrogation) as well as neatly atmospheric set pieces and steady direction by Robert Collector.
But, amongst all such movies, you will find minor classics or examples of the so-bad-its-good calibre (BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE for example).
There are quite a lot of gruesome murders and their bloody aftermaths on display and some of the make up effects are even TOO repulsive, like for example Mrs. Lovett's dental hygiene.
Like this week's episode for example.
for example, the last fight scene with the giant robot and the Avatar.
More than one investigator, for example, goes into the prison undercover and gets killed trying to stop the drug trade.
The film, while American, set in Connecticut and shot in Canada, feels almost foreign, as if it were set in Germany, for example.
The plot is everything but good (a guy wakes up to find out that he has "lost" his penis), the acting is poor - Joop for example mumbles his lines which makes it sometimes very hard to understand him at all - and the few attempts to be fun (Jekyll tries to have sex even without his penis) simply fail.
nano bugs eating pollution for example?
In some situations he is shown as extreme--using an alcohol wipe to open his own medicine cabinet door, for example--but then the next second he is touching people and objects willy-nilly and not appearing to be bothered at all.
Too many elements are extraneous and never used--for example the entire storyline (if you can call it that) of the roommate, which neither goes anywhere nor adds anything.
Take for example the scene where star John Clay is grilled by a policeman after bringing someone to the hospital.
If you have to watch this film (for example as a punishment in a prison or something) shut your eyes and close your ears!!
The fight scenes were filmed slowly, for example when an actor through a punch he made his fist move slowly as if going to pet a strange dog.
But usually we witness an arc of some sort, for example Blood Diamond's mercenary character, the aging gangster in Charlie Valentine, or the cold hit man in The Killer, all undergo a redemption of sorts.
Even when there is no apparent arc, for example Lee Marvin in Point Blank, Mel Gibson in Payback, Benicio del Toro and Ryan Phillipe in Way of the Gun, or Warren Oates in Bring Me The Head of Alfredo Garcia, the main characters are of interest and not one dimensional.
Ridiculousness abounds, and not in a good/funny way: at one point, for example, a ten-minute monologue takes place entirely by text messaging.
The protagonists are for example a Shadmock and a Humghoul!
I normally like easy and dull comedies - for example scary movie series - but this failed even for me.
Eastwood even changed some of the people completely, for example Mandy is actually nothing like Eastwood's daughter in the movie.
You know, for example, obscure post-apocalyptic cult flicks like "Holocaust 2000", "Escape 2000" and "Death Race 2000" were tremendous fun to watch, so I was fairly confident that this one would be cool too, especially since the title refers to a type of heavy machine gun.
I've liked Jennifer Jason Leigh in some films--I absolutely love eXistenZ (1999) for example, and she certainly can act like "someone other than herself", which a lot of people seem to use as one of the main criteria for "good acting", but her character here is so annoying that I couldn't wait for the film to be over.
So to see middle-aged, A-listers tackle this kind of flimsy plot gives the movie a bit more strength, but fails in a lot of areas to actually be the kind of laugh-out-loud movie that "The 40 Year Old Virgin" was, for example.
Some camera shots just don't make sense (the camera angles from outside the camp, looking in, for example).
Anyone who has seen an episode of a real documentary series (THE FBI FILES for example) will immediately be able to tell that the "experts" in this fake documentary are actors (and very bad ones at that).
I mean, when we watch "Ghostbusters" for example, we know that the script is a cartoon and no one stops to consider if it could have happened.
The main character, Yu, for example, recovers multiple times after being a hair breadths away from death.
The acting was unimpressive, save for perhaps O'Quinn(whose presence in the episode, coupled with our attraction to the genre of science fiction were largely the reasons we watched the episode), but Rohm, for example, is just... bad.
The rest of the film just tries way too hard to be funny which makes the film look really silly, like Police Academy for example (except that had more funny moments but there weren't many).
The romance of the marriage couple is portrayed in a very, very realistic way, for example, I think that was the best part of the movie.
This works in other movies, like Scream, for example.
Youth Runs Wild, a more serious RKO teen film from that same year, shed a lot of light on how gas rationing and 24-hour factory shifts, for example, affected young people's behavior.
Crap movies like "The whole 9 yards" for example, had much, much more financial backup so they get more attention and credit.
As a result, anyone who tries to bring a bit of life to things (Liz Smith and Joan Sanderson, for example) are shot down as soon as they appear on the same set as Tommy and Tuppence.
There are a few scares in this movie but all of which are of the cheap variety for example "ghostly shadow walks past in background" "deathly face in mirror" "hand coming out of the ground" the list really does go on and that is where all the scares come from seriously.
To me it came across like an extremely clichÃ©d horror comedy that in many scenes made no sense at all (for example the dead horse woman pointing somewhere) and was stolen from loads of movies you know anyway.
So we all have to stay indoors and watch, for example, this movie.
I love the character of Dick Martin (Romilly Lunge) for example.
Take for example the music.
(I remember, for example, a theatrical short where Funt, as a travel agent, insisted, with total courtesy and friendliness, on selling a customer a fancy vacation when they wanted something plain and simple.)
It's a far better, more enduring film, in fact, than some of the documentary "classics" (GREY GARDENS, for example) that were made in the same era.
Other English DBZ movies are good but are better left Japanese, for example; The History of Trunks.
It is of interest only to two groups-- those who are starved for any version of MACROSS: DO YOU REMEMBER LOVE and those who are (masochistically) looking for examples of how badly manga can get mangled....
This very fact contributes to elevate the value of the movie, which becomes ( like Easy Rider, for example) an ambassador of an extinct generation to the future generations.
You have to take into account that John Milius is an all-American director, who-for example- shot Red Dawn, an example of American paranoia of the Red danger.
If they could only make films like this these days, instead of poor attempts at remakes of classics (Shaft, for example).
Learning about the stairway floating out allowing for easier access to the interior of the ship for example I did not know about.
A few things that are major events in the book are treated as non-events in the movie, for example, the fact that Henry's first time travel was out of the car when his mother died is the very first thing revealed in the movie, when it is something of a breakthrough mental moment for Henry in the book.
There is nothing, for example, about the exercises that Colin indirectly learns from Bob Haworth in order to strengthen his legs, there's nothing about Colin's plans to become a scientist and an explorer and a lecturer (this kid wanted to be Indiana Jones and they didn't even mention it in the movie!
The screenplay is good and comparable to resident evil's 1 game, for example there is a traitor who walk among them just like Wesker!
Watch the byplay during the funeral, for example.
Take, for example, 'Broken Blossoms (1919),' where a Chinese immigrant (portrayed, admittedly, by American Richard Barthelmess) is shown to be, by far, the film's most compassionate and respectable male character.
There are also references to the American pop culture that I unfortunately have not understood, like for example Dr. Phil, the Oprah talk show in the end (see Obs.)
Some of the story lines are truly memorable and stick with you for years (for example, Sami on trial for Franco's murder).
That may sound ridiculous but the PBS News Hour and occasionally CNN do it regularly when Iraqis or Pakistanis or Afghans, for example, are being interviewed in English that is hard for viewers to understand.
Chris, already a bit of an iconoclast in the Women's Institute whose ideas have not always worked, for example a vodka tasting evening, comes up with the idea of a calendar in which her friends, all in their fifth or sixth decades, will pose in the buff.
Well, getting back to, for example, those long walks on the beach: these are really...long...walks...on...the...beach.
One he is cured, an interesting chain of humiliating events that bring Alex even farther down ensue: he is, for example, now attacked by his very ex-mates, now policemen, and his ex-victims.
"Rudy," for example.
You will understand some scenes better, for example where the number salad comes from on the computer screen in the phone booth.
The scene in the countryside between Marcos and his wife for example.
There are some directors I loathe (take, for example, Kevin Smith), but at least I can see that they are talented-it's just, to quote good ol' Mr. Ebert, they use their talent in an unworthy way.
There's only one good thing about this movie: It's so bad it's funny (for example, the scene with the flamethrower).
"Dreamaniac" is a typical 80's horror/adult movie trash full of sex and mindless teenagers.Atrocious acting,plenty of fake blood and stupid disco music.Some gore effects are interesting(for example drill through the throat at the end),but also very cheesy.Complete lack of suspense is hard to forgive.So if you find this movie skip it.
How is the young singer from the UK, for example?
Jean-Claude Dreyfus as Clapet the Butcher is simply delightful as the story's "villian", and basically every member of the cast delivers an unforgettable performance no matter how long or short is their screen time (Silvie Laguna for example, is really wonderful).
Unlike many of his Scorcese roles to name for example, Pesci as Gambini comes across to audiences as likable, humorous and sociable.
for example Anna's mother makes a comment that she can get the kind of issues-political writing she is turning her repertoire to published in Marie Clare, but later throws out a copy of the magazine when her article isn't published, proving that just because you want to save the world doesn't mean Marie Clare does.
This indecisive behavior leads to an illogical structure and uneven pacing, for example when a moody love-making sequence is immediately followed by an extremely violent murder vision.
The overlong chase sequence, for example, is the least spectacular one in the history of cinema.
Add to that an unexpected, underlying morality and some of the most creative one-shots I've seen in a while (the zombie who eats himself, for example) and you've got a helluva ride.
The sinister Budapest filming locations form the ideal setting for a tale like this, but everything else is entirely Giagni's accomplishment (like, for example, empty swings and toy balls bouncing seemly by themselves).
-- see the enjoyable "D'Artagnan's Daughter" of 1994, for example!)
Many of the characters are not believable, for example the central villain is a "bad cop" who is just laughable in the way he is portrayed as pure evil.
She knew that the bottle belonged to Greg Dyson and that the person who placed it into Palgraves cabinet must have been either him or somebody who had access to his suite Â the hotel manager, for example.
"Cannibal Man" is a slow-paced Spanish shocker that contains some graphic gore.The film is also extremely stylish and the atmosphere of decay and frustration is simply overwhelming.It certainly gained some notoriety as a former video nasty in the UK,but it's nowhere nearly as explicit as for example Lucio Fulci's gorefests.However the most interesting fact is that Eloy de la Iglesia was one of the major directors to push Spanish censorship boundaries with this film and a number of powerful gay-oriented films like "El Diputado" or "Los Placeres Ocultos".So if you are a fan of Spanish horror give it a try.8 out of 10.

In this regard, the story mimics many classic works of samurai fiction, for example, where the hero denies his own desires in the name of a personal moral code.
The film introduces other "styles of life", for example a group of bumbling burglar teens, a hit-man (Vinnie Jones) and his translator, an advertising guru who thinks every think she makes is the pinnacle of hilarity, and a family that apparently has a few issues of their own to deal with.
