in this Movie Dana Carvey hides his face behind many disguises.unfortunately someone also hid all the laughs,somewhere no one will likely find them.this is billed as a comedy,which is OK,but it's not funny.it's not even amusing.it is however,stupid in all the bad ways possible there are some talented actors in this movie,but i guess sometimes actors sign without reading the script,(or what passes for one,in this case)Dana Carvey certainly has some comedic talent,but aside from the two "Wayne's World" films,he hasn't has a chance to showcase it.i kinda felt sorry for all involved.it was truly embarrassing and painful to watch.i'd have to give "Master Of Disguise" 2/10
Unlike other shows such as The Mighty Boosh or The League of Gentlemen which spawned mass publicity, cult followings and travelling shows, Garth Marenghi only ran for one series and still survives due to its popularity among the fans.

This movie also tells us how relationships are whether they are a one-night stand or a serious one.It makes us realize the difference between the two and how two people fall for one another upon meeting each other at night.With regards to acting,Susie Porter did a very good job and so did her partner.Also,the film was very realistic in its presentation.

Bad editing, over use of slow motion, horrible script, and bad plot all make for one terrible movie.
this is one of the best time travel movies i have seen.it's vaguely similar to the Philadelphia Experiment but on a much larger scale.i also think it's a much better movie.for one thing,there's way more tension and suspense and you really can sense the fear and desperation of the ship's crew.this one will have you on the edge of your seat.the acting here is very strong all around.there's no weak link in the bunch.there no slow spots either.the movie flows at a nice steady pace,and keeps you interested right to the end.i'd highly recommend it as a rental at the very least.i purchased a copy which was more than worth it.for me,The Final Countdown is an 8.7/10
We never for one minute believe Kirk Douglas is really the captain of the Nimitz.
His gift for dry English understatement is the occasion for one especially humorous scene-stealing moment that I will generously leave to the curious viewer to enjoy for himself.

A flashback to 1940s era Japan for one of the girls is seen by all of the girls as if in an old newsreel.

Before I saw Death Wish, I knew there was more than just the context of it being a starring vehicle for one of the major bad-asses of the action picture, Charles Bronson (who's best role is still the one with the least words, Once Upon a Time in the West), and that it contains the elements that would spark an entire sub-genre (for better or worse).
Except for one thing: Donna D. looked incredible.

Instead of going for the trippy style of "Requiem for a Dream" or the barebones realism of "Drugstore Cowboy" -- Gunnerson wisely doesn't aim for one extreme.

I think I am, and the audience too, are sick in wanting to watch our eye candy cast, whom we don't really give a damn about, become target practice for one of the cult killers of cinema.

I, for one am grateful Louis Malle was able to do so.
The movie doesn't hold up to close scrutiny (how did the money hanging under a pier not rot from three years' worth of salt water for one) but it is highly entertaining and noir fans should definitely take a look.
We learn early through the narration that this soldier did not survive the war so his journey home to visit his mother for one last time becomes all the more poignant.
Some other users have commented on the movie not being multi dimensional, but I think that the way that the characters reacted are pretty realistic, and most people (generally) are multi dimensional but may only show one side of their selves for one reason or another, and don't forget that this movie is focused from the point of view of Henry Kray.
I just saw this movie yesterday and I for one, thought it was a terrific movie.

In fact, the whole time I was watching it, I was thinking "This would have made a great premise for one of the mid-90's Hong Kong Cat III films"- it just had that sort of feel to it.
Eastwood laconically pulls it off with dominant ease and certain authority of truly delving into this character (as now there's more to that monomaniacal search for one's own justice), as his hands out punishment (against a bunch of terrorists who call themselves 'The People's Revolutionary') and has time to let fly what he really thinks.

One of the college dorms used for one of the story segments is rumored to be haunted, and maverick wunderkind Quentin Tarentino has championed the movie, supposedly owning his own print which he screens for people who don't know any better than to go do something else just because it's Quentin Tarentino showing it.

The voice cast is the same as the first movie, except for one major difference: Genie.
Its amazing to me too how many commented how closely it followed the Gospel of Matthew,,,,,yet it left out quite a bit and actually mixed up, for one reason or another the sequence of events.

I thought the moments of how the past affected the future were all plausible except for one moment toward the very end of the film, which was clearly done for dramatic effect, (so I'll let it go).
In McCarey's film, a trans-Atlantic liner becomes a metaphor for love: two people fall hopelessly for one another, becoming adrift on a vessel of passion that precludes all former relationships or future life plans.
While most modern action films (Smokin' Aces for one) aspire to some sort of grand intelligence while providing shoot-outs and explosions, this film is a reminder of times when action films suffered no such pretensions.
Except for one or two sequences, they don't play against each other, they play with each otherÂa feat that is more difficult to bring off successfully.

Her party cost US$ 150 000 in the end, for one night.
Starcraft is a definite winner for one of the best RTS (real time strategy) games.
tight, powerful action sequences bound together by a futuristic plot, with art direction a la "blade runner" make this movie a contender for one of the best action films of the past years.
If it wasn't for the slightly desperate final 20 minutes then this could've been a contender for one of the best films I've watched this year.
He is an unassuming, articulate gent and discusses his interest in shocking audiences, why he wanted to mix erotica with horror, and how he may have been responsible for one of his performers turning gay.
Well, I for one, almost gave it a miss (as it is I am not a huge fan of Mr.Bansali).
In short, please do not subject yourself to scenes of graphic brutality and confusing political analysis just to give the apologists for one of the most brutal regimes in the history of the world a chance to make their case!
No, it's nothing ground breakingly original, but then it never pretends to be for one minute.
I for one suspect thats probably the case with out humble director trying more to put one over on his audience rather than enlighten them.
I got the feeling that this film was tossed together as a vehicle for one or two of the younger actors in it.
When combined with the haunting the black & white photography it makes for one of the best looking examples of the film noir genre.
I guess if one saw it over and over, and if one had an overactive imagination, one could create for oneself a story line.
I for one liked the pace of the film.
I for one am also happy that Ghost stories are making a comeback, and I would much sooner jump in my chair a few times than cringe or hide my eyes or be disgusted by the graphic slasher films also doing the rounds.
Because of this he has to pay a one-hundred-rupee note just for one ice lolly.
There are some moments where one or other actors does not feel awkward but this movie has wonderful drive and you will get bored even for one second.
It might well be the epitome of Hollywood entertainment during its golden era with the colorful legendary characters - all flawlessly enacted by one of the best casts ever brought together for one film - supplying comedy (and not just that involving Una O'Connor and Herbert Mundin, which I didn't find as icky as I remembered it!
The event will only be remembered for one thing, Rey Mysterio's shock victory in the 30 man over the top rope battle royal.
I just can't believe I bought this film for one dollar.
participate in a race around the world for one million dollars.
The supporting roles are fine, with Laura (the 18-year old daughter of one of the friends and femme fatale for one of the other friends) delivering some magnificent Lolita eye candy.
I for one will be there in line to watch their work.
It also seems tantalizing to imagine if MGM decided to stick out "Our Gang" for one more year, until after World War II ended, I'll bet there would have been a patriotic-themed musical episode, like "Calling All Kids!"
Doing something for one specific purpose without realizing that we are being lead by fate , I presume, to an existential cul-de-sac.
Jude Law is back in top form and I for one want to cheer.
Frankly, me neither, and I have not even looked for one, for I was the movie house projectionist and I saw the movie enough times to remember about it many years to come.
If the FX weren't so horribly bad (I assume they were made on a Commodore 64) it wouldn't be so horrible (the script still needs some work), but they are so amateur and dated that the film simply can't be taken seriously at all, making the performances seem ridiculously over acted, (the performances that is, not the 'actors' that turned up for one day of shooting to take their clothes off, stage some unconvincing scenes and swim in filthy lake).
It falls horribly short, making for one amusing B movie wannabe.
Your in for one hell of a ride.
By the end, the effects of each different subplot can be seen on each other, all coming together for one climactic moment.
I, for one, can never get enough of Chloe Webb or John Malkovitch or Joe Mantegna, and this movie supplies all in a stunning array.
I don't find his character or any of the other players here believable for one second.
It definitely leaves room for one last movie.
I, for one, definitely do not see homosexualisty as an avant-garde attitude in principle.
If you're better than that then you're in for one helluva crazy ride.
It's really more of a character study, a kind of "opposites attract" romance develops regarding how two completely different people find a mutual growing friendship and love for one another despite their glaring differences.
They also share great love for one another, though they quibble like all human beings do.
The infected person only appears for one morning in downtown and midtown Manhattan, which may be scarier than someone criss-crossing the planet with a biological weapon.
When oh when will I learn that the bargain priced movies in the bin at Walmart are there for one reason.
I, for one, am quite glad that Blake made it.
I, for one, had a blast watching it.
The movie's message is lost somewhat under the barrage of jokes; but it's most certainly there and I for one think that it's a shame that a movie that is entertaining and funny can't be considered in the same league as other, more serious movies with a similar message.
I recently had the pleasure of acquiring a copy of this movie, and I, for one, am going to treasure it.
Actually, there's enough there for one, easily.
The movie has no female actress accept for one, who make a brief appearance at the beginning as the landlady.
I for one own the movie on DVD.
Singer chose to go with black leather outfits and I, for one, am very thankful for this choice.
It was actually remade Â and considerably improved upon Â by THE SHOOTING OF DAN McGOO (1945), a Droopy 'vehicle'; while remarkably similar in many respects to the later classic, one of my favorite Averys, it is a minor (if still highly enjoyable) effort Â for one thing, because of an anonymous i.e.
Paul Giamatti is a sinister delight and able to match Owens one-liner for one-liner.
I would recommend this film for one reason alone - the soundtrack.
TERMINATER: SALVATION is truly an abomination to the franchise - and don't for one second suspect otherwise.
Recently, I have studied for one semester at a university in London and therefor I was very keen to see "Wonderland" when I got back to Germany.
I actually prefer Kikyo over Kagome but for one, she's way too old for InuYasha.
The movie has a strange calmness with some beautiful scenes ... except for one particular scene (and having seen Irreversible this is tame) I don't understand what people find shocking about Mysterious skin.
But Neil has a need to trust his in soul-mate, the girl who does everything for him, even gets God on the phone for Neil, just so he can believe in something for one single moment in his life, something that isn't a joke told by his best friend.
You can't imagine for one moment that a king would make Grand Constable a man who was caught stealing food from the royal storehouse.
Equally as significant is the revelation of the killer, which I have to admit was quite clever; I never, ever would have guessed and that is rare for one of these.
There is so little respect for one another that I sometimes question the friendships.
But I for one am sick of gloss and special effects and actors who command nine-digit fees.
Two years after they had solemnly admitted their feelings for one another, they meet again.
So It must have taken some measure of courage to make this movie, for one of its two themes is racism.
I for one found it exquisitely erotic (and frequently sweetly funny with the lovers' DIY approach to S&M), even - or especially, perhaps - in its more extreme moments, all of which handled beautifully by the two non-professional leads.
French people have a tendency for long and deep conversations about not too offensive and personal subjects as a way of courtesy and care for one's private life, so this is rather challenging stuff I guess.
Their two characters find themselves uneasily sharing a hotel room for one night, waiting for transportation snafus to be cleared up.
They don't have much time anyway because, before you know it, they discover a lost civilization of pale Sumerians who live on mushrooms, except for one beautiful babe (Cynthia Patrick, the best actor in the bunch) who looks reasonably human and has something resembling a tan.
I guess if the story has a moral to it, it's that for one star in 'shimmering firmament' to be born one has to die.
Hollywood of those years was a factory of dreams where many went to be part of it, but for one Esther Blodgett, there were thousands who were rejected.
But I for one couldn't, so it's straight into the bin with you Sanitarium!
So Willard and his best bud, restaurant manager Rusty P. Hayes (played by the hilarious Dave Chappelle), set out to give Miss Crock the big screw: steal her beloved Pomeranian and hold him for ransom for one million dollars.
I for one would not stand for it.
Some years later I have finally been privileged as well as honoured to see the long lost footage from the final battle scenes in "Game of Death" and to see the master in action for one final time.
Richard Anderson is not for one minute convincing either as a doctor investigating the strange zombie-like creature, or as a lover to the artist/love interest Elaine Edwards.
I have known so many skinny women in my life that were absolutely revolting in a bikini for one simple fact.
The ending for one is rather ham-fisted, and a scene between the oldest son and his school therapist seemed awfully pat to me.
But, I gave this one an "8" score for one very good reason: It accomplished what it set out to do, and it did leave me happy that I'd watched it.
The movie was very good - I'd say excellent if it weren't for one thing:  The actors and director basically took the script in a completely different direction than the writer wanted initially.
Louise and Albert have been married for nine years and she needs Albert to write her a check for one thousand dollars for the merchandise that she bought for here antique store.
The make-up and prosthetics, tattoos, scarification of the cast, as well as the overall look and texture of the movie, make for one of the most vivid and haunting movies you will ever see.
The thing about the sculpture is that it sensitively depicts a dying soldier of the enemy's army, and so is normally taken to represent the ability to have empathy for one's enemy.
So let's get back to the theme of empathy for one's enemy.
The direction of Klepto is professional-looking but never more than ordinary, except for one long tracking shot that's clearly in the movie just because the director wanted to show he could pull off a long tracking shot.
The unsynched video and audio make for one of the most unsatisfying experiences ever.
Acting performances are incredible all around, but for one exception: Laura Dern.
At the end of a life of courage and honesty he sets out to fight one last battle, KNOWING he may be going to his death but willing to protect his people for one last time.
I, for one, lost control of my jaw when I initially saw this.
There is a creeping sense of death and decay surrounding this fine horror entry and I, for one, appreciate its stench.
Tony Shalhoub and Stanley Tucci, (Who by the way co-directed this film with Campbell Scott) Plays brothers who own a struggling Italian Restaurant who puts everything on the line for one big night to save their business.
The boss enemies are fun, for one immediately obvious reason, but the explanation behind them(and thus, how compelling a presence they are) just doesn't measure up to that of the first... even if there are far, far more of them.
This movie just sucked me in and didn't lose my interest for one second.
The trick using 2 different actresses for one role as stated by another user, is not unique per se, but heightens the surrealism of the movie.
When his cohorts convince him to pull one last job, he finds himself in the dangerous realm of the powerful and wealthy Action/Adventure  Marcos DeSantos is a Robin Hood-type thief whose plans on retiring from the life of crime are halted when his partners Cole and Bianca convince him to return for one last score.
when it first started out in 2000, it was intended to last for one series and be a social experiment.
To be fair,this was a mildly interesting idea at it's inception,and would've been just about acceptable for one series.But such has been the dumbing down of UK TV,and indeed seemingly British society as a whole in the new millennium,that the powers that be at CHANNEL FOUR have elongated this woefully thin concept to at the time of writing,an eighth series.What is disturbing is that this has led on to other tawdry reality shows springing up on other UK TV channels (I'M A CELEBRITY GET ME OUT OF HERE,LOVE ISLAND,THE FARM,CELEBRITY WRESTLING,even CELEBRITY DETOX,CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER,etc,etc,etc...)like unplanned illegitimate sprogs,with the British viewing public acting as unprepared,unwilling parents.The aforementioned programmes are virtually as tedious,dreary,lazy,banal and pointless as this one,but BIG BROTHER is wholly deserving of the lowest possible vote because it is possibly the main cause of the shallow brainlessness pervading most of UK popular culture in contemporary Britain.For example,the only so-called "celebrity magazines" at the turn of the century were the highly resistible OK and HELLO!,whose sickly,ghastly and vomit-inducing sycophancy to various public figures (most with very minor talents) was initially mocked by comedians,satirists and journalists,but even this mickey-taking soon became passÃ© as it didn't seem funny to mock something which was already too unintentionally amusing to begin with anyway.
I can normally handle this stuff, but these characters are meant to be high school students, and Misty can actually pass for one.
True it is one big tease from start to finish but I couldn't help watching just to see where it was going to end up and I for one wasn't disappointed.
All of these great elements make for one great satire.
The Living Dead Girl stars the beautiful Francoise Blanchard as Catherine Valmont who comes back from the dead for one of two reasons.
it's a shame it only ran for one series.
I for one admire the enthusiasm the puts into this almost comically unstable character.
I, for one, love that my children can sit and watch a character who is moral, who is loving and attentive to his wife and child, who seeks out new things and learns from them and for the most part who sees the good in people.
This film is memorable for one reason and one reason only:Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor,together as a unit.They had a chemistry that was undeniable,and they are in full force here.The script is flawed,the supporting cast,at least for the most part,forgettable,and I'm not knocking Sidney Poitier as a director,but I always considered him to be much better in front of the camera than behind it.Much of the dialog and interaction between the two main stars was no doubt improvised,and they probably needed no instruction from Poitier whatsoever.As funny as the two men were separately,there was just something special about them on screen together.They were just knock down,drag out funny,and if you were to just put them on an empty stage with no sets,props or even a script,put a movie camera in front them and just said "action!
participate in a race around the world for one million dollars.
for one simple reason.
The cast is great, Kurt Russell makes one of his best performances ever for one of the best characters in sci-fi films: "Snake".
I feel that it represents the culture in Mexico and emphasizes how everyone looks out for one another, like how Ubaldo looks out for Eusebia's sadness and how Dona Cata looks out for Susanita's feelings, and also how Abel looks out for Chava's well being.
Way over the top, but utterly and completely hilarious just the same American remake of the popular 1978 French film/play "La Cage Aux Folles" about a gay nightclub owner and his flamboyant drag-queen lover (played by Robin Williams and Nathan Lane, two actors who I might say look like they were born to each be the comedic halves that equal one fall-down hilarious whole) who in an attempt to please and hopefully fool the conservative parents (played by Gene Hackman and Diane Wiest) of Williams' biological son's (from what is obviously a previous liaison with a woman) fiancÃ©, pretend for one evening to be a straight married couple, a la Williams is the husband and Lane is dressed up as the wife, with as it is blatantly apparent disastrous results!
It was a well directed dogma movie with excellent acting, but when it comes down to it the story was very vague, and I for one did not find that movie very interesting at all.
I thought this was an interesting idea but it didn't work all that well for one major reason--Atwill's erudite presence just made it very, very hard to believe him working in a steel mill!
Ca Twiste a Popenguine is a movie best suited for one with some background information about Senegal or Africa in general.
In fact, I'm going as far as to recommend it as a candidate for one of the best of 1999, let alone best comedy of the decade.
Censorship for one.
I, for one, cringed every time Marty Feldman appeared wearing a nurses uniform.
The animators at Imagi Studios did a great job in delivering this film to expectations, graphic wise, and amongst all the robots, I preferred The Peacemaker best amongst all the mechanical creations, given his ability for fusion which allows for one really awesome looking make of a robot to grace on screen looking good as well as possessing enough opposing power to Astro Boy.
First by the skyrocketing rents they pay for one fourth of a room or one fifth of a caravan.
The script, for one, is great.
Later, March is able to convince his boss for one more chance, as he convinces him he has a new and TRUE human interest story the newspaper can promote--a pretty young lady dying from radium poisoning!
Well worth your time on many levels ...just to see film-making of the 30's and how good it could be, for one.
A hotel owner with the hots for one of his maids.
I, for one, think that Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is a genius.
And for the titular beast, of course, which doesn't do much either, except for killing people off-screen (except for one girl who gets her head smashed against a grid - nothing special).
Overall, I wouldn't watch it again but it was fine entertainment for one night.
I, for one, have chosen to buy it, and I do not regret it for a day.
Three women review their past lives while they wait for news that will change the future totally for one of them.
For an awkward woman with no real beauty, she has a presence and a power of attraction that are hard to withstand -- and I for one would have no wish to withstand them even if I could.
While juggling between real work, and his potential aspiration, things go awry with his love and sex life, when he falls for one of his friend's wife, and when his dad gets mixed up with and swindled by Russian gangsters.
There are moments in this film which painfully brings out themes of frustration, of being lost at a crossroads, and of deciding for oneself what your calling is.
Great cast (except for one huge exception) and some nice shots of a beautiful landscape, but otherwise this movie is enormously flawed.
I think the best way to begin this would be not to thank but to bear hug,the creative geniuses who created this piece of art..i mean everything about this show is f**king perfect-the characters,the plot,the direction,the music,the screenplay,the script..Its a perfect example of when all the things come together to make something that is larger than the creators themselves..I don't know how i stumbled across the page of cowboy bebop but it must have one my lucky days..I have to say i was not intrigued from the plot as much as from the characters,which i read about in the comments..my expectations from the show were pretty low despite the rating but man when i watched its first two episodes,even the 9.4 rating seemed an insult..and IT IS THAT GOOD..you would filled with awe for its creators after you watch it..you would even love the cowboy bebop sign that comes in between the show..The best thing about the show is that is has no specific genre,or you can say its a genre in itself..i wont have the slightest doubt if the show gets a cult status..so you never know whats gonna come out in the next scene,whether you will be convulsing with laughter or staring at the screen in empathy for one of the characters..as the show goes on and on,you keep on going deep into the skin of the characters..you don't know when it happens that the characters just occupy a permanent space in your head..you start to wish that they are always around..with a bored spike smoking his cigarette,jet watering his plants ,sulky faye with her frown and industrious ed jumping around with his laptop..and when the show ended,i actually felt a part of my life going away..and i bet you will feel the same way when the show ends..you will stare into the eyes of spike and say " no this is not going to happen,i wont let you go"..its a rare feeling for someone in real life but its almost impossible for someone in reel life..  so my respect to shinichiro wantanbe from the bottom of my heart for directing the show so perfectly and congratulations to hajami yatate for writing something so perfect in itself..and kobayashi and yoko kanno,no man i ain't forgetting them either..the show wouldn't have been complete without their music which encompasses everything from jazz to metal to blues to country to electronic..I urge everyone who reads this comment to watch this show..doesn't matter if you're not an anime fan..this show is apiece of art and it must not be missed..and if you're an anime fan,then you wont be seeing something as great as this in a long time..i guess if you take my word,then you're in for one of your luckiest days of your life..  SEE YOU IMDb COWBOY..
Jazz isn't the only music though as they employed some deep African drums for one episode, some boys choir for another, and soft rock music for a lot of episodes.
This movie is extremely horrible except for one line that Hav says.
The writer is found not guilty, and the continuing mix-up of characters, two actors competing for one role makes for a very confusing narrative.
Well for one the whole commentary in which Wynorski keeps referring to the footage stolen as Delta Force 2, but it's actually Delta Force 1!
Now, if you could go back in time just for one moment and buy the bumper, but now it is 100,000 dollars (just for the bumper).
Also watch it for one of the best love scenes ever.
There are a few twists and surprises you might not see coming but then again you might expect it because I for one did.
It would not have made sense in this film for one of the main characters to narrate, as in "Goodfellas".
The mistakes in this movie are too much for one to handle.
However, the film was selling for one dollar on a DVD and I decided I had nothing to lose.
Hackman is absolutely first-rate (without being a bravura actor) when he gets the right role, whether it's villainous or heroic, but he's never been good with accents and, man, does this role call for one.
I, for one, (while reasonably coversant with history), have never thought about her early years on the throne, and the difficulty as a teenage monarch, of dealing with Mum and Parliament!
Dan Chupong, the star of DYNAMITE WARRIOR, would give even Tony Jaa a run for his money (and a film featuring the two of them together would no doubt rival Bruce Lee's showdown with Chuck Norris in WAY OF THE DRAGON for one-on-one action).
This movie is here for one reason and I think that we can all agree on that reason.
Watching this movie was a waste of time....Nudity, for one thing....this was GROSS!
It had theatre showings in a few cities for one week each and the main release was on DVD in USA on January 15, 2008.
He loathes his life, his crumby house and unkempt lawn, and most of all the loathes the people with whom he works - except for one Vanessa (Elisha Cuthbert) who has a 'smile that lights up a room', but pays no attention to the geeky Bob.
However, in defense of David Lynch, for one who has followed a number of his films Inland Empire holds a coherent and linear narrative, and one that most novice Lynch viewers can follow with a few pointers.
Okay, for one this is a David Lynch movie known for setting mood.
I for one, am a fan of David Lynch, as I have been of Dario Argento's part work.
That title year is 1954 and young TV comedy show writer (Linn-Baker) gets assigned as the chaperone to former, swinging, - and heavily drinking - swashbuckler movie star on the downfall (O'toole) for one wild weekend in NYC.
She meets a detective on the case named Smith (Wilding), and the two start falling for one another.
I was so hesitant to see The Pursuit of Happiness for one reason, this movie looked like an incredible tear jerker, just from the trailer I was nearly crying.
This dreadful movie is clearly a candidate for one of the 10 worst movies ever made.
All the dead woman had to do was change her will while she was alive   Story two ) A bunch of feminist " lesbian " students find the going tough when their college commitee turn against them though for one of them it leads to a happy ending .
The amazing style used by Gendy Tartakovsky... (I hope thats spelled right... And the brilliant plot lines makes for one excellent adventure through time...oops wrong movie.
We are convinced he's never incredibly dangerous (save for one or two moments), and watching him fall into a surrogate father role with Kira offers a period where he seems to take on an appearance of a responsible father, as if he were "remembering" what it was like prior to his daughter's alleged abduction.
The second is that he tells the story of a conflicted criminal trafficking in some mean streets and he does it without ripping off Scorsese for one second.
I don't want to tire you all with a long review, there isn't a need for one with this movie.
It's simple enough, I guess, but there's so many random things that just don't make sense (the random weird flashbacks during the Kill Bill sequence, for one).
All except for one.
Not that it's a major problem: for one thing, the original Trek is famous for not having any significant narrative continuity between episodes (something that changed with the spin-offs); secondly, The Man Trap is just as good an example of what really makes Star Trek a riot to watch - the interaction between the characters.
The grand finale really goes for the gusto, and I for one actually wondered how investigator Hamilton was going to explain the whole thing to the authorities.
The ones I know also have wicked, if dry, senses of humor and McCallum has joyfully taken the humor route with Ducky and I, for one, appreciate it.
What makes The Best Intentions a gem in the Bergman cannon is his trust in the audience to take these 'characters' as full-on human beings, who have the utmost trouble with one thing, compromise and the real meaning of love for one another- connection, which is what Bergman goes for in most of his films.
I do believe that three men could fell deeply for one girl as beautiful and dignified as Ilona in a star-making performance by young Hungarian actress Erica MarozsÃ¡n and who would not?
Conan O'Brien is already disappointing die-hard Leno fans, like me for one, with his egotistical, self-centered and clichÃ©d jokes and antics.
Billie changed all that Â which is why Frank Sinatra (for one) readily admitted that he'd learned everything he knew about phrasing from listening to Billie's records.
My personal opinion of Lohan aside, this movie - like others (Dead Silence for one) relied heavily on effects that at times, become quite distracting.
Some weeks later, my mother decided to turn pro, although double Olympic Champion Karl SchÃ¤fer implored her to go on skating for one more year.
This perhaps doesn't really make "Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex * But Were Afraid to Ask" one of the most consistent movies ever made but I for one don't really mind that all segments differ somewhat from each other.
It's an intoxicating feeling when a movie excites and enlivens us like this -- and there's a particular giddiness to be had in thinking about what movies can (but don't often) do for one's soul after imbibing such a fine vintage!
I should have read Ebert and Weirs' comments prior to watching the film and I'd realize that there is no plot and that the director didn't want you to even think for one moment that there was the possibility of an answer.
The tribble problem aboard the ship is but a vehicle meant to get in the way of Kirk's job of putting out all the "little fires" engulfing them, the Attack by the Klingons, for one, and Nilz Barris continually, acting the self-important bureaucrat, getting in the way.
While the girls DID disguise themselves for one of the robberies, it's pretty obvious they weren't guys!!!
Jack just phones his performance in, enough said.....and speaking of laughing, I, for one, hate those scenes where the main characters are on a beach, over dinner, in bed, and they are laughing, laughing, but you the viewer are not privy to the stream of jokes.
I for one would have chosen Keanu any day.
These hotel doors left ajar did provide for one point where I thought 'now the fun begins', and that is when Yella leaves her room and seeks out her companion.
This movie who is supposed to be about the Jewish issue, is really nothing more than an absolute waste of time, except for one or two scenes.
The story moved along at a snails pace and, except for one part, was very very predictable.
I sat through the whole lot, but this movie is only fit for one thing, DELETION...
You don't for one moment believe that she even loves her boyfriend.
Basically, you have a group of troubled teens who have all been sentenced, for one reason or another, to an evening of detention... for an entire evening... at night... overnight, in fact... with no other guidance than from a manically depressed Vietnam veteran turned homeroom teacher.
"The Battle of Shaker Heights" is the second offering released and made from the successful HBO reality series "Project Green light" which chronicles the search for a screenplay and director in which Ben Affleck and Matt Damon will produce for one million dollars.
There was just too many people for one movie, and that's the problem.
Okay, that's exciting to watch for one time, but by the tenth time it gets very boring!
This week-end my friend was at two parties given for one of my sons and she was able to engage in give and take conversation with all of the guests.
Tarantulas: The Deadly Cargo maybe good for one thing though, to stretch the running time out Hagmann pads the film with seemingly endless shots of the orange factory & it's inner workings so if you've ever wanted to know what happens in an (70's) orange factory here's your chance!
for one thing this girl played the nagging role, another stereotype for black women, who actually never communicated with her partner.
For a movie that is supposed to have "about a joke every minute, and sometimes too many jokes for one to swallow", that's not a really good thing.
Each new Marple gets further away from that notion, but I for one like a new take on an old theme.
The only sad thing is that no longer could you imagine seeing movies as plays on the stage, something which was very easy with the old rather over-acted melodramas...  Keep up the good work and I for one will be waiting for the next release!
OK, this is notable for one thing: the dog is well trained.
Writer/director Annie Griffin is responsible for one of my favourite TV series, "The Book Group", a funny and often moving tale of an odd bunch of literary fans, also set in Edinburgh.
The patrons, BY DEFINITION, should rise as one and get that idiot of the stage, for one.
I for one can take only so much beautiful scenery before I start to get irritated from the LACK of a REAL story and "unstaged" acting.
While the first one was about a search for one's self, the second one was about money.
While I do understand that first it's a "Hallmark" (as in greeting cards) Production, so right there schmaltz and rubbish and that it was also a "Mini-Series", it seemed as though the producers were looking only to fill time and in a feature package... (DVD) meant for one complete viewing... it came across so God awfully long and boring.
It was as credible and plausible as an Eagle picking up a beagle dog taking him to great height, dropping him, the dog catching a pigeon in flight, the Dog landing in pile of Hay, bouncing harmlessly, making a great meal of the pigeon only to be found by the rancher who was just thinking about buying a Beagle for his daughter who had been begging for one.
As for the acting, this film is unusual in that all the actors were good except for one whose performance really stood out from the rest--it was THAT bad.
But, for one thing, the execution of the potentially interesting material is boring.
Overuse of throwbacks to previous Christmas specials and pop culture references, for one.
I, for one, have a long memory.
Rouge for one, I hate her voice.
Complete suspense of disbelief is an absolute necessity in order for one to sit through this flick without laughing aloud, or groaning at all the ridiculous stunts Tom Cruise performs.
I so not buy for one minute the notion that this movie may simply have been "too deep" to appreciate.
I do not buy for one minute the notion that this movie may simply have been "too deep" to appreciate.
"The Boys From Brazil" is an overblown, exaggerated thriller that I really couldn't take seriously for one moment.
Nothing unexpected happens except for one silly thing at the end.
(and fair enough..we banned fox hunting in the UK and thats not even apatch on this ..fox hunting is humane compared to this)I for one am unable to support or watch this movie as I know enough about the AHA that although they may not print the whole truth and they may err on the side of caution ..they do get at least the tip of the iceberg out so you know on both those film -FLicka and LOTR things were amiss...and thugs were worse than what the AHA can reasonably say on their site(see film & TV unit of AHA).Disappointing that Tim McGraw allows this and he is not Ã«yes open yet.You know can one forgive him for this kind of support for these wild horse races.NO.Cna I buy his movie now.NO!
The acting was good too, but the theme is counter to what we think are important values: integrity, respect for one another, and healthy communication.
Not only did it make for one of the best episodes (proof that the worst movies don't make the best episodes), but it makes some of the duller parts of the film seem lively.
Lackluster people doing dull and unimaginative things make for one excruciating experience.
That goes on with the next scene in which the aspiring knight Tiuri just has to sit quiet in a chapel for one night.
It's good for one watch, but that's it.
Frances o connor, as the Professor's assistant Kate, in particular stands out for one of the most hammy and immature female portrayals i have ever seen.
Now this may well have been somewhat shocking to the viewer if it were not for one problem; the writers had already drawn attention to said cigarette case earlier in the episode by having Lois steal it from the crime scene.
I will be grateful to this film for one thing though.
This movie starts out with an excellent premise: a young witch named Kiki, following the ancient tradition of her kind, leaves her home for one year to train to be a full witch, and find her special skill.
Knives, runaway cars that inexplicably miss the heroine and explode and gunmen who can't hit anything make for one of the weakest gangs in film history!
It remains inconceivable that such a purveyor of finely crafted films could also be responsible for one of the year's most cinematically redundant and, to quote a previous reviewer, what amounts to little more than a cut-and-paste job of any given 3 TV episodes.
The search for one's self, trust and love, a renegade but loveable pig, "temple balls", Taj Mahal's music, outstanding film backdrops, good friends, all combine for a very charming and creative film.
The film is almost worth it for one scene: A dead woman is to be made a zombie; the ritual goes like this: a dwarf in sunglasses and love-beads, top-hat and tux (over a tie-dye tee-shirt) whips the back of a native girl kneeling before him.
This sets the scene for one of Northern Irelands most dysfunctional mixed marriages ever.
I, for one, am a political conservative and straight, but this series captured my heart -- not because of its politics but because of its strong characters and rich narrative.
Having mentioned the cast, Hammer stalwart Michael Ripper turns up here as well for one brief scene; as for the film's American lead, James Olson (with receding blond hair!)
SOLSTICE is a haunting yarn about a group of high school friends getting together for one last blow out before heading to college.
"Meet the Deedles" was a movie made for one reason, and one reason only: To cash in on a once-was film franchise.
I, for one, value his work as Brian Wilson's biographer.
He makes for one of the most nondescript, unexciting heroes I've seen.
Between the emasculated Tarl Cabot, scene after scene of a midget's hinder, an annoying side-kick named Watney, and an embarrassed looking Jack Palance wearing one of the goofiest looking hats imaginable, you've got the recipe for one bad movie.
From the very opening scene, you'll know you're in for one real tacky experience.
By the end of the movie, I was surprised that I cared for her more than any other character I've seen in any movie save for one.
It was a shame, because for one, it stars Lance Henriksen, who is one of my favorite modern genre actors, and two, it could have easily been a decent film.
With his sweetheart in a coma, and given almost no chance of recovery, Mr. Gibson asks to be cryogenically frozen for one year.
The killer story, for one of the most infamous and gruesome murderers in all of history is really quite boring, and lacking any mystery and aforementioned "suspense."
Add it up Â cheap sets, dull script, and uninspired acting make for one very bad movie.
A control group of viewers who saw the original back in 1977 at the theater should have been consulted (Me, for one.)
I saw this movie and was impressed first only for one reason .The new concept of short term memory loss .But then later when I saw the original one Memento I was totally awestruck by how beautifully the screenplay was done ,you in fact live with the character ,which you can never feel for once in Ghajini .Well thats not the only flaw the whole brilliance and intelligence of Mememto is diminished in Ghajini .
The title is well chosen except for one thing: they could add stupid movie after Dead Husbands!
I can't believe for one moment that Susan Cooper has authorised this movie which is supposed to be based on her book.
Godzilla, for one, is a monster metaphor - the bastard of the nuclear age.
Not for one moment does she actually look lifeless, which would have helped with the darker side this movie tries so hard to project.
This dud was in the theater for one week before it disappeared, and when I went I was the only person in the audience!
The fighting scenes for one was very slow, it seemed like they were both scared of injuring each other when they were fighting, even though they were wearing god knows what inches thick.
That classification is reserved for one of those hand-puppet, creature features called "Centipede".
The 13 year period for one member is coming to an end.
I will say that for one of these "Lookee, musicians acting like musicians!!!"
With Dark Ride we have the unfortunate opposite and it left me loathing the production for one simple fact.
It's easy to understand why it only ran for one season, and equally easy to see how it has achieved the cult status it enjoys today.
The music was good too (except for one instance which I will rant about later) and the cinematography was decent too.
It doesn't worth watching even for one time.
It`s badly directed , badly cast ( Barry Pepper as Jonnie makes for one of the least impressive screen hero`s ever seen .
Dylan was obviously written in for one reason only--- to sell the soundtrack.
What the movie is about is a bunch of old crooks, getting back together for one more job and it ends up going bad and then they are hunted down by the mobster who gave them the job.
Actually there is but they only appear for one short scene to get Helm out of a tight spot then are completely forgotten about for the rest of the movie .
I am an object of terrible fascination to you, A Severed Head such as primitive tribes used putting a morsel of gold on it tong to make it out of prophecies, as real people you and i do not exist for one and other" I know, huh?
I wasn't expecting this to be a good movie and I don't think anybody involved in it was either, or else they would have--for one--called it something else.
Only once does the film leave the nightclub for a musical number in an outdoor cafÃ©, and then it is for one of the film's most haunting scenes, where a young boy begins to sing 'Tomorrow Belongs To Me'..
It all makes for one horrific wartime propaganda flick that would be hooted off the screen by some and would offend others.
I for one cant recommend it to anyone,I will how ever try to get my hands on the longer version that is supposed to exist and see if they manage to salvage the promise this movie almost showed.
One, they were confused as to what the climax really was and two, there's no resolution or their pathetic excuse for one was terrible.
The film never leaves the confines of the Colorado town either & I for one never really felt like the whole of the US was at war.
3: Lets talk entertainment, not for one moment was I caught up in this movie, I did not have one shred of emotion, this movie has no substance, no deep moments, and the 'climax' and ending are just plain stupid.
Low-budget queasiness (worked on at an early point by Martin Scorsese) takes a surprising amount of time to mount its grisly story--and by this time, one is watching and waiting for one of the nasty killings to occur simply because nothing else is happening.
A fight breaks out (the Asian guys use martial arts, of course) and everyone gets killed except for one guy who reappears throughout, murdering people.
This would be excusable perhaps if an inexperienced director tried it for one scene, but it's the entire movie.
However, I respect Oprah's attempt at resurrecting a new interest in many people for one of the world's most extraordinary and misunderstood writers of our time.
I, for one, found the ending both touching and hilarious Â it's the ultimate punch-line to the one, big joke.
Some of the camera shots are actually quite artistic - possibly evidence that they could only afford to hire a professional for one hour.
It's a long, dull movie with nothing to recommend it... except for one thing that is worth noting:  Almost every other review points out that this movie seems to be the inspiration for "Monty Python and the Holy Grail."
This movie however was so extremely slow and hollow, that for one of the first times in my life, i really felt sorry for wasting time on a movie.
The "ride" seems interminable and there's almost no conversation between them, so when they finally begin to show an interest for one another, you may find yourself asking "Why?"
This movie is currently remembered for one scene...the infamous scene where one of the worst actors of all time spouts out the line "GARBAGE DAY!"
I don't have much to say about this turkey except to watch for one incredible sequence with the terrorist contacting the control tower.
A group of freighted passengers, some superficial individual dramatic situations, terrorists, pilot and cabin crew killed or sick, an alert and smart passenger that has never piloted a plane (but knows a lot about planes), a helpful lady, a doctor, some torture and murders, plane with very few fuel, enough just for one trial of landing the aircraft, happy end for the survivals, a beginning of a love (sealed by a kiss) between the smart passenger that saved the survivals and the helpful ladyÂ How many times have we, simple viewers, faced this screenplay?
It's a giant deus ex machina designed solely to bring Sephiroth back for one last fight.
The novel was too long, for one thing: a pitfall often seen in King novels.
I've found that watching this movie was only good for one thing - whenever one of my friends regards some movie as "the worst movie ever", I simply raise my hand and say - "Tequila Bodyshots."
tonnes of sections that seem directly ripped from other movies, ("I'm sorry unmemorable crew member #1, I can't let you do that", but don't worry, it's only HAL for one scene) and parts that just didn't seem to make sense (Why did the hydroponics section catch fire?
The movie is one of those incredibly lame "family movies" that is clearly designed for one target audience: infantile children who can't differentiate between quality and utter rubbish.
Thornton Wilder's play about a matchmaking busy-body named Dolly Levi in 1880s Yonkers, New York who has been hired to find a mate for a wealthy, grumpy business owner; she comically attempts to keep him for herself, while the gal he admires is quickly falling for one of his own employees.
This show bored the living daylights out of me, I never even so much as cracked a smile for one thing said.
Michael Richards was shunned for one random (and completely misunderstood) outburst, said in a fit of pique.
Angus Oblong only has one producer credit and only has writing credits for one episode (the first one, probably) so all indications are that he sold out creative control.
The ultimate pointless, shallow, and unnaturally contrived movie makes for one hell of a viewing experience.
Forgive me for not caring for one of the dumbest families captured on film.
I wanted to see this for one reason.
so guys please for one time spare the poor bollywood film makers guilty of lifting off ideas from Hollywood .
The island is so small, there is only room enough for one village.
That was funny enough for one star.
This insane piece of garbage is only watchable for one person- and it's not Brad Pitt!
The main character who mysteriously returns to "Jericho" after an unexplained five year absence is so heroic that in the first episode he saves an entire school bus load of children, including making a makeshift respirator for one of them with some straws and a pen knife!
After delivering supplies to a desolate but inhabited island, Captain Thorne Sherman (James Best) wisely decides that with a threatening hurricane about to make landfall, it would make sense to stick around at least for one night until things blow over.
I bought Raise The Titanic on DVD for one of my mates for Christmas 2003, mainly because we've read all of Cusslers books and thought them very very good.
I for one like B-movies.
First of all the acting in the movie was absolutely terribly except for one minute part in the movie where Washington dies, she was the only person who showed emotion when she actually died.
I imagine the creatures would be queued in right after the couple promises to survive for one another and hang on no matter what even though they fought non-stop for the first 100 minutes of the movie just like Bud and Lindsay.
The story for this movie, for one, is creative but flat-out silly if you really think about it.
I for one (and an unprecedented number of others) couldn't take it.
To watch a pregnant woman for one hour, with nothing else going on, is a waste of 35mm film!
Well, for one thing, this is one of those "vampire" stories where the writers think they have to cleverly re-invent the vampire mythos for the hundredth time.
Now a decade and a half later, she's working as an air hostess (flight attendant) for one of these airlines founded by pals of the dead pilot.
It didn't take more than two minutes for one of the horses to say (while eating a carrot, perfectly normal food for a PONY) that she couldn't wait until their synchronized swimming competition was over, so they could all go back to eating "normal food" again!!!
A pretty girl walks past Kevin and Perry - and you just wait for one of them to get an erection for the hundredth time - the same joke was done better in Waynes World (schhhhwing!).
In fact, the one scene that featured parents, they were silent except for one comedic line!
a haus frau who has little to do but talk with her gay confidant, another brother that paints sometime (we never know when) the gay confidant who does nothing but pine for one of the brothers and a mother, who has lunch, because she seems to be perpetually out to lunch.
I like the idea of the sadness that he ignored his son by paying loads of attention to Tommy, then tommy went awol with george duke, but at least he could have had Apollo or Creed's manager(I forget the name) train him for one last fight in the ring, and then beats tommy gunn, wins the title, and wins back his fortune.
Another point that dooms this film is that none of the people are very good or interesting & I for one was unable to care one bit on what occurred.
I can only give it a 2 for one good butt shot, as a peeping tom on stilts stares into a window  2/10
At times you could barely hear the people talk, I had to constantly turn the volume up for one scene, and then back down for the next.
Michael Curtiz's expert directing along with a strong cast and great story make for one interesting film.
This film is no doubt something that Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland rejected for one of their 'let's put on a show' films.
For some reason, dumb robots fall for one another.
The Gideon council chamber created so much free space for one man when they could have solved their overpopulation problem by having Kirk transport Odona to Dr. McCoy's sickbay for treatment?
The film tries to "class" itself up by throwing in cameos by legitimately fine actors like Sissy Spacek, Elizabeth Perkins and Gary Cole for one or two scenes that are as distracting as they are embarrassing to watch.
I own the movie for one reason "the sorcerers Apprentice".
for one,Kristen Storms(?)
While some find the interconnected narratives humorous and others appear to relate to the story, this writer for one found nothing about the film witty or meaningful.
But see it translated and you're in for one hell of a headache...  What makes this film a cult classic is that you can't overcome that sneaking suspicion that the makers were doing this intentionally.
Not for one moment in the entire run of this film did I believe that Cruz and Kingsley's characters had any attraction to each other.
It was made for one reason and one reason only.
The story, from David Rich, is little more than an excuse to get these two former brat-packers back together for one last fling.
The plot is extremely predictable & strictly by the numbers with these two mismatched partners hating each other to start with but growing to respect each other & becoming great friends & even putting their own lives at risk for one another, seen it all before & usually done much better with more humour & more excitement.
A definite watch for one of those late night boredom releases.
It never piqued my interest for one second.
This Peruvian American co-production was directed by Luis Llosa which is a name I instantly recognised as this is the guy responsible for one of the worst big budget horror flicks of the 90's, namely Anaconda (1997) which is a film I hate with a passion & guess what?
Well I have to say I was for one really eager to do so and as I watched the movie, even as a full open minded viewer, some scenes were feeling just ... incomplete.
More likely the director needed a mass murder at this juncture and this was his best excuse for one.
True, it didn't need as much special effects as this move would need, but every single actor in that film was better than every single actor in Ghost Lake - and for one hell of a lot less money.
All in all if you're looking for one of the stupidest and funniest movies, rent this.
The Cheerleading sequences are average at best,except for one excellent one at the very end,I will admit that was very well done.
I think critics and people keep praising it for one of two reasons: they don't understand it and think they're missing something (but don't want to admit it) OR don't want to rock the boat of critical opinions from the 1940s.
Now II left the door open for another sequel, and I for one wouldn't have minded seeing at least one more.
in fact,it's your typical action/crime drama.the characters are stereotypical for this genre.i also found the movie slow and depressing.i was quite disappointed.i was expecting a much better movie than this.the action is slow,and there really isn't much originality here.Andrew Davis directed this one.he also directed The Fugitive,Under Siege and Above the Law,all after Code of Silence.but it's not all bad.for one thing Henry Silva is great as one of the main bad guys,although he doesn't get a lot of screen time.because of it's depressing atmosphere though and how slow it is i give Code of Silence a 4/10
The fact that anybody invested as much as a nickel in a script that one monkey working for one hour could easily have done better is what really blows my mind.
The corpse of Jack Pallance re-animated for one week only to play Â of all things Â Hawk's evil brother!
Actually, I like mindless, escapist fluff comedies, and was prepared for one of those here.
Someone, somewhere though, evidently thought audiences would be engaged by this dross and leave their brains behind: an excruciatingly awful end credit sequence actually has the temerity to chronicle the post-film fate of the movie's characters -- National Security adviser arrested, Ambassador arrested, military hero acquitted of all charges --as if for one moment anyone could ever believe them to approximate to real people.
And, as I said above, they could only spring for one zombie and guy in a $9 gorilla suit.
It is in black and white but saves the colour for one shocking shot.
Of course as soon as the waffen SS turned up and got some bayonet practice in I realised this wasn`t going to be the case , but by then the damage had been done and I knew not to expect any intentional laughs  POSSESSED isn`t of much interest except for one aspect - How things used to be .
I couldn't stand his over-the-top accent, and I didn't believe for one second that he was the kind of guy who would be living at his parents's house into his thirties.
In fact, it often seems more like something from the Cannon Films stable than a vehicle for one of the world's top superstars.
And yet in 'The Merry Frinks' she is cast in the central and largest role, for one of the very few times in her film career.
The direction never letting you forget for one single second that this is a PLAY darlings.
Morris wins because he gives his lines all the emotional inflection of a dial tone, and when he cuddles up to cutie Marla English for one of their many painful clinches, she looks like she wants to bang down the receiver.
This film is a dreadful piece of work, hardly worth a second thought except for one reason - it illustrates the use of entertainment media for propaganda purposes.
The plot is full of holes, for one thing.
Near the end (for one of a zillion examples of This Film wandering far far far far off the main point - i.e.
Ahhh, but the guard guy wasn't so easily fooled, nope, uh-uh, he realised that is was quite suspicious for one to forget their mother's phone number.
The baddies use great blocks of it to blow open things like doors; they even light a fuse for one pieceÂ Regular gunfights take place through the film.
But bravo for one funny scene where the husband makes an excuse, and lies that he lost his wineglass on the ceiling, when it clearly was an act of anger.
The house was once occupied by a super-crazy mutant family of retards who killed each other and themselves all except for one little freak who managed to survive and got to watch all the others die.
The movie seemed to want to incorporate too many themes for one horror movie: killer husband/wife, haunted house, deranged surgeons, ancient evil, etc.
Go for one of his many other classics, ignore this unless you're a completist like me and have to have it all!
- 3. when Gable goes off to war - 4. when he first visits her at the convent & she sends him away - 5. when he finally stops pursuing her but promises to love her for the rest of his life ... and get ready for one more!
Implausibly, Kit's mother allows her to go to a hobo camp to do some 'research' for one of her articles, but wouldn't you know it the hobos are a bunch of wonderful people (despite police reports of many robberies committed by various members of their group).
According to a friend each Highlander film gets even more disconnected and continuity confused than the last, and The Source is probably one of those textbook examples of a story being simply way too confusing for one who isn't at least a little familiar with the franchise.
It IS good for one thing, though.
It's primarily Robin Williams' film, but he's so obnoxious and never believable as a reverend for one minute.
The man is a menace, and the fact that nobody seems to realize it except for one character makes everyone in this movie come across as completely oblivious.
No money spared there, and hence everything in sight blows up, for one reason or another, and blows up big.
A beggar buys the kid for one copper, because nobody else wanted him(what a surprise).
This is the most stereotypical movie to come out since "Birth Of A Nation" but yet it's embraced by the black community for one and Hollywood seems to be OK with it.
But as far as MST3K episodes goes, it makes for one of the best.
Sure, it has Troy's grandma for one scene, and you could hear the voice of a female operator in one scene, but what I mean is, this film had absolutely no romance(unless you want to count Zap Rowsdower and Troy scampering through the woods romantic...ugh...)I think there really should have been a spunky female protagonist alongside Zap and Troy, fighting masked goons and uncovering clues to the lost city.
At no point do you for one second believe that Freddie Prinze is cool or a good pool player, two things we are supposed to buy in this film.
The sewer chase upset me for one reason, and one alone.
I, for one, was extremely disappointed.
Louise and Harold were made for one another.
Never in my life have I just for one second think, seeing such crap is possible.
I for one have never really been a big fan of animated cartoon type movies, that is since I'm now an adult but in my past as a kid I treasured them.
I for one thought I was proved vastly wrong.
Criticism against a government or politician doesn't constitute anti-patriotism or hatred for one's country, except in fascism.
And with that said and told, I don't believe for one single second that Micheal Moore hates America so much as the producer of this movie wants him to.
Well, for one, they are not totally boring.
for one thing, this kinda stuff really happened.
9/10: I could see Mondo Macabro picking this one up, they have shown a willingness to present movies on DVD that other companies would never dare bother with, and I for one would love to see a re-release just because I know how many stupid Liberal idiots would protest it.
You can't tell me for one second that you ever thought that Zeta-Jones could outsmart a stump of wood, let alone Connery.
I, for one, would rather choke on LA's smog than have to watch this movie again.
It should also be noted with regards to the plot that never ever, not even for one single moment, does it become convincing in its portrayal of events.
Not even good enough for one of those days when you are exhausted from work and just want to watch *something*.
I for one could not believe that William Holden and Paul Newman would agree to star in this rubbish.
OK, to be honest i didn't expect much out of this movie,being a romantic comedy and all,but in the end i actually liked it, yes it's a chick flick ,and yes some things in it wouldn't really happen in reality,and the movie being so sweet and funny,the ending could have been a little better,but hey,these kind of movies always have something that we would like to be different,all in all i actually liked it,and enjoy watching it over and over again...  Kate Hudson was really sparkling in this light spirited comedy, and i for one would like to see her more in funny comedies like this...  Denny
There is no plot line, no events that will lead them to even change their views of each other at this point of time(half the movie gone)and seriously, there are such little chemistry or sexual tension between the two leads that I for one, even though knowing that this is to come, still can't quite imagine them falling for each other.
This is the cue for one of the counselors to immediately say his name.
Not much to recommend here, boils and ghouls, except for one truly bizarre moment.
The reason is I am hoping for one of the family to emerge as a totally responsible person.
Its an ultra "Z" film only for one propose, too shock, with ultra violent and grotesque scenes, with a non linear\sense story.The film focus the character Karl the Buchter (Andreas Schnaas, also the director) in a killing spree, walking around the woods killing people without a propose, every signle death is sadistic and brutal..(what they are thinking?)!
Taking set in the mid 60's for one was something unique and refreshing.
I say this for one simple reason: Without the special effects this movie would never, ever captivate and take a hold of audiences like it has in the past week.
It is NOT scary, NOT suspenseful, NOT overly gory, NOT overly sick (except for one season MAYBE) NOT beautifully scored.... AT ALL.
If this movie had for one second taken itself even a little bit seriously, it would have been unwatchable.
All this is abrogated by the fact that it was all clear to me from the off (and i wasn't aware there was a twist to the film so i wasn't looking out for one), all due to the fact that essential production values fail to adequately disguise the twist.
The comedic slash farce-like plot never interested me for one moment.
Far from being a pro-PETA piece, this movie strongly implies that the only reason anyone cares deeply about animals is because they are incapable - for one reason or another - of functioning in human society.
The movie's primary detestable assumptions are that a) anyone who has a close bond to animals only comes to that bond because they are incapable - for one reason or another - of forming healthy bonds with other people, and b) that people so bonded to animals are hopelessly blind to reason.
In this era, a mainstream movie for kids should be beyond having a villain with a physical disability, for one example of all the weird stereotypes, prejudices, and symbolism in this movie.
This is the type of movie that's just barely involving enough for one viewing, but I don't think I could stand to watch it again.
i for one can't be bothered to find out.
Certainly not enough to overcome his celebrity; you don't for one moment forget you're watching Mick Jagger.
This movie is alright for one watch.
This would be fine for one sketch, but there needs to be more.
I kept waiting for one of them to pull out a cellphone because most the performances were phoned in, for me the beginning was the worse stupid twinkling lights in the background of scenes of them on the ship while long shots with harpies flying over head were of a cloudy twilight sky, so where did the twinkling stars come from....this is just pointing out one of many flaws and of course this ship was filmed in a studio with no water at all, I'm sure of it.

All the countries of the former Yugoslavia voted for one another which can be seen as part of a healing process but be honest , do you think the ghosts of 278,000 dead Yugoslavs can be exorcised by a camp and cheesy song contest featuring more often than not Euro-trash ?
All the Nordic countries voted for one another while Greece and Cyprus gave each other maximum points as they do every year much to the disgust of the gathered audience in Turkey .
Keaton steals this movie with a wonderful performance as a self-styled 'idea man', setting up a pimping business out of the city morgue with the financial help of Winkler who falls for one of the prostitutes in the form of Shelley Long, who has certainly been better cast.
The special effects seemed as if they wanted to save any money they could... save for one effect, which was good, and another, which seemed to have no purpose at all.
We see a German E-BoatÂor what passes for oneÂoff the French command intercept French radio signals.
I for one am not the reader of the English newspaper the Daily Mail.
When I watch a film, I like them to have plots and developments and characters I don't spend the whole time despising for one reason or another.
Expectations for one of its productions were about rock bottom, and for the most part this exploitation quickie lives down to that well-earned reputation.
see a looser who sell his girlfriend for one million dollars and manage to get himself in jail.
I, for one, was angry that I had wasted my time with a film that was not pleasing on ANY level.
Elwood is going to get in trouble for one thing or another.
The plot isn't complex enough for one of those comics that comes wrapped around bubble-gum, and technically the film looks like one of those local used-car dealer commercials in a small town.
Imagine hearing the major critics on the top of the roof on the skycraper sing boisterous praise for one of the five hundred 'qualified masterpieces', and Lost in Translation somehow received the honor bestowed on Sofia Coppola and company.
I for one don't think that Munthe's slasher opus is as bad as its hideous reputation makes it sound.
Emile was in the hospital for one month ask who was with him every day morning and night?When i hear the whole story then I will rate that story and not until then.
If CGI department would have recorded a demo from early 1994 flight simulator and used movement capture of game planes for ones seen in movie, they would get at least half of it believable.
Though billed as a Rush Hour action-comedy, it is not funny at all, except for one scene at the end.
I'm not sure where this comes in the Bud/Terence line up of movies, but, much like the early plot where the two characters team up again for one final mission, this movie has the feel of a movie made after the heyday of the pair.
Two talented actors can't save a movie with recycled script, bland cinematography, annoying editing - pointless "flashy" speed-ups and crash zooms, childish time-lapse photography and most grating of all, totally superfluous (except for one scene) use of split-screen.
Kudos Marita C. Turns out that CSM, now dying, has summoned them for one final attempt at rekindling the conspiracy.
In the past few years i have rarely done reviews of films or TV on here for one simple reason, abuse, abuse from people who think you are wrong or are thinking you have been unfair on something they love/hate and i grew sick of it.
The new generation is there to challenge the power of nature, lead by Lopez... and the three friends come together for one last ride.
Alas, by now, the same formula has appeared so often, be it under different guises, that there's little left to be amazed about for one watching this series for the first time now.
Meanwhile, Acerola's wife and babysitter Cris (Camila Monteiro) is invited to work in SÃ£o Paulo and she sees the chance to raise money to buy a house of her own; she tells Acerola that he must take care of their son Clayton alone for one year.
Why they couldn't have substituted one womanizing scene for one of the many preaching scenes is unknown.

Sorry, but I think after viewing this, there's no doubt that Ed Wood should have ranked up there with Steven Speilberg for one of the greatest directors who ever breathed.
I, for one, am extremely grateful that they don't use the close-up filming as they did here, a distracting element detracting rather than adding to the presentation.
Bad acting (The lead female actress was last seen in another bad spanish production, Beyond Re- animator, a terrible sequel to the cult classic from the 80Â´s)and direction (take a look to his terrible boring first film, Second name), and more than dissapointing visuals, this film is good for one thing: curing insomnia.
Mostly though, this movie is an exercise of ego for one Joe Brooks.

George Cukor and Ms. Garland were made for one another, yet, Warner Brothers decided to chop the film, perhaps robbing her of an Oscar she deserved.
I for one, am not a Izabella fan, only seeing her in Forsaken.
I, for one, thought it was a solid, Gothic tale that sad, high school girls will absolutely adore.
Everything changes when Bloom decides to get out of the game and Stephen lures him in for one last swindleÂa beautiful and quirky millionaire (Rachel Weisz) who yearns for a taste of adventure.
After having fallen in love with too many marks, only to watch as they swindled and left them out to dry, Bloom is ready to quit and goes into self-imposed exile for three years until his partner finds him and rounds him up for one last big score.

Some questions are answered at the end, but some are not, and I for one like that some are not.
This is basically "Scanners", "Firestarter", and "Poltergeist" all ripped off for one overly long "Tales From the Darkside" episode... A kid with psychic powers is hording some kind of demonic beast in his closet which ends up killing people.
It's unfortunate that no feature length movies have been made because I, for one, would love to know what Sisko learned while moving among the prophets after falling into the fire cave (Final Episode).
some people don't like the ending, but I for one thought it is just fine, when you consider other movies like The Day After Tomorrow (2004) the ending is fine.
I can forgive him for one of the worst ever English accents in the Ocean's films because despite that he is normally very good at his trade.

In fact, that's what the movie is about: the difference between wanting to be cool and wanting to think for oneself.
Barry Jones plays the father of two lovely princesses who suffers to get the best knight for one of his daughters...  Well...
Nevertheless the film is enjoyable on a number of levels; for one, lovers of old films will delight in the great ambiance of an isolated, wind swept island and the dark, moody atmosphere of the Albrecht home.
Ponsoldt is that rare combination of writer/director who has something unusual and significant to say and has the skills to tell his story with genuine sensitivity and with amazingly polished skill for one so new on the scene.
Yup, "Cody Jarrett" was in business for one more tough-guy gangster character.
I know what people are thinking, another documentary based on conspiracy theories, but just for one minute ask yourselves, why are there so many of these films (documentaries) barking up the same tree?, maybe, just maybe there's some fact in what is being told.
Also remember most if not all of these films are made by Americans not by outsiders and as a result of the attacks on the Twin Towers 100,000 Iraqis' have perished, and now in Britain the US and majority of the world the war is being called illegal but we cry for the 179 soldiers (UK) that have died out there fighting for their country but not for one minute do we realise the chaos and death we have caused.
