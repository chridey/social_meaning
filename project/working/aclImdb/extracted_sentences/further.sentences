The film is flawed no doubt, it should have developed the characters a bit more, we never really understood why Madeline and Helen were friends in the first place as it seems like they've always hated each other, they could have just explored the friendship a little further.
The writing is witty and sometimes painfully sharp, emphasising in almost every scene that beauty does not equal happiness, and the closer you come to attaining an obsessively pursued physical perfection, the further you get from real happiness and fulfillment.
This seems a common element to films the further back in cinema history you go.
The movie further more features a good supporting cast.
Those that, like me, have been pining for a classical contemporary horror should look no further than The Orphanage.
Actually, this is a mature film for mature viewers who understand the complexities and bliss of mid-life relationships that are further complicated by the loss or disability of a steady partner whose patterns are well learned and experienced along that long path.
Contrary to her personal code of conduct (she will rarely work more than once with the same director, always looking for new experiences to further her craft and personal growth), she went on to star in Ozon's deceptively upbeat SWIMMING POOL and took a supporting role in his first failure to date, the atrocious ANGEL.
They don't reveal anything about the characters who say them, they don't add to the story or further the plot, and with rare exceptions, they're not funny.
Resulting partly in an amateur movie about a film director and a scriptwriter who must write a new manuscript in five days, interspersed with scenes from the film they are working on - about a young idealistic doctor in the late 20th century, who tries to fight an epidemic, but only manages to spread it further.
If Family Guy pushes the envelope, Tim goes even further.
But in the end (do not read further if you don't want to know the end) Tanner is saved when Conway, who is shot, activating the machine.
Coppola decided to take a risk and experiment even further after Apocalypse Now- to go to something 'light' like musicals he directed in college after going through such a dark experience like A.N.- and in the process made something that, had it paradoxically been a silent film with most of the accompanying music, would've been a full-blown masterpiece.
Director Lestrade obviously has condensed the trial and chosen scenes to further his point of view but much of the evidence and many of the submissions had no place in a trial seeking truth and justice.
"Russia's War" presents haunting images of persons being tried in Communist show trials, transported to labor camps, and working in slave labor projects (Anne Applebaum's book Gulag offers a useful history of the Gulag system, in case this documentary encourages you to read further).
And if you like sight gags, one-liners and either Goldie Hawn, Chevy Chase or Charles Grodin, look no further for your favorite movie.
One of the reviews I read here said that the characters Dana does aren't funny, but they couldn't be further from the truth.
At the start of the game, the Indian-guy doesn't bother you much, but further in the game his whining about his girlfriend and his childish and furthermore simply dull one-liners ("Damn, its dark in here!"
The only further comment i can give is ....WATCH IT!!
I also believe that what me enjoy this film further than I have other Edward Burns films (i.e.
Now it seems that Mr Burns has brazenly gone one step further and remade Woody Allen's Husbands and Wives (1992) with slight plot changes and a younger cast of characters and of course an alternate title.
However, her role was no bigger or more prominent than the other lady in the film who didn't appear until much further in the credits.

The first thing I must say is that I have not read the book so I can only go by what I saw on the small screen and at this point a further introduction is necessary.
Edith has a Brooklyn type accent which points to Max having something of a working class background himself, and further, he has ambivalent feelings towards her - for one thing, she is uncomfortable in formal social settings.
For a film made in 2001, the editing here did seem a little jarring, but further research explained that this was inherent to the version of the DVD viewed, which included a very obvious missing Interval title-card, which splits the film into two given the industry's run time for films.
A pity though that it wasn't explored further, and had to be ended as it did in the film.
The introduction of Derek (Harris), Kelly's pimp, and the potential threat that he carries as a character is only brought into perspective when it is revealed he answers further still to an individual higher up than he is; the son of the leader of this organisation.
Where Derek is more extroverted and animated; Stuart (Spruell), the higher up, is calmer, dresses more formally and talks in a quieter manner which quickly pushes the boundaries out further as to whom acts as more of a threat, without taking away any of the initial menace Derek inhabits.
The film is told mainly within flashback sequences that slowly reveal the sinister reasons for Joanne and Kelly's hasty departure to normally colourful Brighton (this film couldn't be further from that happy seaside town).
When Derek arrives, Stuart tells that his father is dead and he wants the responsible; further, he cuts his knee sinew to prove that he is not kidding.
The uproariously inappropriate hip, mellow, finger-snapping cocktail lounge score takes the viewer straight to aural groovesville while the ratty, scratchy photography further spices up the film's fantastically lurid'n'loopy sense of blithely unapologetic degeneracy and the maladroitly jumping back and forth fragmented narrative eschews continuity in favor of a peculiarly becoming "what the hell's going on here?
Wes Block (Clint Eastwood) is a New Orleans Homicide detective who's investigating a series of sex murders involving prostitutes and the further he delves into this seedy world.

The scene in Perfect is useless and it only serves to date the film even further.
It follows the trials and tribulations of a "one night stand" that goes that little bit further.

Not only is this film a character study, but the single-setting idea was taken a step further because for two hours while your whole notion of the outside world is erased you do not see a single house nor a single room, but a single table.
This rather dark film noir with its uneasy comics (Roscoe Ates, Nana Bryant, and Billy House who even repeats his checkers trick from The Stranger) and desperate heroine (Mary Beth Hughes), is further strengthened by the forceful performance of Charles Russell who manages to make his rather ambivalent drifter somewhat sympathetic.
We are edukated to not be complacent in the face of the powers that threaten to segregate us even further.
Let's not let the powers of the world separate us any further.
There is no language, violence is bloodless and not disturbing, and sexuality goes no further than a risquÃ© costume here and there.

But if you're looking for a fun time with the best acts The Renaissance Faire has to offer, look no further than The Lost Princess!
Nothing could be further from the truth.
But it is also about life... this series goes much further than the movie in all aspects.

It proved popular enough to run for an extended 26-part season and, although no further series were made, a comic-strip in the newly-launched 'Look-In' magazine provided fans with further adventures of the intrepid youngsters.
The "Baldknobbers" were vigilantes who had done worthy things for the citizenry in the post-Civil War period, with carpetbaggers and others attempting to plunder the areas - but like a lot of such groups, when there was no further need for their good works, they turned their prodigious physical strengths to illegal, self-serving ends.
He further added, "The caring and most talented direction by Vidhu Vinod Chopra is worthy of maximum praise and awards.

Jean Gabin would go on to appear as Inspector Maigret in 2 subsequent films - MAIGRET ET L' AFFAIRE SAINT-FIACRE (1959; which I've caught up with a couple of years ago) and MAIGRET VOIS ROUGE (1963) - and work a further 5 times with director Delannoy (including the afore-mentioned second Maigret film); interestingly enough, Delannoy himself would abandon his own artistic aspirations shown earlier in two major French films of the 1940s - L'ETERNEL RETOUR (1943) and LA SYMPHONIE PASTORALE (1946) - to concentrate on modest genre offerings (of which MAIGRET SETS A TRAP is the best-known and probably best overall as well) for the rest of his career.
If you're looking for a big shock, look no further than this masterpiece, but don't expect a cheap thrill.

He realizes there is a further choice, which is unexpected.
Karloff is VERY creepy as the devil-worshipping madman whose cold, concrete Bauhaus sits atop the site of a bloody battle (it even overlooks a field of crude grave markers); his almost effeminate makeup and mannerisms further his creepiness (his black gown hangs like a dress on him and he often gestures with wrist limp).
Overall, the added material outside of the 40 films is interesting and adds further layers to the project.
You can take that as a poor mark upon those modern directors, or as further good marks for the LumiÃ¨re's, or both.
One thing I'll say--she does "haughty" and "overbearing" so well, that it's hard to remember that in real life she was so afraid of further humiliation by the cast and crew of HUSH...HUSH, SWEET CHARLOTTE, that she left the film and feigned illness to get out of playing the role of Cousin Miriam.
If you're looking for a fun, scary, thrill ride of a movie, look no further.
Remakes usually are a curse for us, horror fans, but "Night of the Living Dead" is a different story, since director Tom Savini obviously made this film because he wanted to tribute the original instead of using the idea of a remake as an easy excuse to further exploit a profitable franchise.
I think the reason they use this device was simply to further highlight Tanz' descent into evil and madness -- having him join a notoriously evil organization (whether such a move was cinematically necessary is debatable, considering Tanz' obvious lunacy).
I would of found him more believable had he simply had some other motivation for pursuing the killer, such as wanting to further his career by landing a "big fish", or perhaps some smoldering resentment against "Army brass".
A further investigation shows that three generals do not have any alibi for that night: General Tanz (Peter O'Toole), Maj. Gen. Klus Kahlenberge (Donald Pleasance) and General von Seidlitz-Gabler (Charles Gray).

Korvo is a psychotherapist who convinces the store's management that Ann is clearly unwell and should, therefore, be released, especially as pursuing the matter further would be likely to draw adverse publicity to the business.
There are certainly some typically subversive little Preminger / Hecht touches, I detect, of voyeurism and fetishism, running the film close, I would imagine, to the prevailing moral code of the day, which the former was to take on further in "The Moon Is Blue" and to some kind of apogee in "Anatomy Of A Murder" 10 years later.
Naturally there's a large degree of implausibility about just how Tierney finds herself under the control of such a toxic character and the denouement is perhaps more complicated and played out than it might be but this is still a highly intelligent, challenging piece of cinema, further pushing back the barriers of adult cinema in late 40's Hollywood.
Cosmo is proud of his little world and his accomplishments, and further more, could not give a damn if anyone doesn't approve of them.
And then there's a further nod to another thriller, Kiss the girls (1997), where the idea of a deadly duo is raised and then quashed when a prime suspect is himself reduced to a jumble of parts in a bag.
But the story doesn't end just there, it goes on further... more secrets are revealed... some that may even change the story's plot... to find out what happens next, watch 7 1/2 Phere...
Like "Emmanuelle, "Joys of a woman" wallows in pseudo-philosophy while displaying a lot of aroused women seeking satisfactionÂ The setting is Hong Kong, where Emmanuelle is taken through the high-life of the aristocratÂ   In Jack Jaeckin's first film, Emmanuelle was sexually reserved, and came out as she discovered her hidden sexualityÂ In the sequel, she explores further into the erotic domainÂespecially other womenÂin trying to find the perfect loverÂ   The characters are not real, but ethereal, dream-like creatures floating through lifeÂ This quality actually works quite well as Sylvia Kristel encounters other womenÂ The eroticism is soft and sensualÂ When she confronts a man, however, there is a feeling only of performanceÂ It's much more sharply refreshing and keenÂ The male lovers never seem to be as compassionate or as feeling as the women, nor are their characters as developedÂ   The photography is quite rich and luxuriant, and has captured a postcard view of modern Hong KongÂ
To Karan for coming up with the film, trusting Nikhil and making it happen, and to Nikhil for a first-class job in his first direction... And the music is wonderful...Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy definitely establishing themselves further in Bollywoodland.

Fearing even further backlash, Fox studio head Darryl Zanuck withdrew the film from general release.
The basic plot of "The Long Good Friday" is perhaps the film's only real weak point.In it's favour,it is certainly unusual but often somewhat over-complicated (several viewings may be needed to properly connect all it's threads) and a little far-fetched;the fact it is set around Easter (Ireland has had some very important events occurring around this holiday period throughout it's long history) may be intended irony.But in the midst of the considerable quality around it,these are modest complaints.John McKenzie's direction (what a shame his subsequent work has been much lower profile) is very well-judged,being either fast,exciting,subtle or reflective when the situation demands it,serving the thoughtful,literate,clever,often droll script by Barrie Keeffe.The characters are not the familiar stereotypes you'd expect in such gangster dramas,and performers like Bryan Marshall,Alan King and Eddie Constantine (in a rare English-speaking part) are given slightly more depth to roles that could have been mere ciphers.Helen Mirren is first class as Harold's mistress,one of the most interesting gangster's molls ever put on screen,but the entire film is dominated by the career defining performance of Bob Hoskins.His searing,commanding presence as Shand is outstanding,carrying conviction in every moment.Hoskins' portrayal is arguably the most anti of anti-heroes in cinematic history.Harold Shand thinks himself as a businessman and no longer a criminal with the 1980's about to loom,with apparent peace with rival gangs for a decade further emphasising this point.But with the uncontrollable mayhem taking place around him threatening his legitimate credentials,Harold is more than prepared to dish out some extremely brutal (if not sado-masochistic) treatment to find those responsible so the lucrative deal can go forward,making cynical,hypocritical remarks about the decline of various neighbourhoods along the way.
The accompanying pulsating musical score from composer Francis Monkman gives further power and emotional resonance to this scene.
The funny teaming of Carl Reiner and Steve Martin after The Jerk(1979), brought you a funny send up of private eye films of the 1940's, but instead of it being just a simple spoof, the filmmakers went further, on having old film footage of great actors like Bette Davis, Barbara Stanwyck, Alan Ladd, and Humphrey Bogart for Steve Martin to play off of.
This sequel is very much that, all the while pushing the envelope so much further than the first chapter, Eating Out .
The combination of old film and new was later taken up by Woody Allen in "Zelig" and was further elaborated on in subsequent Hollywood films like "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" and the overrated "Forrest Gump", but I'll take Messrs Martin & Reiner's stylish rib-tickling homage any day of the week.
When the company even further jeopardizes his existence, he blows his fuse and prepares to release information on the indecisive industry of B&W.
Bergman senses some vital information withheld in the knowledge of Wigand, therefore further investigates what he is making the executives at B&W so concerned.
But Bergman faces further complications.
And the juxtaposition between the cold, hard New York settings and the organic nature of Mississippi further press this film beyond standard non-fiction works.
And I must say, that while it is a pathetic teen-targeted horror film (and directed even further at Black and probably Hispanic audiences), it was about a zillion times better than most of the pretty white teen "horror" movies I have seen (Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legend, and all of their nauseating sequels to boot).
What's different about this is that it actually goes further, into a child's realm of disturbing imagery, which can be even more disturbing because thinking of Lynch dealing with children is kind of appalling--The Straight Story aside.

I would go a little further and suggest that the premise of the movie is what would the case be like if Philip Marlowe were roped into a mystery when he was pushing 80?
), and starts draining info from the Internet so that it can find out more about Godzilla (it discovered that Godzilla has quick-regeneration process; Upon further study with Miyasaka, Shinoda calls it Organizer G1).
The film has an impressive use of the camera,with inventively flashy visuals here-and-there and still shots that skillfully add to the tension of the story.This is complimented with a clever use of soundtrack that further revs up the story some notches.
Sometimes the story doesn't come together that well,and the plotting goes a bit wavey.Also,some of the dialogue and delivery can't help but feel a little uninspiring.But for the most part,Brit director Roger Michell has crafted a film that hangs together very well and proves to be very intriguing,as well as further high-lighting some fine British talent that deserves to go much further.

The killer's identity is fairly obvious, too, but there are further twists - many of them linked to the hypocrisy and corruption of upper-class Edwardian society - which should satisfy most armchair mystery buffs.
All the time I was watching I didn't recognise the Holmes I saw on the screen, indeed, for the first ten minutes, I assumed Holmes was some other man to further the story along, until Watson followed him and called him by name.
The story involving a girl who does not die during the twenty-minute gassing and is then revived and how the men argue over how to protect her from further harm, is intense and touching in that it shows the humanity that is still in their souls.

Here the film falls even further into risibility, as although these couples are meant to represent (or actually be) real people, they are so one-dimensional, robotic and mono-subject orientated that they seem like no one anyone has even met in this world, rather being dead ringers for the inhabitants of some future Brave New World-type dystopia.

Those looking for an exceptionally well made docudrama about the battle for Santa Clara and the time Che spent in Bolivia look no further.

Howard Vernon provides a further link with the EYES WITHOUT A FACE prototype Â since he played the title role in Jess Franco's THE AWFUL DR. ORLOFF (1961), a character to which actor and director would often return (the last time in FACELESS [1988], a viewing of which followed the next day).

Phil Karlson's sharp, assured and stylish direction, working from a smart, complex and absorbing script by George Bruce and Harry Essex, further aided by George E. Diskant's stark, shadowy black and white photography and Paul Santell's brooding, moody, rousing score, skillfully crafts a diabolically arresting and hard-boiled little nugget of a gritty crime noir thriller: the brisk pace never lets up for a minute, the nerve-wracking suspense is well-maintained from start to finish, the tone is suitably grim and serious, and the tense, bleak, seedy and sinister atmosphere seethes with danger and corruption.
One of the people he had to fool was his daughter, who surprises him down in Mexico and further complicates the situation.
Ronnie James Dio further obliged with a running commentary on Gene Simmon's preference for money over music.

Murky, muddled thriller further hampered by director Daniel Haller's penchant for peek-a-boo eroticism (probably eyebrow-raising for its time).
For those who haven't yet indulged further, Grigori Chukhrai's 'Ballad of a Soldier' is a good introduction: more universal, less political, not as formally difficult, and quite a bit more fast-moving (demonstrated, quite literally, by sped-up shots of a tank near the beginning!)
Although Blalock is a real hottie, the shameful way her character is depicted as either a 'sista pretending to be white' or vice versea as some sort of living-in-the-shadows- chameleon is only further drummed over the head by the ham-fisted direction by Wayne Beach in his debut as a helmsman and also the film's scribe.
The rather ham-fisted editing further adds to confusion, with sequences ending to suddenly, settings changing without proper establishment, and events being referred to which the audience never saw take place (though, this may be since I saw an incomplete version).
What's interesting is to see the 'breaking the virgin' part takes time to unfold, and how it does, and how ugly it all becomes the further it goes along.

There are buildings and characteristics that are unique to their respective sides... the GLA, being sneaky and tricky, have tunnel networks, the Chinese, being morally ambiguous, have hackers to acquire further funds(all three sides have an alternate method of continually achieving supplies, so even if you fight long enough to use up all the natural resources, you can still gain more), and the US, having clear air superiority, can call in air-strikes, paratroopers and a nasty drop called The Fuel Air Bomb.
Almost as important as the case against the terrorists is the city politics where the mayor and chief of police wish to talk up Harry and Kate's role just to further their equal opportunities policies even though they had no role in the arrest they are getting the credit for.

I have to say that this film was eastwoods better works of history.The ability to bring out the real feelings in people about how we view the human race in general.I enjoyed this film for the simple reason that WWII was a turning point in how we see each other.How to come together in the highest need to overcome obstacles in the darkest hour.As the flag was raised and having a photographer just at that moment to take a picture of the flag being raised,coincidence flew out the door.But the film goes further as we see each one remembering the pain it created,from a simple misunderstanding about who gets what flag and why.If anything the flag should have went to the soldiers who fought there at iwogima.But like the narrations pointed out,it was a forgotten past and the hero's also forgotten.It's sad to think that the human race no longer sees why war is not necessary,just as long as money is made in the name of war is what it's all about.They were right though,without the money it would have been lost to the Japanese at least that part of the world.But in reality it would still be Japanese soil.This film impacted on all sorts of levels,financial gain through war,the soldiers dying because of money being made,artillery paid for by millions of people,and the suffering going home without so much as a thank you for keeping the world safe.In reality the soldiers who fought and died i would like to call real hero's.No matter what flag was planted,and why today most of the yesteryear men and women are nearly gone.I have to say this film gave me a bit more understanding why war is becoming a thing of the past.We don't need it and don't want it,flag or not we need this world safe and i think Mr. Eastwood gave us a good vision of it becoming a reality.So go ahead make his day.

Enjoyed the series when shown on TV first time around.I have purchased season one to three (as available) and I am wondering when further seasons will be released.I enjoyed Fred Dryer's laid back acting(I know he was replacing Clint Eastwwod persons on TV) but the cast was so right for the show,except maybe the "Captain', until the arrival of the actor who finally settled in the role.I seem to have forgotten the name of whoever played the captain.

(For further information on such a desperate breed, see Rhys' first major film: "Notting Hill") Okay, there is the overstatement that sees a male voice choir singing Mungo Jerry's "In The Summertime", or the twins joyriding their own father's hearse, but generally this film, despite the extremities of it's plot, does keep an eye towards realism and naturalistic dialogue.
Enhancing the film further was it's great choice of cast.

William M. Miller's fluid, sparkling cinematography, Ryan Shore's delicately melodic score, the nonexploitative and matter-of-fact handling of the unpleasant subject matter, and the frightening plausibility of the whole story further enhance the considerable jolting impact and potency of this profoundly disturbing and gut-wrenching descent into the cinematic abyss.

The Godfather, Seven Samuri, The Third Man: all fantastic, but after messing around for many years pondering over what is "the best film ever made" I find that I need look no further than this abominable piece of piffle that conceals within its two creaky reels, the quintessence of the art.
Right from the start of the film you are bombarded with parallels to reality and its hard not to get distracted by your own thought chain, in a good way :) The CGI is as good as it needs to be to tell this story, the yellow sphere that you'll have seen if you've read this far is a bit misleading - the film has its own unique style that extends further than such basic geometry and reflections.

Finally, the first few minutes start off promising and there is some humor but that vanishes further on.
Some of the messages the film tries to convey are done so unrealistically, however, some of the scenes are moving and authentic (an interrogation scene involving a racist Italian subway cop who discredits the gigolo's purported identity by reacquainting him with his given Hispanic name on a driver's license, in an attempt to further emblaze immovable class lines).

This is further proof that cult Japanese director Takashi Miike is not for me: as can be deduced from the title, the film is a pseudo-homage to the Italian Spaghetti Westerns (though Django has almost nothing to do with it!).
The O'Henry like ending is affecting and again gives the film a further degree of individuality.
The aesthetic of some of the action scenes go so much further than the typical slow-mo Matrix rip-off you're used to and really creates a style all its own.

Maybe he didn't because he was a perfectionist, even though the character portrayed is not a native French speaker   There are just two further points I should like to make that nobody else has touched on thus far:  First, the story for the script is from the pen of Danish raconteuse Karen Blixen, magnificently portrayed by Meryl Streep in "Out of Africa", who, Sheherezade-like, beguiled her lover and his friend with her fluent and fascinating tales.

The usual hard drugs and sex follow, further increasing the protagonist's desire to detach from reality.
However, Lynch goes much further here stylistically than he has before, making very effective use of digital's simplicity (even as his montage and musical mixing reaches new levels of intensity) and making what is surely his most detailed and intricate film yet.

I thought Feast was a satisfying film.I will say I was just a little disappointed, because I was expecting a tad bit more, but still, it was very enjoyable, and even though at some parts I felt as if they overdid some stuff a bit, it contained cool action scenes, and I believe really lovable characters.Also, they kind of throw you off guard, and do some of the things that you least expect, such as how they killed of Heroine, which when I thought since she was like, one of the most important characters of the story, they would've kept her alive, and also at the part where one of the creatures devours that child, I wasn't expecting that either, which I believe was clever that they were able to do that.There was even pretty laughable comedy, which one of the best mixes of genre is Horror/Comedy, and like I said before, I was really into the characters, like the old woman and Tuffy were some of my favorites in Feast.This was a good movie, and I think it has a pretty reasonable rating, so I have nothing further to say, except that if you absolutely flat out hated this movie, you DEFINITELY need to watch it again, and maybe you'll see the error of your ways.

The movie made up of sketches ,as I said, has always been Duvivier's forte.Here ,there are seven flashbacks,one prologue and one short epilogue :strange how this final resembles that of Mitchell Leisen's "to each his own" (1942),when the boy says to Olivia De Havilland:"I think it's our dance mother".Having directed with a topflight cast "tales of Manhattan" (1942) in America,Duvivier went even further in the "sketches movie":in "sous le ciel de Paris" ,he used intertwined little stories till all these subplots became a seamless whole.

Though Juanita as Baby Jessie has a few cute moments at the start of the film, I won't go further into the child actors save one grievance: unprepared wooden pathetic attempts to act and having to look off camera for their lines and those looks retained in the final cut out says enough.
Basically everyone listed follows their respective stereotypes to a T, and don't need to describe any of them further.
The Marine is just a silly film by WWE simply to entertain it's fan base and further it's empire.For one to judge The Marine you need to take into account that this film was intended to entertain action fans with a no brainer,cheesy,action,popcorn flick and as a popcorn flick The Marine succeeds.John Cena is actually a good actor and he played his invincible,heroic,one man strike force character to perfection as did Robert Patrick with his absolutely hilarious character.The Marine has the most unbelievable stunts and at some times they are almost unbearably bad.The fight sequences are great,very intense,very hardcore, but the explosions and special effects are brutally unrealistic and cheesy.The film also has some of the most annoying,campy,corny, dialog ever captured on film.It's so bad you feel like you're re-watching 1997's Batman and Robin.As a follower of pro wrestling I'm aware that John Cena currently has a love/hate relationship with WWE fans.Females and Adolescents love Cena while Males hate him.My guess is that The Marine was made in order to change male fans opinions by making an action film that generally appeals to them.However judging by the overall IMDb rating WWE failed to do so.I wouldn't necessarily say THe Marine is a bad film but it is incomparable and can't compete with mainstream action films like The Transporter,Crank,or District B13 however if you enjoy direct to DVD action flicks that have a thin storyline but some great action scenes like Special Forces or Belly Of The Beast than The Marine is more suited to you.It's definitely not the worst film ever made and I think for the most part it's because it doesn't take itself seriously and admits it's a popcorn flick.Overall The Marine is just silly action much like wrestling and much like wrestling the characters are whacky and at times unbelievable.

Edited, written, co-produced & directed by Matt Fratto who also co-composed the music score & also known under the title Zombies Anonymous I have to say I thought this was crap despite all the glowing reviews from people who seem to have seen it at some obscure film festival & somehow that makes it great.

The tunnels, however, remain off screen and we know what awaits the group, giving us a position of power Â a position of power that is further emphasised when we witness entire scenes dedicated to the Vietcong, the American's enemy, one occurrence of which sees the camera crane directly below a Tunnel Rat to reveal a makeshift Vietcong war room.
This thinking could not be further from the truth as this movie tries to illustrate.

This show couldn't be further from reality if they had the "boys" become bionic cyborgs with the powers on invisibility that can bend space time and had flesh eating incest's that fly out of their mouths, in fact that would be more entertaining because you wouldn't need such a huge suspension of disbelief.

This has a quality of "Tombstone" (1993 - Cosmatos) mixed with "Fistful of Dollars" (1964 - Leone) mixed with "Open Range" (2005 - Costner), but with a far more darker side to it which is perhaps only seen in "The Missing" (2003 - Ron Howard) and it goes even further into that.

Could this be any further from the truth when we consider the Media blanket placed during the conflict.
The military recommended cancelling the program,"Finally, the cost of the CF-105 programme as a whole was now of such a magnitude that the Chiefs of Staff felt that, to meet the modest requirement of manned aircraft presently considered advisable, it would be more economical to procure a fully developed interceptor of comparable performance in the U.S." Note that the government was told the Arrow was "comparable" to other aircraft and not that it could fly higher, faster, or further than anything else.

"Possession's" preview describes an amazing journey into the depths of love, transcending time, making Shakespeare look like the writer of "Not Another Teen Movie", and uses Enya to further add atmosphere to the scene, with her chilling emotional sound, filling your stomach with a mixture of magic, desire, and most importantly a NEED to see the movie.
I don't know how to engage your interest any further.

This movie is further enhanced by a wickedly funny sense of black-as-coal gallows humor, with the loony hick clan -- the weary, bitter old man (marvelously played by Jim Siedow), unhinged hitchhiker (a deliciously batty portrayal by Edwin Neal), and the freakish, squealing, gibbering Leatherface (an astonishingly bestial and bloodcurdling Gunnar Hansen) -- serving as a strikingly grotesque caricature of your typical American family.
The few good jokes in the movie only alienated the audience further, and the only remotely good thing about this picture was (some of) the acting...not of course, good enough to save it from a 1/10 rating.
Maybe when I'm years older and further away from my own passage into adulthood, I will find this movie nostalgic and charming.

John Matthew Mathan debutted with SARFAROSH(1999) and people clapped and were amazed at how in his first film he did such a good job  Now he returns with SHIKHAR(2005)  We always say a second film is a judgement day for the director and John Matthew fails in it  The main problem is actually the storytelling, direction  The film has a decent plot but it's ruined  Ajay's role takes off well but his plan of making a city looks feeble also the film lacks the intensity because in between suddenly they throw in songs and other commercial ingredients  The comedy by Sushant Singh is poor  The film goes on and on endlessly in the second half and the climax spoils it further  Direction by John Matthew Mathan is bad Music is okay  Amongst actors Ajay does a cakewalk in a negative role but his role could be far more intense, the director wanted it to be on a lighter side mostly and even says he had cast Govinda for it before LOL Shahid too excels in his role especially in the second half Bipasha is okay, Amrita too is okay Javed Sheikh does well Sushant Singh irritates
Not only is it memorable in the fact that it was written by a woman in a time when women were considered the lesser of the two sexes, but it also set up new standards for science-fiction and horror that were expanded even further with following plays and ultimately the 1931 James Whale film of the same name, which featured Boris Karloff as the mutinous, growling monster created from dead bodies fused with electricity.

In their hermetically sealed universe, the sisters' otherworldly formalism is threatened, firstly, by a landslip caused by the family mine which destroys part of their small village at the outset and, secondly, by the return of their wealthy and apparently hard-hearted pragmatist brother and his primly efficient secretary, whose modernity further unravels the web of antiquity which has preserved their world.
Except for the Master Of Ceremonies at the Club: Joel Grey's character is a semi-supernatural all-seeing character, mocking, seeming to somehow know EXACTLY the further destruction Germany's headed for.

However, Astaire deludes himself further into thinking that the roughnecks who come into town eventually leave it because of his notoriety (rather than through the helpful 'armed and invisible' presence of his friends) and even befriends a much younger saloon gal who turns out to be the girl of the robber behind the crime Astaire was supposed to have committed in the first place!

The writers and director try to use every clichÃ© to further their careers.
The humor is taken down a further notch from the first two films; again, a surprise for those of us who weren't aware that it was possible to go any lower.

The bomb would have just pushed the disease further out so that would have never happened.
In order to sell a movie to the American target audience you need a "typical American looking" leading actor, which will be quoted like a commodity(this quote will determine the further use of him to endorse another product).
The grouchy Daffy Duck is the natural choice for Scrooge: with the premise updated to modern times, many of the familiar Looney Tunes figures turn up Â atypically Â as submissive employees in Daffy's department store (that said, Bugs Bunny is his usual independent self, though he serves no particular function here except to further harass Daffy!).
This is where the movie nosedives even further.

It's also interesting to consider that a spirits ego may be capable of realizing its spirit, and maybe it was meant to realize more than just that, maybe it was meant to realize itself as the spirits instrument to experiencing a projection of individuation, which would further assume that the spirit is singular, and this would align with what could be considered as god, or maybe it's just something that couldn't otherwise be explained as the answer to life due to the bounds of our existence.

In addition to some seriously poor production values and editing (probably the result of being forced in front of a studio audience - not Sorkin's choice), not to mention a dopey theme song that continues to rear it's ugly notes, this series (and "Studio 60" to an even greater degree) suffers further from being produced by someone way too close to the subject material.
Why the police never catch up to this guy just further eludes to the fairy-tale concept.

If you don't want this horrible film ruined for you, don't read any further!
Oh, I almost forgot, I will give Martel this: speaking from the somewhat limited experience as the son of a pathologist and a nurse, Martel DOES manage to capture how deliriously boring and maimingly monotonous a medical convention can be (otorhinolaryngologists no less, their motto would rightly be "fun with phlegm"), particularly when held in a craphole motel (think Leaving Las Vegas' witty "The Whole Year Inn"-cum-"The Hole You're In") and further exacerbated by a tediously planned dramatization of how to conduct a patient interview (a device Martel must have found brilliant since she devotes exponentially more time to this than anything else).

The film reduced its wonderful source material to just another preachy, moralistic, stating the obvious 'kids, say no to drugs' diatribe.It also didn't have the guts to push it main character's decent into the hell of drug addiction further.
That being said, i know many will feel entitled to tell me that a lesson learned from anyone is still a lessoned learned, which is true, i suppose, but it is still keanu reeves, and he plays a chain smoking dentist The argument is further broken down into pathos and logos The pathos of this movie is most likely the strongest element, not because it is in anyway strong, but because the logos is poorly executed, there is no logic to this movie.
well no sooner had milla jovovich done away with her previous zombie killing fest, another adventure lurches menacingly toward her, or so the makers of this film would have you believe, in fact this films does little to further the praise (if there was much for the original) franchise, its loud brash incredibly clichÃ©d, wise cracking black man anyone?

Fluorescent lights flicker on and off to add a little extra ambiance (or in my case, to irritate me even further), none of the supernatural events that occur are ever adequately explained, gimmicky editing and post production trickery makes everything extremely hard to follow, and the whole thing finishes as confusingly as it began, with a child once again whispering some nonsense that might possibly have made some sense had I not given up caring long before.
Well, the filmmakers decided to distort reality further in Superman III by ignoring what made the franchise great and going with a hipper, more today approach.

Although both of the parts end quite abruptly, they are explored further later on.

The soundtrack may sound annoying too, but it adds nicely to the atmosphere and it becomes clear that things inside Lisa's head are not as they should, but since nothing is explained further and nothing else is this interesting, it cannot raise this film too much higher and the element can be appreciated only as a single succesful piece in a very flawed work.
And further on I thought this film would be typical British in terms of showing how something "exciting" like a sex club could be funny and not exotic at all, like they did in Full Monthy.
This has, of course, been Disneyized, made into a father/son thing, and child characters were invented for the further Disneyization to be complete.

Since then though it's been slightly down hill with some poor further attempts released.
Nothing further.

Lt. Sterne decides to take a personal interest and investigate even further.
While I'm not an avid anime fan, a friend of mine who is despised it even more than I. I was further horrified upon visiting this site to learn that a sequel had been made to this wretched bit of cinematics.

One of my favorite things about this movie is that it captures a sort of 'parentless' world that further enhances its subtle and sweet adolescent tone.
Indeed, the most mature character in the entire film may be the 10-year-old sister of the main character, and this flip-flop of roles is further illustrated by his sister's little suitor friend, Richard, acting ever the gentleman even through Gregory's very funny verbal onslaught.
But Forsyth the writer creates a constant stream of little gems that are very much his own style of wry humour, taking real life and stretching it just that little bit further, but not so far that it's no longer recognisable.

I will readily admit to having gained no further understanding or insight into this film over the years.
Thomas Susanto's pedestrian cinematography, the laughably lousy dubbing, the excruciatingly overlong 102 minute running time, the sappy theme song, and Gatot Sudarto's cornball score add further abject insult to already appalling injury.
was further proof that this film had no character development.

They have nowhere to go or expand, and thus the ending keeps getting further and further away.
Sometimes this film goes to lengths, also, to go further into depth about things that don't deserve such treatment.
Also of note are a number of scenes that don't exactly go to further the plot (nor make much sense for that matter) but are included presumably to beef out the movies running timeÂ.
The beginning was decent, and the new characters were for the most part acceptable, but the further into the movie you go, the worse it gets, until finally you get into flying characters and voodoo witches, neither of which (in my opinion) belongs in a "Blues Brothers" movie.
However, this idea is squandered immediately because of the fact that his voice sounds ridiculous, thus giving the whole piece a jokey sort of feel, and it's squandered further because most of what he's saying is delivered in a very patronising manner.
Hey Babyy was a huge box office success and further established Akshay Kumar as a dependable actor(Namastey London, Bhagam Bhag, Bhool Bulainya were all massive hits).
These three idiots then decide they love this near dead wet baby and get her revived... so they can skip and romp around the landmarks of Sydney to our further head shaking bewilderment.
The whole thing stinks and looks like it cost 50 cents to throw together in a couple hours--the fact that it probably cost more and took longer does a further disservice to the reputation of cast and crew.
The gore actually isn't bad, as despite being cheap it does have a cheerful feel to it; and the film goes further than most would dare, as offending body parts include penises, placentas and over-sized tongues developing a mind of their own.
The ending results left me guessing quite a bit, but not in a good way and this only irritated me further.
To shock you further, I'm also in my mid-twenties.
For further proof, compare the scenes in both movies where the main character displays his cluelessness about condoms.
Hes also left room for a sequel by including a predalien birth at the end, further putting a big hole in future stories.
This movie is the perfect epitome of Hollywood taking something beloved, running it straight to hell (Predator 2, Alien 4) and then taking it even one step further by completely disjointing the stories and continuity, *ahem* alienating the fans and basically wasting everyone's time while marring the original (Caddyshack 2 anyone??)
Look no further than the main titles to see that's all Alias was about: a fashion show.
All I can do is avoid any further show or movie he has anything to do with.
Even though the twist made little sense to me, the style of the film at that point, which pulled further away from the feigned documentary, worked better for me.
Stiff, wooden lines do nothing to further the careers of unknowns and past-prime actors here.
I recommend this only to those who agree with the message being shoved down the throats of viewers... so the preaching can go no further than the ears of the choir... and those who are fans of science fiction and/or Terry O'Quinn should especially stay away.
I guarantee you won't regret it, and I don't know what further guarantee I can give than that.
And the witty lines are abused going further...
Why does the film show Halsman alive and well in America in the 1950s spoiling any dramatic tension - we already know in the first 2 minutes of the film that he is going to be free, whats the point watching any further?
Whether you hate or love the Serbs, it seems this film only further highlights their tendency as a people too shoot themselves in the foot be it in the world stage or as was the case in making this film.
However, this film is very disrespectful, because it shows real footage of Bruce Lee's funeral - including his actual dead body - just to further the plot of the story, which is the lead character (who is meant to be Bruce Lee) faking his death.
Also thrown into this sordid tale are further cardboard cut-out characters including a champion skiier who is hell-bent on bedding as many women as he can before the screen credits go up and his jilted lover (wonderfully portrayed by Cathy Paine) who hams it up in a campy performance that involves her threatening to slice his cheating 'ass' with a butter knife before having a cup of milk thrown onto her as she falls to the floor screaming hysterically.
The movement controls/logic, however, were so extremely bad I didn't play the game further than the second map - it is the second game ever I threw away.

Partway throught the film, these film-school rejects meet a representative from the Japanese Tourist Board who pays them to insert further meaningless 'postcard' views of Japan.
Peter Sova's dazzling cinematography, the flavorsome evocation of the groovy swinging 60's, the often amazing profane dialogue, John Dankworth's supremely jazzy'n'moody score, the stark, harsh tone, the fantastic golden oldies soundtrack, and a potent central message about the bitter spiritual coast of blind ambition all further add to the sterling quality of this bang-up corker of a crime thriller.
Read further anyway.
nothing about the characters is explained, no back-story is given, and when the inevitable violence occurs, it's relief to know that these two examples of human excrement will not disgrace our screens further.
POSSIBLE SPOILER (If further spoilage is possible) It should take longer for directors to go into decline.
MacGuigan goes one further than Soderbergh - both directors emphasis role-playing, casting iconic 60s stars who seem to be making it up as they go along, having a laugh, trying on accents and clothes, but while Terence Stamp achieves some kind of grace, Malcolm MacDowall goes very uncoolly mad.
This is a no-brainer, I mean it's obviously not fair to the contestants that the British guy (the most offensive of the three), say, can hit Brandy's buzzer if HE's decided the currently-performing act is not worthy of any further consideration.
this movie was the first ever i saw at the drive-in and even if i was 7 years old , it was an exceptionable film.even if it is an 80's,you have to look further than special effects to like or love this movie.the acting is simple , so is the storyline , if you saw the first one , and the fight scenes are human.it's the best of the film of the duo,and no one should destroy them before seeing the rest.you have to accept the fact of the budget they had and also the music in wave at the time.the in sync of the fight was a choreography to make ballet cheap.and do not forget that it was shot in Italian first,they had to transcript all of the scenario.i just think it was a gem.
The situation is further complicated when Mel actually falls in love with him.This film totally rocks and in my book it's an adorable romantic comedy 8/10

Manmohan Desai was known for larger then life entertaining and illogical films AAA is one of them   The film marked one of Bachchan- MD most famous films and also a blockbuster  The plot is the similar long lost brothers theme but it's well handled and entertaining  The plot is revealed in the initial 20 mins itself which is damn serious but then the film gets funny and entertaining Amitabh's character is one of the best parts, Anthony Gonsalves became a big rage and is remembered even today The scenes between Amitabh- Vinod, the fight and the jail scenes are well handled(in PARVARISH surprisingly both played opposite roles of cop and thief) though the long lost theme isn't taken much further like other films(meaning the searching of the siblings.etc) but the film is more on entertainment then story  The film then focuses on love stories between Amitabh- Parveen, Rishi- Neetu.etc There are several entertaining scenes like Bachchan carrying Mukri to the hospital, Amitabh's long drunken monologue, Amitabh- Pran scene and many more There are too many songs though, like after the famous MY NAME IS ANTHONY GONSALVES in few minutes there is HUMKO TUMSE HO GAYA and PYAAR KE DUSHMAN   The film ends too in a slapstick manner with the disguises which also got famous and the long fight scene  Direction by MD is fabulous Music is good too  Amongst actors Though an esemble cast Amitabh towers above all and no doubt his character of Anthony became a rage and won him best actor award too He excelled in his character which is completely different from what Bachchan did mostly Vinod Khanna plays the cop role with elan and his last funny act is hilarious Rishi is a natural in his role and he is at his best towards the end Amongst the girls Neetu is alright, Shabana irritates, Parveen is very good Pran excels, Jeevan is as usual Hercules is okay
Without sharing too much, the closing scene is also very well directed to further underscore the storyline and theme.
I even believe the film ended too soon; there were a few ideas that could have been developed further.
I miss the old cast the further I get into the seasons, the old cast is what made the show so great I believe even without them the show is good but the old cast had the better times and the most memories.I own all 10 seasons and I am still working my way through to the end.
In his quest, the holy-man calls upon the knowledge of a death-metal obsessed record-store clerk, and a cheezy talk-show host to further his cause...  A truly funny and well-made production - DAY OF THE BEAST is a fun and twisted black-comedy that should appeal to most horror fans.
If you're looking for a plain old good flick, look no further, Day of the Beast is it.
Sydney Greenstreet often played nasty men deliciously but here he takes his character's weakness and pettiness much further than usual, and his scenes of escalating madness are very effective.
He likes her, she likes him, and yest not one of them have gone any further about it; and I also love the love/hate relationship between Sock and his old girlfriend - Josie.

Despite this and it's talkiness, it's still a decent film with an exceptional print through most of the film--though in a few tiny spots it is scratchy and appears in need of further restoration.
In this installment, the series has gone further then to parody horror films.
In one scene having re-boarded their crippled ship, the men have to decide whether to return to N. America (safer but against prevailing winds) or try to make it home but face further possible German attacks.

However, "Calendar Girls" goes so much further, forcing the girls' attention back to the joys and hardships of their personal lives, as well as facing the tough questions and realities about their original goal and what they have done to accomplish it.
As I mentioned, in lessor hands this could become a further melodrama, and part of the films refusal to subvert to that category is a credit to not only Bergman, but to cinematographer Sven Nykvist.
Either someone thinks I am very gullible or movie-makers all over the world should think about making church on Sundays a regular practice ... alternatively, they should spare themselves countless hours in AA further down the line (when directors and their movies like this become common practice) and quit now!!

Does it have a connection to that Valley of Elah which was guarded by Azekah, and where Joshua defeated the Amorite kings whose army was further destroyed by a hailstorm?
This movie completely fails to capture the excitement and intense public interest in Mantle and Maris's chase of one of sport's most sacred records and further fails to place it within the context of the what was one of the greatest seasons in the history of the American league.
However, I was extremely pleased with how the final story educated viewers on the realities of the abortion procedure (mandatory counseling and all)-- a reality which couldn't be further from the horrific depictions offered up by many in the anti-choice camp.
This film needs to be aired during prime time and piped into the Bush White House, if for no other reason than to show that abortion is not a black and white issue, that the argument surrounding it cannot be settled through protest, violence or prohibition, and that restricting a woman's legal right to reproductive choice will only complicate matters further but will not be an end to abortion.
Two national retail chains suggested that I contact IMDb for further research.
If you do not wish to read the plot and spoilers, please do not read any further.

If you want something unique as an underrated horror movie worth using for studies of photography look no further.
I'm assuming that this is a tale well known in Korea where this is from since this is at least the second version of the story and there is a note at the end about further outcome.
In none of the scenes that follow is there any further attempt at strategic communication.  
"Wordplay" fits into that category of documentary film-making, as it further instills certain modesty into the lesser minds of us viewers.
The IMDb mentions a vampire and astrological plot points, which sounds intriguing, but couldn't be further from the contents of the version that was eventually released direct to video.
For those however, who like their films dark, character driven, edgy, capped off with a bit of despair look no further, it's all here.
Miike expands the concept even further.
That is, no contrast in the light on faces or objects EVEN THOUGH THE LIGHT SOURCES LEND THEMSELVES TO GREAT POTENTIAL LIGHTING; lighting that could help further the story.
Writers Daniel Myrick, Julia Fair and Daniel Noah seem to have come up with a basic idea, without being able to elaborate the concept further.
There were moments where it seemed a plot might emerge, but they inevitably turned out just muddying the waters further.

Apart from the pleasure of Brody's outfits and how well he wears them there is further eye candy in the film's intense color, especially its rich reds and blacks.
And, what's worse, I wanted to make no further effort at all to try and understand the movie better - which is rather uncommon for me.
More because of Adrien Brody and Rachel Weisz, who play off each other wonderfully as an at-first awkward couple who get further romantically involved (there's a wonderful, spot-on charming scene where we see them kiss, and we understand clearly Penelope is having her first French-style) and connect closest with how Johnson casts them.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
So this is the basic psychoanalytical insight of attraction between father and daughter and the taboo at acts to prevent it from going any further.
The film's case cover mentions that the action sequences were from the person responsible for the action in the Bourne films, and that maybe the case but the director doesn't shoot it with any sense of Bourne's style and the result is further boredom.
The plot is too ridiculous to describe further.
Any further explanation would be either: a major spoiler.....or news to me, as i couldn't keep up with the movies many plots and twists.
Upon further inspection, the fight scenes (as usual) are shot extremely fragmented (why use one edit, when forty will do) so it's hard to tell.
I asked further.
There is even one rather graphic love scene between the girl and the man in the bathroom, which follows further nudity as she is seen coming out of the bath and drying out; that it does not feel reprehensible or exploitative is a tribute to the remarkably sensitive performance of Karin Trentephol (who, perhaps unsurprisingly, never made another film appearance) as the girl.
Apocalypse opens with a brilliant and truly atmospheric Vietnam flashback and further in the film there's a compelling hostage-situation in a flea market (which is obviously influenced by Romero's Dawn of the Dead).
Popular occult author Dennis Wheatley was so pleased with Hammer's 1968 movie version of his novel The Devil Rides Out that he happily agreed to them making further adaptations of his work, even going so far as to granting the rights for nothing.
Choosing to develop To The Devil A Daughter, however, was probably a bad decision: budgetary constraints meant that a faithful interpretation of Wheatley's book was impossible to achieve, and after much script wrangling, filming went ahead whilst further revisions were still being made.
I won't go any further than that.
Oh, and just a further note, the Spanish they speak in the movie is a castilian dialect, but that's why they have English subtitles.
For while the formula of Wellington having a problem, sending to Sharpe to solve it, a beautiful woman getting involved and everything culminating in a massive pitched battle was well and truly in place by now, Sharpe's Battle takes pains to develop its characters further.

Except for "Get Smart" Mel Brooks has not had great success on television (or any further great success - "Get Smart" being in a class by itself).
If you're looking for a horror flick, look elsewhere, but if you're looking for a subtle, well acted melodrama, then look no further!

His doomed relationship with Andrea Beaumont and the role it plays in his metamorphosis into the costumed vigilante further adds depth to the character, in ways we have never seen before, as we realise exactly what Bruce had to sacrifice to live the life he has chosen.
That's because it deals with the current topic of terrorism in an unflinching manner, with the hijacking of religion to further the terrorists' extremist and violent ends being told in a style yet unseen from films such as The Kingdom, Syriana, The Siege and Body of Lies, to name but a few films dealing with the topic.
Sinister foe's who were willing to go that one step further for their cause.
The interpersonal dishonesty between most of the characters further complicates this leads to a very complex turn of events.
To shock you further, I'm also in my mid-twenties.
the story behind silkwood is possibly an interesting one, which i will investigate further after writing the review.
Which further shows the weak structure of the story's narrative when the movie spends too much time on them.
And further more, to say that "the times we live in" are the reason for us over looking the fact the violin was whisked away immorally is a clear fall back on cliche for a lack of intelligence.
That's it's an expertly executed piece of filmmaking further indicates the stars must have somehow been aligned.
With estimates of how much further ranged from a couple of miles to as much as twenty, I reversed course, and by the time I got halfway home, the skies opened up in buckets of rain.

the only thing i liked less was the further the movie got, it could use some other story lines.
This was momentous time in China with the rise of the Mao's communist forces and the Nationalistic forces of China further complicated by the imminent Japanese invasion and World War 2.
Lee goes further from his "Brokeback Mountain" to enhance the degree of explicitness by bringing the leads' body/pubic hairs, Wang's underarm hairs in a close-up in particular, into mise-en-scene to connote the rawness and liberation of the couple's desires.
This couldn't be further from the truth.
Doctors are delving still further into how the brain works.
This goes even further than the original "The Sheik" (1921) ********* in establishing the films as something incompatible with reality; of course, both films suffer when taken without a grain of sand.
(No Madonna or Aerosmith, thank God, nor would have I expected that kind of crap, of course...) If you want something genuine, original, unpredictable (but not in an idiotic "Saw" kind of way), very well-acted, and a little seedy even, look no further.
Even as various residents fall ill and die, others attribute the deaths to a Greek-style vampire; to further complicate the story a premature burial leaves the prematurely buried considerably annoyed, to say the least.
We often hear of great moments in 1942's 'Cat People'; most specifically the swimming pool sequence and an almost heart stopping moment involving a scary walk and a bus or we may further be reminded of great scenes of psychological terror in Lewton's other movies, notably 'I walked With a Zombie'(1943) and 'The Body Snatcher' (1945), but we seldom hear of the sense of impending doom and escalating terror evoked during 'Isle of the Dead' which comes to head when we realise that one of the primary characters has been buried alive and it's her consequent insanity blended perfectly with an eruption of repressed superstition that chills the viewer in the final fifteen or so minutes.
Also, the studio's intentions for the film were undoubtedly geared towards a higher-brow audience, further suggested by the unintimidating, woman-friendly title.
;) The film is further enhanced by an exquisite soundtrack.
How the thug recovers so abruptly from life-threatening wounds for instance, or his spell in prison, during which legal processes seems to take no time at all (by reference to an extended fantasy is the usual answer, an occurrence which further undermines the allegations of misogyny).
Vince Guaraldi's fabulously jaunty score further enhances the infectious merriment.
Music for the most part hit all the right notes and further enriched the bizarreness of certain characters.
Also the film wears its 'Japaneseness' on its sleeve, which is further highlighted by the inclusion of the very un-Japanese Vinnie Jones (playing a hit-man who asks the question "What is your purpose in life?"
-If one needs more proof why foreign films are superior to American crap then look no further this gem.
I think he could have waited until further into the film before Erin's identity were revealed and that would have helped maintain tension for longer.
Two scenes, among many, jump out from the norm for their style, as often happened in a Hitchcock film: Payton throwing coffee, sugar, etc at Cagney, during a spat; and Cagney pushing Carter's foot further on the pedal in a duel of power while she drives her sportscar.
One day Carns witnesses a housewife (bewitching brunette Linda Harris) in the act of killing her no-account husband; this in turn causes the already seriously nuts Carns to go further around the bend and succumb to depraved delusional fantasies in which he has his sadistic way with Harris.
