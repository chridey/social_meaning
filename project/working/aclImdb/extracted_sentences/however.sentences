Also, while made in the midst of the Universal horror period, it demonstrates some of the best elements of that genre, however it also pre-figures the oncoming decade of sci-fi flicks of the 50s, but with a more intelligent, and mysterious, plot than most of the B sci-fi films that followed.
The ending itself is decent enough, however, as we finally get to see the killer's lair and the climatic struggle is decent despite the fact that you wont really care who comes out victorious.

He isn't noteworthy for anything but swearing a lot, however.

This shortcoming is difficult to avoid, however, in most any book or film.
It has only achieved a relatively low approval rating from IMDb users, however as far as I am concerned it is a fine work that, despite some flaws, is the nearest approach to a true erotic film with which Zalman King has so far been associated.
When you sit and watch it, however, the horror slowly drips down on you until you're drowning in it, not knowing if you should laugh or scream.
As such, however, he does include everything one has come to expect from a babes-behind-bars epic; problem is its all crammed into the first 40 minutes, the remainder being dedicated to a rather laborious trek across the desert and the decidedly predictable and anti-climatic round of score settling with The Man.
Lilli gave an outstanding performance, however, Lilli Palmer will be greatly remembered for her long career in making outstanding Classic films.
The uncertainty of the incident and her disbelief nurture in us the hope, however meagre, that somehow or other he is still alive.
I saw the film over a month ago so I don't recall the teachers name, however I think he is a idiot, i have to give him credit for being different...and sharing his love of music with kids but its outbursts seamed like a mimic of the classic "rock" artist.
Anyway There is a part where the ass**** teacher is playing a blues type jam, and had said he hates it when a student is better then him, well it seams that is easy cause he sucks, he had no licks, no soul and no vibrato...then the film seams to play him up as the "mentor" when your ear can tell you he blows.... what grounds then does he have for yelling at the kids, when his own playing fails to impress..The one kid I hope keeps rocking is the 12 year old who at the end plays a amazing solo, kids got it....(teacher don't) thats all oh yeah, most adults who act like the butt monkey teacher end up profiled as weird........aside from the yelling I act the same way its fine, however I play a meaner blues and I am not as much of a honker as said butt monkey....Ps I know my grammar sucks, then again this is not about me........Peace movie fans M.Run

Here, however, they barely give out a profit.
I could make all sorts of observations about how the writers, actors and director had no clue of how to make this story resemble... well, a story, however, suffice it to say that the care invested in the production of this film is evident in the total lack of any pretense to recreate the period of 1987 to 1993 when the film is supposed to take place.
Would a film with the same script telling two different stories about a woman who murdered a man who killed her child and one about a man who murdered a female doctor who performed abortions and "killed his child" be as well received however well constructed and "thought provoking" the concept and the film might be?
This quickly changes however with the introduction of the predator.

The Sands of Time, however, have altered him slightly, causing him to change into a dark alter ego, the Dark Prince, from time to time.
The Free Form Fighting System is also still in use, so spamming powerful attacks is still possible, however, this comes closer to The Sands of Time in the combat, with more strategy and tactics necessary, among other things because of those archers... arrows in general are present in this, and they are very welcome.
Time travel is very tricky business however, and not surprisingly this movie gets it wrong.
The worst part about this film, however, was that it was confusing and badly written.

No worries however, almost all shots miss completely.

The conclusion, however, is a bittersweet reminder that transformation can come instantly once difficult choices are faced.

in this Movie Dana Carvey hides his face behind many disguises.unfortunately someone also hid all the laughs,somewhere no one will likely find them.this is billed as a comedy,which is OK,but it's not funny.it's not even amusing.it is however,stupid in all the bad ways possible there are some talented actors in this movie,but i guess sometimes actors sign without reading the script,(or what passes for one,in this case)Dana Carvey certainly has some comedic talent,but aside from the two "Wayne's World" films,he hasn't has a chance to showcase it.i kinda felt sorry for all involved.it was truly embarrassing and painful to watch.i'd have to give "Master Of Disguise" 2/10

The show however is also a brilliant example of cult British sitcom.
The episodes however are incomplete, with huge chunks of footage missing and so to make up the running time, Marenghi, his producer/co-star Dean Learner (Richard Ayaode) and fellow actor Todd Rivers (Matt Berry) have had interviews recorded, snippets of which make up the gaps.

just finished watching "The Man"with Samuel.L Jackson and Eugene Levy.not a bad offering.it's sort of in the vein of "48 hours".now i'm not equating the 2 movies with each other,though i do seem to recall being less than impressed with "48 hours.i did however find "the Man" entertaining from beginning to end,from both a dramatic viewpoint and a comedic one.the 2 stars are both very gifted actors,so it was good to see them in action.admittedly,the film was kind of light in tone(it could have had been a bit more substantial) and very short in its running time.however,for what it was,it worked very well.i do have one small complaint dough and that is that the movie did seem a bit mean spirited in the beginning.not sure why that would bother me,since i would usually not complain about something like that.

The action and CGI was much better, however there were many points where it was unbelievable.

With all those restrictions, however, Philip Groning says that those did not affect his intentions for the film.

The base of this movie however was Sam Jackson in a familiar "Sam Jackson" character and Eugene Levy in typical Eugene Levy role.

Their idyllic tryst is short-lived, however, when a gang of bikers burst in on them to treat a wounded member of their partyÂ   Watching SHANKS (which is the puppeteer's surname, by the way) right after Robert Hartford-Davis' CORRUPTION (1968), I couldn't help but be reminded of that film's analogous last segment (right down to the 'dreamy' coda); here, however, Castle has a trump card up his sleeve when a biker steals one of the doctor's electronic devices and fools around with the zombified 'servants' Â the puppeteer, on the other hand, re-animates the scientist who, together with the servants now back in his control, beat up the gang.

For once, however, he gave almost as much as he took: Brigid not only developed an arts reputation in her own right, she also managed to remain friends with Warhol until his 1987 death--something that very few people, and particularly those of Warhol's 1960s circle, ever managed.

Another asked if we really needed ANOTHER homage to Hitchcock since De Palma's been doing it for years; however, one look at De Palma's films and THIS film and the difference is night and day: De Palma's films, which could be considered almost a Hyper-Hitchcock, are almost TOO jokey and slavish to its directors flights of fancy, while Benton's film exhibits the cool reserve, almost detachment, of its sophisticated New York settings.
Streep is excellent in her cool blonde role, though it's not a great part; however, her monologue toward the end of the film is very compelling.
And while visuals, attractive actors, special effects and over-the-top action adds value to a film, it however does not define a film.

The acting alone is reason enough to see this film, however there is a very real story being told.

One wishes he'd done the role back in the middle Thirties as a young man however.
Interestingly for a Matt Helm movie, however, Linka is a rare woman in Matt's orbit who is the recipient, rather than initiator, of the first display of interest.
The above got me sold on it, however when watching it a couple of other problems were quickly visible.
The last quarter of the film, however, sees a change of pace and the viewer is poured over with information that literally comes out of the blue and quite frankly makes no sense.
Sweepers however was a huge letdown, it starts brightly enough the whole opening scenes on the minefield are pretty cool and after the 'Roadhouse' style bar-fight scenes i thought i was in for a good time...then it all goes wrong.
The worst part about "The Last Winter", however, is the resolution or rather the lack thereof.
I think the highlight, however, was Brittany Murphy's incredible part.
I am not going to try to outdo the preceding remarks regarding "Zenda" with it's superlative cast and their matchless performances I will however, give my opinion of the high point of this great film.
The duel between a man and a woman in love is seen by me as the most exciting genre on Earth however what this movie offered was, with exception for some sequences, awfully boring and senseless.

As this was made for television the Major keeps her clothes on far more than in the film, she does however wear a rather revealing costume in the first series.
however if you care for Plausibilty and Realism while watching and, want your Anime to be serious, then Your humble Quest has ended.
I must say though I enjoy the series, however the plot is a little confusing and complex but upon repeated viewings I appreciated it even more.
A couple of the things you complain about, however (such as Kusanagi's provocative dress habits), aren't a case of dumbing-down for television, but actually straight out of the manga -- Kusanagi's having to strip nude to use her camouflage in the film actually seems like fanservice compared to the manga original, where the cloak seemed to be part of the team's battle dress, not built into the Major's skin.
Eklavya, the royal guard (Amitabh Bachchan, however unbelievable it may sound this is his best performance till date.

Some, however,we learn, it takes longer and they wind up as light sensitive,albino zombies, with the now insane- "Matthias" the guru of at least the Los Angeles area ones, battling Robert Neville, the last plague-free man on the planet.
A little melodrama, however is apparent in the scenes of "the family", and the movie does show its age with the language and color of the 70's culture.
It's there to break fellow Romanian Marcoux (Marat Glazer) out & kill any witnesses in order to conceal it's human identity, however it never reckoned on Ginny Lydon who doesn't take too kindly to hairy monsters ripping her prisoners apart on her shift...  Co-written & directed by Gregory Lemkin one has to say that without wishing to sound too unkind Shapeshifter is awful.
This piece of garbage however has to be the worst thing i've had the displeasure to watch for years.
The real surprises in the cast, however, are the men.
Later however, we gather the truth about each person, and why the marriage was foredoomed to failure.
Found this film quite unbelievable because of the fact that so many men seemed to be attracted to Greer Garson,(Irene Forsyte) first met a very rich man named Soames Forsyte, (Errol Flynn) and Soames falls immediately in love with Irene and he keeps asking Irene to marry him and after many years of trying, Irene decided to say yes to marriage, however, she told him she does not love him.
I do believe Sergeant Shadrach Bickerstaff played a Sergeant in Sharpe's Gold, however he is not named.

I did however notice some things missing.
The prize for villainy, however, goes to Toby Stephens as Dodd.
India, as well as its inhabitants, shimmers; however, the director Tom Clegg would have done well to ignore the peremptory entreaties of Indian/American actress (using the term advisedly, of course) Padma Lakshmi, when she demanded to be cast as the scheming courtesan, Madhuvanthi.
This miniseries, however, was excellent.
The other characters rock however; well written and acted.
If you enjoyed one, however, you will thoroughly enjoy the other.
One scene, however, had no artistic value, or any other value for that matter.
Upon repeated viewings, however, I figured out why.

The newlyweds however, retain a lot of chemistry and their bickering on-off relationship helps propel the story forward and fortunately, the crux of Palace rests on that story.
The movie is not for those with a simple, uncomplicated mind however.
Unlike Browning's movie, however, SHE FREAK contains almost no freaks at all.
That said, however, the film is deeply flawed and far from a classic.
There are a few laughs and many moments that LDS members should find enchanting however the film held little in the sense of real substance.
I really did enjoy this film, although it is certainly no cinematic masterpiece, however I do think it would be of fairly limited appeal to a non-Mormon audience.
No, I'm not Mormon, I'm actually an Assembly of God Christian, however that does not overshadow my appreciation for this movie.
If you aren't a fan however then I would still suggest you watch it because it really is a bad movie, but because of that it's entertaining and fun so give it a go.
Gay men, however, came under full attack.
I have mentioned cannibals a few times already, but there is no actual cannibalism in this film(people are speared and taken by crocodiles), although it is mentioned by some characters in the film, it is however in the same vein as the Italian cannibal films.
Poor Porky isn't laughing, however, after he arrives at Petunia's door and gets the brush-off.
It was a bomb, however I feel it was really taken the wrong way.
Now that the film is fully restored on DVD, however, viewers can truly appreciate this masterpiece of the macabre.
But, as the film progresses it is clear there are more sinister themes; however up to the climax the film never looses its light hearted atmosphere that makes it so enjoyable, for me anyway.
There is however people over there.
The translation is accurate most of the time, however understanding the language definitely makes for a more live presentation.
Del Toro, however, aces it, as per usual.
Overall, however, the movie is a well-depicted idea that deserves more appreciation from audiences than its receiving.
Kelly Garret (Jaclyn Smith) is street - wise and tough angel, however she is also really sensitive.
It's gusty political sub-text (on the treatment of the poor and use of violence to get your point across) can get a bit wishy-washy and preachy, however it definitely makes up for it in other areas like the chewy script with its constant wit and surprises.
Probably the strongest element of this movie however is its subtle use of humour.
Sure, Misraki's music and song are haunting and the camera-work is sleek, but what actually makes this film a major work is that the authors( R.M.Arlaud, Delannoy and Audiard ) are true to the spirit of Simenon : disillusioned with human nature but sympathetic with those who are its victims, however monstrous they may appear to society.
Much discussion was made of Streep's letter-perfect accent and her scenes as a prisoner, and indeed she's quite remarkable; however, Sophie isn't allowed to bloom as a person.
Gradually, however, the tone darkens as we become aware that the gentle, beautiful Sophie is hiding a dark secret.
Sophie's most agonising secret, however, is the "choice" of the film's title- the fact that she was forced by a brutal Nazi officer to choose which of her two children should live and which should die.
Despite these weaknesses, however, this is a film which more than justifies its ambitious theme.
The end of the movie, however sad it is, is not at all depressing, because somehow we felt throughout the whole movie, that Sophie was doomed from the start, that there was no other solution than this and that it's probably more peaceful for her than to go on and on.
The movie is more than just stupid and simplistic, however.
Lurking beneath the surface, however, is the film's true message, one which depicts the business world as a battle of survival of the fittest, a harsh world where men sacrifice their integrity and compassion in favor of oneupsmanship and greed.
The games become more and more clever and violent as times goes by(..not enough to satisfy, however), the remaining survivors trying to form a plan to escape their unfortunate predicament.
Daniel Franzese however sure is a step down from his role in "Mean Girls".
If you looked only at the cast and crew however, that would come as somewhat of a surprise.
His past, however, catches up with him in Shohei Imamura's The Eel, co-winner of the 1997 Cannes Palme D'or with Kiarostami's A Taste of Cherry.
At other times, however, it is a discordant conglomeration of plots and subplots, one-dimensional characters, and heavy symbolism relieved only by wooden farce.
It is however an opportunity to see an interpretation of the performances of the broadway stage who originated some of the characters as interpreted by the stage version's director.
I don't like to review the politics of a film, because every film has a political viewpoint, however subtle, and I have an open mind.
The third, dark-haired child, however (Robert Walker), never tossed a pigskin in his life (the first clue), but in compensation boasts `more degrees than a thermometer.'
Younger people, however, may not enjoy the movie, as it is not at all politically correct and reflects a time, the 1950s, that many of us who lived through it recall with great fondness.
The worst part, however, is the pretentious artsy cuts and slow scenes that wants to make this movie into a cult classic, all of which feels embarrassing considering the apparent weaknesses of the narration, pacing, acting and CGI.
The movie is so enjoyable for everyone...I wish I could write about the contents of the DVD, however, this would make it a spoiler.
I know many find that the sequels are disappointing and a real let down for the original film however i found this sequel fantastic!
One other bone of contention I have however, are the songs.Granted, they used a few snippets from the original's score, but all the stuff produced exclusively for the current film was your typically weak, formula-laden "contemporary" numbers that are so cookie-cutter bland that you can't even distinguish one from the other.
I think I have a longer attention span than the average film-goer, however, I have to admit that I can't sit through all kinds of slow films.
Nora, however, works out a way to do so.
When limited to the technology of the CinÃ©matographe, however, many of the modern filmmakers' films demonstrate little to no advancement in film grammar or insight into the medium.
The Marines, however, *were* covered even though they were inside since they were carrying arms on duty, hence coming to attention as well as the salute.
Acting honors however go to the ever dependable Joseph Calleia as a Mexican bandit chief and to Robert Keith.
The opening scenes set the tone of the filmÂ Ladd, an itinerant gunman known simply as Choya and with the aid of a tattooed birthmark, passes himself off as the lost son and is accepted wholeheartedly by the parents (Bickford and Royle) and Ruth (Freeman), the man's sisterÂ   Ruth had responded to his arrival on the ranch as any pretty woman would respond to a mysterious, handsome stranger, but she rapidly sets right to the fact that he is a relativeÂ   As soon as he is welcomed as Richard Jr, however, something happens to ChoyaÂ As a member of a loving family, Choya experiences feelings denied him by his own childhood and became increasingly sickened by his contribution in the trickingÂ  Leading a cattle drive to El Paso, Choya decides to give up his charade revealing his true identity to Ruth, who turns on him with consternation and antagonismÂ There remains only one way to redeem himself and make up for the distressing emotion he has caused the Lavery family: To find their real sonÂ   All the elements in "Branded" are taken directly from the straight-shooting school of Western moviesÂ Choya, despite his confession to Ruth that he is a "four-flushin' thief," is true-blue outlaw heroÂ The smart Leffingwell has him classified correctly: "You won't hit an older man.
Along with childhood friend he takes a job for local gangster "Putty Nose" things go wrong on their first job however when the police turn up and kill another of the gang.
These, however, are side issues to the film.
"Public Enemy," however, was a bigger-budget production, directed by William Wellman, and it contained all the elements of successÂ It is the story of two brothers who become Chicago booze barons in the Twenties... One was Cagney, the other Edward WoodsÂ   It is sometimes claimed that the story of "Public Enemy" is based on that of "Little Hymie" Weiss, leader of the North Side Chicago gang after the murder of Dion O'Banion by the Capones in 1924Â What is more likely is that the Cagney characterization is based on "Little Hymie"; the plot itself is pure fictionÂ   When Cagney, in his striped pajama, sat opposite Mae Clarke at breakfast and decided he had had enough of this boring broad, he wasted no timeÂ He picked up half a grapefruit and planted it full into Clarke's faceÂ It was a piece of screen action which has lasted down the years as the ultimate in violence from the gangster to his mollÂ   Of course, it isn't Â it just seems that wayÂ Since then gir1s have been slapped, kicked, beaten up, run over, shot, stabbed and raped, all in the tradition of mobster violenceÂ   But at the time this scene was daring, and the more daring because it was totally unexpectedÂ We remember Mae Clarke in "Public Enemy," yet forget that Jean Harlow was in it, tooÂ There may have been good reasonÂ The New York Times, reviewing the film in 1934, commented: "The acting throughout is interesting, with the exception of Jean Harlow, who essays the role of a gangster's mistress."
Closer investigations, however, points out that the girl has been murdered elsewhere before dragged into the attic.
The budgets, however, are low so don't expect blood-soaked murders like the ones featuring in Dario Argento gialli.
Dallamano however throws a black-clad killer in the mix and punctuates this police proceedural with a couple of very well done gore scenes (hand decapitation, machete in the head, screwdriver in the belly; take your pick).
Further investigations, however, point out that it was murder.
This is not a flaw however, since Claudio Casselini and Giovanna Ralli are very good in the leading roles.
I will, however, elaborate on some of the little things.
"Torch Song" is, however, fun to watchÂ as an example of the "trashy" Joan Crawford film.
I had many laughs watching this film, however I had a valid reason for that.
The difference, however, is that the Machines that Asimov had controlling the World's production were only willing to force those against them away from positions of power, and such resembled Earth politicians.
It isn't too long after, however, that the Russians announce that they too have built a similar computer for those same purposes on their side--Guardian.
Be warned however this film will scare you; there is no blood or gore and the special effects are primitive by modern standards, but if The Forbin Project does not scare your brain then you have not understood it.
To be fair the filmmakers were forced to cut some of the gorier stuff to get the rating that they wanted, however there is a documentary on the DVD release with some of the gore shots that were cut out.
Problems arise, however, when more survivors emerge from the cellar and personalities begin to clash.
Nikita however survives but she is captured and jailed for the murder of a police officer.
The film however was stolen by Tom Courtenay as a reluctant war-hero.
The Grau character itself is, however, alittle too "good to be true".
I do however understand why it's there - it's because by attaching the "good" German generals to the plot of killing Hitler, they let the audience not feel bad for rooting for them.
lol But the rest of the scene turns out to be rather bloody... Well, it's a good twist however...  *Global Spoiler Alert*  But the ending... Oh no, how could it be?
The title is very apt, however, as Preminger spins a web of intrigue around the central character, and although the film never really gives you the impression that it's created a whirlpool - it often tries to.
This is not, however, a role that plays to her strengths as an actress.
Overall, a flawed, yet underrated work (however deserves more praise, but not too much) from Otto Preminger, with both Gene Tierney (who is always worth watching) and Jose Ferrer a pleasure to watch.
Ultimately, this is an undercurrent of the movie, however, and Director Otto Preminger may have been making the point that even a good Psychiatrist may not be that good for people.
Korvo, however, has another, far more furtive agenda.
I will say, however, that I wish they had shot the film in the 2.35:1 widescreen format, but I am sure they had their hands full with the 1.85:1 format.
In terms of plot and story, however, DINOSAUR is still not well developed.
If he is dead, however, she can live her dreams.
This doesn't stop the drama from unfolding, however, nor the talk about wealth and power, first with old man at the bar and then when an upper-class couple who got stranded in a sandstorm come in and also get in on the conversation.
It would be impossible to get better performances however.
His voice, however, gave him away.
Earharts aviation contributions are substantial, however, she seemed to have more than her share of accidents, some of which indicate a basic failure of pilot judgment.
Another reviewer states that he does not understand why no-one has claimed the screenplay, but I don't understand the lack of understanding; I can't imagine that anyone would willingly admit to writing this script - however, it seems the director has (and apparently based on Chekhov and Turgenev, no less.)
The second series, however, left something to be desired in my opinion.
The toons however are the real stars here; Daffy takes on the role of "The Scarlet Pumpernickel" and does so with gusto.
The consequences are not the simple 'scene-of-the-crime-cops-get-involved-good-triumphs' kind of deal, however.
John Cassavetes, however, decided to concentrate on the characters rather than the action so you see lots of interactions between Vitelli, his girls and the gangsters and lots of shots of Vitelli thinking.
I'm afraid, however, that I agree with the initial audiences.
The consequence is, however, that we are transported to a very REAL, very pathetic place in reality.
I can't comment much on the acting as I'm not familiar with the actors or Korean cinema, having seen only a few; generally, however, I think the actors performed quite well.
The second murder is truly unexpected and shocking however and despite the changes I was happily engrossed throughout.
The script seems muddled, the science seems plausible initially (identical particles of matter and anti-matter do annihilate and produce radiation, however human bodies are not "particles") until we see Kirk in the anti-matter universe.
Her role does however seem almost as if it were inserted by the producers as an afterthought.
There is, however, a crazy girl named Clara who looks almost equal to Marcie, except without glasses.
This movie isn't all drama, however.
Eventually, however, Snoopy and Woodstock reach the hospital where Lila is staying, and her spirit does indeed rise when the dog suddenly appears by her bedside and enriches her enthusiasm.
The series, however, goes off the rails in the third hour.
I also recommend seeing the original first; it is not as good as this one, however it is still a very good, and important film, as that is the one that started it all.
I cannot however recommend most of the others in the series, (with the exception of the very rare "Yellow Emanuelle" and a couple Laura Gemser films) as they range from bad to ridiculous.
Like "Emmanuelle, "Joys of a woman" wallows in pseudo-philosophy while displaying a lot of aroused women seeking satisfactionÂ The setting is Hong Kong, where Emmanuelle is taken through the high-life of the aristocratÂ   In Jack Jaeckin's first film, Emmanuelle was sexually reserved, and came out as she discovered her hidden sexualityÂ In the sequel, she explores further into the erotic domainÂespecially other womenÂin trying to find the perfect loverÂ   The characters are not real, but ethereal, dream-like creatures floating through lifeÂ This quality actually works quite well as Sylvia Kristel encounters other womenÂ The eroticism is soft and sensualÂ When she confronts a man, however, there is a feeling only of performanceÂ It's much more sharply refreshing and keenÂ The male lovers never seem to be as compassionate or as feeling as the women, nor are their characters as developedÂ   The photography is quite rich and luxuriant, and has captured a postcard view of modern Hong KongÂ
well however the movie does have some emotional moments.
The movies has a very humorous start, however, the ending is quite sad, but that was meant to be by the title of the movie "Fanaa".
however what ever hes given to work with he electrifies every scene hes in .
I don't think they meant it to be a comedy, however.
If you can maintain a sense of humor throughout it's a fun movie, however poorly acted/scripted.
There is, however, an interesting exchange between the schoolmarm (Mary Brian) and an old pioneer woman (Helen Ware) about violence vs. pacifism that still seems relevant today no matter if you're conservative or liberal.
In the context of Bollywood however, it's actually is pretty original.
If, however, you occasionally indulge in something that is neither intellectually challenging nor deemed high art, but that is clean, bright and bubbly fun, you will enjoy this picture.
The portion of "6 din, ladki in" in the second half was a bit of a drag, however.
That being said however, this is positively the worst film I have ever seen in my life.
Under details for this Television series it says that the location was Walton-on-Thames, however series 1 was mainly filmed in Hersham, Surrey.
After just a short time however, the personality disorders portrayed must inevitably lead to a rather more uncomfortable experience.
He is however called on one last mission to which he remains extremely suspicious even after he is told that he is going to enter a virtual reality world created by the pentagon with the purpose of simulating war games.
James Gandolfini is one of my favourite actors and i feel that his acting is absolutely stunning in every episode, after i heard that HBO wanted Ray Liotta to play Tony i felt that it would've been the better choice, however after watching the first few episodes, i knew that HBO had done a great job in casting James as Tony.
I have to dig into some of the criticisms however, especially the 'it glorifies violence/belittles Italian-Americans' one.Most of the writers and actors are Italian-American, would they attack themselves?
People aren't as stupid as some of you make out....  Not everything is perfect however.
He, however, does do a hell of a job playing the part of Tony Soprano.
The key protagonist Tony Soprano is perceived as a perilous general bereft of fear and moral values by his crew ,however, Tony is of two persona's one which is bestial while the other is conflicted with guilt and resent.
The true genius of this tale however, is the creator and writers bravery and revolutionary take on a conventional drama series.
You can only fault her to a certain degree, however.
Scary Movie 3 was number one, so this is an explanation of why this movie, however excellent, didn't make the big bucks.
Here, however, Jolie is cast in a serious role as a UN relief worker whose only contributions to the relief effort appear to be her wealth, her compassion, and her ability to strike a pose during a bad situation.
First, however, they share meaningful glances during Sarah's short stay in Ethiopia.
Ultimately, however, Ford's performance qualifies as serviceable, nothing truly special like the cop the played in "The Devil's Own" (1997).
Not all of his government and staff agree on this, however.
I found this scene to be very interesting, however, in the film it is not dwelt upon.
This film was shot widescreen however the release on videotape is pan and scan so much of the composition appears to have been lost.
Not put off by the reputation of the camp the friends set their tents up & start partying, however someone intends to crash the party & kill all the guests as Seth (Kevin Robson) has his throat slit.
Soon enough, however, Rudy notices strange quirks about these seemingly friendly folks.
Jones defends it however.
In Belgium however this movie never made the theaters due to a law suit between Sandra Bullock and the producers.
I suspect, however, that the clamor to restore the director's vision will be somewhat quieter than the one concerning "A Touch of Evil".
There are hidden and internally scars that will never heal however my hope is that this movie will present a lesson to how the UN forces from France, Belgium, Italy, Canada and the US were inactive in their missions to police and stop the massacres.
The film opened to immediate critical acclaim during it's first week of release, however when a negative reviewer opted to focus on the treatment of Willy's character, it called into question whether the story was sympathizing with the Nazi cause.
After their ship went down however, another ship in the convoy rammed in the U-Boat that sank them.
Gangland boss Harold Shand (Bob Hoskins) is on the verge of something big in his native London's docklands;replacing the declining port-side areas with vast new modern developments and buildings,even with a view to holding a future Olympic Games there.There is however a considerable fly in the ointment;would-be mafia backers are concerned as Harold's manor and underlings are subjected to a campaign of murder and bombings,later revealed to be the work of the IRA,who think Shand was responsible for the deaths of several of their members (when in fact he wasn't).An enraged Harold plans his revenge,but should he go ahead and do so?
Hoskins in fact often makes this most unpleasant of characters sympathetic (with some witty one-liners part of his repertoire) in the midst of similarly unsavoury individuals.His grotesque arrogance and megalomania however get the better of him when he somehow thinks he can take on the even more ferocious and brutal elements within the IRA.He is warned of the risks by one of his closest associates,fresh-faced Jeff (who is killed by Harold in a savage outburst) but to no avail.The irony of course,is that Harold himself did not instigate this chaos;it the aforementioned Jeff and one of his most trusted friends and associates,Colin,a homosexual,who fell prey to the dual temptations of sex and money while in Belfast (doing an errand without Shand's knowledge or approval),placing Harold's business plans in dire jeopardy.
But the final drive away,with Brosnan holding Hoskins at gunpoint is now justly famous,holding on Harold's face seemingly endlessly but ingeniously,with all number of expressions telling us so much.This aspect of Hoskins' performance may be it's most impressive,despite being wordless.There has been a problem in some of Bob Hoskins' film roles since;undeniably a very fine actor,Hoskins however has sometimes fallen into the speech patterns and mannerisms of the role that made him a star into some other parts he has played,much to his detriment,though this has mostly been the exception rather than the rule.
There are many compliments, praise and recognition of his magnificent work from the interviewees; however there are also many obscure moments that deconstruct the idol.
+DO NOT see this film if you are offended by neo-Nazis (Boyd Rice is NOT a neo-Nazi however his character does 'hint' at it in this film (costumes and monologues) +DO NOT see this film if you are horney (it way warp your impressionable little mind) +DO NOT see this film if you are disgusted by fecal matter +DO NOT see this film if you think the random slaughter of 'innocent' homeless people is disgusting...  you wont be able to handle it.
I will however say that the most interesting twist is the whole ex gay ministry segment with their homo no more movement lead by Allen who obviously gets off on the other ex gays telling of their sexual slip ups with men.
Samm Levine however, gradually gets under your skin as a kid with to much self confidence to be entirely believable.
The show really grew on me about halfway through, however, prompting me to bump up my rating by a couple of stars.
Five years ago was a different time, however.
Sadly, however, the network, too, is to blame, as it shifted the show into unrecognizable time slots, airing a show that was ideal for young audiences at a time when they would least likely be watching television--Friday and Sunday evenings.
The issue for me however is that Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid is one very funny film.
Ultimately, this culminates with her going to a nightclub and Charley thinks she is still hypnotized--however, try as he might, he cannot awaken her!
This movie however just seems to have randomly placed cuts in which the DVD seems to be faulty and just randomly skips ahead.
And with the script and story you can't blame on a little budget, a good story is a good story however the amount of money you put into it.
The acting was top notch, however!
I ask you, however, what is greater than the concept of Evil Snoop Dogg coming back to earth to feast on human flesh, and wreak vengeance on those who betrayed him.
If not, however, you'll be intrigued by bleeding pool tables, talking severed heads, and a climax in the "city of the dead", that is actually well done and far surpasses the rest of the film.
This movie is not the worst of horror movies that I have seen, however it is far from the best also.
Bobbie Bresee, however, is well cast and gets a chance to flaunt her magnificent naked figure in a gratuitous shower sequence.
As the series came to a close, however, I became less interested in the Cadena family, although both the scene where Chato killed the policemen who raped him, and the scene where their uncle strangled the senator with a garote were both very exciting.
This movie however got actually produced by an oil company, so there is no such happening in this movie at all.
It's however still a very well directed one.
The editing at times is however really off and at times ruins some of the movie its pacing.
It felt really long at its two hours, however it was surprisingly good.
For me, however, the best part of this film was the color.
Unfortunately, my copy of the DVD is in Chinese, with Cantonese subtitles that won't change to English, so I guess that it's defective, however I'm keeping it anyway.
"Cue Ball Cat" has the typical violent gags of these cartoons, however it is different because, for one thing, Tom is playing pool.
This,however,does not stop this movie from being fun.
Where the movie excels, however, are its action sequences.
That does not mean, however, that The Untouchables is just some half baked action comedy.
Aquaman: Mercy Reef, however, began with a somewhat weak beginning.
Of the three films mentioned, however, I would recommend watching 'My Science Project,' instead.
This formula however in my opinion worked very well.
If you don't like history and politics and ancient civilization, you may not like it...however, if you really LOVE these things, then this is one you shouldn't miss.
The little girl is cute; however, the initial cuteness of those incessant "Why mommy...?
Catherine Deneuve, John Malkovich, and the other actors are trying their best, but inadvertently fall short, because of the poor script; however, the polyglot setting they are involved in is indeed an interesting idea, albeit inadequately exploited.
If this had been a one-man show of a 96-year old I would not criticise it however, hundreds of people (of supposed quality) worked on this production and it seems no-one dared speak to the man to question his view.
Mainly the story is about Phillip and Marlowe, however that pun is intended as they are 2 guys who dreamt of become Private Investigators so its a post apocalyptic film noir.
There is, however, no cheating in the use of classic ideas; they are combined so craftily as to create a new legend of Gothic significance and intensity, one which is also true to historical accounts of murder and realistic in a frighteningly everyday way.
I have not read the novel, however, i think that this movie is well done.
Most of the "shock" scenes and red herrings are predictable however (esp.
Overwhelmingly the initial reaction of the families was shock; however, in most of the cases parents were able to educate themselves about what it means to be gay or lesbian, and they became accepting of their children.
Millions of people still don't get it, however, and these are the viewers this film needs to reach.
All the glowing praise for the histrionic "performances" in the other reviews here ignore the message force fed a war weary population who knew well at the time, however much their heirs have forgotten, that European wars, if not all war, is nothing but procurement profiteering by peerage, the scenario presented so gushingly positive in this poisonous treacle.
I was only 4 and 5 in 1976 and recall only one time being sneaked into a drive-in; my understanding of drive-ins, however, is that when things on the screen got boring, people honked their horns.
Making one or several imitative efforts, however flattering, adds nothing of value to the original, and does not make any meaningful contribution to the genre, or to film-making at all.
Horror evolves, however slowly.
This film, however, is not a sequel; we only deal with Mark as he relates to the theme of the piece.
Unlike a cobra however, which recoils after it strikes, she lurches slightly closer and you think she might just rip his throat out.
Terry Zwigoff, however, is a filmmaker very much in tune with his subjects; his fictional films, the comic-book adaptation Ghost World is cynical (or skeptical) but with true heart, and Bad Santa is as dark as comedies can get.
It is, however, excruciatingly long, and is without enough story embellishment to sustain interest; an even more fictionalized account might have been a wiser course of action.
Ms. Shearer must be credited with crafting an vivid character; it's difficult, however, to feel much sympathy for her predicament, in this presentation.
The rest of the cast, however, went on to bigger and better things.
Whatever it is, and however it's measured, I don't think Norma Shearer has any.
The movie does play it safe when it comes to Kersey's "victims" however.
Once he leaves that loft apartment, however, then all hell breaks loose.
Overall, however, "After Hours" is an enjoyable film.
Fortunately we don't get too many of them, like we would in a Tarantino film, however.
Believe it or not, the two Blacula movies aren't that bad--BLACKENSTEIN, however, is abysmally bad--so bad that bad movie fans might (but probably won't) love it.
Others with taste, however, won't!
The film however belongs to the late, great Art Carney.
I would however, recommend viewing a movie like "Guess Who" or "The 40 Year Old Virgin" as an alternative.
Not this movie, however.
I could easily, however, read the book again.
Having not read the novel, by Ian McEwan, i do not know how it fairs as a novel to film adaption, most readers of the novel, however, seem to dislike the film and i admit, perhaps if i had read the novel, it may have put a downer on the film.
I preferred Enduring Love, however, because i think it is more unique and has the right balance to a thriller film, and thought the actors suited the characters well, especially, Daniel Craig.
I do admit, however, before the films having a doubt about the casting of Rhys Ifans as Jed, however, i am glad to have been proved wrong and was impressed with his performance of a Jesus-freak psychopath.
It does walk a tightrope between credible and confusion briefly but this just kept me focused on the story and the characters which perhaps did need more development however it works well enough to keep the overall feel of the film moving in a consistent direction.
For the most part however it is a case of watching good actors wrestle with a dire script and an implausible plot.
The "I hate Errol Flynn" bandwagon may have been emboldened by this film, however, because Errol is flirtatious and is as womanizing as ever.
Perhaps the greatest disappointment in "Ghost World," however, is that Scarlett Johansson as Rebecca is marginalized midway through the film.
On the whole, however, the film is a delight, producing some very memorable characters to whom, in the end, the audience will be sorry to say goodbye.
There's no time for celebration, however, because an evil nazi bastard shows up and starts peppering everyone with a prop.
The film, however, was a box-office disaster on its original release.
The story, however, was ultimately a downer.
I am embarrassed to admit that I am 23 and this is the first time I've seen this film, however now that I have I will be certain to go out and purchase any Buster Keaton film I can get my hands on.
The plot alone is entertaining, however the obvious draw of the film is Buster Keaton's amazing stunts, including the famous (and dangerous) scenes of him riding in front of a moving train while attempting to dislodge large wooden planks that are blocking the tracks in front of him.
The flogging he suffers while chained in a dungeon in "The Prodigal" did, however, win him a bit of unexpected honor.
As the film begins he has honored his father by becoming engaged to Ruth (Audrey Dalton), a gentle girl of his own faithÂ   While visiting Damascus, however, the youth enters the tent of Samarra, the high priestess of Astarte, goddess of the flesh, and he is dazzled by her beautyÂ To his father's bitter dismay, he demands his share of the family fortune, leaves his fiancÃ©e on the eve of their marriage, and goes off to the city in pursuit of the pagan woman, whose duties include presiding over human sacrificial ritesÂ  Among the fleshpots of Damascus, Micah's uncontrollable infatuation for the priestess plunges him into a variety of mishapsÂ He is victimized by Nahreeb (Louis Calhern), the sinister high priest of Baal, who conspires to destroy him for his irreverent interest in Samarra; by Bosra (Francis L. Sullivan), an unscrupulous moneylender; and even by Samarra herself, who withholds her love until he produces a certain valuable pearl as a gift for her goddessÂ
What's brilliant about this film, however, is that about a third of the way through, it rips the unwritten contract between filmmaker and audience in half.
At this point we are led to think that the movie might turn out to be a romantic comedy after all, events however take a different turn as love is replaced by manipulation, betrayal and greed and we are back into black comedy territory again.
Until that point comes, however, we are treated to a parade of funny special effects, some humorous and some painful slices of life from those who grew up not fitting in and, most importantly, how friendship can grow into something special.
Dante's film unfortunately has nothing for the adult audience that was so delighted and entertained by the two "Gremlins" films however.
Remarkably the film still holds up well even though it's a movie primarily aimed at children, however the film is really brought down by the third act.
The idea for the story however was solid and this would be a good film to be remade.
Films such as these, however, were coincident with films by others like D.W. Griffith; one can easily see which was advancing the medium and which was hampering it.
Everyone stated it was excessively gory and violent, however when I watched it I didn't think it was too bad.
You won't go wrong with any of those, however this one will let you down right from the beginning, and the end won't do you much good either.
This film, however, polarizes the two sides of the issue instead of exploring the ways in which they intersect.
In this one, however, he had a hard role to play, and he played it well, doing great voice-acting too.
Such songs as You're Devastating and The Touch of Your Hand got relegated however to just part of the instrumental background.
Due to the cast, and Woody's script, however, this is very much another Woody Allen flick, no matter who is in the director's chair.
The film isn't a complete one-man show, however, as the underrated Tony Roberts, along with Diane Keaton also give grand performances.
Futurama, however, is the rare series that I wouldn't mind watching any episode at any time.
If you let the yellow family go, however, and actually watch the show for what it is, you will love it.

This indulgence is something Morris does not explore further, however.
I realise that it is only a war movie, doubtlessly made for a young male viewing audience, and it is silly to take such films seriously, and I don't; however, Submarine X-1 even as a time-killer for boys on rainy weekend afternoons is 'orrible.

Its third outing however (the Crow: Salvation) i enjoyed.
There is an occasional nice shot, however, such as a scene with Alex walking down an alley towards the screen, with it snowing.

All the stories however end in murder, often shockingly brutal murder and torture.

Audie, however paid a bitter price.
Like many great soldiers, however, he had trouble adjusting to life after the war even with a semi-successful acting career aided by James Cagney after the war.
So in terms of historical accuracy Che falters and ultimately that leads to the dearth and want of something a little more cerebral and provocative rather than an exercise in cinematic and narrative technique, however laudable that is.

I will, however, say without shame that this is my favorite Final Fantasy.
Since I went into it with an open mind of sorts, however, all I can see is the overpowering beauty and emotion of the characters, animation, and design.

Not everyone dies in this movie, however, and there is a very neat twist at the end.

The movie is filled with a great deal of Hong Kong humor and however the language is awfully vulgar (especially for kids, but they wouldn't understand those jokes).
The version with June Allyson and Janet Leigh is my favourite, however, I also enjoyed the other two versions that I have seen.
Here, however, Murphy goes massively over the top, and it's hard to imagine how anyone that obnoxious doesn't end up with a cracked jaw.

The humour is sometimes crude and vulgar, however.

Generally the acting is superb, however, in particular this is possibly Orson Welles' finest performance.

There is however one upside to this installment in the Dirty Harry series, which is, that it is far more stable than it's predecessors.
What really gives this one that ring of authenticity, however, is that Clint Eastwood is in top form, and even in his third outing as Harry seems more immersed in the character than ever.
The first four, however, more than make up for it-- and that's the magic of the movies.
There is however one upside to this installment in the Dirty Harry series, which is, that it is far more stable than it's predecessors.

The remake, however, is one of the goriest films ever.

In its second half, however, the story surrenders to the pessimism it tries to battle; the tone shifts from `Dilbert' to Kafka, and some of the characters suddenly become cold and unsympathetic.
Whichever version the viewer chooses to watch, however, a highly entertaining and, yes, educational time is almost guaranteed.
Two of the grave robbers, William Hare (Donald Pleasence) and William Burke (George Rose), however, have their very particular methods to bring in corpses that are especially fresh...  Aditionally to the terrifying and fascinating story and the gloomy atmosphere, "The Flesh And The Fiends" also profits from a brilliant cast.
The arguably greatest performance in this film, however, comes from Donald Pleasence (another favorite actor of mine), who delivers an ingenious portrayal of evil as the unscrupulous Willaim Hare.
The film's theme, however, and the uncompromising manner it is brought to screen, is unspeakably macabre for its time.
The real stars of the show, however, are the graverobbers themselves; Burke and Hare.
It was a bad ship, and it ended in a one-way ticket back to Sweden, paid by the Swedish embassy, but, however, there were some Mexican hookers visiting our ship every day during our stay, very friendly and "speakable", but one day when they came aboard one of them shouted "I'm a movie star", and she explained that she had a part in a film called "Crossroads" (later I found out that it was called Back Roads), featuring Sally Field.

I missed the first few minutes of it, however and would love to see it again.
Only a lawyer could come up with a plot like this, however.
The Movie is however much different from the book but this was for me a very enjoyable find, especially after a near 30 year search.
What could have been a rosy small town setup however has been sent off the tracks by a criminal investigation into the war-time practices of the company, which was accused of passing off defective parts which ended up killing American pilots Â Ann's father has been sent to prison for a crime that it becomes increasingly obvious was probably just as much Edward G's character's fault.
His son, Chris, however, comes home and announces that he wants to marry Deever's daughter Ann - who had been engaged to Chris' brother Larry, lost during the war and presumed dead.

I watched the 1985 film Krush Groove yesterday, I must say I really enjoyed it.Now here's the thing about this movie.If you do not like rap, you will probably not enjoy this movie.If you hate very old-school rap(any rap song that came out before 1988), you probably will not like this movie.However, if you like the genre of music, you will probably enjoy this film.I really like this kind of rap.I also like old gangsta rap from the late 80's to late 90's.I also like other types of music such as rock, metal etc.Therefore, I liked Krush Groove.The plot of the film involves a man who is trying to start his own record label, his brother's a member of rap group Run DMC.He starts it after a loan, and it does work, however there is another big record producer who is stealing his artists.He also owes money to the man who originally gave it to him.Meanwhile, a rap group called "The Disco Three"(The Fat Boys), are trying to make it big in the rap game.The movie features music from artists such as Shiela E, Run DMC, The Beastie Boys, Fat Boys, LL Cool J etc.If you like old-school hip hop/rap, then Krush Groove is the movie you should see.
Unlike most "school" movies, however, I quite enjoyed it.
In this movie we can watch pretty good performances;emphasizing one or two of them would be unfair because they all are incredible,however I can say I consider Robin William's performance in this film the best of all his filmography.
Weldon, however, is about to be shaken up by the arrival of John Keating (Robin Williams in an unusual dramatic turn), who encourages his students to look at things with new eyes.
There was however Cameron Crow that set the high-school genre on it's 'ear' with with the creating of "Fast Times At Ridgemont High" which for me growing up back then was straight between the eyes!

The list of criminals, however, has much more meat to chew on and does so, lead by the villainous leader Everett Sloane and his deputy, Ted De Corsia as well as all the others to be listed.
Can't say I was impressed, however, by the key that unlocks the puzzle.
she does however, deserve some credit for always being able to find her co-actors as in seemingly every close up she tended to disappear in a fog the likes of which has rarely been seen outside of an episode of the original 'Star Trek' (you can almost hear the director imploring his cinematographer to 'add more vaseline to the lens!').
I do realize that the director was going for the homage to a period movie, however, he focuses too much on it.
There were however a few minor errors of omission or commission.
The focus of the film, however, is on two ordinary troopers: Brad Davis's Henry Nash, a composite of the trooper from the Territories with a real Rough Rider's name, and Chris Noth's Craig Wadsworth -- one of the Park Avenue contingent, who enlisted as a trooper and mustered out as a sergeant.

I understand why some may be to say the least disappointed however, I found it to be very entertaining art piece, which is not easily done.
however.
A Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell, on the other hand, has me rather confused about its makers intentions: sometimes it follows the standard Troma route, offering extremely dumb characters, bad special effects, and gratuitous sex and violence; occasionally, however, it seemed to me that director Brett Piper wanted his film to be more than just tacky trash, throwing in snippets of poetry (Lewis Carroll's Jabberwocky), an intriguing sci-fi slant (there is the suggestion that the planet may not be Earth, and that the humans are the descendants of space travellers), and more poignant moments (such as the agonising cry from the scarred warrior who yearns for company).
Whatever the director's intentions were, however, the film still sucks!
It's best then, as Herzog suggests, to take one out of context of the period, even if seeing the green-screen images (however brief) of the war conjures up immediate associations.
If looking at this without the associations of the Iraq war part 1 or the Kuwait connection in it all with oil however (as with Wild Blue Yonder not associating that its 'just' NASA and underwater photography), it fills one with an immense wonder at what can be captured by a lens not bound by conventions.
Special effects will suffer when viewed with out 3-D glasses, however, the film is still enjoyable to watch.

Well, Salma Hayek's curves are eye candy, however, does not justify having to sit thru this travesty of a film.
The best support, however, comes from Rachel Griffiths as Joe's girlfriend, also a cop.
She is, however, excellently physical, and would have made a great action star (I wouldn't be surprised if this option were still open to her).

I did however watch this movie as a kid, and it affected my life.
"Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas," however, is perfectly suited for CG animation.
Bill, however, is driven by his own sense of deserving, that he is superior to the blacks and Irish.
Cameron Diaz is totally unconvincing as Jenny and Scorsese could have easily given the part to a real life NY hooker while Daniel Day Lewis gives a powerhouse performance as Bill Cutting , however the role is slightly overplayed especially compared to Lewis's other work   Indeed everyone involved in GANGS OF NEW YORK in whatever capacity has done far better in other movies and at the end of the day this is a very unsatisfying flawed picture which received more nominations than it did prizes at award ceremonies , and I'm somewhat happy about that because this movie isn't a crowning achievement for anyone , especially Martin Scorsese or Daniel Day Lewis who are capable of better things   Seven out of Ten
Actually it's a great movie, however it's very very underestimated also.
I was in Turkey when the movie was first released however I haven't heard of it until I saw in on DVD, since it possibly was not well advertised due to financial issues but the cast and the plot is really spectacular, and well directed.
It has a scene of Troma's famous barfing however.
But this in itself was not enough to make this movie worth a see - I think Dushku fans (including myself) will watch this just for her and will be glad to finally see her in something, anything... however it makes one wonder why on earth she did this!
This film however is filled with poignancy, beauty and self-assuredness.
THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT PART II is different, however, for three reasons.

Gone, however, are several of the conventions of Guest's previous films.

Now, however, even those words seem like a hopeless dream.
Like beyond pathetic, however much money you throw at it.
Strangely enough however, even if Schoendoerffer really used all the wrong ingredients to make his spy flick, this isn't a bad movie at all.
It is, however, a relatively complex story, with a number of sub-plots: the French agent who wants to quit, and who pays the price for trying; the degree of collusion between government and dirty business; the nature of the arms trade and why it continues.
On reflection, however, it was appropriate, if a bit flat Â especially after all that blazing action.
It is easy to quibble that their own characters are flawed; such flaws are, however, the very essence of their humanity.
At the end however the movie goes from dull and boring to pathetic, turning the story in another silly way using really bad computer graphics.

It must be said in the son's favor, however, that he managed to get his hair stylishly cut (just a whisper of mousse)and deliver a moving anti-war speech to his slack jawed mom before biting the dust (dust he wouldn't have bit if he had the sense to come in out of the flack).
Hope was known to have liaisons with a few female performers, most discreetly however.
The character of Eddie Sparks however had three daughters and America's most well known father of girls was Eddie Cantor in most of this era.
The plot -although kind of standard (a bunch of soldiers chased by savage Indians through the swamps- is however very well handled by director Roul Walsh and he keeps action going all along without major bumps.
I read that this will be Mr. Garner's last film, I do hope that such is not the case, however if it is, then he has gone out on a high note that is a fine cap to his career.
Not so much here, however.
It is pretty disturbing however, and it's variety of extreme close-ups include genitalia, self-surgery, barfing, masturbation, and yes, taxidermia.
each of the generations have it's own story, plot lacks a bit in this film, however, the cinematography is amazing, and I think that if I was to watch this film with no subtitle's and understand nothing, I would still enjoy the cinematography with the soundtrack by Amon Tobin complementing this film to a "T".

The performances of the three leading ladies are well balanced however the supporting cast let the side down a little.
Now I was actually surprised to see that underneath the makeup, Loretta Young didn't look too bad as an Asian, however Robinson looked about as Chinese as Scatman Crothers!!
Subsequent to watching this film, however, I was confused.
If you are looking for an intelligent action drama, you are probably better served skipping "So Close", however if you want a fun action drama that is so much more better than "Charlie's Angels", then "So Close" is something for you.
Yet while this is an animated film, it is not ment for small childern however.
I do however agree that both Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway (particularly) are fine actresses, and are both very pleasing to the eye.
Her performance in "Bride Wars" was surely satisfactory, however I believe her role was not really challenging.
To be fair however, Bride Wars isn't really a romance at all.
I was expecting to be grossly disappointed by this sequel, after the first offering which blew me away ((being a Newcastle fan and all)) I was pleasantly surprised however at the ease at which the story flowed between Santiago's time at Newcastle, to his blossoming career at Real Madrid.
An upside however was Santiago finally finding his long lost mother and a stepbrother he never knew he had...  All in all, a rollicking good watch for all concerned.
It does however have beautiful women, some cool fight scenes, and great style.
Lon Chaney Jr (a man who has played all of Universal's main villains) is a worthy replacement, however; but the Count just doesn't seem as sinister with him in the role.
In that one however, the town folks don't take to city boy Bing right away, here they're going out of their way to make Fox welcome as they know that Hughes will not be there forever.
Despite enjoying the show very much, I must, however, admit that the show was very formulaic and predictable.
The acting is pretty good with Tom Cruise being believable as the fugitive police officer, however the best performance comes from Samantha Morton in the role of Agatha; the pre-cog who Anderton turns to for help and who in turn seeks his help in solving an old case.
I saw this a couple years ago and was unimpressed, however after upon 2nd viewing, I must say It deserves it's praise, so if you didn't care for it the 1st time, give it a second viewing, you may change your opinion.This should honestly be in the top 250 in my opinion, and there are some fantastic creepy moment as well, plus I loved the depressing atmosphere it had at times, and This is almost like The Fugitive except it's set in the future, plus It also has some very funny scenes in it as well.
But it's clear enough that locking these people up, however much it may be in the interests of justice, serves no purpose.
This is a fantastic film however that should be viewed and loved by everyone bold enough to come in its path.
It addresses larger issues, however, than the usual French fare.
Joan Crawford's character, however, is the main focus of the film and wow does she have a lot going on psychologically!
This is only the beginning, however, as throughout the course of the film, it's apparent that her problems run much deeper as she paints an amazingly accurate portrait of a woman sinking into the depths of schizophrenia (with paranoid and catatonic features).
Finally, however, David accepts a job FAR AWAY,with Mr. Graham's oil firm.
The tension, however, between her and Van Heflin is pretty good; he's an up and coming engineer and certainly not going to commit himself to her, a clinging neurotic who's a nurse for the suicidal wife of Heflin's employer played by Raymond Massey.
I have read the other reviews, however I cannot agree, because this is a BIG hearted not light hearted comedy drama, and there is PLENTY of chemistry between the stars Annabella Sciorra and Matt Dillon.
I am generally not critical of people who have a different opinion than I, however, anyone who liked this turkey is either stupid or mentally challenged.
Most, however, are visiting the graves of loved ones.
This film raises a serious issue in Philippine society, however, I think most of Philippine politicians may not even recognize how desperate a country which relies on exporting their people for such slavery jobs.
The acting in this movie is magnificent, I had never heard of Vilma Santos until I watched Anak, however after seeing it I had to rent out some of her other movies, the emotion shown by Vilma, and the other actors is amazing and at times you really can find yourself believing that this family is real.
This is a chick flick with weak story line (okay acting, however).
This one however was one of the worst.
I give credit, however, to Myers for doing whatever he can with the character and does score maybe a few puns.
This one, however, I'm ashamed that I ever wasted bandwidth getting it, let alone consider watching it again.
Had the gags been separated and shown on a TV skit show, I might be calling them genius, however, when you string them together with the only common denominator being that the same characters are used, it gets old fast.
If one sees the film nowadays, however,one glaring, seemingly unimportant compromise is obvious----the character "Curley's Wife",the only woman in the film---has been given a name...Mae.
The highlight, however, of this "western adventure," is the ice-fishing scene..Without giving too much away, suffice to say all three Stooges wind up taking humorous plunges into the icy waters.
Rather than ghosts, however, the mansion is populated by murderous mice who ritually execute their victims.
viewed movie as NO GOOD DEED: I found the plot to be somewhat plausible, however, there were many errors in the movie.
Jack Friar is looking for a blond-haired, blue-eyed male, and Doug Hutchison (character Hoop) thinks it is him -- however, Hoop is dyed blonde-haired with brown eyes.
Grace Zabriskie and Joss Ackland steal the show, however, with their portrayals of a thief-couple in their twilight years.
I could however see it being a barrier for people unfamiliar with Scottish slang, although if someone could understand "Trainspotting" they should have no trouble with this movie.
From Daffyth - The only gay in the village, a stereotype that we know all too well to the Cross Dressing lady boys who act as though they want to remain subtle in their acts cross dressing however draw attention to themselves whenever possible.
With a approaching Christmas Special which is supposed to tie up the ends for many Characters, we may soon be saying goodbye to Little Britain this may not be a bad thing however as its best to go out on top and if it continued, I believe it would start to flounder as if Series 3 is anything to go by, the ideas is simply not there.
The Italian film was meant to have a big emotional bang; this Chinese film, however, goes the restrained route of slow, emotional realization.
All in all however this movie fell short.
All in all however, it was enjoyable, despite its many fall backs.
however, iÂ´m faithful to jack and see whatever he's done on film.
Someone looking for a deep and meaningful plot will not find what they are looking for, however it is one of the best plots of all the Adam Sandler movies.
Although this western feature has much big name talent, it however fails in quality.
That's not too big of a complaint, however, in a classic comedy such as this one.
Ambrose has a debilitating problem however: he gets violently seasick at the slightest excuse.
Once into its stride, however, this classic tale progresses with relentless fatality to explore all the sadness of loners and drifters with such heart-breaking intensity that it really gets you at gut level.
Chaney however is a revelation.
All of these questions are moot, however.
Even more pale in comparison than the budget however is the talent involved.
With all its color and fun,however, the film can get serious real fast.
Cauldron of Death is a little more nasty than a lot of the genre, however, as it features plenty of grisly murders, including some unlucky victims that find themselves being thrown into a vat of acid, a la our featured criminals' favourite method of dealing with people that annoy them.
It's not a fatal problem; however, as Cauldron of Death is an entertaining and gritty little thriller that is well worth seeing if you can find it!
Rabid fans of politically incorrect exploitation, however, will have a field day watching the killers as they indulge in all manner of wickedness, including a marvellously depraved finalÃ©, in which an entire room-full of nurses are rapidly dispatched.
The one failing of both these films however is the character of Bianca, she is such a tragic figure when you think about it, she's neither nasty, vulgar, cruel, malicious or evil.
"My Favorite Wife" was however a screwball movie that I really enjoyed watching.
He however got involved in an automobile accident shortly before the filming of this movie and he had to pass on the directing honers to less experienced Garson Kanin.
To somebody else however, the Prince of Egypt also has so much to offer: Great animation, a cracking story and a good dose of humour.
There were however some disappointments, the acting could have been improved between some of the characters as they could have had more personality and the effects could have been a little better, also there is not a lot of action in the film until the final half an hour which is worth seeing.
Virginia Bruce was one of those,I know the face but i cant remember the name stars.She deserved better.A very pretty young woman, and a convincing actress, was Miss Bruce.She was however overshadowed by the Irene Dunnes, Norma Shearers,Greta Garbos that reigned Hollywood supreme.She was of those able and sometimes forgettable actresses such as Karen Morley,Frieda Inescort,Kay Johnson.
I however did not like when Moses accidentally killed the guard on the structure.
Crawford rises above it all, however, always commanding the screen with her physical presence (her eyebrows in this one are bigger and blacker than ever), her throaty voice, and her impeccable diction.
It is true however, that Crawford is the focus of the story.
While the United States infiltrated Central American nations in attempts to tinker with the regional politics, there is no documented evidence of American presidents authorizing covert entries and operations into Columbia The action film Clear and Present Danger, deals with the issue of the American war on drugs, however, a large portion of the plot action takes place in Columbia.
It is the soundtrack, however, that brings this beauty together- the songs as well as the musical scores are catchy, beautifully composed and thoroughly breathtaking.
), however they are all VERY long (mostly 800p +), detailed and complex, so adapting them into 120p screenplays must be a nightmare, but Clancy actually participated in the writing of this one - along with Steve Zallian (Schindler's List) and John Millius, no less!
It seems that everyone was enjoying an hedonistic lifestyle, the upshot being, however, that you ended up dying because of it.
Some good make-up and special effects are a plus again however, but overall it leaves much to be desired.
Even worse than their unoriginality, however, is the open mockery of ancient Egyption religion and culture, which these two characters embody.
Beneath Still Waters starts in 'Northern Spain 1965' as two young boys Teo & Luis trespass in a town that is being flooded by the creation of a dam, they run wild throughout it's streets but hear screaming coming from the local Church, upon investigation they find several people in the basement chained up including the evil dabbler in black magic Mordecai Salas (Patrick Gordon) whom Teo unwisely sets free as Teo is killed by Salas but Luis runs off... Jump forward '40 Years Later' & photojournalist Dan Quarry (Michael McKell) wants to do a story on the now completely submerged town & the upcoming celebrations by the town that was built nearby in place of it, however the preparations for the celebrations aren't going too well as a boy named Antonio drowns in the lake created by the dam.
If, however, Michael Bay should ever decide to spend several million bucks remaking this through Platinum Dune's I'll be there for the 7 PM show opening weekend.
Few people know, however, the dam initially served to deliberately drown the entire town of Marienbad, because all the inhabitants were gradually joining the satanic cult led by Mordecai Salas.
This however is slightly tarnished by his admission - in the "Bonus Features" interviews - that he has never performed a screen kiss before.
Many people, however, dislike the way the movie ended.
We found out, however, that Chuck Norris' isn't dead.
Ultimately, however, Yuri is bested by the combined might of his three assailants.
It is here where the young person begins to interpret ideas, histories, and ideologies of all sorts, however good or bad they intend to be, and have the option of either rejecting or accepting them.
This all changes, however, when Grampa dies.
See it however you can.
For some, however, the international success of Nakata's humdrum 'spook show' is baffling, to say the least.
Miki Nakatani who plays Mai Takano isn't really a as good character like Reiko Asakawa from the original was however.
T liked the original but found the suspense lacking and the film-making a nit bland, in this film however Hideo Nakata (who also helmed the original) gives the visuals a much needed kick and the atmosphere so much needed zing.
These days, however, it's marry now - divorce later.
In this movie, however, Crawford and Corey hit it out of the park.
Despite all this, however, it's an excellent if depressing picture, with many deep and dark performances.
This all goes to show, however, that the film doesn't stand still for a minute, which can only be a good thing, especially when you have Quaid firing off the wisecracks.
I fear that, living outside of America, however, I may have trouble finding his work... but I hope this will not be the case!
I am still unclear as to the implications of the ending, however that does not make me love this film any less; perhaps the film maker intended to leave the ending somewhat open, given the nature of the events and circumstances that preceded it.
The central problem remains, however: like most 'post-modern Westerns,' it's very unclear what of this we're to take seriously, if any of it.
I will, however, enjoy my own reruns.
Soon Alfredo ZacarÃ­as started making films on his own and found success directing the comedies of GAspar Henaine "Capulina", however, ZacarÃ­as had big plans in mind and by the end of the 70s, he directed two ambitious horror films co-produced with the U.S.A. and starring somewhat famous American actors: 1978's "The Bees" and this film, "Demonoid, Messenger of Death".
To ZacarÃ­as' credit, he makes really original set-pieces aided by some good special effects and a somewhat effective musical score; however, the bad cinematography, together with the low-budget and the contrived plot, would diminish the power of those scenes.
It's true that at first sight, one could blame the movie's flaws to it's low budget, it's bad special effects or to its director, however, I think that the real problem lays on the poor way the script was built.
Later that night Mark opens the casket & finds nothing but dust, however a hand reforms itself from the dust & possesses Mark.
Here, however, the trauma is turned up by a huge notch.
Simultaneously, however, this style gives the series even more of an edge.
With its dark, dreary nature and often painful sequences, NOW AND THEN, HERE AND THERE is not an easy series to recommend; however if it's emotionally powerful Anime you're looking for, then this series may be worth a look.
Irishman Jack Lemmon seems miscast; he does his best, however, to sustain the frenetic shtick, mugging outrageously at times.
There are three things, however, that make the film not necessarily bad or over-wrought, but just, well, different, like a musician or band we all know through and through trying a little something new.
More important that all of that, however, is that it's a story that needs telling.
Native Americans lived in community groups and we lived more as individuals, which is why it's no surprise that a mythic individual played more of a role in relegating Native Americans to second class status, however inadvertent, than any collective group of Americans, at least in popular culture and entertainment: William F. Cody.
Wayne, however, is effective despite his dodgy accent, and it's interesting to see him in a film, just a year after his breakthrough in "Stagecoach," where he is presented to us as one of the gang, something of a follower and not a lone-wolf leader.
This movie however, get's inspiration from other sources, such as Carrie, and that removes some of it's power.
Most of the stories took place in the Plains however the one from the West Coast as well as the one Haudenasaunee story were real cool!
Dreamkeeper, however, is show and tell done well, ain't that swell?)
It is however very british in its characterisation and dialogue, although there is something continental about it which lifted it out of the mire of other brit flicks for me.
The trailer pulls on your heartstrings, the movie however spells out things that parents and siblings experience on a day to day basis.
It becomes apparent, however, that debut filmmaker Elissa Down has instead crafted a very fine and perceptive film, indeed.
DROLE, however, is the complete opposite of the typical English detective novel, which offers an opening chaos and enigma, with the social disruption of a crime and a series of wildly disparate clues and leads, but achieves order and social restoration through the figure of the detective who can see, interpret and control everything.
The levels are however, a tad repetitive and not very creative.
are implemented, game-play is changed around some... however, there are shortcomings and bugs, if not very many of the latter.
I for one however will guarantee you that once you see this movie you will forget about it in a week or even less.
He did a splendid job directing this movie however.
As a result you may  find The Elephant Man depressing, however, I see it on the contrary.
After taking the movie home I was however pleasantly surprised by it's humor and cheesy camp-factor.
john hurt and anthony hopkins are not my favourite actors, and to be honest hopkins was always brilliant till he got an oscar for one of his worst performances in the very bad silence of the lambs, here however he is perfect, as is the rest of the cast.
It is, however, utterly repulsive.
it is quite raw and blunt about its subject matter, however, so it should not be viewed for "entertainment" purposes, thought he story is inherently intriguing.
it wouldnt be called a top 25 of all-time film by the public (though i may place it there), however, based solely on the fact that it, as i mentioned earlier, is lacking in terms of typical "entertainment" value.
When he does and begins conversations with another operator, however, he realizes the person he is communicating with is his long dead father.
I didn't think, however, that the film would be very good.
Even before 'The Thin Man (1934),' however, Powell was one of the classiest stars in Hollywood, here delivering his dialogue with unsurpassed aplomb.
Fellini engages us through a tapestry of decadence during the Roman Empire with such stunning juxtapositions of exceptional images from a collapsing society that one cannot help but be reminded of our own times and its disconcert moralityÂ   The film is freely adapted from Petronius' book, which is the exploits of two young Romans, Ascilto and Encolpio, as they venture throughout the empire, indulging in both heterosexual and homosexual relationshipsÂ In the course of this proliferation of sensuality, Ascilto becomes impotent and madly goes for a cure which ends in tragedy for EncolpioÂ   The movie's treatment of the sexual decadence is remarkably powerful without being explicitÂ In fact, in light of the mental images it presents, it actually puts on view very little on screenÂ But there is a great quantity of mysterious whores, hedonists, gluttons, and gross indulgence in carnal pleasureÂ In the midst of this chaos, however, there is a beautifully light reprieve as the young Romans come across a forsaken villa... A very charming slave girl has remained behind, and she playfully troubles the two men into an erotic gameÂ   Apart from that, the sex is portrayed as bizarre, tempting, suggestive of hidden secrets, violating the rules of morality, and going beyond the limitÂ
however I am finding it difficult to put into words how great this film is, as emotion has swarmed over me.
What ensues after developing his bizarre nature, however, is the true core of this absolutely spellbinding masterpiece.
In Van Wilder, however, Matheson plays the exact opposite character.
Action and cult movie fans are advised to watch this film, however others might be turned off by it.
There ARE however, elements of this film that drag it down quite a bit.
Most of the vocal performances are excellent, however, especially from the lead characters, and visually the design, especially of the environments through which April moves, is superbly evocative.
Release was withdrawn from circulation for the Dallas magnicide(1963) because the events are pretty similar.Frank Sinatra(JFK's friend) as producer ordered the retaining copies and the movie was forgotten,however long time after was issued in video market and obtained many success.
Sinatra, however, begins the film with the portrayal of a cocksure hit-man who seems to be an ice cold control freak.
Artistry, however brief (i.e.
slow-motion shots of a Exile on Main Street billboard), gives way to Frank just being there and getting everything he can, however mundane it might seem to be.
I saw a screening of this last year at the Tate modern, i had heard a lot of the rumours surrounding this film... Was Robert Frank going to be there, was it the only screening that year... Well no on both points, it was however the only time it was likely to be shown in London this decade.
Half way through, however, i did think, this is rubbish, its just full of rock clichÃ©s.
I don't think that fairly characterizes this movie however.
Without a doubt, Scorsese's ardor-stained debut is at times too stylistically obvious, and it has clear flaws in form, however not a soul who feels real affection for cinema trusts that a perfect one will ever come.
Being raised by the Callum family, Jeb falls in love with Thorley Callum and hopes to start a new life; however, things from his shady past come back and relentlessly pursue him.
Where it differs from other laddism comedies, however, is the extent to which characters AND plot lines developed in sophistication and imagination, to the extent that the Kryten+ series are deservedly accorded the rare tag of sci-fi comedy, rather than outer space sitcom.
Beginning in season 3, however, the show gets a bigger budget, CGI, and the actors even get a couple acting lessons.
Yes, they're a welcome relief, but they are, however, rather incompetent scientists: they can't get their experiments right.
A few elements keep Outlander from being a cult-masterpiece however; it is too long, there are too many false climaxes and the goofy plot only just holds up.
I was, however, pleasantly surprised.
This movie captures the raw Gleason to the point of dislike; however, movie reflects that he was a driven man who knew what the audience wanted...frankly, by their reactions to prior performances.
At least, however, Sinatra could still do dramatic roles while being a hero (like Detective Tony Rome, or "Von" Ryan), but he stymied a section of his acting development.
Given a lean 88-minute running-time, it's no surprise the plot is so thin and obvious (virtually recreating all the highlights from the first two Universal shark flicks Â however, while characterization was a strong element, in JAWS at least, the scriptwriters here lazily resort to mere stereotypes).
however, while I like his movies, nothing comes close to the beauty, acting, photography, atmosphere and sheer stomach turning quality of this work of art.
This all comes to a head in the ending, however, which has to be one of my favorite endings in any movie ever.
I do, however, have two minor complaints.
It's not disturbing in the slightest however, and whilst the subject matter (rape rape and more rape) is nasty, the way it's done is just funny.
In both cases, however, their demeanor is perfectly appropriate to the roles, so I didn't mind that.
It must however be viewed as a film of it's period.
For the moment, however, Lucia's "loss" will make her cycle in Lorenzo's world, and when she moves to Lorenzo's island, the island Lorenzo would never take her to, she is really inside the hole he was in (she falls into a real cave in the island, as well).
I ended up, however, being really surprised by how entertaining I found this film to be.
Today, out of context, it seems corny, but back then in 1947, if you had just ducked into a dark movie theatre and spent your 5 or 10 or however many yen for a few hours escape on a Sunday afternoon with your girlfriend, it has a different meaning.
This didn't really bother me however, it's more I'm letting others know what to expect.
The story seemed pretty basic after the first 30 minutes, however upon the 45th minute passing I realized I was wrong.
If they had a chance to review it again however, I think that they would most likely change their perspective.
On the other hand, however, the fact that you laughed during the film does not change the meaning of the war that it focuses on.
I, however, was only glued to the tube because of my favorite actors, Dominique Swain and Oliver Hudson.
What I found however was a pretty hip piece of independent youthful film-making that kind of blends the 80's, 90's and the future.
It looks like it was shot on video tape and transferred to film, however the acting, special effects and gags are just as good as any American teenage slasher comedy, except is has the coolness of a video game, urban anime and Japanese game show all rolled into one.
I can understand why some are not satisfied with this film as it is not the typical predictable Bollywood fare, however it is a refreshingly unique piece of Indian cinema.
I was, however, highly impressed with Kelly Lin's language skills.
Warning: The film has some very gory images; however I don't feel it was gratuitous but necessary to tell the truth of a story that has been much misrepresented.
I do however think that it is a documentary that the public should be made aware of at least as I knew very little regarding the problems that Sierra Leone have and think that this should be very much to the director and everyone involved's credit.
The sheriff reluctantly agrees, takes the boss's woman home, and relieves his frustrations on her before trying to carry the Indian awayÂ   Meyer does indeed have a fascination for very richly gifted women, and this film is no exceptionÂ The scene where Bolger talks the nurse into giving him a body massage is a classic erotic teaseÂ Also, Meyer has very cleverly juxtaposed a sensual lesbian scene against a bloody battle between the sheriff and the IndianÂ But much of the sex is unmotivatedÂ Meyer cuts so quickly, however, that it is more of a lack of respect tease than an exploitive treatment of sexÂ   Larissa Ely (Raquel) is wonderful as the steamy, sweaty, desert young womanÂ Linda Ashton (Cherry) is delightful as the sexy nurse, but Charles Napier steals the show as the violent, explosive, cruel of a sheriffÂ
Most movie goers who have bothered to rate this, express their chronic dislike of this work due to Howie Mandell's presence herein; however, I must say that he is no more a harbinger of death to this film than anyone else.
Coming from the same people who gave us the bloody awful Octopus movies, I fully expected Spiders to be a complete stinker; I'm glad to report, however, that this cheapo big-bug movie is a lot more fun than I thought it would be (hey, I might even go so far as to say that it was actually rather good!).
What is not generally known, however, is that Jolson actually made his talkie debut the year earlier, in 1926, in a short entitled A PLANTATION ACT.
In this case, however, it feels much more genuine.
Unlike the others I have seen, however, THE SLEEPING CARDINAL is not based on a Conan Doyle tale but was created for this film.
however, i can say it is honestly unlike anything i've seen.
however, he is making movies unlike anyone ever has before; he takes his audience on a no-class induced hallucination through motel room and trailers, unveiling a world utterly no one is accustomed to.
Like Bela's "Dracula", this film lacks a musical score; however the acting is very good and Bela's performance will please his legions of fans.
Elkins however blotched it up and caused the old man to be sentenced to a year in prison and died after four months behind bars.
Anyone taking the effort to sit down and watch the film in its entirety will come to realize however that the female characters (Bourbon's in particular) are well drawn, not whining victims at all, perfectly capable of righting the wrongs inflicted upon them.
The special effects, however, are great and the murders are incredibly gory and sadistic!
Harris, however, has obviously matured - in more ways than one - since his days as Doogie Howser.
This is another outing for Speedy Gonzales, the fastest mouse in all of Mexico, however in this cartoon most of the laughs come from Pablo and Fernando, two of his friends who have had too much tequila in the taverna.
Or, of course, Lenny Bruce, who also had a fight that he ended up losing miserably, however much he paved the way for everyone else in his field.
In fact, the structure, however hokey and joyful in its wicked little ways, has to start delivering on more interesting grounds.
This one, however, is very comparable to that film and to that of the underwater film "Leviathan" which itself does a bit of copying of the film "Alien".
I was happy, however, to read that SV has retired and started her own business-hopefully she'll be one of the lucky ones.
The relationship between Neil Morrisey's and Rachel Weisz's characters sparkles because however quirkily their attraction as lovers fleet on and subsides off at different times, one gets the feeling that Weisz is partly a fantasy (there are storyline elements that also drop hints of this) for Morrisey's pint chugging bloke (not too unlike the concept in Fever Pitch) and that his and the nation's fantasy of success for their Football team mirrors their relationship.
In entirety, however, the film isn't quite on the same level as IT'S A GIFT and MAN ON THE FLYING TRAPEZE, which I consider to be his very best work.
On the plus side, however, in THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY the sub-plot at least comes off as being relevant to the main story, at one point even providing Fields with an opportunity to reveal a softer, more complex aspect of his twisted character.
What stands out the most, however, are the performances of a flawless cast.
Carolyn, however, is unable to limit her spending (she impulsively buys a dress costing over $40) and soon the couple are in financial difficulties and their furniture is repossessed.
The main problem with this film for a modern audience, however, is its outdated social attitudes.
Tracy was a master of film acting and never indulged in histrionics; however, when he spoke his words carried weight, and his figure had a presence that commanded attention.
Even though Teri was at the time married to Jon Tenney, who guest starred on Lois and Clark for a few episode as a kinda bad guy however is character was hard to define.
I cannot agree however; the movie was slow moving and as such it painted for me a delicious pastische of the life of a complicated man doing a surreal job under surreal circumstances.
however, the reason for duvall's giddiness seems to be more about a realization on the lack of interesting dialogue his character has than because of a good film.
however, it took me three days of on and off again viewing to finally complete this film, all the time with a grimace on my face.
It is, however, compelling and worth seeing.
I didn't need that, however, to keep my attention.
My attention, however, accelerated when newcomer Luciana Pedraza entered the picture.
I can vividly recall the the emotions of the host who greeted them at the pit stop; however coming in last place eliminated them from the race.
Unlike today's pretty-boy heroes, however, Flynn shows a surprising talent for acting with his face alone.
But they realise almost immediately, however, their dreadful mistake: they have entered not socialist heaven but an Orwellian nightmare of totalitarianism, brutality and deprivation from which there appears no escape.
That is before the denouement, however, which has all of the drama and pace of a John le Carre novel.
NYM minute wouldn't be the type of movie I would pay $12.00 at the cinema (besides the shame factor), however if you do take the time to watch it, you might be amazed.
The thing my friends and I laughed about most, however, was the lame storyline with the girls each meeting a "super hot guy".
This movie however truly screams for more.
I love almost every single moment of the movie, however all the "Americans" including the "Korean-Americans" were horrible actors!
During their stay at Dongmakgol, however, they come to realize what is truly worth fighting for, and ultimately trade their lives to preserve it.
To emphasize these performances, however, is to overlook one of the more important "characters" in "B&E".
Apparently Minghella was making some point by having Liv want to have sex with him immediately; however that was never developed.
When he has a crisis of confidence and his career starts going down the drain, however, he finds the solution to all his problems in his daughter's imaginary world.
What is surprising, however, is how the characters -- who should have been mere cardboard -- turn into semi-three-dimensional people.
It DOES, however, make me enjoy the original all the more.
It's a paradox, they actually use the finished film as a prop on the movie Schnieder would be less annoying if he wasn't grinning like a lunatic for half the film (though he can recognize which of the teens is dead from his sneaker (cause there's only 7 in town)), but McMurray is kinda funny, however not enough to stop me from writing a scathing review whilst I actually watch it to make it more fun.
It's quite muted in these aspects, however it brings about a refreshing realism to the story, a great departure from the days when action has to be stylized (flying through the air shooting two guns anyone?)
After reading other comments, however, I realized that these problems were probably due to my viewing a shortened version, 63 minute version of this film.
This third sequel, "Phantasm IV: Oblivion", however, has hardly any positive aspects.
All I can say, this picture must have been a great success years ago, however, this film at times made me think about "King Kong" and how Kong escaped and almost destroyed New York City.
Even here, however, the suspense is dissipated by the fact we've already seen the Allosaurus (or another like it) attacking first a Trachodon, then a Triceratops, so its appearance in the camp is less of a shock.
Things take a turn, however, when Frankie's psychotic methods and attempts to align with a powerful Italian syndicate reveal him to be worse than Terry imagined, and he takes matters into his own hands.
Anna Magnani, however, was worth the gamble for him.
Alonzo, however, is harboring more than one secret, and will not take kindly to being denied a romantic union with Nanon.
In this film, however, you won't see much of his hands.
My first thought was to say that The Unknown was a masterpiece given the tools and abilities of the period in which in was made, however, the more I think about it I think it is a masterpiece period.
Alonzo didn't understand women however!
Josh, however is absolutely "DEAD-ON".
One question that does cross my mind, however, is just what should the aliens have looked like?
The DVD commentary, however, is really unfocused; the film itself is seldom talked about but it is interesting to hear the random things Christopher Lee comes out with and, consequently, it's never less than entertaining.
It is however a mediocre finale, which may not be the case if V gets it's funding.
Once there, however, they're stalked down by a group of murderous psychopaths who have taken up residence in the grandfather's former home.
The setting, however, is absolutely beautiful at the southern California ranch in Santa Clarita.
Twenty minutes could've been cut off this movie and possibly saved it; unfortunately, it can only afford to lose ten and still be considered a feature; however, that's ten viewers could have back so here's some suggestions for the DVD release.
I've kinda spoiled some TV memories by re-watching old shows & we all know that however much we want to, we cant feel the same way about the things we loved as kids.
I am happy, however, to see that after Policewomen she went on to have a good career.
This, however, is just one example of Chabrol's calm mastery as a director of the material.
The Butcher, however, is not a masterpiece because of its cynicism; it's a masterpiece because it manages to be cynical while having utmost respect for its characters.
The story is completely unusual and very simple, it is not tagged by an specific genre and can be resumed in the storyline; however, the screenplay, direction, performances and camera make the difference.
This obscurity is less frustrating than it is fascinating, however, because Chabrol is a master of pacing and mood, and he knows not only how to keep an audience gripped right to the end, but also how to haunt them afterwards.
Son is a novice, however, in the criminal world, and ends up losing a big package of cocaine he was delivering.
There are, however, a few interesting facts involving this early talkie film:   1.
(I should add, however, that Jimmy Cagney, in his autobiography, agreed with those who believed Ayres was too pretty to play a convincing gangster!)
Too bad about the countless lives that stem cell research could've saved, however ...
There is a plot, however, and it follows a convent full of nuns.
The era before and during WWII, however, was anything but wonderful.
The most interesting person, however, was Diane Wiest who played a man-chasing sister-in-law.
Alas-genre regular Richard Harrison is no where to be seen having by this time presumably escaped his contract with the aforementioned cinematic crooks (in fact Harrison reportedly felt so sullied by his experiences with Lai and Ho and their deceitful film making techniques that he more or less retired from the industry)  In his honoured place however steps forward Pierre Kirby (who also appeared in the demented classic that is 'Zombie vs Ninja', aka 'Zombie Rival-The Super Ninja Master') who actually does many of his own stunts and martial arts.
This of course isn't that much of a problem, as it's not much of a problem that the villains are underwritten and the movie is often vague in its science fiction elements, Drive is a very enjoyable B.movie, certainly among straight to video movies, however this could've been easily a four star movie had it just not strained so hard to be funny.
The funniest character, however, is eastern-European handyman Vuk (Peter van den Begin), who constantly manages to short-circuit, immolate, or blow up things (or people, for that matter).
I wasn't too exited by the acting of Bracha van Doesburgh however, who looks great, but, as a fist timer tries her best to portray her character as believable as possible but fails in doing so at times.
Unfortunately however, the editing choice to attempt to bring the project to a level greater than the sum of its parts leaves the film feeling far more like a rallying cry for the Democrats than a non-partisan expose of the door to door and hand to hand politics of other film.
The most revealing parts, however, come towards the end of the film, when we see massively long lines of African-American voters waiting to cast their ballot whilst Anglo voters waltz into the polling place and vote within seconds.
The way I like to put it however is it's a good "twist(s) on an already overdone and clichÃ© story line."
Throughout the whole movie he plays the tough guy, right in the middle however he is this sensitive man who can cry as well.
You must earn your money however, otherwise there will be no bread in the cupboard.
Both versions work in their own way, however.
Fritz Langs film work work particularly "M" (a film about a child molester and Serial Murderer) made a profound impression on the Work of Hitchcock .It would be a strange coincidence that in his Last American Film Friz Lang Would Pay Homage to him in "Beyond Reasonable Doubt" This film has all the trademarks of the latter Hitchcock s films and is greatly enhanced by the great use of film montage of German Expressionist Films to which Hitchcock learned his trade and made a point of his style This Film has been Remade four times as recently as 2009 and the second even starred Novello himself however there's is no comparison There are some who say Hitchcock was always a bit of a silent film director with his use of great lengthy scenes without dialogue, and if you watch this u can see why everything in the stories plot comes across clear as a bell its not a dodgy DW Griffith with too much montage to millions of Credit cards to Tell you whats happening, you can see exactly whats going on, you can tell when something horrible is going to happen to the sweet blond victim , and you are given that same 'suspend belief' that's in all the Great Hitchcock Films of his Golden Period .
Much of this however may be down to the style of the seldom referenced screenwriter Eliot Stannard, who has a credit on all but one of Hitchcock's silents.
The overall ineptitude of this film and the monumental waste of talent does warrant some kind of perverse redeeming value to it however.
It works, however, in making Crusoe the Water Horse as real as possible: as we watch, we see Crusoe growing from the size of a box turtle (which it resembles early in its development) to that of a true king of the deep, the Loch Ness "monster."
"Incident" however, didn't have to play it's hand.
Me and my five year old son saw this movie tonight and we had a rollicking good time..... it started off slow and surprisingly somber ( the kids dad is off at war; he's lonely, sad ).... however, once the water horse itself grows and is released into the loch, the movie turns into magic!
De Mille collection; however, since I already owned both THE SIGN OF THE CROSS (1932) and CLEOPATRA (1934) via TCM showings, I kept postponing the purchase of this set Â until I acquired the lot through a friend of my father's!
The problem with this film, however, is that it looks historical but contains serious historical inaccuracies.
They are, however, showed in a different perspective and addressed to the audiences of that time.
Loretta Young's performance, however, is far from masterpiece.
THE CRUSADES, however, is still entertaining in some way.
Far and away the silliest story in the movie, it does however deliver sex, nudity, and gore in an enjoyably campy way.
Before the film the producer mentioned he wanted to bring back an Amicus-style anthology film, which it definitely captures the feeling of, however with a very distinctively Japanese feel (most notably in Sean Cunningham's episode) as well as a twinge of Cronenberg-style body horror.
His screenplay is very consistent however in retaining a singular and entertaining voice between the different personalities of the directors.
For many westerners, however, there will not enough of a story arc to make for a satisfying watch.
Ironically, however, it is the Boss who takes the little girl back so that she can grow into the next Bijou.
'Shanghai Triad' does not contain that one off quality, however, it is in itself a fascinating film.
It does, however, leave you wanting a little more since it IS made for T.V.
She, however, is already engaged to a sleazy lady's man.
This all being said, however, I think the touch-all-the-landmarks-of-the-mid-'80s approach gets awfully heavy-handed at times.
The Wedding Singer, however, gets not one thumb up; but both thumbs, firmly, up.
Anyone who has stolen their sister's Barbies and produced a girl-on-girl porno/suspense/horror flick will clamor to get a peek at this program; however, the end product just doesn't pay off.
With this programme however, it went to the extreme.
The quality of animation in some bits is inspiring, and the breadth of what they are spoofing is amazing, you know your truly geek if you can figure out most of even the most esoteric (look up word if you don't know what it means, because it actually is ) references  Season 2   There are some gems in season two, however due to the fact that the DVD is uncensored, it makes it a bit more harsh, especially because most of the time we know what they're saying the overuse of the word douche seems to be without a doubt lack of a thesaurus in scripting, yes as immature as it can be, it's still kind of a funny word , but not used as a crutch the way most of the fart jokes come across, which there seem to be more in the second season than in the first, even though I don't think there really are in season two.
Religious satire is great, I believe morel orel is a show dedicated to that ... however Jesus and the Argonots (Despite the fact that the name is funny) I think it's just over the top, and doesn't hit the nail on the head at all, especially because if you're going to satirize something you should do it in the confines of what you're doing.
It takes a long time to get there, but the ending is at least hilariously campy - the appearance of Satan is memorable for all the wrong reasons, however.
All were very good, however, it was Paulette that got the Academy Award nomination as "Best Supporting Actress" for this film.
These Japanese are faceless, however, showing up only as shadows in one scene.
I did enjoy watching Claudette Colbert, Paulette Goddard and Vernoica Lake, however.
It's amazing, however, that he doesn't show up for the food Uma Thurman's character prepares for him a few nights thereafter.
He doesn't show up, however.
Maybe I enjoyed it more because I was with my friends, but believe me, it's good to see such a non-stop laugh riot once in a while, however non-sensical!
The movie goes for a clichÃ©d ending, however, which is a downer.
For me however, besides the surprise ending and the shocking murder mystery plot twists, what I love the most about this movie is the title...BLEEDING ROSE, ooh nice:)
Prochaska does, however, count on the surprise factor as well: not all in the script is a deja vu, and he takes advantage of those moments when we don't know what's gonna happen next to scare us witless, with almost sadistic joy (in terms of how off guard we're caught).
There is, however, some interesting action scenes and overall the action is acceptable.
Generally, however, the first film is all about setting the stage for the films to come and it does do that in a satisfactory manner.
Bryan Singer, however, did a wonderful job at making X-Men a movie that will not only overjoy the fans of the comic book, but also the general movie-goer as well.
There were some things in this movie that annoyed me however.
That however did not stop the judges at a European film festival from awarding the best actress prize to Kirron Kher.
Zubair (Navtej Johar), however, is a Sikh determined to find his long-lost elder sister, and is sure she lived around these parts.
Yes, it is one of the worst films I have ever seen, however how bad it is exactly cannot be measured by a mere passing remark.
I am not adverse to films of a mindless nature, believe me I have sat through films such as Deep Blue Sea and Transformers and been thoroughly entertained, they are what they are, however when you have a mindless action film that have bad set pieces terrible dialogue, even worse scripting and woeful special effects all you are left with is Shoot 'em Up.
The special effects make this already bad film just feel even worse, I am aware what this film is trying to do with its tongue in cheek take on the action flick, however not to throw any money into the budget of this film (Â£23,000,000) has meant it doesn't even have its special effects to rely on, they make it look cheap and quite unremarkable.
I am sure that their careers will not suffer too much, however I feel that the paying audience have suffered enough.
Recommended to those of you, select few, who enjoy good drama, mystery and discovery, wherever and however you find it.
Where I would part company with its devotees however is in my degree of admiration.
Great to see Canadian Molly Parker carrying off her role with aplomb, however, and Ian Hart remains as convincing as ever.
Do not, however, go to this film to stimulate the imagination.
On the brighter side however, all of the characters are very well developed and the romances between some of the characters were truly captivating.
I was pleased to find, however, a true diamond in the rough; a decent tongue-in-cheek thriller that left everyone in the audience entertained throughout the entire film.
This movie might be a bit slow for some people - however I found the timing just right.
In 2 days in Paris, however, Julie Delpy (girlfriend), Adam Goldberg (boyfriend) and most of the other actors are prone to overacting and hide their lack of skill or enthusiasm behind a lot of cheap yelling and blustering and gesticulating and contrived facial expressions.
Special mention has to go to Adam Goldberg, however, whose antics lend the movie the lion's share of its funny moments - I certainly hope to see more of him in the future.
So I didn't get around to it when I lived in California since it came and went very quickly however the film did show up in a little theater about 5 miles from my house so I figured I have to check this film out and so I did.
I really don't like Mrs. Trachtenberg probably because I saw her in the god-awful "Euro Trip" and in "Buffy" however in this movie she was pretty good.
What I did appreciate, however, was the fact that a bunch of guys with cameras, little money and an idea got something filmed, produce and distributed.
o Bitchy Blonde Girl: Yes, however, the least number of times and the least quality of times when it does happen.
Together they break into the abandoned Slaugher Studios & get to work, however it appears that they are not alone as a killer stalks the corridors of the once busy studio...  Edited & directed by Brian Katkin I really liked Slaughter Studios.
Rumor has it, however, that Liebling now crafts short films for the exclusive enjoyment of friends and family.
I did, however, notice that they continue to make more money and garner more fame than certain others.
BloodRayne isn't original nor is the most epic game you'll find in the market, however I like the execution of it and it's a fun ride from start to finish.
The golf course, however, is reasonably drawn and looks quite a pleasant and relaxing place to play golf, enjoy silence (no major noises in there), pure air, pure nature and a blue and sunny sky.
This is most definitely the single best movie that is available out there (however in a close second, check out Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Gene Wilder is astounding).
After the first murder Bava's camera pans up from the feet of the killer to his black gloved hands in a typically clichÃ©d giallo shot, however, Bava then carries on up to reveal the killers face in a move that goes completely against the sub-genre's rulebook.
This is Bavaâs third âbody countâ movie after BLOOD AND BLACK LACE (1964) and FIVE DOLLS FOR AN AUGUST MOON (1970); however, given that teenagers are also involved here, this is the one which became the virtual template for all the teen slashers which stormed Hollywood in the late 1970s/early 1980s.
The greatest aspect of "A Bay Of Blood", however, are probably the ultra-demented characters.
Unlike Chasing Amy however she's willing to let him get 'experienced' with her a la menage a trois.
There are numerous close-up shots of her staring off camera, slowly opening her mouth, probably while watching something unpleasant (however, she is doubled in her key lesbian scene).
I can't speak for them, however, I have ridden horses in Hell's Canyon, have seen elk, deer, big horn sheep, cougars and coyote in my backyard, and they all live in harmony w/ my cocker spaniel.
LIONEL BARRYMORE: His character (but not his acting) is the one I like least because he is constantly cringing and apologizing; however,based on the type of role it is, he is right on the money.
The movie is absolutely funny, however, to understand the comments and the jokes you have to be raised in Arabic speaking culture and understand the Egyptian background.
HOWEVER (of course, there has to be a "however"), this still doesn't mean that Jason is dead - the evil force that has animated Jason all these years is still very much alive and free to inhabit a succession of victims.
However this time the story is a little different as now Jason has been led into an ambush and is blown to pieces, however his evil heart lives on and he possesses various people to kill people who are a threat to his immortality, as a bounty hunter says that only a Voorhies can kill him, this of course leads to his sister, niece and grandniece, they are the only ones who can stop him.
Some of the gore is actually well done, however one scene shows blood coming from a gunshot wound to the foot, the blood is far too thin and even has a froth.
With this in mind, it would be easy to point out what is wrong with Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday- however for the sake of time, it might just as well be easier to point to what's right about it.
In one laughable sequence, you would be forgiven for thinking "Jason" (or as I'd like to refer to him as...the Imposter) being reborn meant the world would end, however a mere 10 minutes or so after he was "reborn," he is also summarily killed again with an ancient dagger (who were the camp counselors who ignored Jason as he died...some ancient Sumarian or Egyptian people or something?
Evil alien conquerors) and horror movies, but this movie was however bad in a REALLY bad way.
She's still a Goddess however.
"Man Of A 1000 Faces" was, however, his finest achievement!
The revelation of the film however is Juliette Binoche' terrific turn as Rose.
The leading actors, however, AndrÃ© SjÃ¶berg and Malin Morgan (former Larsson), well educated and all, doesn't seem to have had very much time to learn their character's way of talking, there are loads of mal-functious pronunciations that really hurt the ear and is very hard to understand also for a Scanian.
this is the first version of this movie made,and the only version i have seen so far.i liked it.i thought it was touching and ironic,and also tragic.it basically tells what the movie business can do to you,and the sacrifices that are made.it also shows how disposable the industry and the people in it are.as long as you are the flavour of the week,everything seems fine.but when you're no longer useful,reality hits and things can come crashing down.that's what basically happens in this story.it's an indictment(ironically)of the movie industry,however subtle.regardless,i thought it was well done.the acting by the tow leads,Janet Gaynor,and Frederic March,as well as the supporting performances,are terrific.i also thought the writing was very good,and the movie flows very well.for me,A Star is Born gets an 8/10
Nothing too extraordinary is revealed, however.
Ritai however, is not very sympathetic.
Narratively, however, the film leaves a little to be desired.
The story was set in the period of 1993 to 1996, however, I highly suspect that it was an on-going cat and mouse game, and the situation of today may not be much better than what was described in the movie.
For March however, he has to play a weak character, something he had not really tackled before.
There is however a lot of food for thought and anyone with the slightest interest in the subject of alien abductions should watch it.
Lindsay Crouse, however, seems rather miscast in the role of the supportive yet frustrated wife, not that she doesn't give it some effort.
The kid in the film is incredibly amazing and real too, however Lindsay Crouse lets Walken influence her too much (starts doing a Walken at one point).
The storyline, however, is so convoluted and ridiculous that my head began to spin.
The assistant of the nasty editor has to make coffee but drops a sugar lump into a sewer thingy on the floor.. an ant crawls out and gets beaten to death by the nasty editor which leads to an instant classic piece of dialog " Ants cant get that big "well no one told him that" and she walks away business as usual.. however our ants are crawling through the hallways.
Most of them escape however the company info stealing dude pulls a gun to skip the queue - I don't blame him- an ant follows him , he pulls the gun - magic gun because it went from the eaten editor to him?
however, with the exception of a billy bob thorton trailer all were (straight to video) releases ill be missing.
None of these objections, however, interfere with the thrill and wonder of hearing Jane Austen's own dialog, wry humor, and clever repartee brought to life by such a talented cast!
What it is, however, is a complex and twisting little tale that gradually unravels itself until the climax.
Tom has doubts about their oath, however, when an innocent man, Tom's friend, is accused of the murder.
If, however, you are a stuck-up movie critic wannabe, stay away from this movie - you'll hate it!
If, however, you are a stuck-up movie critic wannabe, stay away from this movie - you'll hate it!
The great casting does not end with MacDonald and Chappelle however.
I just was channel surfing and ran across "Daugher of the Mind", which have not seen since I was a young child (I am now almost the big 50), however, much to my dismay the movie was 3/4 over and I only got to see the last 1/2 hour.
Using comedy as a medium to deliver his message, Arau's film delivers good laughs and flows smoothly most of the time, however, at times it is notorious that the project started as a short as there are scenes that seem to be shot only to reach the runtime of a feature length film.
The Arau couple had a brilliant idea and raised very good points, however, the film still feels as if it could had been better.
THIS guy, however, was on the verge of tears.
The rest, however are not given much to work with.
The movie doesn't draw the viewer in, instead it psychologically irritates and alienates the viewer by butting unrelated scenes together (which one would think might have some overall meaning in the end, however this is not the case).
The life they try to lead however is anything but normal and they are doing things ordinary people would not do.
The government however don't think so.
After that, however, it was fine and had some funny, outrageous scenes.
His Richard, however, has a soul and it aches you to its core when on display in a heartbreaking twist sequence I will not divulge here but it hits you in the solar plexus.
If however, you're a fan of the so-called "so bad it's good" movies, keep on reading.
There's a bit of historical distortion here, however.
And he firmly believed that, however warped the socialism of the DDR had been in the past, it contained the seeds for evolving in the right direction.
This is, however, an exceptional film, and perhaps more importantly it is an honest film, a true film if such a thing can be said of fiction.
If, however, you want a film with genuine emotional depth, that makes you think and resonates far after the end credits have finished, then this may be what you're looking for.
I did feel, however, that the film loses momentum, to an extent, twoards the end.
She earned her celebrity through hard work and honest talent, however, not by noodling with the boss.
What entailed, however, was one bumbling misstep after another by two young lovers who were not exactly the sharpest tacks in the box.
When you are not free, then you have nothing else to lose thus you have to run after your freedom, however do not believe in freedom until you get what you used to have before losing it.
Fans of the movies that are parodied may occasionally find the Muppets take on the films as somewhat insulting to the source material; however, the whole show is all in good fun and is targeted at children and light-hearted adults.
The way this poor soul is treated is pretty pathetic, however the irony occurs when the younger crook is stranded in Albania and his car is vandalized.
His women friends are the focus here, however, and he wisely gets out of the way most of the time.
As personal choices, however (exempting The 40 year Old Virgin), they were were excellent.
His characters, however, are more real than Anderson's.
The number one thing that troubled me however was the ending.
If it had been better shot it may have work, however I didn't even have the time to let the emotions of the scene sink in before I was slammed with a big Title Card!!!
For Frank, however, his parents break up is the end of the world, as he knew it.
After that point, however, the movie basically becomes a rip-off of Alien.
On the plus side however the 2-dimensional characters are engaging, there are one or two great jump-out-of-seat moments, tips of the hat to not only the original movie but also HG Wells' novel "The Invisible Man", effective use of music (which is all new - not a rehash of Goldsmiths original) and an overall sense of fun (That's Executive Producer Paul Verhoeven shining through, I think) - despite the nasty moments!
There is, however no trite and superficial dialog; (think Desperate Housewives melodrama).
This isn't perfect however.
The underwater scenes are really good, however - but a lot of them are probably just documentary footage spliced into the film.
I recall watching this as a kid on a now defunct Sicilian TV channel; however, given the ample nudity on display and, for a film of its type, the excessive length of the thing itself, it's very probable that it had been cut to some extent.
Soon, however, after some 30 minutes of the film, finally the nasty shark starts to eat and kill people and also return the vacationers back on earth from their dream world.
Unfortunately only 32 episodes were made, however they are top-notch television.
Week by week, however, the show grew on me, and whilst not as glossy as the Swedish show and definitely grittier in terms of their investigations of everyday crimes, it certainly provided a very satisfying weekly viewing meal indeed.
However, it is shot exquisitely, moves along with relentless power, and at least conveys an unequivocal message about racism, however unexceptional and self-congratulatory that may be.
This film is a good,though not flawless representative of the turbulent 1960's south.The character representation is good,though taken to a bit of an extreme in places.Gene Hackman gives another knockout performance here,as he does always as does Willem Dafoe.The cast is great,though Gailard Sartain was a surprising choice as Sheriff Stuckey, given his penchant for appearing in the worst of films.It is based on a true story,and as we all know,true stories are never presented to perfection.It is,however,presented as well as it can be.This is a very gripping,edge of your seat film,and very well done.
Their buildings, however, would lead you to believe they couldn't put tin on a roof straight.
There is however one actor in particular that I wanted to touch on and that is Michael Rooker.
Not available on Home Video for years however it returned on DVD!
The movie pretty much just runs out of steam, however, unfortunately lacking a satisfactory end, its hair-raising climax coming too early.
Here you have a successful, yet pompous British author who goes to France to unwind, who however, gets to be roommates with the boss' daughter.
The movie was really too slow for me for the first 70 mintues, however, and I kept wondering, what is the point of painting us a pictures of this dour and unhappy author's interactions with a lustful irresponsible bratty young woman?
It's funny how people either critisize or praise all the nudity and sexuality common in European film, however here nudity and sexuality were intrinsically necessary because they were such a crucial component underlying the mechanics of Sarah Morton's personality.
The ending to this film made it all worthwhile, however and it is very exciting when we feel we need a 2nd viewing of a movie to really absorb it all.
That, however, depends on your viewpoint; the action is stretched, but the relaxed tone of the film blends magnificently with the beautiful French scenery, and Ozon's attention to detail with the characters ensures that, although slow, Swimming Pool never descends into boredom and there's always something on offer for it's audience to enjoy.
Unlike most comedies today, however --which pathetically attempt to garner laughs from the audience through the characters' mindless "schtick," pratfalls, and mean-spirited jabs at one other -- the humor in "With Friends Like These" derives organically from the situation the characters find themselves in, aided by their idiosyncratic personalities.
Even the situation, itself, however, and the types of characters who inhabit it, would not produce the guffaws, chuckles, and deep smiles that "Friends" does, were it not for the intimate knowledge of the movie industry and actors that Phil Messina, the writer-director, brings to every frame.
No comedy ever written, however classic and hilarious some are, could come close to bringing you the sheer joy you will feel when the credits roll on this film.
And, in some very odd scenes, his worst nightmares come true,...however, they actually DO appear to be nightmares.
Lisa Picard is Famous, however, really builds on what could very well be real people.
Mr. Presley is a great singer, especially on "Let Yourself Go"; however, you would not know what a great entertainer he was by viewing this terrible movie.
When the two went head-to-head together, however, there was an unexpected result, with the lightweight beating the heavyweight by a knockout.
There is, however, little else in the film that impresses.
My only complaint was that it was a little over 2 hours long so it does require a clear, rigid mind if you are going to watch it however the film moves at such a fast pace your mind won't really wonder very far at all.
The subtitles, however, take no longer than a glimpse to grasp.
After the eclipse, however, the movie settles into a conventional "chase" mode which, though interesting, can't compare to the first 95 minutes.
As probably many other Exploitation fans out there, however, I must say that my admiration of this film, and my acknowledgment of its pioneering cult character exceeds the actual fun that I had watching it.
This is also what is to acknowledge about this film however as it is pioneering in its sleaze and weirdness.
Nothing but the low budget can take the blame for that, however.
The film has more than just a sentimental value of originality, however.
Our hero just doesn't see the point, however: he's happy enough to enjoy this woman's company but he doesn't feel like committing himself to her for the rest of his life.
Liberties were taken, however, to make him also meek and hesitant, and clearly existentially bewildered.
Although there might be some scenes are not matching the real scene, however, it is understandable of how a movie is made to present a story into a reality.
That's not to say the film is left in want of character complexity, however, but more that the sheer spectacle of it all can tend to overwhelm its various more subtle aspects.
John Avnet's direction seems sluggish; however this is probably more due to the nature of the plot, which tends to paint Gere and Avnet into a corner.
Richard Gere and Ling Bai are a great combination, however, the film is rather long and drawn out and intends to become a bit boring.
however, the biggest disaster with this film is that it got made.
As a movie in its own right, Klepto is a disaster, however as a directorial debut (is it??)
Oddly, however, the DVD box says it's a comedy.
It was, however, a little bit exaggerated about all the horrors that the poor couple lived there.
Kurtwood Smith is probably the biggest standout, however, as the maniacal head of the Fortress.
Some of the special effects still look good especially the flying carpet scenes and creating the million man army, but the rest for the main are primitive Â however if you're unfortunate enough to see any of the laughable modern versions, maybe some with eye-splitting digital cartoonery too you'll realise special effects do not make a great movie.
In this choice, however, he was out of step with the majority of his comrades.
Fair warning however.
Not that the film follows any linear strictures (however inverted, as with the superior Mystery Train) or narrative arc: Jarmusch isn't interested in dealing a complete hand here - merely shuffling the deck around and plucking cards at random.
Unfortunately however if you see this movie in 2-D then you will not be experiencing Beowulf in my eyes, take off the 3-D this is a 9/10 movie, with the 3-D it gets the 10/10 rating with a blink of an eye.
My favourite segment, however, is the equally funny New York section starring Giancarlo Esposito, which is basically a culture clash between a working-class New Yorker and a foreign immigrant's first night driving a taxi.
It's also the segment which provides a little extra bitter of a touch by way of the Ivory Coast cabbie, however it does come to pass as being about two outsiders thrust into a strange little moment in life.
The woman, however, is not interested in conversation, yet we get the impression she opens up more than the driver realizes.
Each of these times lends a special atmosphere to the story it tells, which becomes the most effective in the Helsinki story, which is utterly sad, however ends with a new day starting.
Characters are reasonably likable; however, it's George Eastman, definitely very creepy here, that comes off the best as the hulking killer.
When going into the theatre to see this I in two minds - it was my first 3D movie and I had heard good things, however I wasn't particularly taken by the concept or the trailers.
I was unsure what to expect, however I ended up leaving the cinema extremely satisfied with the film, and tellingly, unable to stop discussing it long after the ride home.
For me the most disappointing part of the film was actually Ray Winstone as the titular character - he was fantastic when talking in a low growl, however the film really suffers when he shouts in full cockney accent.
Potential viewers have to be warned, however: You need a strong stomach for this!
Things go awry for the Captain however when a portion of her assembled crew lead by her former lover, a cutthroat type named Vendler, double-crosses her and looks to gain the valuable Solarium aboard the ship for himself.
Unlike the feast, however, the film is somewhat unsatisfying.
Their hopes are heightened however, when Pascal offers to send Louis Prima and his band to their restaurant - a sure fire way to drum up business.
Throughout the film as well, however his passion was palpable.
I very much enjoyed the film, however it is mostly aimed at the Turkish audience, or viewers who are familiar with the University Entry Exam System in Turkey, in terms of understanding the emotions the characters dealing with.
This film concerns Mabel Normand having some trouble with selling what looks like hamburgers; however, one of the alternate titles for the film suggests she's selling hot dogs.
While up against not one but two actresses, he holds his own very well with his character, however much his character's logic might skew.
As for whether the court-martial did what it intended to do, obviously it did not in Pearl Harbor's case, however, it may have helped development of better aircraft and aircraft carriers during the 30's, especially when one considers this was during a depression.
His and his pilots' achievements were dismissed, however, by battleship-loving admirals who claimed that the test was meaningless since the ship wasn't defending itself.
This DVD transfer, however, borders on dreadful.
Jackson, however, can be founded occasionally working on the fringes of film-making.
In Forgotten Silver, however, the satire isn't really on high about how a film gets made from start to finish, although it does include that as part of it.
She decides to remain virgin throughout the whole movie, however she uses her sex to manipulate Mathieu who's too blind to understand she'll never be his to possess.
This is a frustrating movie to watch too - many times it seems Mathieu will be able to get Conchita to bet, only for her to change ideas in the last minute, however whetting Mathieu's attention through some glimpses of her naked body.
And I'm not sure we're meant to identify with his hang-ups, after all he seems just a bit too innocent to be tricked by Conchita so many times, however he's lust-driven.
For now, however, it has left me full and still digesting.
In true Star Wars fashion however there are loads of cheats and hints available on the internet.
In every other case, the Lightsaber, and just about everything in the entire game, does look right, however.
I know I was kind of unaffected to the early scenes of violence, however later once the film shifts to the tour and we revisit the battle and we have a sense of who these men are the effects are devastating.
I went to see it for the action, however, so I turned my brain off and enjoyed.
Jet Li's performance is excellent, however mr bad guy might be a little well too bad.
This one however, is worse scripted, worse acted and in fact not entertaining at all.
There are plenty of action sequences, however, and the fighting does not involve wires, phony stunts, or computer generated effects like in "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," and "The Matrix."
Before I talk about the final scene, however, I want to establish another subtle surrealist thread through the film.
The story isn't without its flaws, however.
Yes, this movie may be a bit predictable, however the scenery is phenomenal and the acting is very good.
It seems not to matter,however,as others will take her equally dismal place as long as the top brass in British TV keep providing money to produce BIG BROTHER and it's various imitations.The house guests this year,if it really matters,consist mainly of young attractive women,with a few assorted males (apparently mostly homosexuals) added for the ride.But they seem as uninteresting,inarticulate,stupid,dull,self centered,unpleasant,egotistical and hopelessly fame seeking as most other house guests have been in previous years.It is the ultimate indictment that the most interesting parts of the programme are when we see everybody asleep in the house's bedroom!
Neither the pick-up nor the malfunction underneath the hood was, however, quite a matter of chance.
Anyhow I didn't find it to be as terrible as many to make out to be, but however it's just too formulaic to rise above its limited scope.
Only one of them returns, however, and she's carrying a hideous monster that explodes through her chest "Alien"-style.
This should have been entitled, "Ernest and the Magick Shoes," however, Slam Dunk will have to suffice.
"Master i Margarita", however, is so far the highlight of his directing career.
The discussions remain however the plot line gets confused...then again this is a three hour movie and I was watching it late...then again its really confused.
The stylishness of the picture comes at the expense of substance, however, and that makes the film hard to like because there isn't a lot of character for the audience to connect with.
Early on I wasn't sure about it, however.
It was satisfying to see such an expert adaptation, but especially so to see how the central point of the story has not been lost: the inability of any ruler, however powerful, to control what happens at the end of the long chain of command that inevitably forms.
His wife, however, Livia Drusilla, is determined to thwart his plans, and embarks on a slow, murderous scheme to place her own son (whom she fancies she can control) on the throne.
The most impressive moment in the entire production, however, came from Brian Blessed (Augustus), whose slow, quiet, passing away remains the most convincing screen death I have ever witnessed.
Having seen the first film and enjoyed it so much I couldn't wait to see the sequel, however, I couldn't believe the out come.
The special effects are poor, however, the joy of this film is in the writing and humour.
It did, however, have moments of brilliance.
It is soon apparent, however, that the 'Lot' is overrun with vampires who want the anthropologist to write a journal about their existence.
And I'm a sucker for late night horror shows, however bad.
Trinity, however, is a much more personal, internal film.
In the second half of the movie, however, the team decide that they were not as dedicated to their film as they thought they would be, and they decide that they can't just stand by and allow the killings to happen.
This movie was not what I had originally thought it was, and I mean that in a good way, I thought that they would show Michael, Jason or Freddy but they didn't, however they did not need to.
In this case however, it cannot be overstated enough.
Hey one thing I couldn't knock though, even though it looks cheap however the CGI was competently executed and never overdone in any way.
There were a couple of characters that were somewhat interesting, however, the storyline never delved deeper into their personalities the way I had hoped...and left them being empty shells of people with no real backgrounds or insights into what made them tick or why they were the way they were.
When I heard about the new NBC show "Trauma", I was so hoping it would be much the same, however Trauma concentrated too much on the everyday lives of the characters and not enough on exciting rescues.
Celebrities however have a lot farther to fall than most people when things start coming apart.
Also a number of things let it down for example: The two twins you see on Cold Reception you are expecting to fight them, however you do not.
But it is an unwritten rule that on a Bond film the person who introduces Bond to the Prime villian always ends up fighting him, however on Agent under fire you do not.
Another thing is that Carla the Jackal appears quite deadly however when you fight she fights worse than a............. well Carla the Jackal.
Karen ClichÃ© is easily one of the most enjoyable cast members, delivering humor with her confusion or lack of knowledge about human customs or lifestyles, however also is a tough woman with no problem punching someone in the face.
The music isn't the major letdown, however.
This film, however, seems to have been shot with the idea of profit paramount.
Beyond that, however, the entire series was great.
That said however, it is definately worth seeing this film just for the classic scene when Wilder and Prior are convicted of Armed Robbery and sent to the county jail.
Jerry, however, is ready to puke watching this spectacle.
I can vividly recall the the emotions of the host who greeted them at the pit stop; however coming in last place eliminated them from the race.
Vin soon catches on however, and knows that as Tony keeps pushing his way up, he is destined for trouble and, like a lion in the jungle, will either has to exert his prowess.
Yes, the movie follows some typical stereo types among a gay male couple, however, is not offensive in anyway, shape or form.
In this fiasco, however, I get the feeling that the actors were blackmailed into doing this film, judging by the pained, or sometimes completely numb, expressions on their faces while they get themselves into moronic situations or deliver stilted, unrealistic lines.
Ultimately, however, I had to shut the damn thing off; I mean, I could feel brain cells committing suicide while I watched this travesty.
The locations, however, were all exquisitely chosen, including Englefield House, Chilworth Manor, Dorchester-on-Thames and, of course, Florin Court in Charterhouse Square, the set of Poirot's stunning new flat.
What Poirot learns however is of a far greater deception that will alter everyone's perception of what they believe to their reality."
She does get some good wise-cracks in, however.
The disaster, however, manifests itself in a direction not anticipated when the lead actress, Sylvia Martin, whose place Sarah wanted to supplant, suffers fatal injuries.
We must remember however that the film-makers are aiming to 'make the stories more relevant and accessible to a modern audience' and I suppose that that must explain everything?!?
Moore believes she is fated to marry a lonely but charming butcher (the wonderful George Dzundza, looking a lot more handsome than we're supposed to think he is); after the nuptials however, she begins to have real feelings for another man, yuppie psychiatrist Jeff Daniels.
Once the Behemoth surfaces, however, the film exchanges mystery for spectacle, even if on a smaller scale than Beast or Gorgo, Lourie's 3rd (and most spectacular) monster on the loose epic.
For all its dark doings, however, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK is also infused with an often subtle black humor that helps keep it from devolving into the kind of lackluster action film that features stars who can't act; Russell as Plissken is also- surprise- vulnerable, and thence more real, than most action leads.
It also, however, captures some of the more beautiful aspects of the city, namely its heart (although the Lewis family are dysfunctional, they have a very warm family dynamic), and also the beautiful scenery in the area (visible in the panoramic shots of the city), and I think that any Welshman couldn't watch the funeral scene at the end as the choir sings "Myfanwy" without wiping away a tear.
These are the moments when Anne's personality makes the show, however.
All is not lost, however, because he and his adversary are left to live normal lives because their gunfighting days are over.
Incidentally, however, the film has been remade using English actors for the British market, as "The One and Only" but is, as far as I can tell from IMDb reviews, is a terrible effort.
She, however, hasn't paid her taxes in years, and gets her house repossessed by the bank.
Adam Sandler comedy is very much an acquired taste, however if you like films such as Road Trip, Deuce Bigalo (by Sandlers Production Company Happy Maddison) or Tom Green or Jackass humour I would highly recommend his films.
I have now seen this film too many times to even count and could probably recite the whole script along to the film, however it is still funny every time I see it.
RGV must be praised those days for trying something new  One such adventure which was latter tried by others is DARNA MANA HAI(03) of having multiple stories in 1 film  The film however falls short of expectations though it's novel  The different stories are:  Sohail- Antra Bad and boring Acting- Sohail has nothing to do, Antra is okay  Sanjay- Shilpa This story lacks logic which can be ignored but the treatment could be better, especially the portions showing characters making weird faces while eating apples is too much Yet a decent story Shilpa acts very well while Sanjay is okay Rajpal leaves a mark  Vivek- Nana this is the best story and handled very well though it doesn't make much sense and they are flaws but that is forgiven The story makes for an edge of a seat story Acting wise Nana is brilliant as usual while Vivek too does a great job  Aftab- Isha This story which was latter made as GAYAB(03) has it's moments and the scenes involving Aftab and his power is well handled The culmination too is good but some people may not agree with the story Acting- Aftab is very good and Isha is okay  Saif- Boman This story is implausible but entertaining and well handled though flimsy Acting Boman and Saif are superb   Raghuvir Yadav This story is well handled too Acting- Raghuvir Yadav excels  The worst part of the film is the main story which appears too bad and the scenes involving the college friends are badly handled and the culmination of the film too is horrible  Amongst rest Sameera is okay, Gaurav leaves a mark Sushant is okay
"Indigo," however, with its ludicrous plot and its poor acting, never substantiates any of its information.
"Indigo," however, represents one of the worst and most misrepresentative films I have ever seen.
Alma is the gaze of men in the film because she is young and vibrant, however, that is all she is allowed to be; an object of men's desire.
The plot however i thought turned very sharply from one direction to another (wilburs suicidal tendencies to his relationship with his brothers wife, and then the end scene).
If it had spent more time detailing the characters and concentrating on the plot then it may well have been quite an effective little thriller, however as it stands it's merely just a passable one with a strong central performance.
Later, however, Atwill is able to recreate his fortune in a very unique way--he forms a union, of sorts, with the handicapped beggars on the street (much more common in the 1930s than today, thank God).
He had the "Kings" who were of western (American) influence as the sort of rebel group, however harmless and sort of stupid, which I found funny.
Then you have the regular students and the Ins who were somewhere in the middle, however in a different way.
What we do see is more than enough, however, and it's the situation that really makes the film what it is.
The rest of the film, however, is tripe.
Some elements of his self-rescue, however, are either far-fetched or downright preposterous (witness the "Snow White"-like scenario at the watering hole in which a deer, a raccoon, a turtle, a rabbit and a skunk-!
What is extraordinary in this case, however, is that this new review is not just an updated version with a few new thoughts: it is, in fact, a review in which I've changed my mind on the film completely.
At the same time, however, these same performers in these same melodramas could suddenly be caught talking directly into the camera, spoiling any illusion if there ever was one.
One warning however, for DVD fans.
These however, are less concerns for me.
That, however is just me being ultra critical, overall this is a top draw movie and worth a look.
With the knowledge that decades of public policy have led to this situation, however, Loach does not single her out as the only culprit, simply one who is unable to look beyond a value system that can only see what is in their immediate material self interest.
The whole film, however, is carried by Kierston Wareing, with no real development of other characters such as her business partner or even her dad, who both could have highlighted the different shades of the argument and perhaps externalised some of the conflicts that we all face when we encounter the by-products of such exploitation.
The best performance of the film, however, may belong to Morgan Freeman as Somerset.
Some of the messages the film tries to convey are done so unrealistically, however, some of the scenes are moving and authentic (an interrogation scene involving a racist Italian subway cop who discredits the gigolo's purported identity by reacquainting him with his given Hispanic name on a driver's license, in an attempt to further emblaze immovable class lines).
Somerset, an intelligent, well-read man, is smart enough to recognize the truth, however painful that is.
What is good, however, the fight between Carole Lombard and Frederic March and when March and Lombard are in the water.
Lombard however is not that imminent to death and she turns the tables and takes advantage of the situation.
What the scientists have not thought of, however, are the side-effects.
Mr. Cronenberg shows promise, however; and, there are at least three sexy scenes.
That plan did work, however, the side-effect was increased sexual desire.
It is the performances however that lifts this movie above the average, Morgan Freeman as the older world wise detective, Pitt almost manic as his young enthusiastic sidekick, Poltrow plays the wife with a fine degree of sensitivity, and Spacey does his usual brilliant psycho routine.
Stewart, however, has a different idea.
The real problem with Trapped, however, is that it is dull, with journeyman direction and acting.
Point is, a lot of this, however just totally ludicrous it all sounds (Bloody Bill's a confederate- no Yankees or blacks after all), could just be moot if it was at least a halfway decently acted or technically executed effort.
The teacher, however, fears losing his chance at becoming school principle and allows the tormenting to continue.
Se7en seemingly starts out as a typical cat and mouse detective story, however, it quickly develops into of a sort of modern-myth, with good and evil taking centre stage.
The most important aspect of Se7en, however, is that it keeps the audience numerous steps behind its story, as oppose to other thrillers, which become predictable and bland by the end.
In all, however, "Common Ground" is a noble, well-intentioned and worthwhile effort.
There's a certain sense of time and structure that sets apart Stray Dog from the numerous 'film-noirs' of American cinema of the period- while it contains the kind of determined edge and wit of those films, it also relies on portraying the people in this world as honestly as possible, however downtrodden things are (like Kurosawa's later film High & Low, location adds to the mood greatly).
Some may say other wise about this movie, however I have found that some people try to pick apart anything and everything.
The controversial comedian's rise to the top, his marriage to a sexy stripper, and his eventual downfall into drugs and court hearings is fascinating to watch, however Dustin Hoffman is arguably too genial and soft as Bruce (Hoffman gives the character a sympathetic center, and some may say this works for the picture).
During a German Luftwaffe attack, however, the quintet escapes and together they decide to flee to neutral Switzerland on foot.
The opening and closing titles, however, were apparently new material and feature some music that isn't heard anywhere else in the feature.
In reality, however, the film is not only historically important because of the legends in it; it is one of the most fresh and funny films to emerge from the pre-Code period.
however, unlike those gems, frightmare had a budget of more that 50 dollars.
it has the quality of any made for tv movie (lights, a decent camera, etc), however the acting made me want to poke out my eyes in an oedipal act of anguish.
The rest of the cast, however, are not very good at all.
If you are interested in this aspect of American culture, however, it's a decent and quick read; and there's a better movie to be made from HOLD AUTUMN IN YOUR HAND.
You get your fill of fighting, gunfights and explosions as well as some quick dialog delivering one-liners and jokes however how bad the situation.
I wonder, however, if the subtleties of Austrian can be understood outside the country.....
Von Roon however I was more impressed with Gunter Meisner's portrayal of Adolf Hitler in Winds of War over Steven Berkoff's portrayal in War and Remembrance.
It is nice, however, from time to time to see a character driven movie.
Both of lead actors deserved their Oscars, however two awards are too little for such film.
"Night of the Scarecrow" is a typical horror movie from 90's.The production is slick and polished,the acting ranks from acceptable to lame and the special effects are mostly cool.There are some graphic gore scenes,so the gore-hounds will not be disappointed.It's a decent movie however I prefer earlier "Scarecrows"(1988,William Wesley),which is not only gory,but also creepy as hell.In conclusion,this is sometimes nonsensical,but quite enjoyable picture so you should give it a chance.
Those are hardly plot holes or badly written scenes however.
On the other hand, however, they're not precisely necessary.
The rest of three, however, come off as stiff and unnatural, with perhaps more fault to the script and directing than the actors themselves.
Aslan works,however, and works very well.
Misty Mundae is an attractive woman; however, it takes more than beauty to save this movie.
I beg to differ, however.
But when Shirley goes to his apartment because Grant fed her a line about modeling for him and Myrna catches them there however innocent, it's big troubles ahead.
It is not all atmosphere, however.
Throughout the film, however, there is a hint she may have been misunderstood.
Interestingly both of these in-jokes reference back to episodes written by the great comedy episode writer Darrin Morgan however this particular episode is not written by him.
I am not a trans gendered teen myself, however I hurt the way they do, only from hearing the horror stories, and seeing the pain.
As a 3rd party I don't know the whole story, however I do know that I am a proud trans gendered supporter, and I will continue to feel like a friend of Gwen in some ways.
I did however like how they finally realized this was who she was and accepted her.
That being said, however, I salute Lifetime for being brave enough to produce it!
For no conceivable reason, however, Conti takes the theme of a very famous concerto ... and plays it with full orchestra only, minus the fireworks of the violin part.
If, however, the film (or other work) causes 'aesthetic arrest'; a feeling that transcends emotion and makes the consumer nail him or herself to the spot and experience the work over and over; makes one question his or her own responses and definitions of truth, beauty and the like; the consumer is in aesthetic arrest and the work represents high art.
What this achieves however is a heightened level of subtle nuances in expression which are arguably more powerful and provocative than anything a real-life actor may achieve.
I will, however, like to sincerely recommend that you find this film, and that you watch it, with no stereotypes of animation.
That's not to imply, however, that the English dub, produced by New York-based Central Park Media, is inferior; on the contrary.
Its very hard to send anyone out to see this unhappy little film (The previously mentioned Barefoot Gen spawned sequels, this has not) but at the same time you owe it to yourself to experience, however distantly what sort of monster we unleash upon the world every time we go to war.
It helps that however depressing this is, its also a damn good and incredibly compelling story.
The clip Bugs shows to the audience, however, is a poorly chosen extract from Friz Freleng's 'Hiawatha's Rabbit Hunt' in which very little happens.
He is awarded, however, the first Raspberry, moulded in his own image, which comes to life and kisses him.
Cowboy Bebop, however, did not disappoint.
In MGM's color version, however, it has become even more offensive: in this version, the black woman cowers in fear as the big white man simply snatches the necklace off her person.
Whoever wrote the story, however, should be strung up by their toes.
This film however, is the biggest exception, and it is ABSOLOUTELY BRILLIANT, as it is a million times much better and more interesting than american teen horrors, which have become a bit dull over the past few years.
The fact that the ending was actually an ending, rather than a Hollywood sequel-tease was nice, however.
If, however, you go all weak-kneed over mush-moufed British accents, you might like it more than I did.
We are supposedly able to think about whatever we want, say whatever we want and act however way we want (as long as it does not interfere with the others', obviously).
This movie is a perfect example of freedom all around, from the scene where a man shoots people randomly and later is sentenced to life in jail but walks out free of the courthouse, to BuÃ±uel himself who has the freedom of saying whatever he wants, however he wants it and in doing so, has given us a fresh perspective.
if however, you are stuck in a baking desert bus stop think of this article and laugh as you watch it and say isn't that something.
The girl that they got to play Sara however was a terrible actress and was like watching a bad car crash.
The rest of the film however is in a minor key when compared with the earlier sound version with Allan Jones and Irene Dunne.
This earlier adaptation, however, stands as a prime example of the genre from the more innocent pre-war era; in fact, starting from the year after Â with William A. Wellman's THE OX-BOX INCIDENT (1943), to be exact Â the Western achieved sudden maturity that would lead to any number of masterworks in various veins (noir, psychological, elegiac, revisionist) till it died out towards the late 1970s.
After a series of tragedies, however, Wayne figures things out (Dietrich had, long before!
One can't help but notice the similarities between this film and Wayne's 1960 effort, "North to Alaska", however, I enjoy "The Spoilers" more and more each time that I watch it.  
The real difficulty, however, is that the film tries for some degree of social consciousness in its dealing with class struggle, but the framework is just too flimsy for such a weighty, albeit noble, subject.
For the rest, I watch movies from beginning to end, and if this is a spoiler: The intro is kind of cool, however, the subject could be better explored and attacked.
At one point he scraped the wall enough to create a good bit of recognizable damage; however and aerial shot showed a beautiful undamaged vehicle - chuckle.
He soon realizes, however, that both clans are evil and need to be extinguished, and so the plot goes on.
With the first words spoken, however, it became painfully apparent what this movies main problem would be.
Sukiyaki Western Django, however, shows his true capability as a director and that he isn't just another run-of-the-mill carbon copy like I originally thought after viewing Audition.
It however is ruined by the poorly over-the-top acting actors and the weak and at times just plain stupid directing from Jim O'Connolly.
The movie and its story however make some odd choices as the movie progresses and the acting and directing truly make this movie an even worser one to watch.
Their trip is set to be anything but pleasurable, however, as it turns out that there's a deformed killer stalking the underground cave system.
Instead of showing appreciation for his efforts to save the lives of her and her family, however, Houston proceeds to fight him at every turn, insulting him, mocking his attempts to turn her house into a secure area and generally making a complete ass of herself, and her attitude spreads to her entourage and hangers-on, all of whom turn on Costner.
I think the problem is in the early part of the film where all of th e pieces are being set in motion, however once its all going its great.
As for her acting, she somehow fit into the roles of a schizophrenic or a comic/computer game type of characters, however, as la femme fatale she completely fails.
He has been dishonest, however, in describing himself as a man of only average means.
So taken is Laura by Kant that she imitates his daily promenade, every day at the same time...unlike Kant, however, Laura's stroll happens to lead her past the door of the darkly handsome Algerian clandestine immigrant alongside whom she works as a janitor in the evenings.
The plot is quite simple, Daniel Day Lewis can't be with the adulterous slut)Michelle Phfeffer or however you spell her name) because he is engaged with Winona Ryder.
The dialogues are somewhat akin to the luscious-looking dishes spread out on the extravagant tables: made of plastic and indigestible, however brilliantly Â sic Â they may have been filmed.
I would, however, love to see the outtakes, the "making-of" footage.
That's where the superlatives end however, though as other reviewers have pointed out, this one merits viewing just because it's so goofy and entertaining.
I however thought it was satisfactory.
'Guess Who' however was incredibly predictable and slow moving at times.
All the doctors are then set free, however the fifth doctor is informed that he is now declared Lord President of Gallifrey but he says to the Chanellor of Gallifrey, to take charge until he returns, which is the beginning of the doctor going on the run from his own people.
The real star, however, is Jesse Eisenberg, who plays the lovable Charlie Banks.
Its open acceptance (or tolerance) and embraced and head-on examination as an "idea", however, is, especially in this city-state notorious for its anti-gay "lifestyles" stance.
Labeling the location Terminal City, however, is a bit much.
The actors playing the various hostages are capable, however, and there's a nice sense of what city life was probably like at around this time.
In French, however, he says "She thinks you're the anti-Christ."
I didn't catch the story, however.
At the time the film was released however attitudes were not nearly as liberal as they are in the 2000s it was not so much the films content but what it silently inferred that was to shake people up and to raise questions their own minds.So that we focused on was it right for her "Emannuelle" to be touched by another woman, to have multiple hetro sex, or to be anally penetrated?
People have sex for many reasons, one reason being that for however fleeting sex can give us a sense of unboundedness, without time.
When Philippe's thesis is again rejected by his Doctoral committee, however, he seeks other avenues for recognition but they lead only to humiliation.
Since it is closer to a perfect ten than a perfect 9, however, I had to give it a 10.
You could consider the film a downer, however, it plays like a thriller, with tensions kept high by focusing intently on the girl.
It is a film worthy of high praise; however, be prepared for experiencing a great deal of anger and anguish by witnessing the subjugation of Muslim women and children without much resolution or hope.
In the film, however, the quote (in Arabic letters) refers to Doctor Shariati who was the ideologue of the Iranian cue (I didn't get the chance to read the actual quote because my Arabic is a little rusty).
I hope this film will prompt people around the world to demand that women have basic rights such as the right to vote, to go out in public, and to dress however they please no matter what country they live in.
The local Taliban, however, remembers this little detail very clearly, and starts by hosing the women down with high-pressure hoses before opening fire on them.
This, however, was unadulterated crap.
If, however, you come to this film (as I did) expecting a rip-roaring comedy (whether of the slapstick or the screwball variety), you may be disappointed.
There are too many boring parts however to make this a good slasher film.
By no means, however, should the failings of "Our Mutual Friend" be attributed to its performers, who were uniformly excellent from top to bottom.
Paul McGann and Keeley Hawes, however, were even better Â though it must be confessed the beautifully modulated tones of Ms. Hawes seemed a long way from the docklands dialect her role suggested.
Fair enough this film has superb scenery, a great plot, and decent actors, however I cannot help but to be disappointed with the adaption.
As with all films of this type, however, we quickly realise that this life is less perfect than it seems.
The community is not, however self-sufficient; they produce little for themselves, apart from fish, and have to import many of their supplies from the mainland, which they pay for by growing and selling cannabis.
It was, however, unfortunate that the director Danny Boyle, who wanted Ewan McGregor to play Richard, was overruled by the studio, as Leonardo di Caprio, although he is better here than he was in "Titanic", tends to overact.
)listening at the keyhole, whose nocturnal presence we, however, spontaneously forget about.
It isn't 'Indecent Proposal', however, as Moreau's character happens to be in her own was as notorious as Clay, and has a history of sorts with Clay and her family.
The other actors are hit or miss, however, with Moreau being the clear top choice in this field.
The men, however, are a little more shaky.
But not everything is bad, however, since the innovative visualization--that of mixing various formats, be it 35mm, 16mm, 8mm and even standard NTSC video--has left us with a visually and aurally interesting piece that can be appreciated again and again.
The best of the bunch, however, has got to be Tommy Lee Jones as the prison warden Dwight McClusky.
Visually however, Natural Born Killers is stunning.
It should come as no surprise, however, that there has indeed been more bad than good horror anthology films.
Secrets abound, however, when footsteps and a child's laughter are heard within.
It is however the most anti-feminist movie you'll likely ever see.
His books did, however, mark a turning-point in censorship.
Yes, I played this game on the sega cd video game console, however I do believe it was originally a computer game.
Reading a few of the other reviews, I think this is evidently a "hate it or love it" film, however a lot of people seem to have missed the point-I don't think this film was really intended as a comdey, to me it was more just about the relationships and interactions between the various characters and maybe even an exploration of the human spirit.
The performances are good, and the play speaks for itself however, Ms. Franz is the added bonus of seeing this version.
This is only the first step into his mysterious past, however...
Later on in the film, however, troubling questions begin to arise about Bob's sanity and his grip on his new reality that he has found himself in.
Tereska is however looking for some warm and she finds it thanks to a disabled porter.
Unlike "Dancer in the Dark", however, "Czesc Tereska" offers nothing but truth, a painful and utterly bleak truth, which connects us with the kinds of human experience we usually shy away from.
In this context, be it however close to Lynch's vision, all the imagery of the film can be interpreted and the plot followed from beginning to end.
If you appreciate non-linear, surreal drama/horror, however, then by all means go see it.
Each of Lynch's films explores the mind in terms of Jungian philosophy, focusing particularly on The Shadow; however, Inland Empire goes further in this direction than any film previous to it.
This year O'Tool was just fine in "Troy" however, that wasn't a very special film.
then avoid this film like the plague however if you are looking for a cheap laughter filled night in with the lads, this is the one for you.
I do however have a place in my heart for this film, even though the script was downright terrible, some moments in this film are just a must to commit to memory and are undeniably funny.
If, however, you appreciate innovative stream-of-consciousness film-making, fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants pacing, and so-sloppy-its-tight design, get yourself this DVD!!!!
One should, however, never confuse the contents (in this case: the political statements of a movie), with the form (viz.
What it *REALLY* is about, however, is blond girls with nice butts + bewbs, 1980s fashions & hair styles, low budget direct to home video horror movie production, and people getting their heads chopped off, exploded by horrific 80's arena metal rock, skewered with large chopping/cutting instruments, and seeing the blond girls with the nice bodies without their clothes on.
I've never really taken to actress Marlene Dietrich, and I find her distinct European accent and stunted line-delivery to be rather distracting; however, she does passably well as Charlotte Inwood, demonstrating an arrogant disposition that forms a strong contrast with the mild personality of Wyman's character.
It is the masterful presence of the great Alastair Sim, however, that makes Stage Fright one of Hitchock's most enjoyable to watch.
It's nice to see him move towards movies that raise issues in today's society and provide inspiration to the average person, however I hope he still does some action films :D.  I would recommend this film to someone who wants to experience something real in society, instead of clichÃ© violence and romance.
Some of the camera work was OK, however the over bright white effect got annoying quick as did the Shaky cam.
The fact is however, Russel plays a very emotionally open person.
I do, however, think that Costner was more what I have imagined Earp as than Russell was.
Tombstone was more entertaining and action-packed, however, the story was not as historically accurate and the characters were a little over the top.
K. Corral happenings, although the true-life characters were never namedÂ "Frontier Marshal" (1939) starring Randolph Scott and "Wichita" (1955) with Joel McCrea also told the storyÂ   To most modern cinema-goers, however, the Corral incident and the confused events and motivations which led to it have been best served by four films, John Ford's "My Darling Clementine" (1946), John Sturges' "Gunfight at the O.K.
There are scenes however that subtly show the main character to be a multi-dimensional person with feelings.
McDowell, Savalas and Wynn however were good.
In the 70s, however, this script was able to attract a whole plethora of respected actors and actresses.
The phantom is not Ken's worry, however.
Murphy turns out to be a nasty ruthless woman herself and Bridgit finally gets an almost worthy opponent, however, once again she proves she is willing to go to any length to get her way.
Not a good film in any respect however.
The last one is sporadically funny, however it also lacks a clear point and only shows scene from today's gay life.
I do, however, believe that "Clone Wars" is simply excellent.
who this time uses his special skills for vengeance when his family is wiped out by Russian mobsters however this is just the first fifteen minutes as Lundgren wastes literally no time in delivering payback and it is when he finds out that the mobster lived that it becomes apparent that he must return back to Russia and even the score.
Of course I was mildly surprised by Lundgren's last movie The Defender due to it's good action and solid story however I generally don't rent straight to video movies because I got burned way too many times, however when this came on TV I saw it and was VERY impressed with it.
If you haven't seen this film then for goodness sake don't - however bad you've heard this film is cannot possibly prepare you for the awfulness which has to be seen to be believed, but is much better left unseen.
Not here however, where the only apparent joke is that a trio of grown men are kicking the stuffing out of a helpless animal.
I do agree however, that nearly all warmovies need a healthy dose of realistic romance.
Lenzi's film is totally devoid of suspense, has plenty of elements which make no sense whatsoever (including a disappearing Doberman and a killer caretaker with a limp), features lousy acting, some dreadful special FX and some even worse examples of 80s fashion, and completely rips off the Tobe Hooper/Spielberg hit Poltergeist for several scenes (however, with a much smaller budget and a less talented crew, the results are laughable).
The bad acting however makes the film more entertaining to watch and gives you plenty of laughs.
Cage really out did himself this time, however.
This one, however, brings a new fresh feeling to this genre.
Once Gizmo gets wet, however, the movie cranks up several notches and never slows down.
About halfway through the movie, however, we are introduced to Lynn Bedik (beautifully portrayed by Amy Ryan), a down-on-her-luck mother, whose young daughter, Kira (the astonishing Abigail Breslin), may hold the key to either Keane's redemption or damnation depending on the decisions he makes.
i am such a die-hard inuyasha fan i'm gonna label this the best anime movie ever (however i'm aware my biased opinion will not convince everyone).
The father of Inuyasha and Sesshomaru, however, was probably the highlight of this feature, he himself was worth seeing the entire movie for.
That does not however have to be a bad thing, since the story is well told, and does not hurry.
This movie, however, breaks the mold.
This movie however, from the previews, made you think you were going to see a chick flick,.... a romantic comedy.
Spider-Man is greatly improved however in his own graphics and fighting techniques.
It however, does have a few problems, as it needs special care.
This one however has a career criminal trying to go straight, but with no one willing to give him a break.
I do agree however, with the message which is given as a whole.
I think, however, that the little girl (Rosie McPherson) was just "too calm down" for a kid her age.
It seems odd, however, that the mother was ALWAYS having a drink.
Club Sand however, is nothing like the brochures, and everything from rude help, horrible accommodations, terrible food (when it can be found), over-sexed guests and even a burgeoning rebellion on the resort island conspire to make the Lollars' vacation anything but an escape.
As played by Glen Ford, however, terribly lacking in character.
A lot of jump cuts and missed dialog however doesn't hurt the flow of the story all that much, but even so, what you're left with it are some of the most over the top melodramatic performances you'll find coming out of the era.
At first, I was taken back by the film's unyielding, in-your-face, wicked humor and plots, however, upon completing this remarkable piece of cinema, I was able to digest and grip what the main characters' (West, Art, 'Nancy' - boy is she a hoot -) social positions in our/their world must be like.
The whole killing and story approach of this movie however still give it an overall original touch.
The poster / DVD cover of this Thai / Cambodian co-production looks quite cool, however, the actual movie fails to deliver.
I would, however, pay to see Sarah Michelle Gellar bite off his "little hobbit" for real.
Good parodies can be incredibly funny, but this, however, is not one of them.
A few bad things however: this show makes a bit too much the apology of the US Navy and it's a shame that Kate died at the end of Season 2...
While the storytelling misses its mark however the acting is on-target.
There are too many boring parts however to make this a good slasher film.
SPOILER however (if you don't already know it) fede dies and flor's prince changes(supposedly Fede returns to earth and enters the body of Max, or something like that) That is quite annoying because after all this trouble they went through they didn't even manage to get married really (unreal weddings-cris morena again!)
As with all prequels written by another author,however, some of the details of the new story do not always fit seamlessly with the old.
The characters are equally ill-developed(though this time, I *could* tell them apart... they were easier to tell from each other, however, so maybe I wasn't the only one who couldn't tell those in the first apart?).
Things are changed around enough; however, to clearly make this a different film and not a true remake.
In Bride of Frankenstein, the film starts with a prologue that recaps the events of the first film, however, completely contradicting the entire ending of the film which is where the sequel starts.
The cameo of FREDDY'S glove is a classic nod to Craven's work...or a diss, however you look at it.
Sometimes I felt like I was seeing even deeper truths being reached about parents and children (not only Anna with her mother but Henrik with his family- both have tarnished relationships, but however much forgiveness is left off or ties severed shows also how the children become as they are), and a take on the free will vs. determinism of such a decision.
As much as I like him for his acting talents, I can't help being nit-picky: He does a commendable job in uttering all of the well written dialogue, however he did struggle to spell out more than a few of those Urdu words in the way they are supposed to be spelled.
It is jarring for what begins as a light story of two schoolboys to become so dark and violent, however.
The story however seems like a rehashed Indian Jones sort of caper/hybrid.
I did not have much of a choice when my brother-in-law bought a CD of this movie home & my wife insisted that we should view it as a family...I have been hearing rave reviews till now & so was just a little bit intrigued...however after sitting through the entire movie, I am wondering what the hype was all about...without doubt, this is an above-average film and has been made with a lot of care & effort....however does it deserve all the accolades heaped on it...can I, for once, cry out "The Emperor has no clothes"?
Let's take a look at the various reasons why I am panning this movie - 1) Hrithik, with his chocolate boy good looks & razor-sharp features is Bollywood star material...however he does not fit in the stereotype of a powerful Mughal Emperor...when you think about Akbar, a powerfully built, swarthy & regal figure springs to mind and Hrithik is anything but...with his soft, melting eyes he looks more like the poster boy of movies such as Dhoom 2 & Krish...
Instead an unknown actor with a commanding presence would have better suited this role...I think Hrithik would be more suited to play the part of Jehangir, in a historic movie, as Jehangir was known to be a typical ladies man...  2) Aishwarya Rai as a Rajput princess is a joke...same as Hrithik, she lacks the stature to play such a part...she is pure eye candy...her voice is weak & she sounds absurd delivering her lines...my choice to play this part would have been Sushmita Sen...  3) The plot of this movie is 2/3rds pure fantasy...Akbar did not have a wife by the name of Jodha...he married a Rajput princess called Hira Kunwar, who promptly converted to Islam and was called Mariam-ul-zamani...she was one of Akbar's many wives and bore him his heir apparent Jehangir...  4) It is not evident whether the director meant for this film to be a love saga or a political drama...too many sub-plots spring out throughout the length of the movie, but get resolved quickly & conveniently...it seems the director wanted to pack in as much masala as possible, culminating in an unnecessary fight scene...  5) Akbar's birth name was Badruddin Mohammed Akbar, after his grandfather Shaikh Ali Akbar and "Akbar" was not a title conferred on him...  5) Akbar was better known as a master strategian & shrewd administrator, not for his chiseled physique...he was also not monogamous as is depicted in the movie, but like other emperors of his time had innumerable wives & concubines...though he has been painted as being broad-minded & liberal as compared to other Mughals, Akbar was far from the benign & forgiving monarch portrayed here...he was responsible for slaughtering thousands of men, women & children, destroying hundreds of temples & ransacking scores of towns & villages...finally no Indian emperor would be fool hardy enough to challenge his adversary to single combat & stake his entire kingdom on the outcome of the fight...  6) The battle scenes are evidently inspired by (read - copied from) Hollywood movies such as Troy & Alexander...however after watching the realistic, gruesome wars depicted in the latter, these appear as tame, watered down versions...the climatic confrontation in this movie reminds too much of the awe-inspiring stand off between Hector & Achilles in Troy...
The highlight however, is one man who stands out the most in the movie, Hrithik Roshan who has once again proved his star prowess.
This bittersweet romantic piece however, does not revolve around it, but keeps a balance between a sensitively depicted threesome of one beautiful woman, a restaurateur and a pianist-composer and the historical background which influenced it and eventually sealed its fate.
Drama, a touch of humor, some suspense and even some sex (however, the latter seems to be unnecessary sometimes - it would have worked without or with less).
The only downfall I feel that this film may have is due to it drags during the beginning, however once we get into the story your on the edge of your seat until the end.
Audio: DD5.1 \ DTS - The DTS soundtrack is very sharp, and one would expect that it could easily be overused, however it's not.
All the while, however, the story is very thin: that of a father and his young daughter coping with the gruesome death of the wife/mother who supposedly slit her wrists in the bathtub where she bled to death.
When the score plays during the Ross-Williams dialogue, however, it brings me temporarily out of the period and into the obviously-made-in-'70s mode.
I've always had a problem, however, with leading lady, Ann Harding.
The wife is not bad at all, however the husband... is an idiot.
In the following minutes however, we do not come across with the same violent scenes.
I was a bit afraid to see a grown up LL, however.
The girl is identified as Aubrey; however, she insists her name is Dakota and does not know her parents or friends.
The plot, however, is solid enough to carry you entertainingly to that point when everything become clearer.
I, however, was in the mood for some silliness and found the film pretty entertaining, despite being a tad overlong.
The big plot twist at the end was original enough, however for me it seemed like a cop out.
It is remarkable, however, that Pawlik's pirouettes actually were as fast as they are in the free programs of the present world's elite.
The figure skater Eva Pawlik, however, does her job well not only on the ice but also as an actress.
They reception they get from the native people on the arrival is however not as friendly as it first seems.
I was however disappointed because the movie had many cut outs of interesting dialog that are in the tv 5 part episodes.
In THIS film, however, the whole thing is all over the place.
Additionally, the various and sundry persons who got "credits" for being this film's "producers," should be ashamed of wasting however much money this effort cost.
They are however representative of the way a schizophrenic's beliefs may vary and may represent her additional fears and paranoia.
For the person who enjoys films that cause one to reflect and to experience more than a thrill, however, Desert Bloom will probably make him feel that he has chosen a very meaningful way to spend two hours.
I hate to say the ending is a little bit clichÃ©, however, the movie is clichÃ© but amazing !
Yossi and Jagger however is a love story of two people caught in the middle of many forces - Careers, being out, military service, authority roles, and living day to day under international hostilities.
Each actor had a powerful screen persona, however neither attempt to dominate what is in effect a prime example of ensemble acting from the entire cast.
Swanson however is just magnificent!
Everyone tends to remember Swanson's over-the-top stylized performance: yet her total control as an actress, and her naturalistic moments and emotional nakedness, however fleeting, are something to behold.
Gloria Swanson, however, steals every scene she's in; you can't turn away from watching her, even though she makes you really uncomfortable - it's like watching a train wreck.
Good premises for a situation comedy, good actors - however the overall impression is one of disappointment.
Alas however it was constructed very much as a whodunnit .
Also caught up in this mÃ©lange is the Mafia represented, however reluctantly, by Fulvio Nestra (Oliver Platt), a nerdy but vicious bungler whose temper is uncontrollable, partly due to his insipid belittling wife Gloria (Mary McCormack) whose father demands Fulvio's crime life importance.
One gets the feeling that the actor/writer/director (and review writer) thinks she's making a populist exploitation film, however, even most exploitation films had an actual story.
There's a lot to be learned from this movie, however you look at it, so long as it's not looked at with eyes that are searching only for the story from the book.
But Rankin-Bass, however, did not.
Beavers can't see it however and passes up her own household to stay with Claudette.
The ideas, however, of this film are not easy to reject totally.
The multiple skits which make up this film vary in their level of humor and cleverness; however, almost all of them are at least very funny, and some are downright hilarious.
What the book and the movie do have in common however is that they are products of their time (post-sexual revolution, pre-politically correctness) and as such their outlook on their common topic is a bit dated.
The segment is topped however by "What Happens During Ejaculation?"
He however lets others play the main role in the others, which works out fine.
The movie is so enjoyable for everyone...I wish I could write about the contents of the DVD, however, this would make it a spoiler.
I know many find that the sequels are disappointing and a real let down for the original film however i found this sequel fantastic!
One other bone of contention I have however, are the songs.Granted, they used a few snippets from the original's score, but all the stuff produced exclusively for the current film was your typically weak, formula-laden "contemporary" numbers that are so cookie-cutter bland that you can't even distinguish one from the other.
The Marine is just a silly film by WWE simply to entertain it's fan base and further it's empire.For one to judge The Marine you need to take into account that this film was intended to entertain action fans with a no brainer,cheesy,action,popcorn flick and as a popcorn flick The Marine succeeds.John Cena is actually a good actor and he played his invincible,heroic,one man strike force character to perfection as did Robert Patrick with his absolutely hilarious character.The Marine has the most unbelievable stunts and at some times they are almost unbearably bad.The fight sequences are great,very intense,very hardcore, but the explosions and special effects are brutally unrealistic and cheesy.The film also has some of the most annoying,campy,corny, dialog ever captured on film.It's so bad you feel like you're re-watching 1997's Batman and Robin.As a follower of pro wrestling I'm aware that John Cena currently has a love/hate relationship with WWE fans.Females and Adolescents love Cena while Males hate him.My guess is that The Marine was made in order to change male fans opinions by making an action film that generally appeals to them.However judging by the overall IMDb rating WWE failed to do so.I wouldn't necessarily say THe Marine is a bad film but it is incomparable and can't compete with mainstream action films like The Transporter,Crank,or District B13 however if you enjoy direct to DVD action flicks that have a thin storyline but some great action scenes like Special Forces or Belly Of The Beast than The Marine is more suited to you.It's definitely not the worst film ever made and I think for the most part it's because it doesn't take itself seriously and admits it's a popcorn flick.Overall The Marine is just silly action much like wrestling and much like wrestling the characters are whacky and at times unbelievable.
As a real fan of action movies I was looking forward to a great action movie from seeing the previews however I found it disappointing.
Honest speaking, this movie is really bad, however some awful movies are somehow very attractive and possess some kind of mysterious charms, and this Mighty Peking Man is one of those movies.
No other comparison between the two should be construed,however.
This movie, however, loses everything that was given to it, literally given to it, by being incredibly flat and mispaced.
I was relieved that the film was not a diatribe, however as a work of film it was deeply disappointing.
The problem, however, is that it was released by Alpha Video--possibly the worst producers of DVDs you can find!!
Thinking he had entered the wrong house, he turned around to leave, however the grandmother stopped him with the statement, "You're the one selling the ecstasy pills, right?
The mediocrity was not restricted to these situations, however.
I would tend to agree, however sometimes the overwhelming beauty of a film can remove some viewers from a poorly constructed plot.
Although they inherently verged on exploitation of the audience's desire to see girls being bad, they were supposedly serious and undoubtedly did reflect real concerns people had, however muddled their transition to the conventions of 1950s film-making was.
Oddly, however, they are not caught for the longest time because you can only assume everyone in the town (especially the cops) are idiots!
In "Life Is Beautiful," however, Roberto Benigni's character Guido is Jewish only because the film announces that he is.
I do however rate this film very highly on account of the following:  * The animation is brilliant (for it's time), with unique style and very distinctive puppets.
I, however, felt clubbed to death by every anti-Jewish cliche known.
RETURN, however, is anything but fun.
Caveat: it is doubtful, however, that one can truly appreciate the ingeniousness of this movie without being brought up in a traditional Norwegian way.
There is not enough here to sustain a movie, however.
This, however, can not save this low-budget effort.
I'd only just arrived and so my norwegian wasn't up to much at the time, however, I knew that what I was seeing was something special.
The film does raise some important questions, however.
(It is, however, a mystery to me why the matriarch is attracted to her son, who is sort of the medieval Japanese Jame Gumb.)
The film, also, has little reason to ever be released to DVD; however, inevitably when it is, a price of more than $1.05 is too expensive.
This film, however, was a disaster.
It becomes annoying; however, the music sound track is very good.
My daughter and I did, however, mostly enjoy last year's The Wild Thornberrys Movie.
...however let's try.
When the monkey attempts to swindle him, however, he fires the simian and takes on his role himself.
To her credit, however, she does this very well.
I have to disagree with other texts in this 'genre' however - Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and Narnia - all clearly with staggering budgets of course and various contract obligations obviously in the case of the irritating though opportunistic and hard working Rowling.
Of note however, is the mangling of the "CG" in the movie.
On a positive note this film however could be used to show aspiring filmmakers on how not to make movies, that about all it is good for.
Automatic however does have good actionscenes.
One night, however, when they sneak away from the campfire to have a night-swim, Robin doesn't seem too worried when Amelia warns that she's not a very skillful swimmer.
But here, the young actress portraying the besieged daughter presented a listless performance (consistent, however, with those by the adults).
however its meant to jump out at people who know nothing about these scenes, and take advantage of their ignorance.
Point is, I was willing to accept ALL that as being "minor", however I cannot accept the HUGE holes in the script.
Krause's character, however, is set up to be obviously paranoid.
This film, however, addresses none of these great themes, except in the most cursory and superficial manner.
The worst is however the one-sided view of the situation.
Finding a hidden mural is an old and effective device, however, the director did nothing with the mural that was found under the wallpaper; it should have revealed a clue or added to the story, rather than merely remaining as background scenery in the room or an occasional talking point.
Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of people that loved this movie... however, now that I think about it, they all had the IQ of a tadpole...
The book, however, earns 10 out of 10 stars and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who loves reading.
"Flowers in the Attic", written by Virginia Andrews, is a gripping tale of broken trust, betrayal, and complex human relationships that seem so natural under the circumstances, however forbidden they were to be.
I now want a remake, however controversial it may be, whatever ratings it may get.
What I got however was dreadful.
I didn't list all of the film's in the above area, however.
It is however, a mystery movie that involves the dead walking the earth again.
Everything about the movie is great, especially the acting...however, has anyone noticed that the movie is an obvious copy of Hollywood's Steven Spielberg's "Catch me if you can"?
The film is too bland to be truly terrible, however I will still give it a rating of a "2" for wasting so much talent (Rani and Amitabh) and for going nowhere with what could have been an interesting premise.
But when he chances to hear Hilda singing, and gets to meet her, he abandons his plan and, instead, decides to help her Â his ruse is uncovered, however, and he is forced to flee, and takes the unwilling girl with him.
This isn't the responsibility of the directors, however.
A bad script pretty much sinks them, however.
It had some good atmosphere and it kept my attention, however sadly It seems to run out of steam and lose it's direction somewhere along the way.
I felt my interest waning as the story seemed to limp along to an extremely unsatisfying ending (however at that point I no longer cared) It IS always cool to see Oldman though.
The movie was very well done, cinematically and directorialy, however, it just didn't go anywhere.
Leaving aside the negative storyline and the political point-scoring, however, the acting is fairly decent, and score is alright too.
Besides this, however, there is nothing original or dynamic to be had.
The janitor, however, is killed early on after making no serious advancements in the plot.
The movie, however, isn't.
I really wanted to like it; however, the immense amounts of pseudoscience immediately grated on my nerves.
It did have its moments, however, and was at least good enough to keep my interest.
Dorothy Malone was 62 years of age in this film and showed her age, however, she knew what she looked like and was a true actress and was eager to perform on the silver screen.
This film, however, is not among his bests by a long shot.
(it IS however writer R.J. Robertson's best, but compared to House 4, Munchie strikes back, or Beastmaster 2, that's not particularly a ringing endorsement) Dexter accompanies Marisa to Transylvania in order to get to her uncle's funeral and subsequent viewing of the video will.
!The acting I do have to admit was well,but the story line,characters and death scenes were either stupid,mediocre,or unexplainable.There are other films that are the same genre and fall under the same category as this one,and they all are way more superior.The concept however,was still just a bit creepy.If what had happened in the film happened to you,you would have to put yourself in the main character's shoes.Most of the ways people died were also avoidable.It just seems as if the director told them that they needed to act so stupid in order to make people like this film.Avoid this film as much as possible,but if you absolutely feel the urge to pick it up off the shelves one day,I warn you with the deepest concerns a person can have for another.
Strangers with Candy however felt like an comedy skit that was stretched from the humorous 5 minute length to 90 minutes.
As soon the GIs step down into the dark and narrow corridors, however, they gotta learn the hard way that their enemy is way more accustomed to the unusual surroundings and skilled in the antics of guerrilla warfare than they are and hence it doesn't take long until one GI after the other has to face a merciless death and the defeat of the whole platoon seems almost inevitableÂ In an early interview, Uwe Boll once said that one of his main intents for TUNNEL RATS was to show the absurdity and senselessness of war.
The tunnels, however, remain off screen and we know what awaits the group, giving us a position of power Â a position of power that is further emphasised when we witness entire scenes dedicated to the Vietcong, the American's enemy, one occurrence of which sees the camera crane directly below a Tunnel Rat to reveal a makeshift Vietcong war room.
Here, however, we get a greater variety of the latter: dinosaurs Anguirus, Baragon, Gorosaurus, Godzilla (along with its annoying baby offspring Minilla) and the flying Rodan, the spider Kumonga, the snake-like Manda and the worm Mothra.
This "film", however, is absolutely terrible from start to finish.
What this means, however, is that BRIDE never self-destructs in the ludicrous way of such films as PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE--and in consequence it isn't so much unintentionally hilarious as it is unintentionally amusing in a mild sort of way.
Tarantulas: The Deadly Cargo starts in Ecuador in South America where two partners Fred (Howard Hesseman) & Buddy (Tom Atkins) are about to fly off to San Francisco with a cargo bay full of coffee beans that they intend to sell for a huge profit, unfortunately they fail to realise that lots of deadly tarantulas have gotten on board... As Fred & Buddy head for San Francisco their plane develops a technical problem which forces them to land in the small Californian town of Finley Ville, however before they get the opportunity Buddy is bitten by a tarantula & the plane crashes in a field.
Others give good performances however, especially the Assistant.
Direction is mediocre at best, however; a strange choice of camera angles and the worst killer's costume *EVER* contributing to RECORD's downfall.
In fact, the vampires dominate most of the proceedings during the latter stages of the film, while early on there's also excess footage featuring a gypsy couple (who, for plot purposes, unwittingly revive the werewolf which subsequently 'marks' Waldemar Daninsky); however, despite the limited resources at the film-makers' disposal, the Gothic atmosphere is well up to par for the course (though dissipated somewhat by the faded print I watched!
The good: The movie pretty very short, so however bad it is, at least it's over quickly.
The series, however, goes off the rails in the third hour.
however, although you know the movie might suck, you would never suspect that it could be as bad as it actually was.
In the end, however, the film really fell flat for me and besides the numerous references to the horrific event, The Great New Wonderful didn't need to have it as a backdrop.
The best section of the film, however, contains two Indian bodyguards protecting a General in town for a run of speeches.
In order to reach that end, however, they sent their child away and seemingly started from scratch with their relationship to each other.
James goes outside and is confronted by a mysterious old man who gives James back his bag, however, it now contains magical crocodile tongues.
There is something special about these two exceptional actors, however, that enables Rhames and Oldman to rise above the material.
It is odd, however, that a movie can take such talented actors as Ving Rhames and, especially, Gary Oldman and turn their performances into run-of-the-mill action clichÃ©s.
Where the movie does not wallow in clichÃ©s, however, is in some of the characterizations.
There is, however, a lot of forgiveness in the movie, and I respect that.
We'll never know if that's true however, because the picture is just too dark.
Peter's attempt's at fooling his guests into thinking the Castle is haunted fail miserably, however all is not lost as then the real ghosts take over.
All in all, however, a definitely sub-standard Wayne Western.
That doesn't mean however, that they have not lived a fulfilling and satisfying life.
Grenades, however, are capable of decapitating it.
Dying for a quarter pound of weed seems a little excessive for a jail, however, if only that had happened the suffering could have turned to slight laughter with mild nausea.
I didn't, however, mention the deliberate misuse of transporting toxic waste because it was an obvious set-up and part of the overall camp of the movie.
The cast of this movie however were unable to make the same assurances.. there is an actor in this film called kevin e scott, his career has spanned 10 years and consisted of 3 small movie roles, it is clear why after seeing this.
I was however disappointed at the Viking-like appearance of the cannibals, it was obvious from the start that they would not be the victors in this film.
As a film, however...  0/5
There is trouble in paradise, however, since they find themselves on opposite sides of an attempt to pass satellite codes to the Russians encoded into a homemade porno film.
Co-directors Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger have a unique and occasionally ominous way of letting nature unfold in front of the lens, and the cinematography is vivid and expressive; however, they don't seem to know much about actors or about the strength of performance--the technique seems to elude them--and Jennifer Jones in particular comes off looking like an amateur (which she is most assuredly not).
This "zequel" however is not only unfunny, but unremarkable.
Hasnain Hyderabadwala & Raksha Mistry after copying COLLATERAL and making THE KILLER(2006) remake again This time their film THE TRAIN is a remake of DERAILED a film which wasn't that great in the first place  The film looks similar to Emraan's own ZEHER in fact the promos and also the songs plus the adultery theme is so much ZEHER  The film could be a decent thriller but sadly the film comes too late even the chemistry between Emraan and Sayali Bhagat is bad The sub plot of their daughter is good but the rest film however isn't as engrossing  The problem is predictability and also the feeling of deja vu plus the villain's characterization isn't too convincing and the final twist is predictable too  Direction is okay Music is a winner, especially ZINDAGI NE, MAUSAM, WOH AJNABEE Camera-work is good  Emraan is good in his part and is getting more dependable though the role is too similar to ZEHER Sayali Bhagat is weak while Geeta Basra is better much has a way to go Aseem Merchant irritates Suresh Menon is as usual, Rajat Bedi fills the bill
Now some people are complaining about the lack of plot, however there is a plot; a weak one, but yes it is there.
Today however I can't see the children even being remotely interested in talking cars or for that matter the occupants of these cars.
I can say however, that Edinburgh looks fabulous, but then it always does.
This film, however proves this not to be such a good idea.
Emma has a problem, however, in that Mimzy, her closest confidant and "teacher" is dying and needs to get back home.
The two kids are also very good at playing their parts, with Wryn as Emma very adept at being vulnerable and smart, and O'Neil being almost too close to looking like the boy Elliot in ET, however not without his own strengths.
It's not just about making friends and gaining in some alien intelligence, but in figuring the significance of the future, however weird it might be.
When Banek traces Gipson, however, and asks him to return the document, Gipson, still angry about the collision and about the outcome of his own court case, refuses.
It must be said, however, that many of his problems are self-inflicted.
It is, however, more difficult to regard Ben Affleck's Banek as an "otherwise decent human being".
This self-assessment, however, is not borne out by the plot; the film shows us a good deal of the harm that Delano has done and no evidence that he has ever done any good.
When the group arrives in the house, they immediately go to a night-club to have fun and chase some local guys for sex; however, the evil El Charro (Andrew Bryniarski) is seeking Maria killing her friends with his machete.
I am, however, replacing one and a half points because at least the film makes the link that people who are gratuitously cruel to animals are likely to harm other humans.
This film, however, had "less than zero" redeeming qualities.
You can tell every second they had very little money to spend, however, if a movie is to be expected that bad, one should simply not even start making the movie to begin with.
Such plot contrivances are irrelevant however, because Feed makes little sense.
The scenes of the artists painting are pure vaudeville - most of them seemingly getting more paint on themselves than on the canvas; this is not a total loss however since the paint looks decidedly better on them than on the finished paintings, which are dross.
I, however, haven't done that stuff in a long time so I was merely envisioning putting this one straight into the trade-in pile when I was done watching it.
!the director of this movie tries his best to make a good statement about the contemporary sensitive issue in Korean society- plastic surgery however,what i see in the movie is an unconvincing script, illogical character development...I think we all have noticed about the famous die-at-the-end trend in Korean movie.
Creepers, in the end, however, just doesn't live up to the standard set by it's predecessor.
There is however a hysterical scene where the killer roots kill a man in a suit who's chasing the "hero" with a gun.
Series than myself- I realize Paul Fusco was a big fan having created the series however I never would have allowed this stink-filled script to destroy the laugh filled memories of the Alf Franchise.
I have seen him do a good job before in other roles so I know that he is not a bad actor, however I just couldn't buy him being the king.
Manufacturing lies to replace well-known historical facts, however, is far beyond the Pale.
Some people say an actor acts "effortlessly:" when he gives a good performance, however in Deniro's case that seems to be opposite as their is hardly any acting all.
Dobie refuses using one of the few morals he has, however Milo comes up with another proposition, he wants to be Dobie's "friend".
Milo eventually introduces the lame brain cop to his new girl "Glory" (Uma Thurman) an attractive woman who we learn is Milo's main squeeze, however better put, she is a prostitute, she is one of many objects that Milo "owns".
By this point in the series, however, the filmmakers were simply sneering at "them," defined as all those people who didn't attend film school or vote for McGovern.
Had they made reference to or alluded to Bio-engineering, or the virus having killed all cats and dogs causing this, perhaps I would have found it acceptable, however they did not explain this even in the slightest.
The only side development in any of the characters, however shallow, is with a woman (a prostitute I believe) who is with another man after a previous ill-timed engagement.
If, however, you have better things to do with your 3 some hours, skip this.
Stuart Little 3 is, however, best avoided.
That, however, does not a movie make so for the most part it is a by the numbers sports movie with an alien twist.
Sasha Mitchell stars as David Sloan the brother of Kurt Sloan (Jean-Claude Van Damme) who takes on Tong Po (Michael Qissi) a brutal fighter who was beaten in Bangkok by Kurt, however Tong Po has killed Kurt and now demands a match with David to reclaim his honor in this disappointingly dull sequel which takes itself far too seriously.
He doesn't, however, get a bursary, so he tries to earn money through various legitimate schemes.
Incidentally, this has to be Presley's most eccentric vehicle: it combines the period setting of the star's own FRANKIE AND JOHNNY (1966) with the carnival backdrop of his ROUSTABOUT (1964); however, he seems quite lost here (this was, in fact, Elvis' penultimate film) in which he's given just one typical number ("Clean Up Your Own Back Yard") and where his hair-do and trademark stage moves clash with the feel of quaint Americana the narrative is striving for!
I kept (back in 1999 when I first saw this movie) seeing a mad Ross trying to be bad whenever I looked at him, but now looking back on it and putting Ross out of my head (I really dislike the show anyway), Schwimmer does an effective job... however he doesn't really have dimensions and depth.
Anyway Rage To Kill stars James Ryan (Of Kill and Kill again fame)a tough marine (who doubles as a race-car driver) travels to a South African college (Because we all know that South Africa is known for their ivy league schools) to save his brother from a ruthless general who has just recently overthrown the government, however after an (inept) escape, the marine and the college students join the rebels and payback the ruthless dictator with wholesale slaughter.
I am completely against, however, two "little people" getting together and having dwarf children out of ignorance of their own conditions.
Now, however, I would rather watch a reality show than this horrible attempt at a remake.
We rented this movie based on the title and the comment on the movie, "Family Favorite Based on the Holiday Classic"; however, this movie is FAR from the original.
Mr. Cruise is a competent actor; however, you would never know it from this film--nobody would have been able to deliver a compelling performance, considering the insipid dialog, abysmal writing and first-year film-school-caliber direction, in this mess.
The gimmick, with the masks IS cute and would be a nice addition to a movie, which contained some real intrigue, however when it is as over-used, as in this film, it is only silly.
The sequel however has no plot, no interesting dialogue just mindless shootouts that would leave Gun and ballistic experts laughing in disbelief.
Despite being rubbish, however, Forest of Fear marks a personal achievement for Charles McCrann.
The second part, however, turned into a supernatural slasher and I was actually quite thrilled, because the first part of the film had been really bad.
Whether this contributes to make this movie a masterpiece is rather questionable, however.
This sort of film however can only work if it manages to engage.
The worst thing about the film version of "Girl with a Pearl Earring" however, is that the image that will appear in association with Vermeer's masterwork in the future, will be Scarlett Johansson's Griet.
There are, however, some very good sequels such as "The Lion King II," "Lady and the Tramp II," and "Toy Story II."
It is also tainted by the stupid antics, however.
Some people comment that the characters aren't acting, that it doesn't feel scripted, and that it seems more realistic this way: however, this is not the case.
It is however, a very unusual and gutsy film for which the director should be praised.
I have to say, however, that an hour and a half of Bullwinkle's voice was way too much.
Like others, however, I did enjoy Lance Hendriksen as Long John Silver, although his infamous handicap is conspicuously missing.
As for the other actors, Natasha McElhone is better than she was in FearDot.Com, and this is NOT like saying Pauley Shore was better in SON-IN-LAW than he was in BIO-DOME; she's not only beautiful, but gives a decent performance; however, what she lacks is star power, the charisma that a star like Julia Roberts can bring to a picture, thus making Kelvin's yearning and his ultimate decision more real.
however, in this WONDERFUL tale, we get a half assed actress who strips down to her big underwear and leaves the stage.
Only the score from Elia Cmiral goes beyond the mundane in this, and he proves reliable for these sorts of films, however his work here is a long way from his excellent work in The Mechanik and a country mile behind his apex in Ronin.
In fact Norris seems to be in his old 80's mode where he was ruthless in his stoic presence however there just isn't enough action.
I really should stop watching all these DTV action films,but every once in a while you find a surprising gem in a batch,however The Cutler is definitely not one of them.
I guess it is not surprising however that they opted to cut out the latter portion of the moniker, as '88 Minutes of Your Life You Will Never Get Back' is not quite as zippy.
I guess putting heinous crimes to notes and lyrics seemed like a novel idea, however, it BOMBED!!!
Most of which isn't all that laughable, however.
This movie, however, is awful and a real chore to sit through.
Kamchatka might be worth seeing, however, if you're interested in recent developments in the political genre.
"Balls of Fury," however, runs most of its humor into the ground as well as elsewhere.
"I Don't Want to Be Born", however, serves as a reminder of just how bad British cinema could be at its nadir.
Thats why the film is appealing however.
Chesty Morgan gives a somewhat catatonic performance (she's no worse than anyone else in the cast, mind you), and there can be little argument that her breasts are unerotic (bigger is not always better), however she does have a pretty face and nice legs.
Other than that, however, there's not much else.
This film is called the Magician because obviously like Shoesmith's dead bodies (which you never see but he does talk about) he makes things disappear, however a Hit Man knows how to hit his target, something this film certainly failed to do.
In the film however, the grandfather tried to persuade Jimmy not to go.
I do however dare you to find a movie with a more unattractive cast.
This movie however, was much to mushy and didn't follow the characters attitudes at all.
Other than the requisite gore (and Philip Glass score), again, we have a subplot involving a black child who lives in fear of the Candyman; additionally, however, we get a bit of irrelevant sleaze (this being conveniently set during Mardi Gras)!
There are, however, few other positives, except perhaps the Bee Gees' groovy soundtrack, with such hits as "Stayin' Alive" and "More Than a Woman".
The movie is however, all the better for it.
The small budget excuses the poor cinematography and editing however it doesn't excuse the bad acting, dialog and overall horrible directing.
The movie has great actors (Noah Wyle, James Rebhorn, Gretchen Mol, among others); however, the Libtards in Hollywood simply cannot tell a story without their crazed anti-American, Anti-CIA, anti-whatever being the core of the story.
Sadly or gladly, however you want to look at it, it does.
however, the best part, and the element of the movie that still, 18years on remains unsurpassed for me, is the Goblin masks.
It is not particularly well done, however, it is very interesting to residents of the Treasure Coast because of its historical significance.
Warning: Don't expect too much from this twist however since it is the most ridiculous twist I have seen.
Although the movie was about four Afro-American college buddies, however, I think that everyone could relate to the episodes that often lead up to the wedding.
Valerie Perrine, however, appears in an entirely disposable role as the obligatory concerned wife.
Orla Brady, however, just falls short from portraying the fiery and vivacious spirit of Catherine Earnshaw.
The 1992 wuthering heights with Ralph fiennes however is an amazing film.
George Hamilton was perfect for the part, however.
Sometimes and with some issues we provincial Americans are wrong...in this case, however, I suspect the French have something to learn from us about the way we have taken sexual abuse cases more seriously in recent years (though, of course, we still have a way to go).
An explanation IS added, however, in an attempt to simplify things further.
The wretched lecher in me however could turn away from the sheer nubile aura of visceral pleasure.
The movie is sort of offensive with the premise, however politics aside the movie is just plain dull.
Well, however Lee Tamahori (you know, the guy who introduced Madonna-techno to the Bond franchise) does it, he does it good: "xXx - squared, muthafucka!"
Despite a high pace, endless attempts at humour and lots of stereotypes (for instance, all black people are badass rapper-type characters while all the whiteys are stiff senators or gay computer hackers - however did they come up with this stuff?
I was reassured, however, that he was not in it.
I did notice however that the action in the sequel are more military in nature when compared to that of the first film wherein its action is more related to extreme sports.
After 15 minutes however, things really went downhill and it became obvious that this is a total Tarantino ripp-off.
James Marshall stars as an ex-crook trying to go straight however this is hard because his criminal record keeps haunting him and ruins his chance for any decent employment, however when he gets his hands on a counterfeit plate, three sets of mobsters come gunning for him.
(Such mobsters include Eric Roberts,William Forsythe, Sasha "Kickboxer 2-4" Mitchell,Patrick Kilpatrick, Ice-T and Dennis Hopper) If anything else, Luck Of The Draw answers the burning question of what became of Sasha Mitchell after Step By Step, however that aside, Luck Of The Draw is just terrible.
I have no disrespect to any believers, but I was moved into watching this movie as it appeared to be historically relevant, however, as the movie progressed history turned into religion, and the message was more about god than the actual Chinese historical plot.
In this world however, Cold isn't a popular character and his films are as much fun as going through withdrawal.
Jump to Los Angeles where the deal is to take place & where CIA agent & Cold's friend Amanda Stuart (Tamara Davies) has Donovan's brother James (John Pyper-Ferguson) under surveillance, however when she is caught by Donovan's men Cold has to blow his cover & rescue her.
I did give Cate a great opportunity however.
Turan, as a reviewer, is usually quite perceptive; however, in this one I think he missed it.
What was however, were the annoying-as-hell female and male vocalists used to narrate the action throughout the movie.
Younger viewers will be beguiled by the nonsense, however older viewers with some sense of history will recognize this movie for what it is worth.
The big disappointment for me, however, was that they took a very dramatic, historical story and trivialized it with some very shallow characterizations and fictitious situations pertaining to the famous last flight.
In the end, however, the efforts were nearly all for naught.
If however, you are over 12 years old and are looking for a more authentic and terrifying war movie, seek out Das Boot.
In this case, however, the aliens are mostly robotic, bleach-blond 20-25 year old young Italian men who all look as if they just auditioned to replace Brian Jones in the rolling stones.
What spoils the film however is the slow pace and the fact that you know who the killer is all the way through.
They were similarly ensnared in well-planned traps and could do little to help, however, not sitting on their hands protesting their sobriety in the shade of pleasant riverbank trees, let alone to each other: they were not together.))
My favorite moment of this idiocy, however, comes at the very end, as the director presents the Battle of Little Big Horn as choreographed by Busby Berkeley (only without the overhead shots).
There are, however, two first class (and totally forgotten) songs.
Here however I didn't see anything special about the direction in this film.
It becomes annoying; however, the music sound track is very good.
On the whole, however, I'd recommend this only to those blessed with extreme patience and attention spans.
An X-ray, blood test, or any number of medical procedures would quickly disclose their less than human nature, however a simple test was just to take a pulse which would give the appearance that they were dead even though they were fully conscious and ambulatory.
The film does, however, have two uproariously funny sequences.
Though Robert Houston (Bobby) is also on hand, his character is conveniently put out of the way at the very beginning: he freaks out when a motor race is set to take place in the desert near where his family was attacked all those years ago and opts to stay behind Â Ruby (who's even changed her name) and Beast, however, go along and, though the former's confession about her past isn't taken very seriously by her companions, both of course prove instrumental in the new victims' safe-keeping.
The non-horror viewing public slander horror films as predictable, cheesy and stupid however there are a lot of horror films out there that prove such a statement false Â though The Hills Have Eyes part 2 not only encourages the "all horror movies are dumb" idea but takes it ten steps further.
Part 2, however, just jumps on the 'Halloween/Friday the 13th' bandwagon.
I would agree those movies are far more gruesome, however they do offer a plot line, which offers the audience some intrigue and interest.
In reality, however, these movies were completed since years already but they never got released immediately for whatever reason.
"Snake People", directed by Hill and Juan Ibanez, however, is one of these movies that are so bad they're actually pretty good.
As an unintentional comedy, however, it is hilarious.
After the montage is over, however, the voyeuristic thrill of stalking an unwitting target is never again recaptured.
MKA however became a pastime for us at University, when we were in that frame of mind, to throw it on and laugh ourselves silly with the absolute shambles that is this film.
To be fair, again however he has no script with which to work.
It does however take a special kind of talent to ruin a franchise and movie which already has a good plot in place (refer to the MK video games).
This is not a good entry in the "fun situation comedy" genre, however.
The famed British studio were noted for making expensive-looking Gothic Horrors with limited means; here, however, the low budget shows through as the futuristic sets they came up with are rather shoddy!
Incidentally, MOON ZERO TWO has been referred to as a Space Western (in view of its mining, dynamiting, discovery of a priceless mineral, claim-jumping and shoot-outs): so far so goodÂhowever, having an outer space saloon (complete with dancing cowgirls) in 2021 is beyond ridiculous!
In reality however, there were three key genre pieces that became the outlines for ambitious titles to follow.
Also disappointing is Munro, an actress who usually compensates for her wooden acting by looking absolutely stunning; here, however, sporting big hair with blonde streaks, she looks far from her best (who the hell thought it would be a good idea to make her look like a cross between The Bride of Frankenstein and Elvira?).
The sequel, however, fails to offer any truly satisfying resolutions to those problems.
This, however, is the nadir of his career.
The device of tracking parallel time-lines does add some suspense and tension (exactly what did happen to this girl, and will the detective crack the case); however, I found that the tension peaked somewhere around mid-movie, and the trip to the end more or less plodded to anti-climatic conclusions to both time-lines.
however the acting wasn't horrible.
One positive, however, is that this film really made me and my friends laugh like crazy.
As the lurid title suggests, Strip Nude for Your Killer is one of the more trashy examples of the Giallo tradition, and that has lead many to lambaste it as a sub-par effort; I, however, could not disagree more!
None of that deterred me, however, as while I admit that this isn't the greatest Giallo...I really, really enjoyed watching it.
He is, however, unwilling to announce the cancellation of the mission because this might jeopardise continued Congressional funding for the manned space-flight programme.
Things start to go wrong, however, when, on the return journey, their spacecraft burns up while re-entering the Earth's atmosphere.
From the standpoint of the twenty-first century, however, the film looks dated.
The film, however, suffers from inherent flaws which are more serious than its dated look.
Either way, however, the plot is unsatisfactory.
The whole plot is worked out in just over an hour (64 min) of quite easy watching; however the story (plot?)
All three of us had high hopes for the series having been impressed by the adverts we had seen on TV however the first action scene which takes place behind a large mound was so comical all three of us couldn't help laughing, they where only getting shot at from one direction and where barely outnumbered and not even out gunned yet they are behaving like they are all about to die!
Wesley Snipes stars as Dean Gage, an ex soldier who has emotional baggage, however when he is injected with a truth serum, Gage finds himself vulnerable and the bad guys on his trail, but who can he trust?
Still, however the films of Spike Lee and co although important are still essentially cult movies.
The small roles in the rest of the cast (Nathalie's co-stars), however, and of actor-friends and directors, are painfully inadequately filled in.
Sadly, however, the film didn't stop there.
Believe it or not, however, Lewis did make one low-budget films that didn't completely suck--the surprisingly good TWO THOUSAND MANIACS.
Also the movie has a deadly dull subplot involving Wilson and a high class call girl which just consistently slows the movie down, movies like Redemption need first of all fleshed out characters and lots of screen time for the important characters to the plot, however because the movie treats the main story like an afterthought the movie fails on its own ambitions and satisfies no one in the process.
These facts are the reasons why I was really interested in watching this movie, however these same facts don't give me the permission to excuse and admire every movie of the 30's I watch and find average (or in this case way below average!)
Despite all of this, however, you should watch this film, if only to say that you have.
Some of the rawer French is slightly sanitized, however.
This film, however, just seemed to be capitalizing on the current documentary craze.
Unsurprisingly, it has few well-developed characters; but uncharacteristically for the genre, almost all the piece's characters, however brief their appearance may be, become memorable.
Very soon it's just a brainless teen slasher, and not even as a teen slasher is it worthy of your time, however little your time may be worth.
I can however honestly reccomend this to all you asipiring actors/writers/directors.
I'll also praise and mention at least once a week movies that I love, such as fight club, the matrix, amelie and other very good movies (my opinion of course)  This movie however I can honestly say was so bad I couldn't sit through it, the acting is nothing short of atrocious, the lines are terrible, the realism pathetic and the fact it "stole" the name from the original is actually insulting!

The link to the original is awful, I did however enjoy William Shattner's performance (I hope I spelled that correct) he was pretty funny and pretty goofy throughout.
The big twist, however, is very predictable and sends the film delving into the conspiracy and his memories of the little signs which were there but he, like us, initially missed.
The Charlie McCarthy bits were better suited for younger audiences, however, Charlie was no Howdy Doody.
Oddly, however, the acts are generally just awful and probably won't appeal overall to anyone!
Both movies are about young travelers getting into horrifying situations, however in "Wolf Creek" the characters actually act like normal human beings therefore you feel disgusted when they get tortured and killed.
DÃ©jÃ  Vu's best sequence, however, is the crazy car chase during the present in pursuit of a vehicle in the past, definitely a rush and orchestrated almost flawlessly.
I do not want to get into too much detail about this movie, as it does not deserve that much time, however I do want to say this; THIS MOVIE SUCKS!
I have never heard if this had any impact on the audience however.
I should've seen this coming however knowing full well going into this that this stinking pile came from the director of M.D.
My Bloody Valentine's re-make was far more entertaining however, and if you have to choose, go see that instead (especially if you're an old time like myself).
The new Jason, however, takes on some of the characteristicsÂnot surprisinglyÂof Leatherface from the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" franchise.
The director/writer of this film took ideas/concepts from other films and tried to put them together into a 'uniquely' drawn out story (with the always great 'twist' ending), however, the end product is a piece of garbage.
Mostly however the film serves as a sort of travelogue of the sights & sounds of the regions in which it was filmed, with ample trips to the local tavern for mugs of fine Austrian beer, performances by musicians playing traditional instruments, trips to the ornately magnificent churches and centuries old town halls, and lots of conversation scenes between the principal actors as they wander about the picturesque settings.
Their interest is, however, scientific, except for the legionnaire buddy who is more interested in gold statuettes accidentally getting lost in his greatcoat pockets (Having mentioned the legionnaire, I must say that I admire the courage of the scriptwriter, who reveals to us -for the very first time- that Egypt was at the time a French protectorate, and not, as we've been led to believe by the official history, associated to the British empire)  The bad guys stick to the old, slow, boring system of studying the terrain and excavating carefully according to old Ieroglyphs, while our hero and his friends discover the tomb the legendary grave by happily throwing dynamite sticks at random: a new path is opened thus for archeology.
This made-for-TV 'extravaganza' is clearly intended to cash in on the success of Raiders of the Lost Ark and the other Indiana Jones films; however it is but a very pale shadow.
Even after they are given room to act, however, they have to deal with such cheesy and dated lines as, "Are you out of your whim-whams?"
Mila however, I found to be simply terrible as Joan.
Faye Dunnaway was her marvelous self, however, and perhaps worth the price of a PPV.
I must say it was helpful to have her watching the movie with us (in our college dorm), however, because she explained a number of things about Japanese tax code and evasion as well as the Japanese mafia that made the plot (and politics) of the story much easier to follow.
I am one of Gwynneth's biggest fan, however this film was simply horrid on every level.
It is with bitter disappointment, however, that I must report that this flick is a piece of trash.
This is, however, the funniest film I have seen all year.
The Doctor was, however, just as abusive, dismissive, selfish and manipulative, not helping her, but in a different way, being maybe worse, since appearing to be what she wanted in a man.
however, the improvements are all purely superficial.
The whole thing adds up, however, to little more than an exercise in morbidity.
It however did make the audience feel better.
Beyond the topicality, however, the film is a failure on most other counts.
I thought I was going to puke during many scenes and lines that, however tamed down, were just quieter racial and sexual stereotyping, still echoing throughout America today, by either well meaning and mostly caucasian "moderate" liberals or conservatives.
Leonard Nemoy does give his voice talents, however "Mountrouds" voice is horribly annoying, especially after about an hour of watching the film.
This story however seen gets abandoned again early on into the movie, as if they ran out of good usable Peter Sellers archive footage.
It's also confusing to see some sequences that were obviously meant original for mainly "The Pink Panther Strikes Again" and "Revenge of the Pink Panther" incorporated into this movie as part of the story but however these different sequences obviously don't really connect with each other also because most of those sequences are basically the same, though less good, ones that got eventually used in those earlier mentioned movies.
Don Wilson stars as a cop who enjoys the occasional virtual reality fighting game, however things go wrong when the people behind the game decide to take virtual reality to a new level by making real people from the video game, okay actually they make the cybersex models as prototype but the main bad guy from the video game awakens and starts killing people and now the only man who can beat the guy is Don Wilson, who in the mean time falls in love with the cybersex model.
Reference is made to Leila's husband being employed in his family's business, however, not once does the viewer see the husband or any family member at work or mention one single aspect of their thriving business.

This film has its moments, having Hugh Grant with his English accent trying to learn how to talk like a mobster was very funny, however the rest of the movie was very predictable and could have been a made for TV movie instead of a feature movie.
A plus, however, is the film's wonderful poster art, faithfully reproduced on the new DVD cover and all old VHS's.
These do not come instantly however, it takes several rounds of dialog (and more sex) to start peeling off the layers of convention and get to the intimate truth, insecurity, intimacy of each one of the two characters.
The script writing however was mediocre and lacked elements of excitement.
The first film I saw from him was the eighth part, Hellworld, and I don't rate it too highly - however, it's certainly the best one he's done.
The good news stops there, however, as just like the rubbish seventh part; Hellseeker sees Rick Bota in dull mystery territory once again.
Blanca Lewin is, however, the one that steals the film, in my opinion.
Leslie Banks as Inspector Slade is, however, another matter.
The character, however, is idealized at the expense of presenting a figure as complex as the Claskys, especially as the story veers into the inevitable though not terribly credible attraction that develops between Flor and John.
This, however, is not the only refreshing aspect of this film.
If only the romance had been genuine, however, as both turn out to be crooks in their own way.
The plot, however, is so full of double crosses it's not worth the effort keeping everyone straight.

I gave it a four out of ten, because it had some funny scenes and I did enjoy some of the characters and performances; however, I did not like the story at all.
Prince attempt to save this work from being completely cliche with some reasonable performances, however the dynamic this script provides them is weak storytelling.
The story is a Hans Christian Anderson tale about a pauper girl who finds brief comfort in the matches she's trying to sell until the cold eventually wins and takes her life away--not before, however, she so escapes into her imagination to find comfort, warmth, and love.
It is, however, definitely obscene.
Personally I like a darker Gotham than most and I have imagined what an R-rated Batman movie might be like, however 'The Death of Batman' is unrewarding even in simply seeing it as a for-adults superhero story because all of its extremeness and shock value is all it has to offer.
Fans of TV's "Saturday Night Live" may never have guessed that one-time rivals Chase and Aykroyd would end up starring in a picture together, or that "Blues Brothers" filmmaker John Landis would be directing, however they may be the only audience for this type of slapstick silliness.
Alien itself was silly just like the whole of the movie was over the top however it fitted in well with the rest of the movie   If you like really cheesy movies, check this out others wise i don't recommender this movie to anyone else 3/10
Maury Povich (or however you spell his name) is a hypocrite because his show sends opposing messages to women.
The other way, is more painful, however.
Adrian's character, however, was utterly unlikeable.
This version however seems to have thrown both the novel and the 1960s movie out of the window and opted for a virtual re-write which adds nothing to the story and instead loses most of the subtlety of the book.
My humble expectations were not reached, however, since the film features hardly any sleaze and the gore is existent, but not to an extent that would make the movie worthwhile.

The list of equally as nasty sights and sounds just goes on and on from there I'm sorry to say these, however, were just some of the more shocking and severely stomach-churning things that viewers should probably be made aware of before watching as they are sure to horrify, if not psychologically scar you, depending on the fragility of your mental state at the time of viewing.
Other than that, however; this is one of the best horror sequels in a long time, and comes with the highest recommendation.
This movie was not intended to be comedical, (I don't think...) however, it proves to be funnier than any actual comedy.
Michael Madsen will always be a bad guy to me, however this was a fair try at another style.
Boring, however, it was not.
Now I have seen ALL of the Puppet Master movies and besides the first and third episodes the rest were pretty much crap.It's interesting however to see the Puppets start out as evil slayers for their master Andre Toulon, but then become more as heroes fighting evil in the 3rd & 4th movies.
She was, however, cast in a mediocre film but was still entertaining.
They show the city against the background of a early sunrise; however, there was no heavy columns of smoke that resulted from the French artillery shells exploding in the city There was also no sound of French airplanes and having them bomb and machine gun the Syrians' positions.

The film however has only one saving grace and that is the appearance of Chris Walken as the second in charge of a mob family.
The writing, however, is beyond bad.
I quite enjoyed the director's previous "the Dead Next Door" film, however this one is a stinker, and included way too much filler.
When all is said and done, however, writer/director Andre Turpin has presented little more than a rudderless narrative featuring a bunch of unlikable and uninteresting characters, characters whose patience for the boorish protagonist is nearly unaccountable.
Some of the former have an excuse however.
See this film, however, and consider the plight of the poor of Russia, stuck under the Tsar and the fat cats.
The movie was originally made for the Sci Fi channel and VHS copies were scarce and expensive to purchase, however you can pick them up on ebay from time to time.
Not that this matters, however, as halfway through the film, the writers decided that the story was no longer about the cult and just made it about this weird sexual relationship between a psychiatrist and his client.
In the absence of any such clear link, however, all we get is a bunch of sound and fury (oh, and LIGHTS, too!)
Some films are so bad that they actually end up being very entertaining; For Y'ur Height Only, however, strives to illicit laughs by deliberately being dreadful, but actually ends up being rather boring.
A harmless time filler, however, if you can catch it on TV.
The truth, however, is that it is not even worth to be rated as a "B" movie.
In "Cruel Jaws", however, the characters recite their lines like robots, and i'm actually surprised that this film actually has the nerve to call itself Jaws V. if this were Jaws 5, Jaws fans (myself included) would be so ashamed that Hollywood made a worse sequel than JTR.
For someone accused of lacking compassion, Susan is surprisingly forgiving of Slick, however.
Sometimes, however, the follow-ons can be a little disappointing when compared with the original, especially when the original is so brilliant.
The final massacre is so over-the-top, it's simultaneously appalling and laughable; the idea that someone would actually hold this viewpoint, however, is what's truly appalling here (although, not as laughable as believing that thousands of rounds fired by trained Guardsmen could only result in three deaths in a huge crowd).
The movie, however, just dumps you right in the middle of it and expects you to love all the characters instantly, which is especially hard for the main character who I think is a horrible person.
The movie, however, made it ENTIRELY sunshine and smiles, everyone was happy, everything was perfect.
It did, however, have a great overlying menace, set in a world where cutthroat corporate Gestapos kill to protect the technology they control.

They seemed pretty generic - however they did fit with the entire "stream lined bat-stuff" theme - they seemed a little too "a la Blade" - all that was missing was a sword.
In the end however, for any fan of the original anime/manga series it is a must see if for no other reason than to contribute to the ongoing littering of the internet with inane conversation threads ...  BTW, for an equally 'entertaining' fare, check out the "ThunderCats" trailer made by some fan-people (I think) that's floating around the internet.
The bloodshed amount is hefty, however.
Before the family's demise, however, the man of the house gives the valuable disk to his son, Nicky.
This remake, however, stands in pale (VERY pale) contrast in virtually any aspect one can think of.
As the boy Stone goes on the run with, and with whom she is supposed to bond with, Jean-Luke Figueroa isn't necessarily untalented, and in a better-made movie he might even be good; however, be it the dialogue or direction, he makes very little impact, a fact not helped by the lack of ANY chemistry between he and Stone.
Behind it all is Sidney Lumet, a once-talented director who has helmed a few masterpieces in his time; however, whatever muses guided him towards those masterpieces has, in the last decade or two, abandoned him, for here he is again, delivering yet another celluloid stillborn.

I found it amazing this movie was given any credibility (however underground it may be), as every aspect was entirely banal and seemingly ignored during production (note when a passing SUV passenger sticks his head out the window to look at the camera crew).
First of all I am sorry for my poor English, I just want to say that the moral of this movie is just wrong, I would say stupid, the wife betrays her husband and he "cuckold" forgives her easily... No way, this is not real, so what is the moral then, I could not understand, I like Ben Affleck and enjoyed some parts of the movie where he says about his family and his father, these parts are good and makes people to think, moreover the movie is full of funny stories, however, the main idea and subject is totally wrong and this movie may cause some wives to betray their husbands, thinking their husbands will forgive them?!

Their reactions, however, are different: while the black boy seems resigned to have joined the ranks of the undead (culminating in a predictable coda, down to the ironic closing line, as he sets out to 'infect' The Big Apple), the other resists Â especially after Ironside kidnaps his kid sister to be the blood donor in his initiation!
Its failing, however, was its failure to develop some plot lines to a conclusion.

Unfortunately they dump the cadavers into the nearest swamp (looks like a lake to me) & think the job is done, however these corpses were injected with Phillips re-animation serum &, surprise surprise, come back to life as rotting flesh eating zombies!
For a start the character's are awful, to call them one-dimensional & bland would be too kind, the dialogue is terrible as for some reason these people can't seem to string a proper sentence together, it's an absolute bore to sit through with a predictable & clichÃ©d 'plot' although I use the term plot very loosely, all the zombie attacks are virtually the same & end up with the human character's having a karate fight with them, however on the plus side Swamp Zombies might just be the best horror/zombie/martial arts film ever made, not that I can think of any others mind you.
One of the few scenes that I even remember is the scene involving the Delta Force doing a sky jump with the drug lord and the fact this film had a bit of a similar plot to the James Bond film "License to Kill", however that film is superior to this one as I can remember a lot about that one too.

In the end however this movie is probably best remained unseen.
Waste, waste...   You can sit through "Casa..." with the sound off and it won't make much difference -- this film was made to inspire awe for director Waddington and his excellent DP Ricardo della Rosa, who fail, however, to convey genuine emotion or maintain our interest throughout the (seemingly endless) 103 minutes.
The casual sexism, however, is a worthwhile reminder that by Sixties standards, the Bond films actually border on the progressive.
Amazingly, however, this film comes off almost as an Austin Powers film--and it's obvious that they inspired this later series.
Now I have seen ALL of the Puppet Master movies and besides the first and third episodes the rest were pretty much crap.It's interesting however to see the Puppets start out as evil slayers for their master Andre Toulon, but then become more as heroes fighting evil in the 3rd & 4th movies.
This however is no surprize, as a movie like this is not, nor should be watched for its indivuality.
This is a pretty good sequel for the most part that's quite entertaining, with fantastic performances, however it comes nowhere close to matching the original.
It's decently made and written, and it also leaves open the possibility of another sequel which I would love to see, however like the 1st the Werewolf effects Wern't that great.

Angelina Jolie, however, had won an academy award so that's where the money was.
Most of the film, however, is devoted to the vapid love life of Minnelli and York, and it is not very interesting.
All of this cheesy silliness, however, is not nearly enough to compensate for the movie's virtually plot less script, crap acting and torpid direction.

And many of the one-liners come off cheesy however there are a few lines that are funny.
A big problem I felt however was the lack of any real direction in the movie.

He doesn't simply haunt or murder those who have once done him wrong, however.
Louis Calhern, however, always was credible at the detestable villain, as he was here once again.

THIS CLAIM, however, IS A FACT.
Speaking almost entirely in emotional hyperbole, she regards herself as 'a strange and extraordinary person'... She takes Brian under her wing and one day introduces him to Helmut Griem, a rich, suave, divinely sexy baron with whom they both have affairs...   Everyone becomes part of her free world: an unseen father who is indifferent to her; and Marisa Berenson, a young serious Jewish department-store heiress who is feverishly courted by an opportunistic, a fortune hunter, called Fritz Wendel (Fritz Wepper)..  At first Sally's insulated life bears little relation to the events propelling Germany toward its bleak destiny... Gradually, however, the cabaret becomes more threatening; the Master of Ceremonies provides the historical and social themes throughout his songs.. (he and Sally sing 'Money makes the world go 'round').. Later he sings a stimulating 'Two Ladies' about the joys of a mÃ©nage Ã  trois..
That does not, however, excuse his lackluster performance and the stinted dialogue of the lead and pretty much all characters.

A mix of cheap effects (however original), and a very poor foundation make Rubber Johnny a complete bust.

He is highly respected in the film world however.
What we have, however, is a convoluted mess that tries too hard to be a social satire.
These are the kind of people who make the world a sh*tty place to live in: corrupt, lazy, lying, drinking-while-driving, gun-toting, dope-smoking, misogynistic, anti-intellectual, selfish, ignorant pieces of sh*t. These people corrupt the military, the police force, school-systems, essentially everything they touch, and yet I felt that these characters were being glorified throughout the whole film, except for towards the end when Bale goes nuts; however it is at this point that I felt Rodriguez stepped-up to being the hero.
it is, however, a good time waster.
however they occasionally use the F word.
This one however is just boring ideas from boring people.
The cinematography, however, is another matter.
The film also features a score from Vince DiCola responsible for two scores I loved in the 80's in Transformers and Rocky 4, however this is not 80's style and his score is mostly generic, aside from some moments that have the Vince pazzazz.
Over and above these flaws however is the damning fact that Lady Godiva is meaningless and unfunny from start to finish.
This however is an embarrassment to independent film makers everywhere, as though a bunch of drunk sixth formers had run amok with a camera.
This movie really just consists of a problem, there's a solution to this problem, however as a result of that solution another problem occurs, this is fine until about the 6th problem or so, and then you just get a headache.
There is however still some attraction in seeing it for its good looks and missed potential.
The first meeting, however, fails expectations.
By the end, however, I'd modified the thought in two ways: 1. the Pegg parody would have a beginning, a middle, and an end; action one could follow; and warmth, humor, and heart-- all of which "Sunshine" lacks in spades; and 2. the parody had already begun.
The special effects were pretty good, however Mark Frost's face...well, it's definitely one of the signs of the apocalypse.
I would not, however, classify it as one of those films you watch over and over.
); however, this occurs at a most inopportune time â as several monsters have been convened in order to crown him their overlord (a title which Frankenstein actually covets himself)!
Gator gets something else he hadn't counted on, however, when he falls for television reporter Aggie Maybank (Lauren Hutton).
The problem, however, is: this is about all the series has to offer.
What I got, however, was a rushed and complicated mess of scattered scene after scattered scene.
I also saw The End of Evangelion and loved it to death, and I think if I had seen The End of Evangelion before this I would have liked it more, however that does NOT change a thing.
Normally I wouldn't comment on an American soap opera however this just seems another example in a long line of mediocre work, which is just way overrated.
There are superlatives, however: the worst musical score everÂworst-ever wig for Marlon (runner-up: Rita Moreno)Âworst-ever ill-conceived kidnap plot and the list goes on.
This director knows how to ratchet up the suspense, to prod his audience into a state of near catatonia, however ultimately the effectiveness of both the story of the wolf in sheep's clothing and the quality of some of the film making becomes saturated in a need to demean and torture would be victims.
This, however, was just a disappointment, Positives of the movie: the two lead 'men in white' had their nicely eerie moments, and played their parts pretty damned well.
Some of the forth-wall breaking was very well done, however it just wasn't done enough.
The ending however, was even worse.
The writing, however, is about as amateurish as can be.
But then maybe people like it because it's simple, however I think they like it, or i I like it because it's so original and has never been done before, even Die Hard 2 and 3 they push the idea of films harder and further than before.
Dolittle and his family take a vacation to a cabin in the woods where the bear would be set free; however the bear begins to realize that the wilderness is not "his cup of tea", and wants to be back at the circus.
Vincent Denoffrio is abysmal (however is Oscar worthy compared to that thing playing his partner.
This movie however, was not fun to watch.
This film, however, centers around a woman feeling very for herself.
There is, however, some unintentional humor (though NOT worth watching the movie for-if the forthcoming description of the unintentional humor amuses you at all , just LEAVE IT AT THAT.
Maybe Fellini had had a great satisfaction in this tribute since the theme was his childhood obsession; however I found it extremely painful to hear and watch after thirty minutes.
This movie could however use an actor who really took the movie to that next level, but I'm sorry to say that no one even came close.
Devoted fans of the teenage-horror film genre may like it however, I wouldn't know.
Aside from these two point, however, this one is pretty much a washout.
It would not be fair to compare this movie to such classics, however it is fair to compare it to contemporary movies made with similar budgets and similar premises.
This, however, would still be excusable.
The most Franco like aspect of the film however is the jazzy score, which remarkably made the film a lot more tolerable for me.
In my opinion, a film starring Pauly Shore is going to be bad, however, while some of his films are good/bad (Encino Man), this is not one of them.
Shore however finds a way to make Jury Duty not only profitable, but quite comfortable.
It is obvious that this scene was written to showcase Pauly Shore's comedic talents, however, he makes noises and is loud and generally obnoxious and unfunny.
It's not a total flop, however.
This however is just lame.
I understand that this film is similar to Scary Movie, however Scary Movie has at least some funny parts, where as Epic Movie is just terrible.
I wasn't expecting much when I paid for my ticket to see this film, however this was the first time I actually considered leaving the theatre in the middle of a film because it was so bad.
Usually I cannot stand these types of movies however I found this tolerable.
For starters the plot begins with the final scene which is something I really find irritating, however, many good movies do that...Anyway, the whole movie centers around a crime which is investigated in a very pointless way and very little happens besides that, except for a few needless sex scenes...
I stress the word basic and not simple because simple things can be very beautiful and interesting, however, this movie has no depth, explores the drug world in a futile way and as a detective story it did not convince me.
The "gal reporter" character played by Lola Lane was, in part, writer Jerry Siegel's inspiration for Superman's Girl Friend, "Lois Lane"; however, Ms. Lane's later "Torchy Blane" characterization is a more accurate reference point.
This highly praised documentary however is a soulless, trivial and dull recounting of Mozarts life through quotes of his letters, interlaced with comments of experts.
This doesn't deter Sonny however who hatches up a scheme to go prospecting for gold so his Dad will have money to pay for his education at the institute.
This however could never ever hope to be held in the same regard as The Leprechaun, from the pitifully bad acting to the rubbish dummy it self the film fails in every quarter.
"Cutting Class," however, still receives a failing grade in my book when you think the movie couldn't get any more tedious, when it reverts to type and descends into typical slasher/haunted house movie territory in the third act.
Complications, however, occur when a thuggish land developer blackmails Jammer to sell his rink, so he can raze the building and build a shopping mall.
I enjoyed it immensely and hope others did to - wish they would write their comments - however - my only concern is - haven't seen it since mid 1950's - have never forgotten it.
The swordsman is however great.
Here however, the women used bolos and clubs to beat on the cave boys, so score one for Tigri and the girls.
The plot however is really bad!
This should be edge of the seat stuff and set up the entire picture, however Amigorena fails to engage the audience with flabby editing and too many close-up shots.
As unintentional comedy, however, it's pretty entertaining and might rate 5/10.
But however its not really true.
Patrick however, is a starfish like person that hangs around Spongebob a lot.
One major problem in the movie, however, was how unbalanced the film was in the portrayal of the families.
The film does do us one favour however... we ARE integral and we DO have morals.
I'm however left with the distinct feeling that he sacrificed the sharp edges of the book as to not alienate too many viewers.
If this had been the first film by the Quirozes I believe it would have been a good attempt, however, after more than ten films apiece the product is very poor.
I really tried to like this film - an excellent ensemble cast and technically well-shot, however the addition of the US scenes (credited as being shot in Kentucky) appeared to be stuck on simply to provide US 'appeal'.
The flow of the movie was pretty good, however; it had some random parts.
Overall the movie was decent however it isn't a number one blockbuster.
This movie is not considered a comedy; however, I don't think I stopped snickering the entire length of it.
The movie itself had the potential to become an endearing film such as "Out Break"; however the film fell real short of making the impression the subject matter should have had on its viewers.
Although I have said this film is dire, I would recommend it - it's so bad, it's entertaining, however not in the same league as Edward D. Wood Jnr.
With the story line, it could have been a great science fiction; however, the bad acting and the lack of development make this a below average film even for a science fiction.
The soundtrack, however, is more 1960s than 1980s, for reasons that are hard to fathom.
The only interesting part of this movie was the true story which inspired it, however, even that is lost in a never ending parade of cuts, fades and pointless scenes.
Bear in mind however, that the bulk of Americans were not involved in this... they worked, they played, they watched the news... and slowly they became effected by the efforts and struggles of the minorities... the Civil Rights workers, the Political Activists, the Anti-War efforts, the War on Poverty....
Some of these presentations are amusing; however, in my estimation, they don't possess the instructive value which the producers/directors seem to feel they portray.
Most episodes of Wife Swap are different, however.
They can't even be referred to as wooden, since the term "wooden actor" at least implies some ability, however dismal.
When she goes to meet him, however, he's kissing some other girl (the fool!
Some have called the film erotic, however the erotic whilst present, is as intangible as a passing cloud on a sunny day.
- In the novel, the shoes which play an important role in the story are black, not red, however Bertrand has a bit of an obsession with the colour red.
What's truly amazing, however, is that "Roots" is receiving a reverential tribute at all.
I can appreciate the premise of the movie, however, and this is one I know some disagree with me on.
I would, however, warn you to keep you expectation low, and not to be too surprised if it fails to live up to them.
The flash-backs, however, were just annoying, and the visuals lacked in creativity.
What Poirot learns however is of a far greater deception that will alter everyone's perception of what they believe to their reality."
We must remember however that the film-makers are aiming to 'make the stories more relevant and accessible to a modern audience' and I suppose that that must explain everything?!?
This movie however is just extremely sad.
A lot of the other cannibal flicks hailing from Italy (and elsewhere) aren't masterpieces, however and this is certainly the case with The Green Inferno a.k.a.
This, however, leaves you watching a movie with people rowing down the river, laughing, in no real danger (for the most part), strutting in Amazonia with the most clichÃ©d plot and events.
for a couple of seconds thinking 'oh god this movie just hit the absolute pinnacle of stupidity' however soon I realized that it was just a twist like ending.
Thats the part I meant was pinnacle of stupidity, however straight after that you discover its the protagonist with a wig, that caught me off, perhaps i was laughing too hard to notice?
This, however, is a story that takes itself seriously.
This however is a sad excuse for a film.
There were a few twists very few however which helped but not enough at all.
You can only keep pummeling a series so much, however, without revolt.
it was ,however, extremely disappointing because after all those years of grueling training montages and hard work, Rocko loses all of his money because of Paulie's ridiculous gambling habits.
Her acting was so-so, however.
The show's decline, however, became even more pronounced in the last seasons.
To its credit however, the story-line stays reasonably faithful to the novel, except for Professor Dufosse and his daughter.
In this version, however, the lighting is ridiculously bright, to the point that one feels as if one is watching an amateurish pantomime.
What came across, however, was that only African American women are in prisons (the very few white women seen, had non-speaking roles and were just blurry extras in the background).
I really liked how this movie started as it looked like it was going to have shades of Halloween with the directors own little twist added however the movie, which starts off slow builds up for about a good 10 minute killing spree (nearly 50 minutes in, ZZZZZZZZZZ)then the movie veers off into weirdness as it turns from a satanic killer from the grave movie to an all out zombie film..thats right an all out zombie film.
My score for Cemetery of Terror: 4/10: Below Average, with alittle more thought about what kind of movie they wanted, Satanic Killer, Zombie, or Scooby Doo(mainly do to the kiddie sequences) flick this could have at least been mildly entertaining however, since the movie bounced all over the place I cannot recommend this as a have to see film, maybe a rental at best.
There is, however, a certain production value to WITCHTRAP.
Be warned, however: The pacing is uncommonly deliberate, the level of erotica (simulated this time) is very high and very potent, and the violence - which isn't paraded throughout the narrative - is jarring and disturbing.
The film, however, was much better portraying the emotional connections between the two main characters which is quite an achievement considering WALL-E was a garbage disposal unit who apparently developed over a long period of time a more than human heart (think of your feelings for roaches).
The action and actors were good, however the movie was not put together well.
The acting, however, is misdirected.
while i didn't mind the original The Shaggy Dog(1959),i thought this sequel was not too good.i found it way too silly and absurd,and not realistic.by that,i'm not talking about the premise,a man transforms into a dog.that i can accept as being within the confines of the movie.what i found unrealistic was how most of the characters acted and or reacted.too say there was some overacting going on would be a massive understatement.i also didn't find the characters endearing.i did however find them annoying.and the acting in general was unimpressive.and i found the ending abrupt with no real resolution.i'd say this would be a good family movie,a family comprised of only 3 year olds.maybe they ran out of money or time.whatever.this film had none of the fun or charm of the original.for me,The Shaggy D.A.is a weak 3/10
Unlike Dead Boyz Can't Fly, however, I know when to leave well enough alone.
I however like the comparison with the Saddam era Abu Gharib and the American Abu Gharaib.
I have to admit, I agree with most of the complaints about "Butt Ugly Martians;" however, I feel it did have one redeeming quality about it and that item was Robert Stack as the voice of Stoat Muldoon, Alien Hunter.
The characters were the lamest group of needy individuals however as a man, I was at first intrigued by the lesbians, but even lost interest in them within the first 3 minutes or so.
So I may be giving this movie a low score now, however, in the future I may give it a higher score or rewrite this review in order to incorporate more of the story in the review.
Unfortunately however, the script is full of holes, too predictable and the total lack of spectacle is pretty hard to forgive.
What is more interesting however, is how suspiciously similar this film is in terms of plot and style/construction to the soon-after 'The Nesting' - in that it misses most of its most crucial horror 'cues', but nevertheless burns independently down its own vaguely self-stylised 'fuse' to an incoherent, unsatisfying 'explanatory' climax.
There were two good actors in the film however, Barry Flatman (Saw 2 & Saw 3) and Mimi Rogers (Mrs Kensington in Austion Powers), made very good and entertaining performances as the parents of Sebastian and Katherine and are the only reason why I rated the film as a 2, not a 1.
I like, but I am not a great fan of western movies; however, "Dodge City" is a great entertainment.
What I can tell you, however, is that this film features some pretty mad scenes that should please those who enjoy crazy Asian martial arts cinema: Mo Kei's father commits suicide by making his own heart explode from his chest; Mo Kei learns magical kung fu from a monk who is embedded in a huge, rotating, flying boulder; horses are skewered by drills that emerge from under the ground; there is a subterranean battle that results in severed body parts being strewn everywhere; and some of the characters battle with what looks like fire-extinguishers hidden up their sleeves!!
In Rocketman, however, he has allowed himself to be reduced to sophomoric antics worthy of any SNL reject (and I say that with all due respect) and appears to belong in a Rob Schneider movie.
Kate Winslet however turns in her usual striking performance.
It shows that even a superstar like Errol Flynn didn't hatch from the egg fully formed, and that however bad you are to start with, there's still hope ...
After viewing however, I can only see it as a waste of time, because the only character it introduced was Greyback, but you never heard of him again through the entire movie until the very end--in which he did nothing.
What I COULD find however was: The burning down of the burrow...?!?
The Burrow burns down during x-mas break due to Bellatrix and Fenrir (who is never described as a werewolf) perhaps for the lack of action at the end of the movie...the Dursleys are completely cut from the movie, meaning when Dumbledore picks Harry up for the summer it's at the train station for some apparent reason...The Ginny/Dean/Harry dichotomy is skewed, there was no break up between Ginny and Dean and Harry is clearly in love with her from the start of the movie which eliminates his confusion on his feelings during the school year...Hermoine prematurely spills the beans on her feelings for Ron which was only speculation in the novels...Lavender Brown becomes a obsessive and crazed girlfriend rather than simply over-affectionate (a reminiscent Unis from She's the Man)...the battle scene is missing from the end giving Dumbledore's death an anticlimactic feel making it all the more unemotional and disappointing...Harry hides under the floor simply holding his wand looking like a coward while Dumbledore dies, Snape sees him hiding rather than Harry being frozen under his cloak compliments of Dumbledore ...There is no funeral or break up with Ginny at the end of it (there is no relationship between the two either simply a kiss)...Hagrid is basically deleted from the movie as is Neville...Pensive trips are deleted and the Horocruxes are never explained, not even slightly...Luna finds Harry on the Hogwarts Express rather than Tonks...The Slug Club simply makes a cameo rather than a proper introduction and explanation...the Inferi look more like skeletons compared to the white bodies described in the book...I'm sure more discrepancies are present, however I can only remember so many of them.
Eurotrip however disappointed me within this genre.
BUT I have to say that cameos raise the overall value: Vinnie Jones is simply a genius, as always, and Rade Sebredja (or however it's supposed to be written, hope you will excuse me) shines briefly and brightly.
Caffaro, for the umpteenth time, however is tied naked to a table.
Sutherland however, is a total embarrassment in his part.
The acting is mediocre at best and poor in general.Do look for a young Denver Pyle as the sheriff, however.
Wow, this movie wasn't great, I'm a huge fan of Paul Gross, and I must say, it looks like he tried, but there wasn't much point in wasting energy, however, if you enjoy laughing at movies that have completely missed the mark, (and seeing some excellent shots of Paul Gross)then this movie is good, however, if you are looking for an excellent adaptation of the book, I strongly recommend looking elsewhere.
Although the movie is laughable at best, there are some very pretty ocean scenery shots, however, the shots are a bit close up for window views which is what they seem to be used as a lot.
The biggest disappointment however in this film is the non existent fight with the giant squid, instead you get some sort of alien that gets defeated in a very silly way.
I did, however, enjoy an unwittingly (?)
Mad Foxes is just as ridiculous as it's meant to be and then some...however, while I enjoy a good silly flick, the inconstancies and illogical nature of the film don't help it as the plot doesn't move well at all, and the film gets confusing too often, which isn't good when the plot is as simple as the one here.
I don't know if anyone ever bothered to watch the deleted scenes of Bruce Almighty but there are a few scenes in which Jim Carrey was given some props and told to do Jim Carrey-like things, shameless and uninspired directing which thankfully didn't make it in to what was an averagely fun movie, however Brad Silberling must've, as this film was one long series of bad set pieces designed to make Will Ferrell do Will Ferrell-like things and the terrible bits made the finished film rather than the extra features of the DVD.
The real heroes in this story, however, are the "boys," with excellent performances given by Robert Gant (Scott), Chad Allen (Mark), and Robert Baker (Lester).
Why you and Megumi can't ever seem to make a film worthy of your combined talents, however, is very hard to comprehend.
Mischievous Jerry, however, is determined to scupper Tom's plans.
I realize this show is a reality joke that is meant to be funny... however what bothers me is that Kenny cheats in every competition.
L for me, was an interesting character, however, I was very skeptic to how this movie could possibly work, since a super-weird character like him usually only work in smaller roles, and the mysteriousness was the underlying charm of L in those two movies.
Sadly, however, much the use of English throughout the film is reminiscent of the Heisei Godzilla series in its grating inanity.
'Underworlds', however, are a staple of horror movies; backing this one up with the obscure work of an early 20th century sci-fi writer doesn't make it any more exciting or screen-worthy.
The story, however, was full of hackneyed elements (the jaded Lt. who won't trust the new guy, the platoon full of chip-on-the-shoulder vets, the new guy who earns the platoon's respect through his grit...and on and on).
The characters themselves were dull and stupid, and it was the story however that dragged ever so slowly and became mind-numbingly daft.
Jess Franco seemed to enjoy making them, however, as this trash makes up a large proportion of his filmography; and women in prison flicks are probably one of the main reasons why a lot of people's overall impression of the prolific director is not good.
This is not really a benefit or a hindrance, however, as 99 Women is just as boring as most of these films anyway.
This does, however, not legitimate anybody to put such dung onto DVD.
Segal is no Newman however and it's obvious that Redford is very much the main man here, but other than giving us his preferred profile, he's rarely exercised in a film that looks as if it was more fun to be in than to watch.
Here however he's coasting in a flaccid movie that does little for the reputations of cast and crew.
The ending however is what really turns Hangman into a bad joke and a waste of time for the public.
The two get caught, however, but the girl escapes into the island jungle and finds rescue in the arms of a lone snake farmer (what an awesome profession that must be) and together they attempt to stop the illegal dumping.
No excuses can be given for Dorfman himself, however, who is absolutely terrible here.
Save your money... it would have been a better flick if more answers had been given about samora or however you spell her name.. OK i'm trying to fill up space since i Must write a minimum of 10 lines of text.. the only good thing about the movie was i liked the view of the harbor from her house.. and the faces of the dead people reminded me of the movie Scream for goodness sakes.. there really was no suspense.. everything was predictable.. as i said sequels are rarely good.. i'm sure i'm making a mess on this review.. i just had to say why i gave it a rating of 1.
The jellyfish is perfect and hasn't needed to evolve since the seas were first poured out, the hapless bears, however, have come to rely on the ice that us selfish humans are now using to chill our Budweiser.
The only value this film might have is to use to interrogate members of Al Qaeda, however Amnesty International would be all over the President's butt if they ever did anything that cruel and inhuman!
If you and a few buddies want some gut-wrenching laughs, however, or you're just a big fan of bad movies, I would highly recommend this movie and all its hilarity.
This film however, left me aghast.
His relationship with his wealthy family could have been interesting, however, we only see them in the briefest of scenes, and are not even sure who his father is until the final line of that scene when he calls a man "dad".
German MTV has managed to go one "better", however.
This turned out to be almost laughable however.
Once you've seen the film's 139 minutes however, you sit back with a feeling of having seen it all before.
This movie showed some potential with time travel and mysterious memory loss, however the plot never really unfolds and the hospital suspense scenes feel totally forced and bland.
If it was called something else however, it would not have made half as much money.
The change has really only been made so that they can have a sequel to be perfectly honest, however, it does mean that the series is able to introduce the evil Reverend Kane.
One of the biggest overall problems with the film, however, is pacing.
Since it was a few months ago, however, (and I don't plan to watch it ever again,) I shall conclude my ramblings with the recommendation that you go and watch this, as a spectacular example of how *not* to make a CG film.
And sometimes one gets the feeling, however small, that the plot took a back seat to this.
The biggest achievement however is the superb direction that provides us some wonderful shots and gives a lesson in tension build up and suspense.
Then he meets Firmin Carter (Jared Harris), a hopeless alcoholic with one up on Lionel, however, inasmuch as he is wealthy, which means that when he hits the floor, at least it's the best that money can buy.
Lionel demurs, however, as in the sober light of day it all just seems too ludicrous.
I've seen this movie compared to Donnie Darko several times, most recently in another comment here on IMDb, however, they're nothing alike.
What I didn't expect, however, was such an intentional and hideous distortion of character of the story's protagonist, Rodya Raskolnikov.
If you don't watch it, it wont be a loss as this story has nothing to do with starship troopers 1 (apart from the war, however there are no other consistencies).
Indeed there have been attempts with films such as Dil Se, however I have not been impressed with the execution of a potentially good film idea.
While Rogers is lauded for this performance, it is a complex character but the actress interpretation is shallow and so pulled back that it makes for an uneven and superficial read, however, I think this is more the fault of the director than the actress.
On arrival however, they find the place deserted and a lot of dead bodies - and the remaining former inhabitants turned into mindless painted killers.
The movie is excellent however.
We all know why he won Best Actor, however I felt his performance here was more superior in this movie rather than in Lagaan.
"72m" even employs some citations from Das Boot which means that somebody from the film crew has seen that film:)) - however, ineffectively.
Applause however is raw, uncultivated Mamoulian, fresh from the stage and wowed by movie-making gadgetry.
In the 1930s, Lillie was a huge star in Broadway musicals ... however, it's notable that she only starred in revues: shows with songs and skits but no plot.
With the numerous precedents for killing US leaders, the premise, however shocking, sets up what could be a cornucopia of possibilities.
In DCH, however, the people talk like how they're supposed to talk, and nothing seems unrealistic about their personality.
Newly-skinny young man returns to his parents' home after a ten-year absence to attend his sister's wedding (to a man he has always harbored a crush on); relationships in the household are sketchy, however, as the man remembers his childhood as an overweight kid who once attempted suicide (and was apparently rescued).
Homer Simpson once said "It's funny 'cause it's true" and The Daily Show proves this every night; War, Inc. however proves that just because it's true doesn't make it funny.
Whatever your heroes wear, however they cut their hair, right down to the way they interact has to be believable.
To say this movie sucks misses the point, however, that what we are seeing in the 78 minute English print is NOT the movie that was originally made in 1976.
A bit more research, however, reveals some interesting information: "Dracula & Son" is in fact Christopher Lee's final performance as Count Dracula to date.
One of the only redeeming scenes was the "Alein Autopsy" scenes, the black and white with grain texture was by far the biggest expense to the budget; however, this scene is also has some of the worst alien acting in the movie.
They have a magical time together (as is shown in one of the worst special effect scenes ever) but soon, Trumpy is accused of murder, (oh, right, the pod people like to kill humans by touching them on the head) and the kid leaves Trumpy in the middle of the forrest...THE END...even the credits were really awful  I would recommend this science fiction thriller however, to everyone!
The plan goes badly, however; Mrs. Pollifax is handcuffed to Darren McGavin, then kidnapped by Communists.
Don't be fooled into thinking the movie is about a lady James Bond, however.
This movie however, was just a total waste of time, I couldn't possibly say anything good about it.
The problem with "I'll Cry Tomorrow," however, is its indulgence in its storyline.
The plot, however, is not focused on any segment of Roth's life nor any aspect -- just her alcoholism.
If, however, you are someone who spends their free time pretending to be a master or Gorean, and have somehow gotten the idea that you have any reason to speak, then this movie is perfect for you.
The timing should be quite different however the canned laughter track is timed for a sitcom not for a comedy show and thus makes all of the comedy fall totally flat.
Jigsaw delivers a lot of verbal shots, however heavy-handed, at the reactionary forces.
The film is laid out like a comic strip, however, this wanes quickly when there is no need for it when it starts to become over used.
This film, however, was a complete waste of time and I cannot believe that CLAMP actually agreed on summing up the immense plot of the comic books in to one film that is not even two hours long.
There are positives however, one being the creepy Gothic animation which apart from being utterly unique in my experience lends itself to a creation of a sinister and severely dark overtone inevitably benefiting the film.The notion of the opposing forces of "good" and "different good" (I hesitate from saying 'evil') using the connotations of dragons, i.e.
Things I liked  It was good to see some full Jedi in action not just a half trained Luke Skywalker  Darth Maul was cool but criminally underused  The light sabre duel at the end was awsome, however I do have a problem about the two Jedi ganging up on Maul it does not seem very noble  The planet effects were breath taking  Things I didn,t like  Wooden actors no emotion at all  Poor story  Special effects should be reserved for planet shots and space shots.They simply do not work on characters.Jar Jar and co looked like cartoon characters with no depth or weight to them at all.
The doctor hardly talks accept the usual clichÃ© psychotherapist babble - how does that make you feel, do you want to talk more about that, this show is like real life in a doctors room, boring repetitive slow, the dialogue is immense however nonsensical in every way, nothing sticks in my head after all the talking is done it's plainly a snooze fest.
To top the already boring & too much hyped characterization, however dense, don't be surprised when the gay character tearfully reveals that he's been in love with the unhappily married guy for the longest time.
It fails, however, as a noirish crime drama.
One of the many stories involves an Egyptian aristocrat who picks up young English soldiers and kills them, one of them however invokes his pity and he ends up falling in love with him.
"State Fair," however, presents simply a small love story.
- however, judging by the absurd split-second flashes to the body on the morgue slab every once in a while, the film-makers apparently thought the audiences constantly needed to be reminded of this novelty!
And any film with Joyce Compton as the second lead (however madcap she is ) you know is not going to be a grade A production.
The script bears little resemblance to the real lives of the two comedians (Costello's daughter in particular was so incensed by this movie that she wrote her own book to refute it and the book it was based on); however, even if it was 100% accurate and Costello actually was the ogre the movie paints him to be, the horrendous miscasting of Buddy Hackett and Harvey Korman destroys whatever possibilities the movie might have had.
Thompson, however, crashes his private plane carrying them in a storm onto a tiny island near Sardinia.
It's nice to watch a clean movie, however some brain cell lossage might occur while watching this film.

Owen Wilson has created some entertaining movies, however this certainly is not one of them.
One thing Hutch likes about Starsky, however, is his souped-up, red Ford Grand Torino in which they careen recklessly around the streets of Bay City.
I'm sure the people that made this had a ball filming this, however It's most likely going to be a painful experience for everyone else, and the ending is terrible as well, as it made no sense, plus It was really hard to pay attention because it was so bad, and incredibly dull.
When their plane lands in New York, however, it's as if the wheels touching the runway triggers something in the cosmos alerting Murphy (whoever he is), who instantly puts his `Law' into effect.

It IS fun, however, to experience it from the comfort of your own living room.
The startling ending (a pair of loin-clothed young children are tastefully shown) would have worked; however, the preceding 90 minutes don't lead you there.
I'm a big fan of "so-bad-they're good" movies, since they are at least enjoyable on the level of invoking laughter from the unintentional humor; however, this one does not even achieve enjoyable camp status.
Even their best salvos might not have saved it, however.
At the end of the movie, she isn't noticeably anything, which would be great if it were a part of the character, however, it didn't change from the beginning of the movie.
The falling action of the monologue was very well done, however.
Gwen, however, retains her sense of moral rectitude and pauses to care for a lost boy in Central Park.
It is however fairly lengthy for a propaganda movie and it's not as ridiculous as I expected.
however what is more worrying, is that this recipe has been used to cook up that world famous jack 24 hour bauer story, that makes you wanna move to the country or beyond!
Renegades is set in Philadelphia where detective Buster McHenry (Kiefer Sutherland) is working undercover to try & bring down a dirty cop by arranging a robbery to steal six million dollars worth of diamonds, however things don't go to plan & the dirty cop doesn't show up & instead McHenry is forced to go through with the armed robbery with local mobster Marino (Robert Knepper) & his men.
The mean-spiritedness of the picture is extremely tough to shake off however, and action-fans won't get much satisfaction until the bullet-ridden finale.
A nice trend to watch : the hero never thinks of a good weapon to fight the cyborg (makes you wait for the teapot or the shoelace), however, the villain can strike from good distance using a hub cap like a deadly Frisbee.
They describe this movie as a black comedy about a stand-up comic trying to make it as a comic just like his dad did so successfully, however he fails miserably.
The movie has no idea that's the case, however.
It doesn't work, however, as "The Legacy" is an insufferable boring and predictable thriller.
Really not a lot of horror going on in this one, however from what I see of other reviews this was just supposed to be a horror remake of a crime classic and it shows.
To do so successfully, however, takes a defter hand than is evident here.
There are some positives, however.
The action in this movie, however, could not compensate for the terrible story and terrible acting.
The villagers are not unarmed, however.
It is, however, exactly the sort of thing that I imagine Zeus likes in his acquaintances.
I would, however, advise people to see HE KNOWS YOU'RE ALONE because I believe the director did a much better job on this earlier effort.
I have watched all "24" episodes to date and have enjoyed them, however that being said let me continue with the reasons this show has overstayed is appeal and gone the route of The X-Files and similarly "thrown together for ad revenue" shows.
This however is not one of them.
Draven) & Jayne (Allison Lange) decide they want to take their friendship to the next level & start dating, however local jock, bully & tough guy Darren (Cameron Zeidler) isn't happy about the nerdish hippie Will dating the hot Jayne & starts to make trouble.
History is the casualty in most, however, as is the enjoyment level and consciousness.
Any criticism, however, can be dismissed by the movie's handful of fans with derisive rolling of the eyes.
It becomes annoying; however, the music sound track is very good.
The real star of the show, however, is art director Seamus Flannery (REPULSION, THE WICKER MAN, FLY AWAY HOME), who works miracles on a microscopic budget, from the vivid colors of Gabor's boudoir to the war-ravaged landscape of No Man's Land and the main square of an occupied French village.
As soon as Leonardo diCaprio is forced to play someone spiralling into a nightmare of addiction, however, everything goes downhill.
The facts of the JFK case, however, point straight at Lee Harvey Oswald as the lone killer and only at Oswald.
I didn't expect much , however, as the plot synopsis on the back made this film sound similar to the Adam Sandler flop "Overboard".
"Rubberface", however, is 1000 times worse!
The men however are all dogs, between the lusting in his heart Hunter, the weakling Fonda, the tyrannical Crisp, even the reporter who tries to blackmail Davis, Hugh O'Connell.
The ending, however, is pretty good and totally unexpected.
The rest of this movie, however, is entirely forgettable and I can't recommend it.
I rented this really wanting to enjoy this film, i like this genre,i think it had some strong actors,however i was disappointed it seemed forced it reminded me of "garden state" another painful film...
I would however be interested in viewing some other movies by this director if anyone knows of anymore of his movies.
What happens towards the end, however Â with the belated "in costume" appearance of the raspy-voiced doc suddenly hard at work on transplanting the brain of his caged gorilla with that of Knowles?!
You could argue for days about why this film is scary; the acting is mediocre at best, the scenes can be confusing and the resolution isn't exactly spectacular--however, this movie gets under your skin!
There was indeed some good acting, however.
Andre Braugher, however, was a little too over the top in his militarism, and became less than believable.
It had a strong storyline, good characters, however after 4 years the writers ruined the show with cheap ideas and ripped off story lines.
This show was so sad, however it really upset me because it was "ripped from the headlines" and at the time, the headline it was ripped from was my school.
Iron Eagle II was as ridiculous as it's predecessor however the edge of the first one and the overall amusing teenage vengeance angle is in favor dropped in favor of your basic military mission that for the most part is watchable if not too interesting.
Things go poorly, however, and Lemmon's boat is destroyed.
It basically teaches kids that you can act however you want if you think your mom and dad don't pay enough attention and cook like crap, and that even if you are perfectly well off it is fine to break the law for petty cash.
Walker is able to prevent his henchmen from being toasted, however.
The first Ninja Turtle movie was a classic; the first sequel however was okay but tried to hard to be family-friendly.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III however didn't belong to be in the theaters or be watched since it lost all the darkness of the original and concentrated on cuteness and having children involved.
Coscarelli does not rely solely on gripping horror, however, as there are many humorous scenes throughout the film.
My favorite moment in the film however is with the Baer brothers, Max and Buddy, both of them having fought Joe Louis and coming out on the short end, in Buddy's case twice, falling out and starting to fight as Max says he'll hit Buddy harder than Joe Louis ever did.
Girls was also overlooked, however, and Dick earned its reputation as "the last decent Carry On movie".
Overall, however, the storytelling is inept.
Like everyone that has reviewed this film before me, I am going to sing it's praises, however, unlike those before me, I'm not quite sure why.
For one thing, the cast is inadequate, I never heard of David Keith and Litefoot (David Coogan, however, was in Around the World in 80 Days).
The result however isn't much good, since it makes the movie unnecessarily difficult to follow, especially toward the end, when twists and false twists follow each other rapidly.
I would NOT, however, care to see them again if that means watching the whole damn movie - it was THAT bad.
It was better, however, I gave a Halo a rating of .00001 out of 1000.
I love Daft Punk, and I really liked the last burning scene, however, it was totally a rip off.
She had the remote, however, and during commercials kept changing channels.
Christopher Reeve, however, is excellent as always, and Annette O'Toole is a good fit for the part of Lana Lang; interestingly, she portrayed Clark's mother, Martha Kent, on the hit Superman TV series SMALLVILLE.
I will say, however, that it is a fun movie to watch if you need something to make fun of.
I'm not going to tell people to stay away from this film, however.
This time, however, the movie is a bit different, as the extras are all Korean AND their command of English is amazingly bad--so bad that it's rather funny to hear some of them stumble over even the simplest words.
Sadly, however, as the movie progresses, you learn that the cheap sets and guy in the gorilla suit and Koreans who can't speak English are the BEST aspects of the film!!
It is however, an adequate film for those who want to get high and laugh at how awful this film is.
I do however suggest that u rent this film or even buy it if u want 2 watch a comedy.
This movie is not going to be on anybody's Christmas list, however, it is hysterical and very very light.
So you are tempted to read it again to see what you must have missed, however, you don't, because you come to your senses and don't want to waste your time.
Since it's carnival time in Brazil, however, the mood picks up and so does the sex as Rae Down Chong leads a parade of naked women.
For Claude Chabrol and Isabelle Huppert, however, this probably could be named the funnest movie ever made in between them.
* The various scenes of the simultaneous separate stories seem to be edited by throwing a hundred randomly selected pieces of film in the air and putting them together however they landed.
Lou, a dubiously celebrated archaeologist (with an ever-present flask), carried off the role with aplomb and MUCH overacting, and was probably actually drinking during the production...I dearly love Lou, but I could NOT stop laughing at his performance here...and the guy who was the sidekick on "Home Improvement" and the face of Orchard Supply there for a while, (yeah, the cute bear) was humorous enough...however, the most interesting part of his performance, HANDS DOWN, is that the very last time the audience sees him, he is having a "spasm' or "seizure" of sorts, presumably from a curse and his last words were "I gotta get some fresh air!!!"
"Supersonic Man" however is a work that makes "Killer Crocodile" look like a masterpiece.
The ending however made me smile because I was into the good main character.
If, however, like me you like your stories to have a purpose & actually tell an entertaining tale then Ring Around the Redhead isn't for you at all.
Zeus, however is adamant that Hercules remain on Mt.
Had the film been made thirty years later Pretzies main customers would undoubtedly have been Madonna and Angelina Jolie, however this was not the case, and some poignancy is distracted from Pretzie's plight as a result.
One expects a predictable plot in a typical exploit-what-a-demographic-likes- and-take-it-to-the-bank Hollywood puke, however, this film will be a shameless assault on your sanity.
Beesley's documentary, however, is satisfied with gritty, hand-held 16mm footage of (usually) Coyne pontificating.
Sorry however to the the other reviewer but I have to correct you about the repeating crossbow.
I'm from the south, I'm totally aware of "Southern Humor", however "YOU MIGHT BE A REDNECK IF ______" jokes are not funny.
"Dead Calm", however, works as a thriller because it emphasises tension over actual violence and gives us characters, particularly the young woman played by Nicole Kidman, whom we can care about and with whom we can identify.
the film actually had an interesting start -3 young woman on a girls holiday meets a group of lads on holiday in a rented boat, drinks, drugs, flirting and banter... at this point you are still awaiting the film to really kick in, however up until this point, the film is still more than just watchable, which i thought had potential to continue in its tracks... suddenly, the whole film changes direction, they 'lose the plot' so to speak.. after a perfectly filmed porno styled orgy scene where the infamous DONKEY PUNCH DEATH occurs and the the carnage begins... words cannot explain how unrealistic the rest of the film plays out.. completely idiotic unbelievable murderous acts coming at you like flock of seagulls until all but the 'good girl' is left.. it was laughable.
Somehow, however, I'd missed Body and Soul all these years.
The story and film, however, are still top notch and stand the test of time, in my opinion.
Six weeks later, Carter buys a ship trip to her from Plymouth to New York; however, Sara decides to visit St. Giles by train before returning to her country.
Sadly however, excellent support playing, and beautiful location shooting are just not enough to save this overwrought turkey.
The worst thing about this film however was the pathetic attempts by the Coca Cola company to inveigle itself via a series of WAY TOO visible product placements.
Jackson's performance in "Rules of Engagement" is not the only thing that's old, however.
For the most part, however, "Rules of Engagement" is what most people find annoying about big-production Hollywood dramas - big name actors, but overwhelming predictibility.
An oft-overlooked strong point of the movie, however, is the cinematography.
At first it feels, albeit unpleasant, at least informative; however, as the film wears on, it becomes even more unpleasant, loses its informative nature, and begins to feel distinctly exploitative in tone.
A bore to watch however it is a movie that makes you appreciate the half good movies out there.
The worst of it, however, was the music.
I thought this was a weak story, however there were some enjoyable characters and the plot is classic...loner loser geek gets revenge on all those who have harmed him...we have all fantasized about that kind of thing.
It's still an effective movie, however.
The last fight sequence, however, is handled particularly well.
He, however, I couldn't see one instance where Murphy was trying to be funny.
This could have been it, however the director went for a 3 Stooges approach instead of a much grittier and darker 48 Hours.
I watched it hoping there was going to be a lot of good quality, wholesome American nudity, however there ended up being nothing remotely redeeming about the film.
The Raymond Chandler plot is as good as you might expect, and I allowed myself to accept the gimmick; however, the acting is worse than I have ever seen in any A-movie of the studio system.
That, however, was a huge mistake.
Not much to rave about from King, Judge, and Moreland, however Criner steals the show as the Oxford educated tribal chief, unfortunately he's only in the last 10 minutes of the movie.
I did, however, go with some people who were: They liked it even less than me.
POSSESSED however is a bunch a parts that don't fit & the result is substandard cable fodder
It did have a couple of cool flashback moments, and Christine Moore is easy on the eyes, however, I was struggling to pay attention, since nothing happens!.I got this on a 8 horror movie 2 disc set.
Christine Moore, does good with the lousy script, however she had her off moments, still i liked her, plus she's gorgeous!,but her chemistry with, Gary Warner is off.
Unfortunately, however, MaGregor's estranged family just planned a surprise visit to the island at the exact same time.
Cruise doesn't act so much as he does strut, however this swagger doesn't help him much in the love-department as he is partnered with Kelly McGillis, playing a leggy, brainy instructor (she's too leggy and brainy for Tom, and seems far out of his league).
The movie struck a nerve with both men and women eager to indulge in the over-scaled presentation and cocky contrivances, however today it opens itself up to parody.
I did like the leader of the pot club, however.
All in all a big disappointment, mainly due to bad directing and bad script writing and a sad end to what has otherwise been a great acting career for Irene Dunne, however this movie might appeal to children 8 to 14 on a rainy Sunday afternoon, mainly for the silly slapstick humor and uncomplicated story line which might be more appealing to this age groupÂ
Fans of the band probably won't care, though, as they seem willing to venture however far off the beaten path Wayne and the boys want to go.
Christina Applegate and Lela Rochon make a good looking female supporting cast, one of the few truly good performances however, is delivered by the beautiful China Chow, who plays the daughter of a rich Japanese businessman in the female lead.
The film however attempts to win over male audiences by exploitively dressing its crime-fighting heroines in skimpy Catholic school girl uniforms, but is so overtly uberfeminist and estrogen-charged that it not only alienates but probably offends a great deal of its target audience.
The idea behind it was very funny, and it was a well directed film, however most of it, left me shaking my head, "no".
It is however, common place for a movie made on a budget shorter than a shoe-string.
These points however seem to add to my enjoyment of the film and it is one of my arnie favourites, a definite must see.
Raw Deal however was a misfire, even by action movie standards the plot and acting is laughable.
Writer-director Eric Schaeffer loves a good clichÃ©, and he doesn't mind playing up the storybook aspects of this wacky romance, however the film does fall into a predictable pattern (they meet, they fall in love, they fight, etc.).
Farrah Fawcett and Harvey Keitel, however, are more in their element as both have done some terrible movies.
Less surprising than the awkward director choice, however, is how silly and redundant this movie is...
The saccharine sweet narration can be rather vomit inducing at times, however in places it is delivered in a dull, lifeless monotone.
Some of the cinematography is excellent and I would love to be able to say make the whole experience worthwhile however it suffers from bad editing and staging and a lack of continuity making it obvious that many shots were filmed in various locations nowhere near Red Flag, and during some of the dogfight sequences it's hard to keep track of who is who as the aircraft keep chopping and changing between shots so you have no real idea who is flying what.
The "comedy" evolves from the actors after a few sketches, however after a while even their performances become tedious and predictable.
The Spanish film "REC," however, showed more imagination with their application.
The film however made me thinking about buying a farm in rural England.
What remains a mystery, however, is that almost no one --during the Romero heyday of zombies or their 21st Century 'renaissance'-- got it right.
The actors in this film however just move from one scene to another with blank faces whilst the narrator reads from the Bible.
beside 'Open Water' it is the worst camera work i have witnessed (bar home videos) I am very eager to collect the majority of Julia's work and so I decided to go for it and have a peek at this seemingly entrancing film, however it was to my distaste.
It is, however, rather watchable in an odd sort of way... Not quite in the Plan 9 fashion, where you're left laughing all the time, because the production values here aren't all that bad for the time.
Holds interest nearly half the way, however the wrap-up is right off the assembly-line.
It certainly benefits from a good cast, with the central performances by Rose McGowan and Rebecca Gayheart spot-on, however prominently-billed P.J.
Precisely that, however, is the film's psychological downfall in the face of an audience which is - or which one would have assumed ought to be - as familiar by now with the conventions of this genre as it is with those of the mafia movie.
This one, however, was a little better than most.
If, however, you would like to see a good Cheech and Chong movie skips this one.
"Our Hitler..." is the extreme example of 1970's  too much talk too little action self absorption (every word we blather out should be preserved- every idea however tangential and unfocused - is precious to preserve ...) film work - but there are still nuggets of visual and verbal power in this way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way too long film.
But the content, however, is just not there.
At the end, however, you get to see Josephine Baker in a major production number, the sort of musical extravaganza that made her a star in Paris.
It wanted desperately to be a legitimate spy thriller, however the best "enemy" it could muster was to fight against a bank.
Where the film really falls down, however, is with the plot, which asks the audience to buy into the premise that bankers are frighteningly efficient criminal masterminds.
Taken simply as Saturday night hokum, however, The International is mindlessly enjoyable, and the exhilarating set-piece gunfight staged in New York's Guggenheim Museum easily matches anything in the Bourne trilogy and is worth the ticket price alone.
(12) The gratuitous leg shot of Robin Givens getting into a taxi - I've got no problem with this, visually; however, I'm sure Juanita Jordan might have something to say about it.
The butcher house sequence, however, is a pretty nasty as an idea and has some interest in it, too, and that is also easily among the film's "most interesting" parts.
It tackled some controversial topics, however, and I would like to view some of these episodes again.
That is the only thing this movie does right, however; nothing else.
There is one good side to this movie however and that is it can be used in video classes at universities to show an example of what not to do when making a movie of any kind, for example, don't even make a movie that is so boring people can tell by looking at the actors faces.2 : spend the extra money and get a wardrobe so the actors can change clothes 3: don't use archive footage and if you absolutely must use archive footage don't get footage that doesn't make sense, like a single car exploding next to a body of water doesn't make sense when matched with an explosion or accident of two cars in a land locked area.
That concept isn't too bad, however, where this movie goes horribly wrong is that each torture is displayed and filmed in detail.
If it's true or not, it would seem to be a way too hard punishment for making this movie, however only by a small margin.
There are, however, several obstacles to a successful romance.
If you already know the book, however, you may feel a little disappointed.

Some are very attractive (personalities aside) however.
There is a notable exclusion of any black women or fat women, however, and it really is porn just the same as playboy or hustler.
I must admit, however, that my experiences with Quest of the Delta Knights have been softened by watching the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version of the movie.
however, after an hour, the plot became so garbled and stupid, I just began to laugh out loud at all the cliches and poor acting and towards the end I could pretty much guess ahead of time what they were gonna say.
Later however, I was watching sci fi channel and Mystery Science Theatre had decided to prod fun at it as well, so in conclusion, it's.....well bad yet funny.
Unfortunately, however, in almost every group dance number, one of the minor male actors is featured repeatedly in the background doing the dorkiest, weirdest dance...thing...ever filmed.
Considering the Monkees' history, however, they were probably glad when the entire ordeal was over.
Despite this,however,there was one good joke in it which I still remember after all this time,about the squirrel in the forest.
The film generally employs a hand-held style of cinematography, which I think was a good idea; however, if you are watching it online as I was, this can blend with occasional choppiness to make it look like your whole computer screen is jerking back and forth.
After this, however, they dispensed with realism and went a very generically unrealistic route.
Abruptly, however, the toe sucker is done and just walks away--leaving Pearce unsatisfied and lonely.
When she reconnects with her love, Charlie's father, you really start rooting for her to take back her son, and make her own life and future, however hard it may be.
It is dated, however that part can be fun.
It did have some unintentional amusement, however, like when the huge mirror weapon powers down and the general (using very poorly dubbed lips) spouts "Dammit, why is everything going wrong today!?"
You, however, are under no such obligation to view it.
This film was cute and maybe kids will like it, however, I was disappointed.
Some things are so bizarre, however, that it leaves me scratching my head in wonderment:   Â Zap Rowsdower?
This is no ordinary truck, however.
I just purchased the DVD of "Il Fantasma dell'Opera," however, and I must say that I regretfully agree with those who feel this is an all-time low for the director.
With The Phantom Of The Opera, however, I feel that he may have bitten off more than he could chew.
Sadly, however, this film is neither well made nor is it cheesy fun--just amazingly dull.
Sadly however, it has to be said that what follows is tedious at best and moronic at worst.
The reason I keep going to these films, however, is that occasionally there will be a pleasant surprise.
The real center of the movie, however, is not Maria, but her mother and her relationship with the kindly old man who lives in Maria's building.
I could forgive this however, except that the movie only went downhill from there.
Perhaps the most cruel cinematic comparison, however, brought to obvious attention by the prominent presence of a decrepit snack van, is with Mike Leigh's 'Life is Sweet', a film whose originality and desperate humour make a stark contrast with the dull clichÃ©d Oirishisms on display here.
The increasingly beige world of rock and pop could use the occasional grand folly, however crass, idiotic, baffling and unintentionally hilarious it may be."
Naturally, it's not long before the more morally bankrupt members of the murderous trio decide that they wanna piece o' Lisa; to their horror, however, the girl proves to be not quite as defenceless as she at first appears...  Axe is one of many low-budget pieces of trash that gained notoriety thanks to its inclusion on the Video Nasty list during the 1980s, and, as such, will forever be of interest to those who are compelled to check out the 'forbidden'.
LISA, LISA is however, a much tamer movie as many who wrote on this comments page have already stated.
Uma Thurman makes a promising acting debut, however - and am I wrong to believe that Dillon is Matt's identical twin?
The real culprit, however, was French director Alain Deruelle, who proves that he can be just as inept as Jess when it comes to delivering jungle horror.
A jungle that is very obviously situated in France, that is, however.
Mr. Wayne performs some William A. Wellman-directed scenes very well, however; especially during a missed rescue attempt.
David Bradley took over for Michael Dudikoff for reasons unknown, however American Ninja 3 is a lifeless bore which features a hero so blank that it's almost quite humorous.
In LONG LIFE, HAPPINESS AND PROSPERITY, however, she towers over the other actors in the film, but that's not saying much.
At the end of the day, however, the performances sunk this ship.
As the movie continued, however, I saw her bright eyes and intense expressions and realized that she's one of the few women who, like the far less likable Leni Riesenstahl, will be sexy in old age.
His wife understands better, however, and insists on accepting the money for the trip to Australia with their son.
THE VALET, however, played as yet another string in the long ball of yarn that is the rapidly dwindling comedy genre.

Azumi has an interesting topic however; this wonderful topic turns into a one, long boring movie.
It was interesting to see an early Simon Baker, however it looks as if he has since had a nose job.
Some of his scenes were longer than they should had been, however, he managed to portray them well.
The playback singers, however, are excellent, especially Alka Yagnik.
(SOMETHING NOT EXPECTEDOUT OF JAVED AKHTAR AND ANU MALIK) I'd however not like to compare the movie with the 1981 Muzaffar Ali creation.......as it would be an insult to the original magic spelled by the pioneers like Muzaffar Ali and Rekha.
However, she eventually finds salvation in the sex trade as an unlikely sex worker however a rather talented one at that.
What drives the nail in, however, are the rest of the actors.
Strayed however most certainly does conform to this stereotype.
One definite piece of comedic interest, however, is that the main "steamy" theme that accompanies each of the sex scenes borrows heavily from "Jingle Bells".
It is not, however, about the moose-and-squirrel.
Any chance of this being a good film is promptly cut away however by the fact that it's all so boring.
Her strenuous efforts at verisimilitude, however, push her into an unsavory, demonic level of commitment to the larger-than-life role.
The execution, however, drowned the story in a sea of amateurish and obvious mistakes that kids in their second month of film school are warned against.
But that's my ten pence worth, I could of been more in-depth however I really don't think this film deserves such attention.
The situation the movie depicts, is however interesting.
What I am commenting on however is how Gorak seems to drag out the film to make the conclusion all the more effective, and instead of causing surprise as a twist should all the ending does is leave the viewer thinking, 'Is that it?'
The soundtrack however is quite good as the opening song was amazing.
If you still wish to see this movie, however, just fast forward to the Brittania dance-sequence.
As it is, however, the film feels like something somebody came up with while tripping out on some really bad LSD.
Stone-cold sober, however, one can only sit in poker-faced silence marveling at the fact that there must actually be an audience somewhere out there for this thing.
This thing, however, appeared to have been thrown together by a bunch of Delta House rejects after a night of waaaay too much tequila.
There are, however, lots of explosions.
I don't have a problem with fast moving zombies (as I said I love the Dawn remake, and the 28 Later films)... however the zombies in this film were sped up to Keystone Cops level.
however, when a film tries so hard to be serious, but winds up being one of the most ridiculously awful, messy pieces of garbage ever committed to film, i have to give it 1 star!
Hard to concentrate, however, when a lousy punk band rents out some space in their apartment building and jams constantly as his overdue rent builds up and bills come flying in.
A point of interest, however, is the portrayal of American soldiers and Iraqi prisoners in post-war Iraq.
It's too bad that most of them don't, however, at least not for me.
Not wholly European as you'd expect but it works on most levels, just not so much on the humour however.
Perhaps you might watch this (as it is being aired this month, December, 2007 on The Movie Channel (HD) for the same reason that I did (and that is to see what this documentary had to say about the man and his instrument, philosophy and some of the history behind the Moog synthesizer's and company's development), however the total impact of this piece greatly suffers both from what was included in the film and what was left out.
There are, however, love scenes although about as soft-core as a soap opera.
The rest of the movie did not support her performance, however.
With the framework in place, I thought this feature might pull it together better, however.
This movie, however, is more of a far-right conservatives response to intellectuals' claims against right-wingism.
By that point, however, Jackson was so deluded by the sycophantic flattery that surrounded him on all sides, he was convinced that the fans would adoringly accept anything he filmed, simply because it was the product of such a genius.
That, however, was not the part of the story that interested him, so we had to have more loving photography of carved dark wood beams and animal-skin rugs, plus a vastly overdrawn love connection between Eowyn and Aragorn.

The corpse, however, will be a lot happier than someone who had to watch this movie.
It, however, was unconnected: in fact it seemed to be unconnected even to itself, as the various segments which I managed to watch seemed haphazard at best.
The current DVD available by Troma is badly framed, however... this cuts out some widescreen and results in an unfortunate pan/scan affair.
Watching this on TV you can blame the station for hacking it up, however seeing it sans commercials you realize what a nightmare it is.
That said however, this is a magnificent statement of young love from start to finish and everyone of any age currently in love (or theoretically), ought to see it, sooner rather than later.

"Gregory's Girl", however, is not an altogether realistic film, despite its ordinary setting.
One would, however, be horribly let down.
however, i don't think this movie deserves to be on the 100 worst list.

The movie winds up far less carefully made than the initial scenic images suggest, however.
Jose Ferrer doesn't seem to be putting a whole lot into his haggard performance, however he still comes off reasonably well.
There is, however, a growing army of vampire doggies, and the oh-so-cute and cuddly widdle undead puppies.
I first became aware of this via the Blue Underground DVD, though I was not intrigued enough by the online reviews to acquire it; however, coming my way recently while being in a "Nunsploitation" frame-of-mind, I could not very well let the opportunity pass me by (in hindsight, the English dubbing is atrocious Â even if the print reverted for a couple of brief scenes to the original Italian language).
The rest of the cast is interesting but, apart from Paola Morra Â who, perhaps not to give the game away too early, effectively underplays her role as Ekberg's devoted 'room-mate' (incidentally, she would don the habit again that same year for Walerian Borowczyk's BEHIND CONVENT WALLS), clearly operating below-par: Joe Dallessandro (completely out of his element as a young doctor whom Morra effortlessly manages to keep in check at the climax Â if you get my drift), Alida Valli (literally phoning in her performance as the Mother Superior), Lou Castel (as a nosy crippled patient) and Massimo Serato (as the irascible elder doctor who, however, continually cuts Ekberg's clumsiness some slack because she was the most valuable assistant he ever had!).
The production values are bottom of the barrel, at the beginning of the film the cast congregate in the TOA first class lounge that is supposed to be at JFK airport in New York, however the 'Theme Building' at LAX is clearly visible out the window as well as several palm trees.
Though as bad as this one is they would make another one, however, it started promisingly enough with a cab birth scene, but once they showed the island and the babies I could watch no more.

Oddly, however, while this is definitely a horror film featuring Mantan reacting to zombies and the like again and again, his antics weren't nearly as offensive as usual.
The sequel, however, is a vast disappointment for a Horror fan like myself, since it doesn't really deliver any creepiness or suspense.
Now, I don't know the movie Freaks however I wasn't expecting the story line to be particularly original but it was worse than that.
If you like movies with substance or at least some kind of plot or real scare do not watch this if you are however, looking for something to scream at this is perfect for you.
There's one bit in this I don't get, Lucy refuses to drink out of a bowl that the freaks had just drank out of fearing drinking their spit, however it is also shown that Lucy has no problem having sex or giving a blow job to a man old enough to be her dad & literally covered in warts & boils!
The worst, however, is saved for former-Catwoman Julie Newmar playing the bloodthirsty daughter of a scary Count (with an even-scarier accent).
The plot on which these caricatures are hung, however, is paper thin and the final gag is particularly strange and grotesque.
But, since she's who she is, however unfortunate that may be for all of us, we'll go on seeing her again and again, silicon-blown lips and breasts and, oh, what's the use?
Another reviewer states that he does not understand why no-one has claimed the screenplay, but I don't understand the lack of understanding; I can't imagine that anyone would willingly admit to writing this script - however, it seems the director has (and apparently based on Chekhov and Turgenev, no less.)
Right Now, however, this show belongs on the cancelled list, and I hope it is soon.
"Paganini Horror", however has nothing to recommend it for, which is too bad, since a Satanic Horror film about Paganini could have become something good, or at least highly entertaining, if someone had put a little more heart into it.
I flagged this "review" as having a spoiler however I don't think anything I say could possibly spoil this movie.
If you want it, and it does have its charms however slight, get it off TCM.
This show, however, is by far worse.
Instead, however, the film is just pretty poorly executed and stupid much of the time.

No nudity in this or any other scene, however.

This movie, however, was set to painfully vaporize the viewer!
The rappelling and caving however is crap, the cave exploring that is shown in the movie is totally wrong.
Rubin, however, is all over the place with his confusion of the American vernacular of the time and almost everything concerning him makes no sense whatsoever (though I did like his funny dance).

What they find however is even more dark and tragic than they were led to believe.
She does, however, contribute the single memorable number to the show, `We're Havin' A Heat Wave.'

Reeves however, delivers another classic Reeves performance.
They must have realize however, that having John Cleese as the scientist was bound to provoke some giggles.

I loved the anime, I hoped that this film would be as good, however I just found it a huge disappointment and nearly turned it off half the way through.
Other than this however, most effects constitute just extras running around with some green paint smeared on their faces, as you might come to expect.
i did like the gore however (there is plenty of it) and the violent effects are not that bad, so if you are a gore-hound then you might want to pick this movie up.
The scenes are, however, performed by the leads themselves, leading to the conclution, that this movie (like many Jess Franco movies that it resembles) also excists somewhere as a hardcore movie.
That night, however, he's involved in a violent barroom brawl with some pinhead regulars, though by the end of the altercation he is able to swipe the keys from one of their swanky new vehicles.
This flick however combined the fashion faux-pas with lame execution and the result was a tortuous hour and a half to make it to the end of the picture.
Dolph Lundgren does what he can with the very crappy material he is given here, however his chemistry with Meilani Paul is way off, and while he was likable, he just seemed to be going through the motions, however i still Love Lundgren , and he deserves better movies then this lousy crap!
I do think, however, that the story idea was very original and scary.
Aside from that, however, the two films could not be more opposite.
"Deadtime Stories," however, is a horror anthology like no other, basically because it's utter CRAP.
Via a lame, low-budget framing device, a 'randy' uncle tells his restless nephew fairy tales in an attempt to get the brat to go to sleep (I, however, had no trouble falling into a somnambulant state while watching this).
Even though disappointing, however, "The Monster Club" is still worth checking out for its superb cast.
That said however it's the way the werewolf is played that leaves a lot to be desired .

Don't be fooled into thinking, however, that this production has anything to do with Jane Austen's "Mansfield Park".
This however seems to have passed completely over the makers, who have provided us instead with an admittedly prettily photographed film that conveys nothing of the book.
however, he does make a great target for self-respecting movie goers who can all come together to attack one person, instead of fighting over who hates kevin smith and roger ebert.
A narration goes on for the entire length of the movie, explaining everything that is happening Â however due to the incoherent nature of the film it's the ONLY way of understanding what's happening!
After awhile, however, it all makes sense and it works brilliantly to create a conflict of fiction versus reality.
Daniel Bernhardt stars as Alex Cardo, a thief who learns how to fight after he is sent to prison, seems he is in prison due to him trying to steal a sacred sword, however now trained in the arts of martial, he sets up to redeem himself in the kumite.
Bloodsport II opens like an Indianna Jones movie with Bernhardt whipping some asses and trying to make off with the sword, however it isn't until the prison sequence where we get the endless training and ponderous Asian philosophy, to then we get the endless stream of fight sequences.
I DO however like the 2nd movie on the disc, "Filthy McNasty", which is the same director, and approximately the same running time.
The way that they are used doesn't inspire the imagination, however, and that is a shame as this film could actually have been quite scary if done correctly.
I will admit, however, that had I not done so, I wouldn't have come on here and read the unintentionally hilarious review by the gentleman who complains that the cast and crew are full of liberals (in a Hollywood movie?
The rest of the episode, however, isn't very good.
When it does, however, there are some awesome sights.
The only highlights are early appearances from later stars Tanya Roberts and Nancy Allen (who plays an ill-fated hitchhiker) however they can't save a movie that's not only garbage but boring garbage!
The movie quickly became bogged down with racial stereotyping, however: hostile blacks, lots of guns, women as sex objects.
TV-made stalker-drama from producer Aaron Spelling was ahead of its time in terms of subject matter, however the story is creepy and pointless.
Even with her, however, your best option is to skip it.
The only saving grace, however, are the action sequences.
Those over that age, however, were as bored and disappointed as I was.
"The Reef," however, has no redeeming value at all.
When Beth can't use the breaks on her bicycle, she screams for Jody to get out of the way - however, she refuses to take this advice, and runs forward - and faster than the bike - and falls in the river.
The camera angle, however, leaps whimsically and frequently.
Not that they don't make enough of their own, however.
It did, however, help shed light on why a talented actress who was part of the Royal Shakespeare company for many years is chiefly remembered for judo kicks and leather catsuits.
Douglas Henshall provides the 'evil' character & is actually quite good, he doesn't overdo it so it never reaches the pantomime stage, however Annette Badland has no trouble in reaching these dizzy heights as Lady Alabaster (PK's characters mother).
however the one "main" predator who is the biggest wuss ever to come from the predator home world because he has a soft spot for humans, well human, kills dozens with relative ease also, in aliens the acid burns through a lot of METAL floors, however this woman's face has developed the ability to with stand this potent acid?
I'm embarrassed that I paid to see it, however, I have a unique way of justifying it.
Here however it is the reason the films fall flat on its face.
Predator however attempts to be a big, complex story with deep meaning to it, but it just comes off as being stupid and try hard.
Shelley Long dies but comes back, however there's nothing relatably human about Long's approach to acting.
All i can say is that i was really impressed with season 4 & 5 i think they were really well made however the preceding seasons were ill conceived and patronising to anyone with real sense.
I was interested to see what happened with Rambaldi but I think I realise now nothing ever will; we will just continue going round in circles since any form of conclusion will kill any form of suspense however minute.
What I did see, however, was maybe 10 to 15 minutes of good movie stuffed in an hour-and-a-half long film.
My thoughts: I really don't like this movie, first off, it's not a movie, it's more like a 90 minute episode of the TV show, as a matter of fact, that's what the movie should have been, a 3 part season premiere, second problem: the title, why is it called Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie and not just Power Rangers: Turbo just like the show, also, why isn't this a sequel to the first film?, I mean, come on, can't you just at least make a more proper sequel, I know this was after most of the original cast left, but dang, also, the special effects were worser than the effects in the first one, they look like something a nerd would do on After Effects, the Justin kid was so annoying, he's not even worthy of being the Blue Ranger, the Lerigot character angered me, he looks like a cross between an Ewok and a troll baby doll, the villains are dumb, however, I did like the soundtrack, and there a few decent action scenes, but that's it.
however i did like the Cameo of Kimberly (pink ranger number 1) and Jason (red ranger number 1)thought it to be really cool that they still acknowledged that they were a part of this story.
If stretched, however, they would be boring.
some, however, may enjoy the sex scenes so for those only wanting to see that, i give it 3/10.
In Infernal Affairs however, at the end of the film, Andy Lau truly wanted to be a good guy but obviously, circumstances did not allow him to, and therefore he was forced to kill the gang boss to protect his identity.
It's truly an "everything but the kitchen sink" approach to film making, however, it only serves to compound the fact that there's no substance to this mess.
Directed by Brent Maddock this was the second sequel to the excellent & likable 90's monster flick Tremors (1990) which is generally considered a bit of a classic, the sequels however thus far are a long way from classic status & while Tremors II: Aftershocks (1996) was decent enough Tremors 3: Back to Perfection continues the downward spiral of diminishing returns.
This movie, however, merely has gags without context.
The rest of the cast cannot however even be accused of trying to breath some life into this tepid affair.
Just not enough to raise it above a slightly below average slasher film.It IS however better then the first film in the franchise.
Well let's put it this way: the film bills one guy "wierdo," however very clearly there are two of those.
I guess however if the killer isn't using a drill, it can't be a "Slumber Party Massacre" film.
The gore compensates a lot however.
The cheap grainy feel is likely to be part of the desired Gothic, art house effect so many will however enjoy its raw non glossy appeal.
The documentary is flawed, however.
Wagner, however, is a looker and so is Zuniga so there's that.
For me this particular movie just demonstrates however the schmoozy, lackadaisical, condescending work which came out of late 70's LA Hollywood studios.
I will say, however, that the photography and sound were good, so it wasn't completely painful to watch.
It is however one of the worst feature films in reset memory.
There was, however, one thing that was good about this movie.
It should be duly noted, however, that this film had all the signs of a thanksgiving turkey: It's release date, which was moved from late June to the dog days of August.
Aside from that, however, it is a poorly-made movie.
The ending actually surprised me, however, because it was not your typical romantic comedy ending.
Rated E.  I have played Pokemon Snap a couple of times on a Nintendo 64.There isn't much to say about this game but IMDb says I have to make the review 10 lines so I must.The only thing good about this game is the graphics.The graphics of the pokemon and the environment graphics are simply amazing.Great for Nintendo 64.The gameplay however is boring.You are a photographer and Proffesor Oak asks you to go to this island and take pictures of the different pokemon on the island.You must distract the pokemon by throwing fruit and other things at them.Pokemon Snap is a very boring game that's pretty to look at but not so fun to play.If you want a good N64 Pokemon game play Pokemon Stadium.
The story is excellent, however, it belongs to someone else as far as credit of the writing goes.
I watched this movie in a theater packed with other people all excited about this film, however after its showing, more than half were at the box office demanding their money back.
Little does the landlord know, however, the senior citizens used to be slick, wiseguy criminals Bobby Bartellemro (Richard Dreyfuss), Joey "Bats" Pistella (Burt Reynolds), Mike "The Brick" Donatelli (Dan Hedaya) and Tony "The Mouth" Donato.
This movie, however, is a dreadful, horrible, depressing pile of junk.
The plot, however, is overwrought.
Bruce Lee stars as Billy Lo, an action star (of the martial arts variety) who mobsters are trying to force to sign with them, however after taking a couple of beatings and an assassination attempt, Lo fakes his death, has reconstructive surgery and looks to teach the mobsters what the meaning of "No" is.
Thus, what I dislike most about Crash however is that it has a stupid and inane premise and the fact that it was such a terrible film in itself.
Director Richard Rush occasionally does fluid work here, and the film has fervently funny and thoughtful scenes, however Robert Kaufman's hot-headed script, adapted from Ken Kolb's novel, is awash with half-realized ideas.
Watch it on DVD, however, like I did, and you'll be in for a real miserable time.
This one, however, is bad in a rather different way.
however, i do like films that appear to have something to say, not necessarily a simple beginning, middle, end storyline but at least something in terms of character development if not plot development.
The movement controls/logic, however, were so extremely bad I didn't play the game further than the second map - it is the second game ever I threw away.
Booker T beat Christian in a fair contest, however there was no build up to the match and it seemed that the match was only booked to pad the PPV out.
Sadly however those funny moments were all given away in the trailer.
After viewing this movie, however, I have a new-found respect for such comedic works as "R.V.," "Are We There/Done Yet?," "License To Wed," "Guess Who?," "Soul Plane," "King's Ranson," "My Baby's Daddy," "Little Man" and any of the "Scary Movie" versions.
That last guffaw was no doubt brought on by the delirium of the closeness of the closing credits, however.
Her acting is fine - her taste here, however, is a little shaky.
This is doubtful, however, as those engines and complete (usually two- or three-year-old) Miller chassis rarely ran anywhere but Legion Ascot in the LA area at that time.
A pyramid that dispenses pills to make you feel however you want; how clever.
In practice, however, it plays out in the manner of a particularly charmless Saturday morning cartoon.
Today, however, it looks like a parody of its own genre.
this movie was technically made well... in terms of quality of picture and audio... the lighting in some scenes could have taken more thought and effort however on to the story...  it pretty much portrays the theme of saw where people are being punished for sins they committed in the past... most of it takes place in a parking lot where the people come across supernatural/horror creatures to finish them off...  the dialogue got a bit annoying in some places and they never seem to execute the suspense very well... all in all.. a fair effort... writing and directing doesn't always work for everyone...
Tia Carrere, however, is so beautiful, and so understated as the seductress - really, it's almost worth the agony just to see her in her pale blue gown.
In America however that would have been the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.
Sadly, however, this scores low on the scale of cinematic value; whatever luster it once had isn't evident today.
Sadly, however, both actors were pretty limp here--particularly Scott.
Later, however, she suddenly marries emperor Claudius who already has big children with freshly married to him Messalina.
It's greatest weakness however is a slow plot.
The film claims to have used veterans of the United States military, however any of the "actors" used in this film who are prior service should be ashamed for participating.
On celluloid, however it all comes apart.
The film's casual racism, however, is deeply regrettable.
The kid, however, unleashes some kind of telepathic power on them, playing mind-games and causing "accidents".
I usually don't give 1 or 2:s to movie because there is always something in a movie thats good, This movie however has nothing good in it.
Sometimes this tactic goes terribly wrong however and the rented film proves to be too bad even for laughs...  Camp slaughter is a story about a few kids who go out to a cabin in the woods to party (although mostly it just seems they want to whine and complain at each other).
This film, however, surpasses almost every one in terms of confusion and all-around ambiguity.
There are some positives however.
I do not recommend that you see this movie, however, I do recommend that you call fat people King Ralph for comedic purposes.
'Shadows', however, while firmly within the Expressionist genre, is too arty for its own good.
Most offensive, however, is the gratuitous manner in which the movie concocts the entire spectacle within a fanciful dressing of glamour, all the while pedaling it's pretensions for historical and physical accuracy.
Calling this movie a rip-off would be a compliment, however.
Dr. Ari Ben-David (Rhett Giles) & Dr. Swatek (Zach Galligan) are in charge & they are both very excited, however a great evil has been awakened in the shape of the re-animated Egyptian priestess Aneh-Tet (Claudia Lynx) who needs 6 souls to bring her 6 zombie mummies back to life & take over the world with the aid of a big slimy monster thing which can only be brought into this world by a virgin sacrifice.
The second half, however, is quite interesting: Merli quits the force after shooting a hood (John Steiner) in 'cold-blood' - apparently, it little matters to his superiors that the latter had done the same to undercover cop and Merli protÃ©gÃ© Ray Lovelock, who remains paralyzed for life!
It does however excel at placing loud, stupid moments one after another until there's over two hours of crap on the screen; damned if you could offer a reason why.
This however beats them all.
Pick any Mexican or Colombian film from the last decade and the idea of an "Better American hope of life", is soon to be found, however, "Paraiso" fails at showing us what really motivates these characters or what lies behind their intentions.
As a serious talent search, however (like Star Search was), it's absurd!
however...it feels like a lock groove.
similar scenes playing out time and time again similar camera tricks again and again it tried to be smart just as high tension did (both failed miserably) and is basically a slasher flick again could have been amazing, however...ended up being slow and a bit boring however the moments that deliver really deliver.
As everyone is being bumped off, it becomes clear that it doesn't matter if these visions are real or not, the evidence is there afterwards, the ending however, with last survivor, Tara (Lindsey Haun), isn't great.
The writing was quite off, however, resulting in stiff and boring dialogue and poor structure (and, eventually, a bit of a cheap ending).
I am however a fan of cinema and horror movies and take offense when a 'popular' director picks a 'popular' genre and makes a total pigs ear out of it, when I then in turn am expected to shell out premium prices for someone else's vanity and back-clapping.
I am entitled however to express my opinion of the film on this opinion page for the film, and given the other comments I do not think I am alone in my musings.
Also worth mentioning in this regard, however, are the enigmatic 'orders' given to the old couple as well as the gardener (a surprising straight turn from comedian Will Hay's frequent sparring partner Moore Marriott) respectively requesting a certain doctor's presence and the unearthing of a locket (subsequently cleaned just as inexplicably).
People tend to skip these lost gems, because they consider it to be rather 'ancient' - however it is so good, that if the same script and direction were used without any amendments, but with a different cast offcourse today, this movie would stll be a hit, and would even score at the Oscars.
So, rather charmingly, they decide that however hip they seem and wish to appear, deep down they are as old fashioned as you and me !
The finale, however, switches gears and drops the mean-yet-lighthearted vibe.
Unfortunate translation of the title however.
They'll do anything to be a part of it, however small, brief, or fleeting.
Sandra Dee had talent however as movies such as "Imitation of Life" and "A Summer Place" attest.
I love all of the Gidget movies, however to me Sandra Dee will always be the ultimate Gidget and I am sad that we have lost her recently.
the beach is assumed to be the famous surfing beach, malibu; however reference is made to santa monica.
All the three heroes performed well, however on the downside there was not much scope on the heroines.
You walk out of the film, however, only remembering Amitabh as Anthony.
The real dealmakers for the film, however, are Pran and Jeevan who respectively are devilishly fiendish as Kishenlal (reborn of course -- who can forget the brilliant "Sewer ka putter ..." sequence after spotting Robert on his return) and Robert, the antagonist to all.
The children, however, are wonderful and not 'too dark'.)
the character of eve was very attractive however lacked in acting.
It is, however, a great example of how Japanese animation differs from its Western counterparts.
The storyline, as mentioned before, is fairly straightforward (and admittedly clichÃ©d at times), but thankfully this doesn't sidetrack from its unique charm, especially as the narrative progresses from a bogstandard battle of Good vs Evil into something else entirely, which I won't describe in great detail lest I completely ruin the surprise for you - however, I will say this: the ending itself is one of the most awe-inspiring things I have ever seen.
The actors and actresses are good but not stellar, but Karyo however is very good as Taggart.
The result is, however, that he blunders not only in public but often also in his private life.
Joan Bennett, however, was the dullest actress in movie history.
...however, I will admit - I WAS warned.
(Therefore, read movie's "Plot Summary")  This film has no "happy end", but however, I thought the ending was rather predictable.
This movie overall was not all that great, it did however have some high points.
I don't think that this film is for people who love to watch sex on the box, but however for the people who never go that step to engage in hiring a prostitute.
The two female leads I thought really did a great job,Yeah, and there both hot, but the sex scene was so believable, and were good at their parts.Of course nothing will ever beat the Exorcist because it rocked, however this one held its own.
This film was let down however by a low budget.
Many reviewers have compared the story to Romeo & Juliet, and although I wouldn't have understood the analogy as a child, I'm sure I recall the realization that, however majestic and omnipotent the combatants (Sea and Fire, in this case), the conflict presented is nothing more than a childish feud, a pointless and senseless sparring match that will probably never see a true victory.
I was gonna rate it a 8, however, since it only has a 3.1 i am gonna rate it a 10. it made me laugh so hard, and unlike some movies who make dirty jokes to make people laugh.
however, i have to say that it is just a funny movie to watch, it doesn't have much of educational purposes,etc.
I've read the book and it would be hard to film it since it was a collection of short stories, however Merchant-Ivory pulled it off.
In this movie adaptation, however, much effort is made in accuracy to not only the plot of Victor Hugo's novel, but the atmosphere and characters.
The trip however does not go as planned.
i was just flicking through channels when i saw an ad for reaper....directed by Kevin smith....now this came as a surprise to me as I'm usually up to date with his works....a regular on the IMDb page as well as the message boards...so decided to give it a go....mostly anything Kevin smith does (despite saying that after jay and silent bob strike back he was quiting the industry...) is good in my book :) and i was pleased to see that this was no exception....the plot is great...and not (as another user posted) like Shaun of the dead...similarities in certain things perhaps...but clearly not based on Shaun of the dead... i would however recommend this series to any fan of Kevin smith or even any fan of comedy...its a warm light hearted comedy about a kid whose just really not had the best start to being 21...:)
Sympathy for the Devil, however?
It's a different case with Sam's bulky buddy, Sock, however.
Her absence is more than made up for in Season 2, however, by the introduction of a demonic love interest for Ben, named Nina (played perfectly by Jenny Wade).
I am however really disappointed that there will not be another series, the show leaves us on a cliff hanger and i'm sure a lot of people, would like to see a solution.
Sam, however, thinks the situation ...well...SUCKS!
There is no real way to compare the two however since Endless Summer is a documentary that follows a couple of California surfers as they search out the perfect waves around the world.
He has however succumbed to the madness of war, wishes to stay, and heart breakingly replies 'Charlie Don't Surf!'
I rented this one based on largely marginally positive reviews i've read, expecting a fun little gory horror flick, what I got however was a pretty uninspired "Nightmare on Elm Street" retread, but with a clown fast food mascot.
The audio is poorly balanced, however, with dialogue often muffled by adjacent noise.
I will, however, elaborate as much as I can on all the things that "Across 110th" does represent Â and that is quite a lot!
Those issues, however, did not seriously detract from the film.
Marley and the old ladies, however, were very good.
There still is lots going in favor of BGC, however.
A few minutes into this, however, it struck me that this might be nothing more than a tax deductible vacation for multi-millionaire James Cameron and his sidekick Bill Paxton.
Murphy's scene in the bar however is bad and does not even come close to the original.
I enjoyed this film quite a bit, however a lot of it is rehashed,and it had some shocking but bizarre plot twists, don't get me wrong i didn't see them coming, but they didn't make any sense, however Eddie gets to show off more with his comic talent, and had a lot more to do this time (in my opinion).
I enjoyed this movie quite a bit however it can't match the original.
Eddie Murphy is AMAZING as always, and is just plain hilarious,however both of them seemed to be going through the motions at times, still they gave it there all, and they were both great, plus Eddie gets to show off his comedic talent more!
In the third act however--that is, after Brutus and Cassius have fled Rome--he seems to grow in the part and his acting gains conviction.
I believe this device could have been used effectively in film with voice-over narration, however, the screenwriter chose not to do so.
They do, however, perform well and allow for some chemistry to give us cause to buy into the emotional turmoil they experience on a daily basis.
In Chicago, the special collections librarian Henry DeTamble (Eric Bana) has a genetic anomaly that allows him to travel in time; however, he is not able to control the moment or the destiny of his voyages.
The book's ending was filmed, however, so maybe it'll turn up as a DVD extra for all the purists out there.
Stealing the show, however, was Maggie Smith as Mrs Medlock, the truly beastly housekeeper.
It is simply impossible to watch these children and not be moved to thankfulness for own humanity, however flawed it may be.
I don't know how they did it, but the film has alot of drama, however, it doesn't get too mushy.
"The Secret Garden" is not Mary's story; however, it's the story Mary made possible.
There were however some cool effects, made me leave hoping that artificial intelligence remains just an idea.
Upon realization that a video game is "dumbed down" for the players to be able to concentrate, however, I opted for a second viewing and came to realize that this was not the waste of time I first believed.
We as an audience however know something is amiss having witnessed a coffin earlier floating ashore following the flute-playing of a most unusual looking black man who we later see arrive at the castle-like house in which the hippies seem to be squatting now acting as something of a servant/follower to Khorda.
For an adolescent horror fan, however, these channels were a dream come true, with Dr.
The story is, as many say, somewhat themed after Shakespeare's classic "Romeo & Juliet", however, the mixture of vibrant Fantasy and animation makes this far more memorable (And I am a lover of R&J).
There are some "inside jokes" here that are not so simple to understand outside of Poland, however most of the humour is universal.
It's a stage-bound film, however, clearly a filmed version of a play.
Director D.W. Griffith's "The Red Man's View " scores points for its point-of-view; however, it remains a relatively weak and unimaginative drama.
Now, I must admit that I did laugh a few times during 3, however this latest instalment has no redeeming value whatsoever.
Others, however, we're bust your gut funny.
Most of the jokes, however, were pretty unoriginal and predictable.
The "War of the Worlds" to me seems to be the main film parodied, however the other films get their fair share of the jokes as well.
The opening is rather funny with Shaq and Dr. Phil doing a "Saw" recreation and there are other celebrities who make short visits as well however it is still the same group who forms the core of the cast.
Worth a look see, however, if you did not care for "Scary Movie 3" I would say you probably won't like this one.
It is however a difficult film to "sell" to a modern audience so used to fast-paced action, fireballs, gore and the odd bit of gratuitous nudity.
There are, however, a few highlights that amused me in this one: First of all Peter Boyle as Sgt.
This was an act that soon palled over the decade, however.
What we are forced to participate in here, however, is the very ebb and flow of love and lust between two people not afraid to let their passions take them to the edge and even over.
I've never seen so many broken, sad and confused characters in one film before... And the interplay between them is moving and captivating...  Be warned however...
Sheilds however rides his ambition and signs on for the project despite the railroading of his best friend, and with Sheilds' star on the rise, the two end their partnership and their friendship on a bitter and acrimonious note.
Bartlow is a happily married man who's home-life has always come first, however Sheilds believes that his wife is interfering with his work, so he engages his dashing leading man 'Goucho' (played by Gilbert Roland) to turn on his Latin charm and seduce the lady away from her husband while the screenplay is finished.
Gloria Grahme however was honored with an Academy Award for her delightful and refreshingly sanguine portrayal of Rosemary.
Not the case here however.
The best, however, has to be when Georgia finds a tawdry starlet (played acerbically by Elaine Stewart, who much later became a game show hostess) descending the stairs at Shields' mansion at which point she flees and drives with Hollywood-style abandon in her car.
It's well-directed with beautiful black and white cinematography but I don't think this was all factual (however I did get a kick out of the obvious caricature of von Stronheim).
Though the Mutants damage the flagship, the power of the Eye drives them back, and Lion-O's elderly guardian, Jaga, pilots the ship to the safety of the world of "Third Earth;" however, he dies in the process, as there are insufficient cryo-stasis pods aboard the ship, and the journey to Third Earth takes several decades even with advanced interstellar spacecraft.
Along the way, Hercules loses his memory & is seduced by the evil Amphale who goes through husbands like Elizabeth Taylor, however, Amphale is something of a black widow & uses a few Egyptians to preserve her ex-husbands in the family crypt.
That said, neither the subject matter nor the direction particularly suits a cinema presentation; I strongly suspect that however strong the box-office returns, they will be comprehensively eclipsed by the video and DVD sales because this is a deliberately small-scale and intimate movie.
Critics of this movie have focused mainly on its similarity to "The Full Monty"; however, unless you watch "Calendar Girls" with this idea firmly planted in your mind, you will probably not be bothered by any similarities between the two films.
Aside from that, as a film, it gets a little too didactic towards the end (it was more emotionally involving before his conversion than after); however, Raul Julia's performance is superb.
As the film progresses, however, the political repression becomes increasingly violent.
As the film progressed, however, these relationships quickly began to deteriorate.
The Finzi-Contini's, however, believe that their position of wealth and their very home will shield them from being touched, and they move on, oblivious to the world outside, in a frozen period of time and space that seems, for a moment, to spare them, until it becomes rather clear that the walls that so protected them are beginning to crumble and that they are headed towards an inevitable train wreck which will destroy all that they know.
In some ways it is more modernly set than some of his other films (and that it is in English sets it apart from some of his trademark Svensk Filmindustri pictures), however it doesn't hurt it terribly so.
I, like most males who have reviewed this movie on IMDb, do agree, however, that it is worth viewing if you are a fan of Jennifer Connelly and her very impressive curves.
Be forewarned, "Limbo" is not film for weak-minded people, nor will you be able to even comprehend the plot if you are brain-dead; however, if you value a film that does not need excessive movie additives (i.e.
Lana's character has been planted at one of the colleges under consideration, however the student-editor of the school newspaper suspects that the company has already chosen its girl.
The acting was fine however.
The film however...I'm not one to compare a book to it's film because they are two different mediums and are not meant for comparison, however for any of you who desire to see this film I suggest you step back with your hands out and get the book instead.
It is believed that in pre-earth life, Lucifer proposed that everyone who comes to earth be forced to do good, so that everyone will be worthy to return to God's presence after death, therefore 'no souls will be lost' -- however, he wanted the credit for this plan.
It's actually quite difficult to categorize CLOCKWORK because it's something of a social satire, something of a drama, has comedic moments and deconstructs a musical for a horrifying rape sequence; however, its approach to the material gives it the feel of a hybrid out of time, out of place, but visually arresting and impossible to take for granted.
One night, however, a woman known as "The Cat Lady," refuses their plead, and calls the police in suspicion.
The overall message here, however, is despicable.
With the help of video left on Mike's cell phone, however, he discovers secrets that begin to shake his faith in American institutions though he never questions his son's actions.

Billy Crystal's movie, however, left me blinking back tears.
The strength, however, really rest in the performance of Billy Pepper and Thomas Jane who portray the friendship, rivalry and respect between two great players.
Naturally, he'll need a LOT of help with the disabling aspects, however.
I have, however, never been a hacker.
This is, however, a decent film, and better than many things being released in the present day.
The film, however, is a delightful entertainment, beautifully photographed amidst the Vermont fall foliage, and filled with indelible performances by Shirley MacLaine in her first screen role and veterans Mildred Natwick, Edmund Gwenn, Mildred Dunnock, and John Forsyth.
I however can only give it 7 out of 10, even though I would like to give it more.
It starts out really well, however after John Forsythe meets with Shirley MacLaines character, the film somewhat slows down and can be at times tedious.
The film is however interesting in many different ways.
It was almost as surpring, however, when I read the comments on IMDb and realized that a large portion of Hitchcock's audience simply didn't "get it".
This story however, is not much different to the Princess Diaries, and "What a girl wants" movies put together.
Persuaded by his wife, however, he decides to wait until after the procession of Catholics to the shrine of the Lady of Guadeloupe.
I went into this film without realizing it was by Carlos R. I won't explain the storyline as you may have read it already by now - I will however try to rationalize why it may be loved/hated.
It however goes a step ahead by trying to create a niche group amongst the "sophisticated" critics/viewers as well!
The movie interpretion however doesn't quite capture the excitement of the Wolfman killings.
It does a good job of coming full circle and educating young viewers of the important role that bees play in the food chain however it never goes back to the beekeepers, a fact which plays way down to every viewer.
The best vocal performances in this movie however come from Matthew Broderick (Ferris Bueller, adult Simba) and of course, Patrick Warburton (Kronk in Emperor's New Groove, The Tick, and Joe from Family Guy).
Her lack of talent was routine however.
This is not to say, however, that the movie is sad through and through.
it did drag a bit in the middle, and it is a bit long in the tooth, however i enjoyed this film, as it has lots of great fights, a decent plot and, some good eye candy.
Kathy Ireland is, however, endearing (as well as looking a treat throughout - as the credits point out, "Special Thanks to The Kathy Ireland Signature Collection"), and the movie is more bearable than "Ernest Saves Christmas" or the "Miracle on 34th Street" remake.
Her boyfriend is taking none of this lying down, however, and makes it his business to get to the bottom of the mystery.
Murders are fairly few in this one and not gory, the film does however include an absolute rip-snorter of a strangulation sequence, one of the best examples of such slaying I've ever seen in fact.
The fighting is great as it took a bit to figure out what to do here and there, however for the most part I was able to find a way to kill the Colossus without any aid.
I have, however, finally been able to play this truly unique game.
Just let the film's character's set root however, and an entirely human element comes into the staunch equation, much like the words that render themselves visible only when filling in others around it for these dictionary junkies.
Apart from this, however, the film is enthralling, intriguing and predominately well-acted (though the male lead leaves something to be desired).
Wagner, however, is a looker and so is Zuniga so there's that.
However, there are a few of her friends, who I say bravo too, through illness and divorce they show great courage, however somehow the films doesn't portray bravery and courage, it documents how little women have grown.
For those however, who like their films dark, character driven, edgy, capped off with a bit of despair look no further, it's all here.
Not much of a known cast, however they all put out excellent performances, especially Lance Henriksen who is one of my favorites.
Here however she plays it fairly boring and straight.
Once the movie starts, however, I am always so engrossed I forget about the sketch.
The similarities end there, however, and I don't think it's fair or accurate to call it a remake.
Both its most notable counterparts ("City Of Lost Children", and more recentantly the vivacious "Amelie") are brilliant and vibrant peices of cinema, however personally i feel that Delicatessen takes the cake.
But in "Delicatessen", Louison, however naÃ¯ve he may be, is no fool; the enchanting Juliet, even as she fumbles her way through a disastrous date because she feel embarrassed wearing glasses, is no object of ridicule.
This did not stop me, however, from watching and, in turn, loving this beatiful piece of cinematic masterpiece.
Jean-Claude Dreyfus is the real star of the show, however, as the extroverted and over the top butcher.
I would however use CGI in the remakes if i could make them, but they would have to be mint and the creature would have to have character too.
This is not something that I could easily do, however, as I had to watch what would happen much like in something in a Lynch or Bunuel film.
Some of the gore is actually well done, however one scene shows blood coming from a gunshot wound to the foot, the blood is far too thin and even has a froth.
Evil alien conquerors) and horror movies, but this movie was however bad in a REALLY bad way.
I would be more forgiving if this was the Hayley Cloake's first attempt at directing, however, it is not.
however i do remember that this little boy who found a cat in the alley and nursed him back to health,the boy use to feed the cat and himself tuna straight from the same can also every year around Christmas i believe it came on TV.and me and my sisters and brothers use to watch it.i was about 10 years old or younger.i have a pretty good memory and its now around Christmas i guess this is why this movie came to mind.not only that i have a cat whom i adore.
It does have an upbeat, hopeful ending, however, and with its holiday setting, it's the kind of film you should definitely add to your list of the best Christmas films ever made.
It might seem as an obvious thing to do but it is easy to slip into that judgemental and critical feeling however subtle it might be, which will spoil any movie for you not just this one.
The movie, however failed to get the recognition it deserves, but I'm glad I watched this movie soon after its release.
Unable to discourage the adamant Vitti, Sobol acquiesces and agrees to treat him exclusively for two weeks, though he is less than enthusiastic about being pressed into the service of a well-known criminal; even less enthused, however, is his fiancee, Laura (Lisa Kudrow).
This is one of the rare movies in comedy that i could watch over and over again,, this movie is sooooo , freaking funny it's like a laugh a minute,, especially how Vinny,, "bag of donuts" is woken up constantly every morning,, first the train,, then the pigs i think the owl, and o yeah the steam whistle... i can relate to that stuff, and living relatively close to N.Y. for years i can relate to the accents in the movie,, very Brooklyn if i'm not mistaken,, i loved Joe Pesci in this movie,, this is one of his finer moments ever in a comedic role,, Marissa Tomei however stole the whole show for me,, not only is she sexy and pretty she can act too, her accent fits her like a glove, Ralph Maccio,, hmm well, not everything can be perfect.. i Loved Fred Gwynne the judge,, he is so hilarious,, i just bust out every time he gets Vinny on Contempt of Court or something,, and order him to some jail time,, overall the plot was simple... yeah some of it's corny,, i guess you kinda have to be a Pesci, Tomei fan to appreciate all the slapstick,, but hey it's one of the funniest movies that you'll ever see and you won't regret watching it that's for sure,,
Yet, through keen observation and endless questioning, and the eventual piecing together of the many unfiltered fragments that come floating her way, Anne is finally able to come to some kind of understanding, however imperfect, of the much larger world community of which she is only a very small but crucial part.
Her parents, however, are infatuated with the Left, especially with the rise of Allende to power in Chile.
It was of course afterwards that I realized that this question, however the most pertinent, was far from the only one I would ask myself that night.
Getting herself out of situations that the brothers can't even fathom and catching on to things so quickly, it's as though the mark becomes the professional, however, that is exactly Stephen's plan.
Ignorant of the world, the girl seems content to live with the old man even allowing him to bathe her every night, however, one day a teenage boy is amongst those who come to fish on the old man's boats and the young girl feels a stirring in her heart that she has not felt before.
The part where the old man plays his bow/ violin on the roof of the boat, however, belongs in a tourism video promoting the wonders of South-Korea, not a Kim Ki-Duk film.
I'm not sure what I make of it all, however I do know the film still haunts me and on some level colored everything I watched after that.
Sadly, however, the instrument doesn't fit into the film's plot beyond providing for occasional mood music.
Soon, however, a sensitive male college student shows up on board, and the old man discovers he's going to need more than a bow if he wants to keep the delectable young thing for himself.
The Bow, however does not go to these lengths, but instead falls into the category of Ki-Duk's more eclectic and arguably more mainstream works like the Birdcage Inn or Samaria.
At first glance it looks like Sergiu Nicolaescu as old prince Morudzi performs rather flat, however the character he plays is supposed to be flat with few emotional variations.
Ioana Moldovan is an attractive woman, and perform well as Isabelle Benny, the prince's love interest while wondering as a young man in Paris, however, she looks more like a tramp, instead of the supposedly poor and simply dressed French girl.
It is not unthinkable, however, are playboy attitude, good look, and highly cultivate language enough for so many women to fall for him right away ?
About the DVD release: rather effective (mostly true to the original Romanian script) and easy to follow English subtitles, however, the person who did the translation seemed to have used some kind of "didactic", Romanian-English Dictionary Â based equivalents for many Romanian idioms.
It is however probably most noted for its name.
Sure we get Spider-man, Wolverine, Venom, Daredevil and more to choose from, however the marvel universe is so expansive you could have had twice the number of marvel characters and still had the three they choose to knock out of action early.
She doesn't know, however, that the clue to solving her mother's dead lies with these same people and that she's actually an obstacle in the killer(s) complete fiendish scheme.
In order to succeed, he must break into one of the most wellguarded prisons in Eastern Europe and free the son of the most notorious drug lord in the world today  In conclusion this is a great and refreshing change from the average action film with real heart felt drama its only rival release may be firewall, however Harrison Ford struggles to compete with Seagal in every aspect.
What is of major importance to all Seagal fans however, is the action.
On her fourteenth birthday, Christy asks Vanessa to drive her convertible car, but she has a car accident, hits a rock and is thrown off the seat; however Vanessa is trapped in the car that explodes and she survives disfigured and totally burnt.
I agree with this statement, however, where "21 Grams" left me feeling sad and hopeless, I left this movie with a smile on my face and filled with optimism.
While he gives us a throughly entertaining Henry, I still however have trouble seeing this character as a writer of erotic fiction.
After this role, however, I have no doubt that if she keeps her head on straight, she's the next great actress of her generation.
We could nitpick over minor faults and details here and there as we could with every movie, however, considering budget restraints, location, scheduling etc.
There were other books written by Ernest Tidyman however this served to be the last Shaft movie made during the 70's.
On repeated viewings, however, I have to say the film still holds up in the manner it was intended: over the top, extremely silly, fun.
"L'Immoralita" by Massimo Pirri reminded me a little bit an infamous "Maladolescenza",but it was not as graphic.Still the sex scene between the girl and the killer may certainly upset some viewers,albeit the girl is clearly replaced by an older body-double.The story of "L'Immoralita" is morally dubious,however the acting is quite good and there is enough sleaze to satisfy any self-respecting smut peddler.I'd recommend this film for fans of Italian exploitation.7 out of 10.
What is does however is that it render the movie tones of reality, tiny pieces of documentary that somehow also makes it a powerful statement without indulging in pointers.
There's only one solution, however, to the inevitable problem.
In the movie, however, this just becomes casual speculation, especially with Gary Cooper and Fredric March in the roles.
March and Hopkins, however, are completely at ease and are a joy to watch.
Sadly, however, despite some interesting sexual dynamics and good acting, the scrip just never paid off that much.
Now, if we saw a much older Will Kane having to face the sons of the men he had to kill, that would be a relevant story to make a Part II; this however is ruined by trying to make the connection.
It is precisely these things, however, that make the lack of a satisfactory plot and its execution so disappointing.
It analyses it's points with a sly grin on it's face, however, and it's clear that none of the points are being made with any real conviction; but Antonio Margheriti has shown with previous movies (Dance Macabre, The Virgin of Nuremberg) that he's too clever for merely making a movie about cannibals - and that's the main reason why Cannibal Apocalypse offers more.
Sacchetti's theme of a violent-cannibalism spreading by bites is a solid-move, however.
The best performance, however, comes from Radice who is once again excellent in his role here.
The people infected, however, are not brain-dead flesh-eaters, but intelligent, thinking people - only with the unconquerable hunger for human flesh... One of the greatest elements of Italian Cannibal flicks were their scores, and even not quite typical, Alexander Blonkensteiner's score is great.
Choosing to develop To The Devil A Daughter, however, was probably a bad decision: budgetary constraints meant that a faithful interpretation of Wheatley's book was impossible to achieve, and after much script wrangling, filming went ahead whilst further revisions were still being made.
The most perplexing moment of all however, comes Â unforgivably Â right at the climax of the movie.
The concern for maintaining the rainforest is demonstrated through the presumed wisdom we are called to see in the American Indian elders, however; Bill Markham is blind to this wisdom until the end of the movie.
We realize, however, that all of them are either on the slide downward or are just about to tip over.
Soon, however, it's revealed that she was murdered, and Heflin is the prime suspect.
There is, however, one baffling omission Â there's not a single widow in the plot.
The movie coupled with the fantastic soundtrack,meant that in years gone by it was always first amongst the movies on video night.Two movies which l feel a similar and most definitely be appreciated by fans of The Wraith, are two Australian films made slightly prior to The Wraith.The obvious movie being Mad Max,however the second less obvious is the movie "Running on Empty",similar plots lines,identifiable characters and outback,desert type settings are all evident.
Back in 1986, The Wraith just about qualified as a moderately entertaining alternative should the video rental shop be all out of copies of Aliens or Top Gun; however, when watched twenty three years later from a nostalgic point of view, this silly supernatural revenge flick actually proves to be a whole heap of fun.
Also noteworthy, however, is the colorful supporting cast, including Randy Quaid as the sheriff, and scene-stealing comic relief cretins Skank, Gutterboy, and Rughead (the eternally fascinating Clint Howard sporting an Eraserhead 'do).
As Packard loses grip on the power he has he becomes determined to take revenge on the wraith, however Packard isn't the only one with revenge on his mind...
This film is really like High Planes Drifter meets The Road Warrior,being it combines classic revenge western with action road rage films.My only complaint is that the dialouge could have been much deeper and more serious but then again,this was never meant to be Shakespeare.Randy Quaide needed more screen time as well.All in all ,however,this one is 100 times better than any of those bloated,computer created dumb kiddy rides like Fast and The Furious or Tourque.This is a real road rage film.
Charlie Sheen's late 80's action masterpiece THE WRAITH, however, successfully ventures down a road much less traveled by filmmakers, a road which guides viewers through an assemblage of scenes which seem somehow related, but give no indication of how or why.
As the film starts it is somewhat promising, as the shaky camera moves through a seemingly abandoned house by the means of clumsy editing and what can only be described as library muzak in the background, you however comfort yourself with the fact that this is an amateur film and hopefully when the movie gets going all of those failures will be forgotten.
I did however kind of like the whole 8mm aspect, but this was supposed to make it look like a 70's movie and it doesn't.
The video quality is appropriate, however, as it's matched in wretchedness by every other facet of this stink-fest.
Gerard Philipe, however, is the center of the story.
The acting interest, however, comes from Charles Arnt and, especially, Warren William.
Even while the film isn't making a whole lot of sense, however, it still remains interesting by way of its atmosphere.
The main actors, however, Susie Amy and the main musketeers, were severely lacking in acting skill.
The story, however drawn out it becomes, still contains enough of Dumas' great swashbuckling tales of derring-do, evil, honor and action to be entertaining.
The great weakness, however, is the lack of style.
I felt like I needed to continue watching it, however, because I had paid for it on Pay Per View, and that was definitely one I'd ask my money back for had it been at the theater.
Some sequences however might be a bit too disturbing for really young children though, so be aware of that.
This movie, however is far from the ride.
In this case, however, a sympathetic judge investigates, determines that the old man is telling the truth and attempts to help him-- too late, as it happens, leaving the old man alone, grieving and bitterly angry.
Plucky Judy won't be dissuaded however, and her blind optimism is one of the lasting treasures of this movie.
It would seem to me that the film is named so because Judy is the one character in the film who has any real desire to leave this community and, however misbegotten, acts upon that desire.
When Sharpe returns to camp however, is told he has been made strategic adviser to Lord Keily, and has been ordered to whip his men 'The Royal Irish Company' into an effective and loyal company of fighting men.
This is made more difficult however as articles in the American press that are being unusually and freely distributed amongst the ranks, speak of British atrocities in Ireland, making Sharpe's new company an angry and embittered group of men.
When the Irish reveal themselves as turncoats during mid battle however, it results in the tragic death of Rifleman Perkin's the youngest of Sharpe's chosen men, resulting in the remainder of the crack Rifle company going completely berserk killing off all the traitorous scum, this coupled with the inevitable rescue of Lady Keily and the final showdown between Major Sharpe and General Loup make this truly great swashbuckling stuff.
Speaking of the changes, I liked the idea of Miss Marple visiting the chambermaid's aunt, however some other changes like the dead coming back from the dead seemed far-fetched and didn't quite work.
His dismal performance wasn't all that noticeable, however, because everybody else stunk like a week old corpse in a broken icebox during a Texas heat wave.
But my biggest complaint, however, was the totally distracting soundtrack.
This however is a quiet, go-nowhere, predictable, pretentious film that should never have been made.
It does however remind me of the movie "Carnival of Souls" in a way that the driver of the vehicle was not supposed to have dies in a crash when he had almost hit a silhouette figure in a white nightgown off the road and soon after a lady had also had an unfortunate accident with a far lesser fate than his.
); however, this alone does not make them worthwhile (let alone good) and, in fact, both these films are relentlessly sabotaged by inept handling and matching wooden performances Â I mean, one has to wonder just what went on during the production of such effortsÂwhere, invariably, a writer-director's 'uncompromising' vision was constantly shortchanged by the individual's apparent lack of talent in putting his own ideas to fruition!
I haven't seen so much running since Run Lola Run, however, in that movie there was a purpose to all that running.
It is however quite enjoyable on its level, which is that of a fairly straightforward and formulaic thriller with some dashes of humour.
Firstly, Rear Window by Alfred Hitchcock is one of my favorite movies, however it is important not to compare this to that classic.
As is the way with promising horror/thrillers of late, however, (remember 'Vacancy'?
Unlike his debut however, Mallrats takes a similar premise and aims squarely for the teenage comedy market.
Soon, however, thoughts turn to getting their ladies back and the dynamic duo will have to fight mall security, a fashionable male (Ben Affleck) and a game show producer (Michael Rooker) in order to succeed.
There is some sex type content, not very much however and its quite mild (I think) but I think it could have done without it, however that's just me I like my intercourse scenes absent and visible mammary glands blurred.
If you are anything like my brother however (who is the total opposite in that area), you will enjoy these bits.
Most of the movie, however, takes place in timeline A.
For example the shots of the 'haunted' house might have been melodramatic and clichÃ©, however this recurring image was often offset with the wheeling stars overhead, creating an ethereal quality that set it apart.
No mater how good a film may look, however, its ultimate worth is based on whether or not it delivers to goods in terms of creativity and its ability to hold your attention (and suspend your disbelief...).
The plot does not sound enticing, in fact, it sounds rather plain, however, this is not case fortunately.
Marc, however, becomes somewhat obsessed with proving that he DID have a mustache, which worries those around him until he's asked to seek help.
I had been looking to purchase the movie for years, however, I found it was never released for VHS or DVD production.
Unhappily, however, aspects of his dream remain, most particularly, a post card that he wrote out in his dream.
This one however, exceeded my expectations by a margain.
Within the group of small budget horror movies I'd give this movie an eight, however, given that this is not a cult movie and there are so many better movies out there, I've settled on a 3.
But however, it kept my attention for the whole running time.
You, however, are in the majority, as this thing runs, not walks, straight to video.
It remains an excellent movie, however, and if you don't get it maybe you ought to watch again.
The demon itself is pretty darn lame, however.
i was so looking forward to this film... methought the title held much interesting promise... i was cozy to it at first, however, as the film progressed, I couldn't understand why the director chose to propagandize rather than tell a story depicting the human condition... all the material was there to tell a great story of two peoples, but instead the director prostituted himself to covert politics instead of the art of storytelling... too bad.... the content turned me off as i was never given a chance to make my own mind up, but rather I was constantly told how to 'feel and think' about the story's dilemma... the director missed a great artistic opportunity... that's why i'm giving it a score of 1(awful)...but I did like the score!
In the process the Saratoga is destroyed, along with his wife (however his son Jake does survive).

It was good, however, for chuckling at.
During a visit to his Granny Wendy in London however, his past returns to haunt him when the villainous Captain Hook kidnaps the kids and holds them to ransom.
An unlikely best of all however is Hoffman - whose method overacting I can normally just about manage to stomach - who is dazzling as the swashbuckling, iniquitous Captain James Hook, complete with batty wig, wall-to-wall histrionics ("Don't try to stop me Smee !!
I must say however, the film owes 50% of its credit to John Williams.
The one performance that stands out, however, is The Joker, voiced by Mark Hamill.
It may be a cartoon but sometimes a great story is strong enough however it is delivered and this is a great example of this.
The former love of his life Andrea Beaumont with her father comes back to Gotham as Bruce Wayne falls for her again, however there's trouble stirring in town as an unknown and mysterious villain called The Phantasm is killing off gangster members one-by-one and The Joker (voiced by Mark Hamil) is next on his list as Batman must find this mystery killer or still be romancing his love.
This Batman is the one from my childhood however it's been a long time since I don't watch an episode from the animated series and frankly I don't remember a lot of it.
traitor has just been released in here..so i have just watched it..i found it on good intentions..especially surprised when i saw Steve martin's name as a writer..Don Cheadle was great..so Said was... but as a Muslim  being in mostly Muslim country(Turkey) i can easily understand there r many people are being used because of their faith..but most of Muslims have normal life..rare of them in those kind, though Islam; as every religion forbids to kill anyone even anything...the first important thing is being human...i know this, i can see this from here..but a European or a Japanese or an American person who has no knowledge or cultur about Islam what does he or she think?i accept as a Muslim we weren't able tell ourselves rightly to whole world but i think if Hollywood or the film makers want to seem pretty to Muslims or to understand and tell the world about real the Muslims, re-sit and re-think...when they r making films about Islam or Muslims; they should quit to write about agency, terrorism, bombs, poorness,weakness,revenge, sleeper agents.......etc..there r real Muslims never confirms because Ä±slam never confirms anything of these..normal lives r being lived...obey the rules..no "takÄ±yye"..its forbidden..its seem however u r..pls quit showing Muslim women ugly..as a good example look at Turkey..u can see really good looking but covered women...please read "Mevlana", "Said Nursi"..u will find great stories to take or adopt...please keep on taking films on this way so u can contribute the tolerate..understanding..
In the end however, it's this consistency in grit and cerebrally engaging tone that makes Traitor a far greater whole than the sum of its parts.
I don't want to be too harsh, however.
The movie quickly became bogged down with racial stereotyping, however: hostile blacks, lots of guns, women as sex objects.
Net Force, however, is a total disaster.
Kilner has other needs however that Pat can't supply and that his kids can't understand.
The film however is too short, there could have been more of the secondary characters like the King and the Duke and one or two scenes felt rushed.
She changes, however, when she realises that the management of the plant have a cavalier attitude towards the health and safety of their employees, particularly the risks of radioactive contamination, and that, worse still, they are doctoring x-ray photographs of the fuel rods in order to cover up potential defects that could prove disastrous.
There were however a few good battle scenes and some good acting.
The TV movie version of Washington Irving's classic American story diverges from the book in many ways, however this is a great movie.
When it came to piecing the whole movie together, however, it just fell flat.
Like all of these modern quasi whodunits however, Foyle's War withholds from the audience some if not most of the requisite tools needed to solve the crime, no surprise there.
Curiously, both the Leslie Halliwell and Leonard Maltin film guides give the running-time as a mere 59 minutes; however, the two times I've watched the film, it's always been by way of the full-length 66-minute version!
These delightful economies, however, may have more to do with RKO than Mr. Lewton, since Julia Dean's Victorian chairs may also be spotted in the non Lewton productions, "Beware My Lovely" and "Experiment Perilous."
In that film Jean Brooks has unpainted fingernails throughout, however, the close-up of her (alleged) hand moving across the stucco wall during the Greenwich Village chase sequence (inexexplicably) features a hand with dark nail paint.
Sadly, Grace does not seem to able to publicly express her points very well (we are told by former teachers that she's a very good writer, however), and the filmmakers don't help matters much by painting her pretty much as totally alone in her beliefs (despite the fact these pro-sex "feminist" arguments have been around for at least 15 years).
At this point the movie seemed to be getting better, however the camera work is so jumpy that I had a hard time following the picture.
It may be a bit inappropriate to place all of them on the same step however, there are common aspects which i consider important - the scripting, final plot and directing.
Well acted, but characterization is a tad sparse, however that's all right as the film is tense and tightly made so it's not a huge problem.
Clutch, however, is more concerned about trying to create a welcome home party for his daughter while Kay in particular seems more concerned about trying to capture the attention of Clutch himself.
My hopes were dashed, however.
deserves credit for his audacity alone, his unwillingness to compromise his vision, however unacceptable it might be.
At first viewing I though this was the weakest of director Todd Solondz films, however like all of his works, it's impossible to forget once seen.
So I wasn't expecting all that much from the movie, however City of Ember is not by any means a bad movie.
The set design, however, is really what sets the film apart.
Set many years on from this event however, much of the inhabitants of Ember are unaware of their origin and all the more scared of it as a result.
If there's one thing that Kenan manages to get across here however, it is the imagination and vision that is present in the script and story.
In the end however, all these elements simply come together to create one thing; an adventure.
With `The Unsaid', however, you can expect to be tied to your seat the whole time as the plot develops.
The main character, a paleontologist named Benjamin Kasparian, however, has a really admirable and stoical attitude towards dying.
While the Japanese had no problem slaughtering those that opposed them, however they were also human and scared as hell.
Take my word however, this film is worth getting a fake I.D.
I personally dislike the raw sexual scenes, however, the film is still a masterpiece!
The real meat of the film, however, was within Ang Lee's direction, Tang's acting, and of course, the intense sex scenes that powerfully depicted lust, no holds barred, with anger, frustration, hate, and all the other negative emotions associated with it.
The beast, however, seems doomed, as he shuts himself away, alone in his castle, taking up a reclusive existence far from everyone and everything.
My personal favourite part of the film, however, is the extended rock and roll medley they perform, along with Billy Preston, in the Apple Studios.
(I do have to give my head a shake at Linda McCartney bringing her daughter Heather to this session, however...a rock and roll recording session is NO PLACE to bring a child, what with the attendant drug taking, swearing and looning about...poor Heather must have been scarred for life!)
There have been many excellent innovative and intelligent rock bands that have come and gone since, many borrowing and adapting from the Beatles back catalogue Â however I don't count the many cash-in rip-off bands such as Oasis.
He still has some- however rare- sound opinions but he sure as hell ain't open minded and generally focuses on increasing the current smokescreen put up by this dirty white house.
He is however anti republican, but if you pay attention to his show you see he is just as hard on the democrats as the republicans.
It is, however, of some historical interest with regard to visual narrative.
Could have been better however if it was written as a story instead of trying to make it like a Sunday Paper story.
The biggest problem, however, is Robert Wagner.
Back in the 80s, however, things were a little different: easy money came in the form of sequels, which were churned out in rapid succession, but remakes were rare and a surprising amount of care went into their production.
Effectiveness aside, however, I believe that the mark of exceptional horror is when the question stems from a concern for the characters' wellbeing, and not your own.
What makes this whole affair really outstanding, however, is his psychological transformation: the truly disturbing thing is how front and centre the humanity of these characters and their world is kept.
This is the right cast however and they keep the laughs coming.
While watching however, I never really got the impression that this was going to be much of a horror film.
The finale is quite effective, however.
Boris Karloff is quite good in the "lead", however, and the supporting cast is competent if unexciting.
viewed movie as NO GOOD DEED: I found the plot to be somewhat plausible, however, there were many errors in the movie.
Jack Friar is looking for a blond-haired, blue-eyed male, and Doug Hutchison (character Hoop) thinks it is him -- however, Hoop is dyed blonde-haired with brown eyes.
Grace Zabriskie and Joss Ackland steal the show, however, with their portrayals of a thief-couple in their twilight years.
It is depressing, however, to realize that Hamilton died at such a young age and, all kidding aside, that is a very sad loss.
Sorry, but none of the three has much magnetism -- however good their acting.
:)  The first part of the story reminded me of Harry Potter and the second of Lord of the Rings, however it solid on it's own and has enough unique features, so you wouldn't be bored.
That title is ironic in the sense that his anti-heroic protagonist really is, whatever we may say or think, or however bestial his behavior, a child of God, while Ki-duk Kim's title "Bad Guy" ("Nabbeun namja") is also ironic in the sense that Han-ki is by societal standards certainly a bad guy, but by naturalistic (or cosmic) standards no better or worse than the pretty college girl.
The overall impression however is of quite an achievement, and one which is perhaps more mature about the unpredictable nature of love and attraction than the director has been earlier.
As said earlier, this movie is not for everyone, however if the concept sounds like something that interests you, then you should enjoy this film.
There are 5 stories that somehow connect but not really intertwine (this is the deceptive part), however, I liked all of them, the movie puts a especial emphasis in bizarreness, but it doesn't go too far.
Wallace Beery had some lean times after motion pictures transitioned to sound, however he got a new lease on his career at MGM, and it turned out that his coarse voice attracted fans rather than repelled them.
All in all, however, the pure brilliance of the writing is ultimately ruined by the poor acting and subpar direction.
About halfway through however the story becomes a murder mystery and eventually a courtroom drama, and the narrative fragments as we see the points-of-view of various witnesses to supposed crimes.
To me, DF3 had the best plot of the 3 films, however the lack of Chuck Norris brought the intellectual achievement down.
All wasn't lost however, I personally found it very unique and intriguing.
It's important to realize that however engaging the film is and notable the actors are in the Egyptian film world, it's made out of dross, not gold.
After the revolution, however, "storage sheds on the rooftop were rented out to poor families--a sort of sky-high slum."
Dylan's gift has quickly gotten him into hot water with the wrong kind of people, however, and to stay healthy (read: `Alive') he flees to England, where he meets Jez.
She stays on board, however, when Dylan convinces her that they are something like modern day Robin Hoods-- that the money they're `raising' is going to orphans.
The one who draws the attention, however, is the lovely and charismatic Kate Beckinsale, who is beguiling in the role of Georgie.
Upon arrival, they are branded whores and gang-raped--the third one, however, is allowed to "join them" and goes back to kill the fourth.
After one hour of walking around naked and making out with each other, one of them disappears when going out to take photos... People who are not in favor of Jess Franco's cinema will probably think of this as the worst film ever made; however, the film's incredible weirdness and lack of any logic whatsoever are also the elements that make it fun (in addition to its primary quality, the constant sleaze and female nudity).
This film may well be described as utter crap; however, I cannot deny I somehow enjoyed it.
It is not, however, really a 'war' picture.
It is undoubtedly a pity, however, that Leslie Howard's directorial career was cut short by enemy action; in his choice to serve his country in wartime cinema rather than pursue a Hollywood career, he proved himself to be a weapon of considerable effectiveness, and it is ironic in the context of this film that, as in the case of R.J.Mitchell, it proved to be a choice that may well have cost him his own life.
Having seen the movie before reading the book, however, I thought it was an interesting story.
they are similar however... enough for me to know most of what was being said after watching the movie for a while.
For now, however, those of us who find grave gaps in the official investigation must continue to question the intent of a government that desperately needed a "Pearl Harbor" level excuse to once again invade the Middle East.
There are also some pretty good comedic lines and situations too, however, for my taste it just wasn't there and it did not hit me right.
The cast is virtually unknown, however, among the bunch there are notably okay performances by Krista Morin, Marc Trottier and Ennis Esmer.
Some of their sons, however good looking, are sometimes both stupid and heterosexual.
This setting, however, is very appealing since it's an island with only an ancient lighthouse on it and the people are survivors of a sunk prison ship.
In reality, however, it is unlikely that a Jewish woman would have been a teacher in a largely protestant public school, and even less likely that she would have entered into an interfaith marriage with the only protest being raised by a small foreign boy.
The funny thing is, the main character rambles on as if he is supposed to be intelligent with a bunch of 50 cent words at best...and funny enough the only reason i rented this movie was the fact that the box description claimed a dog<which looked a little like the taco bell dog with a mohawk with an african american accent> actually talked, and told him things to do...well the dog never physically talks, it just talks TELEKENETICALLY...i would tell you more..but half way through the film my eyes began to close as well did my fiances...so at least this movie serves as a sleep aid...That sadly however is its only purpose.
Here, however, I would not praise that much Lysette Anthony: I admit she is beautiful, she gives a memorable performance.
My husband was disappointed with the ending, I, however, was overjoyed and cried.
The excecution of the plot, however, suffers from a number of handicaps.
They however are fighting with each other and working the nerve of one-an-other.
