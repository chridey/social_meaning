This is not your traditional love story however, and in fact that emotion seems to have very little to do with the pairing on the screen in Love Me Or Leave Me.
Most of the killing early on is done by the Bad cop, who is in fact a good guy.
But in fact this story of living dead could have been much better filmed in the hands of more talented director than Robert Zemeckis of whom I can't remember having seen any good movie till now.
Unfortunately, Kravaal's nemesis is a greedy nephew who wants the inheritance of his patient in cryogenic sleep, and this maggot rips up and burns the exact written details of the solution which would in fact help prolong human life.
The character that Steve plays here is, in fact, only a certain plant away from being the same character that he played in Lock, Stock; namely, a wimp who happens to be in a world of criminals.
The whole movie, in fact, is rather slow.
Moore claimed, in fact, that he actually toned down the violence of the Natives compared to what he found in his research.
I've not read this nor any of his other novels, but I am told that on several occasions he explored the idea of a priest losing his faith, and I wonder if perhaps, in spite of his outward angst against the Irish clergy, he wasn't in fact (like so many ex-Christian writers) struggling to cast of his guilt and to justify abandoning his own vocation.
), the film presents a dimension of the country, in fact the continent, that is hard to fathom otherwise.
"Turks fruit" and "Keetje Tippel" (and in a way also Verhoeven's earlier movie "Wat zien ik") show some similarities in the way the story is told but it are in fact of course two totally different movies.
Whenever I watch Blackadder I simply do not stop laughing throughout the whole thirty minutes, the jokes come thick and fast, in fact they probably come a little too fast since quite often you'll find yourself in stitches at one joke and be laughing for so long you'll miss the next one.
Horror films are few and far between these days; in fact it's almost a dead genre in the west.
When first looking at The Orphanage's plot outline I was less than enthralled, in fact I almost didn't watch it.
Like ALUCARDA, the film doesn't dwell on period reconstruction (and, in fact, we only realize when the story actually takes place via a reference towards the end to the Inquisition); still, a few social/racial issues are raised nonetheless with the presence of the two black nuns/maids, who are mistreated even by their white 'colleagues'!
Apparently whoever did the costumes wasn't alive then, because there was no attempt to find any clothing for the actors that actually resembles the fashions of that era, and sorry, but Cyndi Lauper and Blondie were not hot singers in the late 1980s or early 1990s, in fact, their careers were dead.
This is in fact a ruse, as Dillon, Dutch's former team member who now works for the CIA, actually wants Dutch and his team to go in and destroy a guerilla terrorist camp who have vital government information.
Buscemi plays himself, or what he probably would have been had he not found his talent in movie making, namely, a "loser" trapped in a downward spiral of unemployment, drugs, alcohol, and loneliness, familiar ingredients of endless movies, TV docudramas, talk shows, and news, all humbuggery and false preaching; so familiar, in fact, as to pose an American fixation, something we see so much of that we no longer see at all.
There have been few other films I've seen that made caused me to weep (big, macho guy that I am ;-)), particularly those that are often mis-labelled as "war movies" -- "The Killing Fields" being another of this ilk -- when, in fact, they're really (if we're labelling things) human interest films that come about because of a war or conflict.
No one here is a good guy, in fact everyone is bad to a degree, especially when you understand who everyone is (a fact not readily understandable to the casual viewer).
And I have no complaints about the special effects, in fact most of them are very good.
Though in fact this one could easy be 30% shorter simply for the riddim sake.
This film about a murder case, about the trial after it, is one of these American films, in fact a TV mini-series, on a real case that does not go in the normal direction, the direction of what we all should think not truth is but justice should be.
None are overly challenging or intelligent, and in fact the AI can't do much more than move around or take random cover, but it wouldn't matter anyway, since you can't die.
(and yes,The Fury borrows form Carrie,another DePalma film.in fact some of the sequences in Scanners were nearly identical to those in the Fury,but were actually not as graphic.i think The Fury is actually a superior film.Amy Irving is terrific,and steals the show.the supporting cast is also good,with Kirk Douglas,Carrie Snodgress,John Cassavetes,Andrew Stevens,and Fiona Lewis.Charles Durning also has a small role.an unrecognizable Melody Thomas Scott(Nikki Newman from the long running soap The Young and the Restless)also has what amounts to a cameo.but it's Dennis Franz in his very brief appearance that is hysterical in a bit of comic relief performance.as for the movie itself,if you have a weak stomach or don't like horror films,i suggest you avoids this.but if you like being scared,pop this in late at night for maximum effect.my vote for The Fury is a 9/10 P.S.
Needless to say after a few minutes i soon realised that it was in fact comedy gold.
He claims it is deep and inspirational, when in fact it is just shoddy and awful.
Even if Daniel Day couldn't make it, I think I would have rather spent more time with the original cast than wasting time with Danny Bonaducci (which is not to say he's not a good guy, he just doesn't belong in a Nanny reunion...in fact they could have brought on some of the repeating characters from the show, like Roger Clinton or Fran's psychiatrist).
A perfect movie for anyone who remembers their first crush, in fact, a perfect movie for any occasion.
(this is firstly a function of Margaret Gibson's source story, which is told from the author's POV) At first you get squirmy and expect that the parallel this character articulates between her and drag queen Russell - "We're both crazy" - will be used as an excuse for the good old queer self-loathing, but in fact this is in a different tradition, that King-of-Hearts, madness-as-sentimental-symbol-for-nonconformity thing that was in vogue then.
There's no real pacing, in fact, the entire movie feels more like a stroll in the park.
Personally, I like women to look natural and not wear thick makeup (or any, in fact); I feel that they are much prettier without it.
And all the while Murphy is a total pro- robbed of an Emmy severely in fact- and there ends up being more for him to do as an actor, in playing a sympathetic but flawed character who as TJ describes about his running for president is like a "lifestyle choice."
This recognition that the powers of the camera-wielding Lumieres are in fact limited, that they are not as omniscient as they once thought they were, is perhaps dramatised in the figure of the father, one of the brothers, one of the first great director-stars, paving the way for Chaplin, Keaton and Welles.
in fact it was really cool and Lindsay played a totally lovable character.
It's not your typical movie about people from 'Vegas, in fact it's not your typical "feel good" movie either.
Furthermore, is Pauline's heart filled with human love for Neel or does she in fact have a yen for him?
In another scene the bored women of the island are seen talking about how close Pauline and Neel have gotten and how this must inspire Jean to be a better lover; but in fact we can see that what the presence of Neel is doing is lighting a fire under Pauline.
Auguste Neel was in fact guillotined in Saint-Pierre in the nineteenth century after waiting months for the means of execution to arrive from Martinique.
Monsoon Wedding was my one and only, in fact.
Here, it's actually out of desperation - in fact almost all the characters here reek of it, in exploiting children on the streets and enticing them with significant sums of money in order to satisfy the whims of some rich clients.
They have a problem as a family, in fact they have everything but they don't manage to feel happy.
Reading some of the reviews here reminds of some critic reviews of various children's movies, wherein they complain about childish plots, low humor or movies that didn't hold their attention, forgetting that they are, in fact, reviewing a children's movie.
The reason the film is called Heavy Metal isn't even readily apparent (unless you've done your research and discovered that it is, in fact, based off of something else).
But these are not flaws, in fact to anyone with a fun-loving nature and imagination these are virtues.
There are in fact so many musical numbers and so many A&C routines in this short film, there's barely room enough for a plot which involves a playboy Lee Bowman, his former chauffeur AlanCurtis, and Jane Frazee the camp hostess they both want to get better acquainted with.
The best parts of the film are, in fact, the interactions between the two starsÂ The story holds up perfectly and entertains the viewer in every wayÂ Martin Brest does bring out the realistic, funny and moving sides of his likable charactersÂ Suspense is maintained to the very endÂ
While cinema is the vehicle, but this is not a film about make believe - in fact it is doing the opposite of what films are normally about and using itself as a means to get us to believe.
I enjoyed it so much, in fact, that I watched it again a few days later.
Beethovens 2nd is a pretty good sequel, not as good as the first as far structure wise, but it comes pretty close for me.Its fun, entertaining, and somewhat funny.Also it actually follows up the first one in a good way.It was very new and fresh in a way, and some what believable, that really the first one and second one capture in a right way.It was good to see the return of the original cast members, and to add in some new characters like Regina( who was a cool villain).It was really funny at times, especially at some points from Bonnie Hunt( who's character I love).I didn't care much for the ending, and some points it was a little too out there and unbelievable, and the dogs annoyed me at some points, as did some characters.Well, overall if you liked the first one you'll like this, and in fact this is probably the last good one sequel in the series.
So flat in fact that what should be construed as humor comes across as mean-spirited, creepy and obviously to my eyes not funny.
Producer-director William Castle may have too often been dismissed in critical circles as a Grade Z Hitchcock or for having been little more than a gimmick-laden showman during his peak years, but nobody could have sensibly predicted that he would eventually be saving his greatest trick for last; in fact, SHANKS was Castle's directorial swan-song and it might well be his best film as well!
Photography as an art form is really beautiful because it captures the little memories - of things that may seem simple to people but are in fact meaningful to us.
And in fact we don't get to see it, we just get it said to Salami Coker (in typical subservient boson role) after he's faced a risible "giant walrus".
She discovers her loving uncle is in fact the man who made her, and they set off on a cross country trek to Mexico to find out why she is sick.
There is a lot of shouting, fighting and sex, and it appears that some of the humans are, in fact, aliens.
The movie is never boring as we see a group of seven twenty-somethings first at a party who then get drugged and attempted to be captured and murdered by a group of loony satanics; there's a twist in the tail here as two of the young twenty-something "friends" are in fact part of the satanic group drafted in to capture the others.
This film is not an action movie like the title might imply, far from in in fact, it is slow moving yet relentless in it's growing tension.
Many people may label her as "eccentric", "odd" and "rebellious", and while she has been all of these things, she strikes me most as being INTELLIGENT..in fact probably TOO intelligent compared to most people.
I do not think that Muslims were treated badly in this movie, in fact just the opposite; I think Omar Sherif's character has a regalness and a curiosity reminiscent of Sean Connery's character in The Wind and The Lion; by the way these are both great classically trained actors in roles as strong Muslim leaders.
Does it matter that Wallace Shawn is in fact not a Dinosaur?
This film restores one's faith that youth is not in fact wasted on the young.
A Lot of people think this is the worst of the series, i would have to say no, in fact it's one of the best of the series, it's at times creepy, hilarious and overall just a lot of fun, the pool party is especially fun times!.
That's right, Pearl Harbor in 1941, and the morning of December 6, in fact.
I think that many of us have a tendency to over-analyze these types of movies, when, in fact, we should just sit back and enjoy the experience.
While racism understandably raises its ugly head during wartime, with epithets and insults hurled in both directions, in fact this Japanese actor portrayed a Japanese warrior at his finest--someone whom Japanese viewers would be proud of.
They seemed to have been friends when they were younger, but Kresten had moved, and was determined to erase all traces of his family (in fact, the reason he must go home when his father dies is to make sure his brother is not harmed).
If this were a drama, it would be horribly misanthropic, but in fact, C.A.
One might say that the two men don't say much, but when they do it is to the point, and in fact it is what they don't say that matters.
The real Queen Margaret who was his Hapsburg cousin did in fact have considerable influence over domestic and foreign policy in Spain.
Please, I'm not completely disregarding his acting ability, because he did in fact make some pretty good movies before this one.
She proved that she did in fact have very real potential as a comedic actress.
When one of the crew members hallucinates presumably due to the release of sour gas and dies in the cold the others realise that there's something wrong with a lot of weird things happenings with no explanation.This movie gives out an important message which is not clearly shown in fact it is hidden and left for you to figure out.
It's just goofy and pointless, and the final "twist" at the end is telegraphed almost from the very beginning (in fact, one character early on describes aloud exactly what the twist will end up being).
David Niven is in a small role - he's on his way up as a younger Colman - in fact, he was supposed to play Colman's brother in Lost Horizon.
The part is actor-proof, in fact Rin-Tin-Tin could play the part and walk away with it!
Each & ever one of them plus others were about flawless under John Cromwells fine , polished direction., The Sets were magnificent, so good in fact, they were used in the 1952 version) I will also have a review of this version.
With such an outstanding, marquee cast that lives up to its advanced billing and then some, it is not difficult to understand why this film was such a rousing success when it premiered in 1937; so successful, in fact, that it was copied verbatim by MGM 15 years later after it purchased the rights from Selznick.
But in fact, this is pretty much the movie I was hoping for, full of Irish charm and blarney, beautiful filmed and full of magic and wonder.
So original, in fact, it sometimes threatens to come apart at the seams and explode in front of the audience.
The plot itself is nothing very new, and is a kind of supernatural take on Agatha Christie's "Ten Little Indians" -- Seven Japanese girls venture off to visit Grandmother in her big, spooky house, unaware that the house is in fact a demon that consumes virgins.
This movie isn't complicated, in fact it really doesn't have a plot other than the illegal cross country car race, but it's fast-paced and entertaining throughout.
It in fact, does not even look as good at the GITS movie.
Poor Frederic is the slave of duty and although he has lived 21 years is in fact a little boy of 5.
Back in the 70s i had to have seen all those party movies , for example, The Van and The Gas Pump Girls, and lifeguard was so much of a breath of fresh air along side of those others, i grew up hanging out at redondo beach and Hermosa beach California which is where this movie was filmed, in fact on ricks tower u see the letters HR i believe that stands for Hermosa/redondo and this is also 1 of the beaches that mike love and Dennis Wilson of the beach boys used to hang out at as they lived in near by Hawthorne, I have this movie on VHS not available on DVD yet, and I watch it at least once a month, as i live in new york now and this movie brings back some special memories of my fun days, i even love that song time and tide in this movie, and watching him drive to the beach in his stingray passing all those very familiar businesses, wow, well if your nostalgic then i don't have to explain the feeling.
So good, in fact, that I'm struggling to find one bad thing to say about it.
After the Soviet Union collapsed, it was found that those fears were not unfounded-that in fact as a "doomsday" weapon the Soviets had secretly stockpiled massive amounts of Smallpox to create just such a last-ditch situation had they been on the losing side of a WW3 that never fortunately occurred.
The director tries to be clever and uses flash filming to try and "enhance" the scene but in fact it's so annoying and unnecessary, it'll probably give people elliptic fits as well.
I am not a musician myself, in fact I am a student in art history, but I really enjoyed this picture.
And nothing short of a massive landing of alien space crafts in all the major capitals and cities on earth, to show the people on earth that they in fact do exist and are real, will finally make the US Government reveal what really happened at Roswell almost sixty years ago.
Not much artistic license taken, which when dealing with something based in fact, is much appreciated.
There is no blood, gore or nudity so as an exploitation film it's completely worthless too, in fact I think I'd probably struggle to even call She Freak a horror film either as it contains virtually no horror elements at all.
These people were not in need of saving (at least temporally), but are in fact a thriving intelligent community of people who do not need the things of the world.
But facts remain facts no matter how many misguided people attempt to change or refute them, and in the name of humanity itself we owe all those who have suffered in the killing fields of the world the dignity of truth.
At least this film doesn't feature tiresome morality speeches and here the dialogues are, in fact, surprisingly controversial most of the time.
Even so it's well worth watching and whilst in my memory this was all about dressed up cars battling it out, this is , in fact, much more a cynical view of the director's homeland.
Exhausted, in fact.
We, and Stingo, learn from Nathan's brother that he is in fact suffering from mental illness and that he is only employed by the pharmaceutical company in a lowly clerical position, not as a research scientist, although Sophie remains unaware of these facts.
Stacy Edwards as the deaf Christine is also very strong; in fact, when I saw her in another movie speaking normally I almost fell out of my chair.
He is seemingly cordial to talk to but behind the smiling facade lies a loathsome, callous, spiteful fellow - one who is ruthless without showing any sign of remorse - in fact, he seems to derive great pleasure and pride from inflicting anguish on others, especially women.
So patiently executed in fact, I was led into a mid-film, historically surprising plot twist without a clue it was coming.
I've read most of the other reviews on this board to know that I'm not alone on this, in fact it's pretty much an entirely one sided view that this groaner sets the standard for space junk in a vacuum.
Over time, clues emerge that cause his family and others to suspect that he may in fact be Communist who is passing government secrets to the Kremlin.
I've never had a movie surprise me like this, in fact, I'd say this is the only animated sequel I've seen that actually meets the standard of quality that its original set.
Some commentators smirk at the stiff upper-lipped-ness of the characters portrayed, but these attitudes are, in fact, very authentic.
The Nazi propaganda machine made him a martyr which in fact he was and the British public was given something to cheer about in those beginning days of World War II.
The fact that the poster for this one has a big picture of Vinnie Jones on it - when in fact he's not the lead - if forgivable.
But it will in fact go down as one of my favorite episodes, even though it was so sad.
Avoid at all costs... in fact burn any copies found... on no accounts waste one and a half hours of your life on this thing!
The film is in fact only half Giallo and plays more like a Poliziotteschi (Italian police procedure film), we only get brief glimpses of the leather clad killer as he tries to cover up his identity by killing those who might be able to give him away.
Despite the sordid subject matter the film refrains from sleaze, it is in fact fairly restrained stuff, with its most discomforting moments involving tape recordings rather than anything visual.
JOAN CRAWFORD returned to MGM for TORCH SONG after a decade of other films at other studios, in a role that paints her character as tough-as-nails--in fact, so tough that you expect her to take out a gun at any moment and shoot anyone who disagrees with her bossy persona.
Check out the eyebrows that look like they belong on Queen Kong, the fruit-like color of her hair, the blood red lips, and in fact the she-devil enhanced shape of her lips themselves.
As much as Jenny dislikes Tye she in fact becomes secretly found of Tye by him treating her like any other "broad" and not giving into her demands even if it means him getting fired from his job as the plays musical director.
The super cool Tye does in fact have Jenny's number and knows how to play it as good has he plays his piano but it's Jenny, with the help of her beer swelling mom, who discovers Tye's weak point which has the calm cool and completely in charge of things Tye fall apart like the cheap, from a crack a jack box, camera that he really is!
***SPOILERS*** In the end with both Jenny and Tye realizing what imperfect persons they really are they in fact come together and fall in love with each other.
There is, in fact no goof.
This treats the original material with respect & adds it's own ideas without drastically altering things which is how a remake should be I suppose, I really liked the ironic ending where the heroic Ben was in fact wrong & if they'd listened to the selfish Harry they would have all been rescued.
Surprisingly, he doesn't allow gore to overpower the action, preferring to concentrate on characterisation and atmosphere instead (in fact, what little bloodletting there is tends to be rather restrained and those seeking excessive amounts of entrail eating would be better off looking elsewhere).
The point I wanted also to make is that, unlike your "factual errors" there were in fact several Regular German Army units and soldiers who were later brought into the Waffen SS.
The dancing is much more brightly lit and coherently edited than in "Moulin Rouge"; in fact, if I have one complaint about "French Cancan," it's that the whole thing is a little too Technicolor.
That in fact occurred very late in the game.
I mean Bollywood comes out with more movies than Hollywood every year, and they seem to only generally get attention in India, and even in India, International films seem to be more popular than their own (judging by their box office results)I am not a racist in any way whatsoever, in fact I have at least 7 friends who were born in India and came to America during their childhood.
Errors abound...the Nazi "Tiger" tank is, in fact, an old US M-48.
Gene Tierney plays a beautiful kleptomaniac married to a successful psychoanalyst who appears more vulnerable than she in fact is.
As happens often in Besson's work, in fact, the female character is put into a realm of personal chaos that is created by or leads to murder and, at the least, harrowing times with the one she cares for or about (i.e.
I was never a fan of "The Land Before Time" (in fact I hated that movie), who has many similarities to "Dinosaur".
I found it impossible to take this movie seriously, in fact, I laughed throughout most of it.
Actor and good friend Ben Gazzara at first turned down Cassavettes in taking the part of the doomed Cosmo Vitelli but when he was told by Cassavettes that it in fact was really about himself he did it as a favor to him.
The choreography is beautiful ( in fact, I watch the opening sequence multiple times in a row) and the music is absolutely amazing, ranging from classical to neoclassical to rap.
I stumbled on the DVD two weeks ago and was absolutely thrilled-so thrilled, in fact, that I got on the internet to see if this film affected anyone else as strongly as it did me, or if I am having a midlife crisis; thank goodness, there are others!!
The film is definitely '70s but not in a super-dated cheesy way, in fact the outfits Denise Miller as Jessie wears could be current now!
In Greene's novel, the seemingly naive, idealistic American who is in (then) French Indochina for vaguely idealistic operative is in fact a sinister undercover CIA operative in cahoots with an unscrupulous general.
These are so hot, in fact, I'd rather watch EMMANUELLE movies than most X-rated films.
This story has an edge, a serious steely edge, sometimes subtle, sometimes not, but definitely always there, and Les (Ron Howard's character) and his two buddies learn some things about life the hard way, harder in fact than one might have expected in a Ron Howard movie in those days.
Real western historians in fact are still trying to separate truth from myth about all these people because of these stories.
The film in question only reaffirms my viewpoint in fact and proves to be a fairly lacklustre affair affair at best.
Similarly, the filmmakers' methods undermine their intentions, if their intentions were in fact as noble as many of the other reviewers here seem to think.
this is quite superior to most of Disney's other films in that it is good for adults as well as children, in fact this was probably the only Disney film i liked as a kid (bedknobs and broomsticks is an exception) i usually preferred Disney's cartoons as opposed to their films i have to give this a 7 out of 10 far better than it's three sequels, although Herbie goes to Monte Carlo is nearly as good
This is a true Disney Classic, in fact Walt Disney had a hand in developing the story but, sad to say, never lived to see it hit the big screen.
And the perfect showcase for Miss Tallulah Bankhead, bitch-goddess of Broadway, who never conquered Hollywood but is forever enshrined in this performance, where's she basically playing the image she herself created -- "Dahhlings" and all -- if not, in fact, playing Herself!
Gangland boss Harold Shand (Bob Hoskins) is on the verge of something big in his native London's docklands;replacing the declining port-side areas with vast new modern developments and buildings,even with a view to holding a future Olympic Games there.There is however a considerable fly in the ointment;would-be mafia backers are concerned as Harold's manor and underlings are subjected to a campaign of murder and bombings,later revealed to be the work of the IRA,who think Shand was responsible for the deaths of several of their members (when in fact he wasn't).An enraged Harold plans his revenge,but should he go ahead and do so?
Hoskins in fact often makes this most unpleasant of characters sympathetic (with some witty one-liners part of his repertoire) in the midst of similarly unsavoury individuals.His grotesque arrogance and megalomania however get the better of him when he somehow thinks he can take on the even more ferocious and brutal elements within the IRA.He is warned of the risks by one of his closest associates,fresh-faced Jeff (who is killed by Harold in a savage outburst) but to no avail.The irony of course,is that Harold himself did not instigate this chaos;it the aforementioned Jeff and one of his most trusted friends and associates,Colin,a homosexual,who fell prey to the dual temptations of sex and money while in Belfast (doing an errand without Shand's knowledge or approval),placing Harold's business plans in dire jeopardy.
in fact in one scene he quotes his own book, while pretending to be reading it from someone else's But that's not the point.
The judgments they have made on the film are based on it being a realistic comedy when in fact it is a farce.
He just didn't have a lot of patience when it came to certain factors.
People don't understand each other and in fact sometimes they don't want to.
Watching the out-takes, though, you notice that, in fact, that is not even remotely the case.
This was in fact so damn tedious that the director was forced to include as many as five pathetic sex scenes featuring the same 'great-oak' couple.
But it also stands on its own much more than some similiar Nightmare knockoffs (Leprechaun comes to mind, in fact this film plays like a much more effective Leprechaun 4: Lep in the Hood).
The whole film is in fact an operatic affair with technicalities deluxe.
Also, the vulgar humor associated with the genre only makes itself felt in the scenes taking place on the set of an erotic movie and, later, in a hippie commune; in fact, the film's tone is generally quite serious - but this doesn't mean that the hard-boiled dialogue, which so characterizes the poliziotteschi, has been downplayed (thus raising the occasional chuckle, especially among those fluent in Italian).
now you may be thinking this is just another senseless weed comedy that goes no where, but in fact you are wrong.
Daniel Karslake is in fact a gay man so he relates to a lot of the issues that his subjects had to deal with.
The first and most important thing to say about DRIVE-IN MASSACRE is that it is, in fact, a very poorly done movie.
A plausible climax determining who between two obvious suspects might in fact be the real killer would've at least provided a satisfying conclusion to a rather poorly conceived horror film.
But the buoyant Patten is a real find, one of the best things in the picture in fact, clearly a talent to watch, Lew's more restrained performance allowing his co star his head.
in fact, the only things crumb doesn't offer are apologies.
This got lambasted by liberal film critics when it came out, of course, just as Dirty Harry had three years previously, but what's interesting about it today is how low-key the attacks on liberal values are, and in fact the film really doesn't go after anything except on-the-street violence.
Each of the multi-ethnic characters is surrounded by irony, as each time a scene rewinds from another's perspective we find that the characters are not in fact what the other(s) perceive them to be, despite the actions that brought them to intersect.
Another film might setup Paul as a meek, hard-working, likable guy who gets stuck in bad situations Â when in fact Paul is a confident jerk who probably deserves what is coming to him.
I could tell it would be a stereotypical teen comedy, and in fact I only watched it because it had Winnie Cooper in it, and I've been in love with her for as long as I can remember.
Connery is, in fact, a 1855 picaresque rogue.
Nothing new is added to the storyline, and in fact, things explained in the previous one get butchered up, to a bad effect.
?It wasn't inevitable that a third Candyman film would be made (highly likely,in fact) or that the Candyman franchise would branch out into the video market,but,all the same,what a mess...
Overall,this is,well,as I've said,the worst of the lot.It lacks the impending,desolate,isolated sense of dread of the original and the well orchestrated shocks of the sequel.It is,in fact,a sorry,pandering mess to these far superior two films that have gone before it and a definite video work all round.Avoid.
But on reading it, I was also struck by how much like a thriller it seemed, with its plot centred on a character who undergoes an experience both frightening and unusual; in fact, so unusual that it isolates him from others and forces him to handle it alone, with an ever-increasing sense of paranoia.
But in fact the plot isn't all that's wrong with this Holmes adventure-- nearly everything about it is misconceived.
It's in fact rather creepy, and the sets are beautiful.
Despite being a very big Sherlock Holmes fan, I try to be open minded about different interpretations, even if it's something I haven't thought of, especially so, in fact, if the actor plays it well enough.
This is one of the many instances* (it may have been the first one, in fact) where they play Franz Liszt's inimitable "Hungarian Rhapsody #2".
This movie had none of that and in fact made me cry.
As expected, Johnny does, in fact, come marching home finally and is made a Lieutenant.
So I was very pleasantly surprised to find that "Body/Antibody" was NOTHING like that, and, in fact was so engaging and well-done that the only time I consulted my watch, I was actually disappointed because I realized that the movie was almost over.
The plot is clever and interesting, in fact, I think it is one of the most original scripts, but interestingly, also one in which most people can relate to (or if not from New York, at least have heard about!).
Lightweight, certainly likable science-fiction fantasy that is good for the young crowd - in fact, it is okay for family viewing - but for me it was too slowly paced.
in fact, i understand the ending a little better now.
Well sorry it shouldn't be a political issue, but in fact it is.
(we later find out she is in fact a mutant and her parents live underground) Fry runs from Leela after being assigned work as a delivery boy (for he wished for a fresh start) and meets Bender the robot, who is programmed to bend, and has a selfish and indulgent persona, enjoying cigars and alcohol (incidentally the fuel of all robots).
I don't agree with that, in fact I strongly disagree.
The story is a bodice-ripper by Daphne de Maurier; in fact, Maureen O'Hara's bodice gets ripped not once but twice.
They all involved a gigantic Pokemon set on destroying the world, when in fact they have "good" intentions.
It is in fact one of the most finely crafted dramas ever put on the screen.
As a previous reviewer said, it is more "intense" than an Inconvenient Truth, but I hardly think any of the concepts presented are hard to take in - in fact, due to the number of interviews, the film manages to take the viewer through a range of issues regarding the state of the planet, without ever losing focus of its basic message - that we must do something NOW.

Even if it's accepted that an older woman could in fact love a little boy, the fact of the matter is, if the roles were reversed, and it was an adult man and a ten year old girl in the bathtub, women's groups from one side of the country to the other would be screeching at the top of their lungs that this film is nothing short of child molestation!
This is in fact quite an electrifying tale of survival.

I had never even heard of this film before Mondo Macabro announced their upcoming DVD release of it, so I was surprised to find - after I had already ordered it online - that Leonard Maltin had in fact reviewed it in his Guide and gave it his proverbial *1/2 rating usually allotted to such sensationalist fare.
Actually, it exudes a rather classy atmosphere (with cinematography by the renowned Roger Fellous) peculiar to French horror cinema Â similar, in fact, to other Mondo Macabro releases such as MILL OF THE STONE WOMEN (1960), THE DIABOLICAL DR. Z (1965), GIRL SLAVES OF MORGANA LE FAY (1971) and SEVEN WOMEN FOR Satan (1974).
Many critics have dogged this work since its release saying it spent to much time with the writers, when in fact, many millions of fans were clamoring for more back story and conceptual histories of these wonderfully Machiavellian Aliens.

However, these aspects are merely part of what is in fact an excellent series.

Since there was so much comment on the "fake gorillas," I think it is worth pointing out that these were not in fact intended to be gorillas but rather the fictional race of "great apes" that raised Tarzan in the Burroughs novels.

All of the actors in fact were just god awful.
Despite this I liked it, in fact I more than liked it.

I didn't find this payback revenge funny, in fact I found it overly cruel.

When this show first appeared, it seemed to be genuinely making an attempt to be fresh, interesting and relevant to modern Britain but it quickly became apparent that it is, in fact nothing more than an 1/2 hour Carry on film, only with less subtlety and innovation.
I don't know the reason why because undoubtedly the two writers can write a much better script ( well I hope they can) While the show attacks all groups and genders it is in fact riddled with political correctness in every sketch.
in fact, weÂ´ve decided to buy the video once itÂ´s out,because this will be just one of the feel-good movies one likes to see every once in a while.
However, there's an angle here that the emotion of the movie's last few minutes overpowers, and that is whether George's act of mercy does in fact represent the wisest or best decision, all things considered.
Again, I'm not saying George makes a blameworthy decision; in fact it comes across as a noble act of humane loyalty.
When I first saw an ad for this movie, in fact, I thought it was really good that they'd brought Jafar back, but having watched the whole thing, I wished they'd left him in the Cave of Wonders to chill out as planned at the end of the 1st one by the Genie.

Judging by the juicy title and exhilarating VHS-cover, "Cauldron of Death" appears to be a genuinely nasty horror film, but it is in fact a rough 'n tough revenge-thriller!
While maybe the ending is asking us to take a leap of faith that a people can put aside their feelings, embracing someone they find out had led the raid that positioned them for great misery and strife, hunger and suffering, believing that they can, in fact, overcome what ails them, I admire the filmmakers for the message they want to get across.
A very good comedy, able to refresh anyone under heavy stress, acting three good stars Cary Grant, Irene Dunne and the "cowboy" Randolph Scott, who in fact did a little as a supporting actor.
Only to get on his honeymoon to find that Ellen has in fact survived, and spent the seven years on a tropical island with another man called Stephen Burkett.

A different approach to the "Ringu" series this time making Sadako a sympathetic figure, a young woman tormented by others when, in fact, she is as much a victim as those whose lives are harmed by the vengeful ghoul.
"Angus" is in fact a rather painful movie to watch sometimes, because the strongest subject matter it deals with is bullying.

Good/evil, man/woman, hate/love reality/ unreality and in fact the merger of demon and woman.
Of course, animators in Hollywood further humiliated themselves by voting for the lite-weight KUNG FU PANDA over WALL-E at their Annie awards (in fact, a near sweep of their many categories).

It didn't seem too bad, and in fact, I was really enjoying it.
(Some of these atrocious emails that preach intolerance are erroneously attributed to George Carlin but in fact are written by other people, none of whom have the courage to take credit for these awful, embarrassingly written pieces.
The rest of the crew makes every effort to see he does in fact get home to Sweden.
It was a lovely book of wisdom with catchy thoughtful lines, instruction about friendship, manifesto about deformed generation that could overstep its tribulation anyway (in fact the show was against the Vietnam war mostly, and with it scarcely to please all I think), a chance to be a down to earth hero, learning that life is invaluable, despite anything you must solemnize it, and how living careless and well is the best revenge out of anything !
Which holds to my theory that some of the best actors are in fact of the supporting variety rather than the "stars", who are there more for charisma and presence than character-acting ability.
THAT should have been a series--in fact, I think it was originally intended to be one.
As she is natural Jess relates a history to us in which the important thing is not the argument, in fact the personages are immersed in a mystery, but they are not worried in solving it, and Jess either, because what really it wants it is to show a dance to us of erotics images that, without arriving at the soft-porn, they do not wake up our libido and they soil our glance.
I have never seen any Wes Anderson film before, in fact I hoped to see a film which makes a clever and funny statement about civilization torn lifestyle .
But no..it's not a horror movie about vampires...in fact, if you see this movie, you'll probably laugh the entire time, due to bad acting, and really really bad jokes, even Blade can do better clichÃ© jokes.
Burt LancasterÂat that time 57 years oldÂin fact dominates the film by a mystic presence, rather than actually being on screen for any length of timeÂ  The bulk of the film constitutes a battle of wits and guns between Valdez and an extremely stubborn leader of a band of trigger-happy gun-slingersÂ   So when Frank Tanner (John Cypher) provokes a shoot-out which results in the death of an innocent man, Valdez asks $100 compensation from Tanner to provide financial support for his pregnant widowÂ Tanner not only refuses, but humiliates Valdez and orders his hired gunmen to beat him hardly, to tie him to a cross, and to drive him out of his placeÂ   Again Spain locations represented the American frontier for this revenge tale about an aging former cavalry man who dusts off his old uniform, straps on his old guns, takes plenty of ammunition, and erupt a one-man army against a greedy, rotten, evil rancher and his henchmen to enforce justice at any costÂ  As the pursuers forge deeper into the wilderness, the situation shifts around with hunters becoming the huntedÂ  Susan Clark (Gay) sides with Valdez without falling in love with him, while Barton Heyman (playing the chief henchman "El Segundo") provides his character with warmth and quality at a pivotal timeÂ
It is, in fact, a low-budget Belgian film that was simply picked up for distribution by the studio, and, as far as I am concerned, it is much more enjoyable than the majority of Lloyd Kaufman's own B-movie output.
Before he leaves on a long needed vacation that is Coleman's number 2 guy at the plant, Michael Rhoades, has been urging on him to take in fact he gives him the money to do it, Coleman has both the girls actually get real jobs at the plant to see how the working folks really live.
So off-put, in fact, that they can't get past it.

I HATED this movie, and in fact, I turned it off.
It would seem tempting to call the film far ahead of its time; in fact, as a superior thriller and a succinct action dramaÂof excellent taste, dynamic sense and sustained drama and elastic, steely style , Lewis Allen's SUDDENLY is far above many corny '50s movies that look clumsy and even dolt.
Yet SUDDENLY is, in fact, an exponent of "the other '50s" (just as there are exponents of the other '30s, '40s, '50s), worthy pieces of style and taste.
At times in fact the whole sometimes looks like some cheap, almost "snuff"-type exploitation movie.
Although this film was directed by the great Raoul Walsh, the story by Niven Busch is the main factor in this western.
As for him, he was lent from RKO where in fact he had worked with a Niven Busch screenplay and got great acclaim for it in Till The End Of Time.
oh yeah, it is in fact that awesome.
The movie is in fact very entertaining and involving.
When in fact, the "dragon" he is referring to, is a monster from another planet, now hunting the viking populace and fauna of the land.

A splendid cast - in fact it could only have been topped if Luciano Pigozzi would have popped up at some point!
I was surprised when i watched this movie, it wasn't as bad as i thought it would be in fact it was quite good.
While obviously similar, it's not really the plot from "Jaws" any more than Ovidio Assonitis's "Tentacles" was; in fact, "Great White" shares a lot in common with "Tentacles".
The soundtrack has the same kind of pseudo-disco thriller music that appeared in "Tentacles", in fact the music is very similar.
I have no problem with sex in movies, and in fact actively seek out this sort of dirty, grisly film...but there really is no reason to bother seeking out Wrong Way.
The ending is less about Buddha (in fact THROUGHOUT the whole film when characters' gaze perpetually hint at a mythic, towering world order and all-enveloping consciousness larger than their conflicts or King Hu could cram on screen), than such spiritual path as critique of all the commotions that preceded it - and made up the film.

Grainy, dark film quality does NOT make for an eerie atmosphere--in fact, it's downright annoying.
No, in fact it's a *campaign* editor.
It might seem implausible to you that there's a deity behind all this, and it does in fact seem implausible to me that there's a deity behind all this, but I can assure you that it seems at least as implausible to many people that there isn't.
He notices how this news lifted the spirits of many of the jews so he continues to make up bogus reports and gives everyone the impression that he does in fact have a radio, which he does not.
Sex is gorgeously photographed but plain, perhaps too caste in feeling, in fact most of it is boring, possibly because of the lack in dramatic tension (very far from the heat accomplished by masters like Nicholas Roeg).

It's very near to being an excellent film, and in fact is a vast improvement on many recent Hollywood sci-fi flicks.
The three sisters from 'Alice in Wonderland,' here named Alsi/Elana, Lucia (the Alice, an anagram, in fact one that Carroll used) and Belin.
His facial expressions, acting abilities, delivery, etc., are all top-notch, and he can make even mundane topics such as walking through the woods pee-your-pants hilarious (in fact, he spends a long time talking about the woods, which is a bit puzzling, but hey, it's funny).
There's also the film's central irony-- that the shrill, cruel-faced DA (George Mc Ready, with an enhanced scar) in fact wins the courtroom battle and Bogart loses.
Python, Fall & Rise of Reginald Perrin, Alexei Sayle's Stuff, Alan Partridge, Knowing Me, Knowing You, Saxondale, Fawlty Towers, The Games)(okay, last one's Aussie) - sitcoms, sketch comedy, satire, whatever - and was extremely disappointed as this was supposedly an influential series, but is in fact a load of nonsensical dreck.
Because, our pronunciation is better Â accurate, in fact Â and we pronounce Internet as "Inter -Net" and not "Inner-Net" the way the Americans do.
I could model my life on the teachings of Dave Marshack - in fact, his name was on my fake id up until i could drink legally.
in fact the Olsen fans(thought i will never know why they have any) must b in heaven at the fact that they made an actual watchable film.
The director says he was inspired by two Italian movies:  "Mediterraneo" directed by Gabriele Salvatores because both of them talks about war and soldiers who lives in peace;   "La vita Ã¨ bella" (Life is Beautiful) directed by Roberto Benigni in fact both of them introduce some people's sacrifice to save the innocent ones.
Only later i realized it was mostly due to the music, which is in fact composed by Joe Hisaishi, who made the music for these Miyazaki movies too; once again, his work is superb.
If you happen to see negative, mean characters in his previous films,in Breaking and Entering it is hard to distinguish,in fact there is no such distinction as antagonist and protagonist,for each of the characters can play both parts regarding the people and circumstances they're surrounded in.
Don't ask me to explain, I may ruin the whole thought just by trying an intellectual explanation when in fact it only makes sense viscerally.
Besides, we find out later that he is a very small percent of Indian and is, in fact, just a jerk.
It shows us straight up that Eddie does in fact used his kid for his personal benefit.
The film wasn't at all camp, (something one naturally would expect from a gay horror movie) in fact, it was pretty darn intense.
It lacks pretty much everything the first one has, in fact, it pretty much lacks everything any film has, which is unfortunate as I have nothing else new to watch tonight.
The story has been remade so many times very few people know of the original, and the best, in fact I had not even heard of it until I found a copy in my dads huge collection of old video tapes, and I decided I might as well watch it, what else to do, in the end it ended up being one of the best films I had everseen.
Crawford is less likable than Loretta Young in LAUGH, CLOWN, LAUGH- in fact, I found her rather unattractive and forgettable when compared to Young's sweet charm.
Be Kareena Kapoor, Rati Agnihotri or Fardeen Khan everyone portrays there part so well in fact they were 1st time so close to their respective profession of acting.
Linda Hamilton gives one of the most touching and poignant performances of her career; in fact, the entire cast is outstanding!!!!
Overall, this movie was good for what it was worth, in fact, I sort of like this movie.

The Doorway to Hell is yet another step up the ladder for James Cagney as the Brothers Warner discover that the guy they signed for a one shot deal to repeat his stage role from Penny Arcade was in fact future star material.
(There are Spoilers) Rarely seen and almost forgotten early gangster film that in fact was the first of the great crime motion pictures of the early 1930's, released before the big three "Little Caesar" "Public Enemy" and "Scarface", that put the "organize" into "organized crime".
A street-like Justice that he in fact meted out so many times to others is now what Louie Ricarno is to receive himself!
Alas-genre regular Richard Harrison is no where to be seen having by this time presumably escaped his contract with the aforementioned cinematic crooks (in fact Harrison reportedly felt so sullied by his experiences with Lai and Ho and their deceitful film making techniques that he more or less retired from the industry)  In his honoured place however steps forward Pierre Kirby (who also appeared in the demented classic that is 'Zombie vs Ninja', aka 'Zombie Rival-The Super Ninja Master') who actually does many of his own stunts and martial arts.
), it could have gone as high as 8 (edit: which in fact it now has).
But for them it seems they had a lot of fun making it, and it shows on the screen, it was such a FUN film, but it wasn't just amazing martial arts action, it had good characters, and the 'talking' bits don't drag the film down, the opposite in fact.
So that might sound like damning with faint praise, but in fact i really like this movie.
Don't let me get the wrong idea that this is not a good movie, it is, in fact it's a great B.movie it's just a flaw that sort of bothered my otherwise pleasing viewing of Drive.
The title of the movie is in fact, a variable of a political stance that exemplifies that theoryÂ"As goes Ohio, so goes the nation."
His acting would put a lot of people to shame, in fact it's a superb performance (also see "Copland").
There's nothing exotic about the locales or the people; in fact, there seems to have been a deliberate use of a cast that precisely resembles the sort of audience that was expected to attend the movie.
To begin with, being a fan of the epic genre, I had always wanted to check this one out and, in fact, was very pleased when Universal released it as part of their 5-Disc Cecil B.
While the script obviously eschews the Robin Hood legend that has become associated with Richard and the Crusades (the Douglas Fairbanks version of 1922 about that popular outlaw figure, in fact, spends more time with him as a knight than the proverbial 'Merrie Man'!
The characters are, in fact, brutally ordinary.
There are, in fact, several movies with similar plots; "3:10 to Yuma" and "Narrow Margin" come to mind.
The only vague marring of the film is a racial stereotyping of the servants in the house - an unfortunate byproduct of the time that seen through modern eyes gains a more negative aspect - but we must remember the time in which the film was made and not judge too harshly for that - in fact Lloyd gives the moment of triumphant discovery to the butler, ably demonstrating his generosity in not always taking centre-stage (in fact Lloyd is missing from probably a quarter of the film entirely).
I don't have anything against crude comedy - in fact, I love it when it's well done.
Perhaps not, in fact it surely isn't but all the characters are played with tons of style (you will always remember the presence of Bruce Willis here).
The plain fact is her performance here is better than many who have won Oscars, and she wasn't even nominated.
And, in the strange development of we find that the "fake" hero is in fact an authentic one and that we did know the secret of the narrative - the "hero"(the father, the phallus) of the propaganda is the "true" hero, as he had to face real tough moral problems and he lived "the life in truth" .
So bad in fact that me and a friend spent the whole film crying with laughter at just how bad it was.
Wow, i know that this show is praised and considered to be one of the best shows of the 80's, but i certainly did not expect such a good first episode, in fact it's a double episode that's almost 100 minutes long.
This movie isn't worse than most similar stuff coming out of Hollywood nowadays, in fact i'd say it's slightly more interesting, and it has the added benefit of being the first film of its kind to be produced and directed in Austria.
Also releasing that th main cyborg, Marcus right, has a human heart, and is in fact half human half machine, when if they had kept that quiet, it could of become a massive although guessable twist in the script.
Not to say that there isn't any humour in the film, in fact it delivers some of the best one liners in a film this year.
We get to see a hint at the old model and it reveals that John is not the leader in fact he is not even aloud to know what is fully going on.
For no reason, Smith just happens to be the world's greatest gunslinger (he doesn't miss; he doesn't break a sweat...in fact the whole movie Owen plays Smith as the ultimate joke: with a straight face.
Good may in fact be an understatement.
I got very little out of this first time round, in fact my reaction was positively antagonistic; characters seemingly as shallow as those in a currently popular BBC soap opera with a similar London setting, but here handled with that clumsy hand held camera cinema verite look, which for me is always a turn-off unless the material itself is brilliant - "The Dream Life of Angels" and "La Promesse" for instance.
Whereas acting is concerned Christian Bale shows up for 35-40 minutes looking real angry at the world and at being involved in this project, it is in fact Sam Worthington who is a breakout star, and such an effortless tough guy that you can feel the bass reverberate in your body when he throws a punch.
The entire series consists of about 175 episodes, of which I'd say at least 125 are filler or some sort of subplot (I didn't bother to count and I wouldn't be surprised if that number were in fact higher, though).
The main factor that contributes to the greatness of this film is the acting.
He's so good, in fact, that he could very well be a teen hustler from an HBO documentary.
I was, in fact, witnessing a movie that transcended all of these fashionable labels.
But what they did with it in fact was an entirely different matter.
Throughout, in fact.
The fact that this was THE last film ever shot at Roger Corman's famous Venice studio is not lost, in fact the flim makers play up Corman's history with aplomb.
On paper the script by Dan Acre & John Huckert looks pretty lousy, a horror comedy about a bunch of annoying teenagers being killed by a mysterious killer but in fact Slaughter Studios turned out to be a really likable & decent film.
Raven in fact does nothing at all and most of the time he just stands in the background looking like Christopher Lee.
Entering into this foreign world that is in fact his own, he begins a tour of psychological symbolism and random association, as objects and settings twist and morph around him.
many years ago on Cable TV â in fact, back when I wasnât yet a Euro-Cult devotee and, consequently, ended up being rather lukewarm on it.
The seemingly insignificant opening sequence â in which we follow a fly buzzing around until it plunges to its death in a bay â is, in fact, a clever foreshadowing of what is to come.
At any rate Reazione a catena is classic Bava, some of the great directors finest work in fact, and an excellent example of the Italian horror genre for those who have yet to discover it.
Despite being a little preachy, it is nicely photographed, well told, and provides the audience with information that may not be historically accurate but based in fact.
Gates who had shut himself off from the world since his wife the daughter of the town's Sheriff Deegan, Kurtwood Smith, was accidentally drowned-when she fell off her horse-would in fact find a new reason for living in the dangerous world beyond the "Wolf Valley" in the Oxbow.
The only production of "Grand Hotel" I've ever seen that actually worked (that, in fact, was deeply moving) was the Broadway musical from the early '90s.
She has nothing to look forward to - in fact her position is not that different from Anne Bancroft in THE TURNING POINT, who can teach ballet, but has no family life to comfort her like her old friend/rival Shirley MacLaine does.
They quickly discover that the local population are in fact Vampire like zombies lead by Drake (Billy Drago)...
But still, there's as much blood and terror represented in this film as there is in all the other ( to say the least, in fact ) According to a bountyhunter ( who is a pretty good maniac himself ), Jason can be killed for good if a relative of his destroys his heart.
I recently saw a restored print from TOLL OF THE SEA (1922) and it was in fact made using this process four years earlier than THE BLACK PIRATE.
The Holmeses had no children, they did in fact raise a niece who was out of the picture when they moved to the capital, but the legend about his law clerks from Harvard becoming surrogate sons is quite true.
Overall, the zombies were in fact the biggest problem in this flick.
The so-called climax of the movie was in fact the most anti-climactic part of the movie.
Yes Chaney was sick but he died in his sleep.He never would let his illness get to him,in fact he was planning on making a huge come back and moving into the talkies.Chaney Sr hated the idea of Lon Jr becoming an actor.
I liked the acting as well, I almost smell the lack of comfort when Felix meet the girl from time to time, and lots of closeups made me always feel that these persons are in fact real, and not acting on an average story thread.
Way too many in fact, but out of the hundred's and hundred's of films I've seen, I must say that Communion is truly the scariest motion picture that my eyes have watched.
The unknown woman is in fact Lady Helen.
I managed to rent this movie from a local Blockbuster and watch it at home a few days ago, and, while this movie wasn't a comedic masterpiece, it wasn't a bad movie either, in fact, it was actually a quite funny movie at some points.
Shot very effectively in a style somewhere between Italian neo-realism, early Scorsese and even Cassavettes improv but with a flavor all its own, it doesn't matter that one of the plot twists is very obvious (so obvious, in fact, I'm not even sure that it's even meant to be a twist) because co-writer Paddy Considine is such a riveting yet natural presence in the lead: he's able to be genuinely threatening while keeping it absolutely real, creating a very believable monster.
The plot is contrived...in fact there barely even is a plot.
This film reeks of class, so much so in fact that this film deserves a Trilogy as it is up there with "The Godfather" trilogy and the "Star Wars" trilogy.
Entitled In Old Heidelberg it is what we are in fact seeing here as opposed to a silent version of the musical, an oxymoron if there ever was one.
His story, at least as related in the movie, is wholly unengaging, and the film does him no favors by droning endlessly trying to make him interesting, when in fact, he is totally undistinguishable from the hundreds of other two-bit performers scraping together a living in the early 1900s.
"10 Items or Less" was promoted, in fact, with the following slogan: "If you thought working in an office was funny, wait until you see what it's like to work in a CONVENIENCE STORE!!"
This film holds place in the hall of fame of black comedy films with what seems to be a highly strange plot which in fact is quite common: the story of a couple living in Brooklyn with two sons going through the beginning of their separation.
Frank, in imitating his father's worst traits, when it is discovered that a song he'd written was in fact a song by Pink Floyd and in a Ted Bundy style argues that "it was as if he had written it so it was his by appropriation" exposes him for the empty snob he is on the inside.
So good in fact that I am looking forward to the third installment of the franchise.
THE OWL AND THE PUSSYCAT is also notable for giving the current female singing sensation Â Barbra Streisand Â her first non-musical role; in fact, it led to other wacky comedy vehicles: foremost among them WHAT'S UP, DOC?
It's a comedy, it's not reality...in fact, far from it.
I'm not particularly a fan of his; in fact, I'm hard-pressed to remember any other role he's played.
It is in fact very watchable - largely due to a colorful and humorous Hackman whose character was himself a Mississippi small-town Sheriff at one time and understands the pitfalls of the Hoover boys going in all guns blazing.
That makes it seem that either she never met one of his daughters, or did in fact meet that one.
And characters we might think are kith and kin of the 'real' people we encounter, are in fact nothing but kin to the fine imaginings of the typing hand.
Worth anything, in fact -- even the risk of losing the love and respect of their dearest friends.
The fact that I rented this is proof that there is far too little to do in the town I live in, and that I will, in fact, rent absolutely anything.
They had some very funny routines in this movie, some of their funniest in fact, I have not seen one Abbott and Costello routine yet that I did not think was funny.
But I really will never know because if he is in fact making a point such as the one I have guessed at in 3., he fails in his utter vagueness and leaves us with a film that is ultimately disappointing, if not entirely offensive!
While no one is suggesting that Findlay was anything like the obsessed monster of a man he portrays on the screen here - there is much evidence to the contrary, in fact - there isn't any doubt that Findlay wasn't exorcising demons from his own psyche with these films, which, for me, is what makes them so compelling.
Where the film goes somewhat awry is the series of developments in the last half-hour that lead to the ending where Robert's sense of paranoia brings certain facts to light and responses become increasingly contrived.
And in fact, it helps to be experienced in China living when watching Red Corner, for much of its deeper mannerisms only become apparent if you know how and when to look for them.
For example, Richard Gere (as subtle and low-key as usual) portrays Jack Moore, a US-based business person willing to forego ideals and politics in order to enter the much vaunted mainland market, hyped up to be the best thing since instant noodles, when in fact like everything in life, it too comes at a price.
I didn't recall a murmur, silence in fact.
But her few scenes stick firmly in memory, and her entry scene is one of the most beautifully pieces of cinema I have seen when watched in 3-D. Crispin Glover too has brief screen time as Grendell, but he delivers a heartfelt performance, in fact I felt genuine sympathy with Grendell.
The problem with the 3-D being so good is that the 2-D version seems like a cash in, in fact the movie relies so much on the 3-D at times that I doubt the 2-D version is worth watching.
But the film, though sweet, also establishes an undertone of such mournfulness that the viewer is not surprised when Prima never shows up, in fact, was never going to show up; it was a brutal trick by Pascal, who recognizes the brothers' abilities, so that they would be forced to close the restaurant and, he hopes, go to work for him.
Essentially Mitchell distinguished himself as a pilot in the First World War but grew appalled at the indifference if not bias in favour of the Army and Navy in peacetime - there was, in fact, no Air Force - and having exhausted every avenue in an attempt to address this problem he called a press conference and accused the General Staff of incompetence.
Williams is obviously using it to symbolize that he is, in fact, hiding something from his life-partner, and that "something" is Rodrigo- note his eyes when he communicates with the waiter in the restaurant scene.
His legacy, in fact, was accidentally found in a locked chest in an old shed at the bottom of his widow's garden.
It took me the first 10-15 minutes before I realised that this wasn't a documentary, but was in fact a mockumentary.
in fact it was the only movie i ever saw, that was able to both analyze and illustrate the TV strategies of war reporting since operation desert storm (which it is exactly about) and the beginning new world order.
This one however, is worse scripted, worse acted and in fact not entertaining at all.
He makes no overtures of marriage, & in fact seems very resistant to the idea.
She is in fact a typical wife and mother who is taken for granted by her family.
However, the murderer gets angry because, as his killings continue, Malcolm becomes the focal point of the stories; Malcolm's girlfriend (Mariel Hemingway), in fact, suggests that the two are practically collaborating.
After years of research, Buckaroo Banzai (Peter Weller) and his colleague, Professor Hikita (Robert Ito), have successfully developed an `overthruster,' a device that has allowed Buckaroo to pass through solid matter-- a mountain, in fact-- driving through it at high speed in his specially designed and equipped car.
He throws so much at you, in fact, that it's impossible to catch it all the first time through; but it's a movie that lends itself to repeated viewings, because it's exactly what this kind of film is supposed to be: Pure entertainment from start to finish.
Master and Margarita were in fact killed by a Woland's ally Azazello, and they were given the rest, but not in paradise... Bulgakov did not give them the light, but it was impossible for them to live in this world too.
Hurt's eyes, throughout his portrayal, remain chillingly cold and lifeless even as he smiles and laughs - except of course, for his expression of shock upon realizing that his sister Drusilla is, in fact, mortal.
The acting is superb, the direction impeccable, in fact the entire production is tres magnifique!
Even so, the film is hardly the heady brew of erotica and visceral thrills that was the latter (though it contains similar lesbian undertones and the occasional outburst of shocking violence) but rather a deliberately-paced mood-piece Â in fact, it might best be described as REPULSION (1965) in the countryside (with all the inherent eeriness that such a remote setting entails)!
The premise: a group of mix-mashed crossrefrences of modern day life are Stranded deadlocked on a Island that is not on any maps and not a soul even knows that it is here... Now all of them, not only have to traverse the mystery of just who each of them actually are, but before it is too late they must Figure the right way through the Unknown Depths of an Island in which the Nightmarish truths are about to be unearthed on a Island known only as "MK:NAOMI"  excerpt: a gov cover-up a Experiment Island in which Failed Experiment Plague the Traditional Loin cloth wearing Inhabitintes have to overcome If you sleep.... hope you have a happy dream Pray Hard it is not a scary one or you might think it really is real really ... cause on this island your nightmares are reality oh and one other thing be careful what you eat oh and think before you open the door...or like the Hero you could be a little green under the gills ...wait hell ya might have gills ... in fact this show was so good i remembered it and thought LOST was the culmination of it coming back...OH well...

We were pre-Stonewall (I am now in my 80's)and, in fact, living just around the corner from The Stonewall in the NYC Village on the night of that famous explosive event -- another life altering event.
I never intended to see the movie - in fact I'd never heard of it - but accidentally I turned on the TV just as it was beginning, I saw Denzel Washington (come on, guys, he IS gorgeous) and decided to see what it's going to be about.
It was in fact Tony who got Vinnie to see the light in what he's been doing over the years in living off his many sick and compulsive degenerate gambling customers.
The similar styled shows on television, as well as many of the other shows, particularly the so-called "comedy" shows are almost always misrepresented as "wholesome family entertainment" when in fact they are thinly guised (or not so thinly guised) sadism, racism, and/or pandering to any number of the lowest human traits.
The dopey premise isn't quite played to it's campy potential..in fact the direction is rather subdued(..as are the cast, even though there are some emotional fireworks as the bickering between family members gets sometimes heated) though the kills themselves are often quite laughable.
I was once only able to see Poirot if PBS's "Mystery" broadcast a series and they haven't for quite a while, several years in fact so I mistakenly thought that the Poirot series had ceased production about 10 years ago.
And in fact he wrote some of their best lines in (if I remember correctly) "Monkey Business" -- "Hurry, my dear, my regiment leaves at dawn."
The action sequences are impressively photographed and John Capenter professionally camouflages that his film is, in fact, and independent production.
This film has a great cast who all play off each other brilliantly, especially Chris McDonald & the guy from Rocky & I can't believe it didn't do better in the cinema in England... in fact it might have only been on selected releae here 'cause I can't remember it coming out.
Its about a Scottish guy - very unlikeable - in fact its not really about anything - its an absolute snooze.
Absolutely marvellous, in fact.
I dig action flicks, and Deaden is an ACTION flick that doesn't pull any punches, in fact it starts kicking your ass from the opening frame.
He manages to pull this up to a much higher standard, very watchable stuff, in fact.
I was glad to see that no animals were hurt in the filming of this movie - in fact the monkey seemed to be having some fun.
This is an excellent film and therefore in some ways it is a pleasure to watch, but anyone who has seen it will know that it's effectiveness in fact makes it almost unbearable to watch.
What is extraordinary in this case, however, is that this new review is not just an updated version with a few new thoughts: it is, in fact, a review in which I've changed my mind on the film completely.
It is difficult to sum up the sublimity of the thing by just mentioning a few bits of business - many reviewers have waded through practically all of it - but of all that sticks in my mind and bursts out as laughter (sometimes in the most unfortunate situations) is the plain fact that included in Field's essential equipment for surviving the conditions in nineteenth century Alaska is an electric fan.
I was somewhat askance that the movie starts off in such a downbeat fashion, with the death - no bones about it, he's completely dead, blasted to smithereens in fact - of the original human Toby.
Now stay with me here, because there is, in fact, a point to all of this.
not only am i disappointed with the film, in fact I'm disgusted that any video store would even stock this film and be willing to rent it out to innocent film lovers, all stores that choose to rent this film out should have this film in a large case with a 20ft warning sign that says " Please understand that by watching this film you are not only wasting your hard earned money but even worse you are putting yourself through what will be years of torture and torment at the realisation that at the end of this film you would have lost about 2 hours of your life that you will never get back, please approach film with great caution, also we don't do refunds.p.s.
Much under rated this movie wastes no time in getting going, so far so fast in fact that with the knickers showing, then nude teen girl getting killed so vigorously before we know what is going on, a most uncomfortable start.
i mean i love zombies...in fact (as my friends say) i am obsessed with them.
It's so wrong, in fact, that it would be hilarious if it weren't so bad.
And before any of the PC brigade accuses me of being homophobic, I am in fact homosexual.
So dangerous it was to shoot there in fact, that the "feet" of Murakami were actually a body double (or foot double) for Toshiro Mifune.
There was always a surprise around the corner, whether one of pace or image or sound or performance or turn of the narrative - though in fact it's a very straightforward story, told in a linear fashion, but that description really doesn't do justice to a sequence such as when we go to the ballistics lab at the police station, Mifune learns about a bullet found at the scene of a crime, and then he dashes off without any warning - and we follow him - to a shooting range at which we'd seen him early on in the film, retrieving a spent bullet of his own, and then we dash back to the ballistic lab, and then go into a microscopic close-up POV ballistics man, comparing the two bullets.
Like De Sica, to a degree, Kurosawa uses the post-war streets and real locations (it's not all just Toho this time), and it adds that layer of heightened realism for our main characters on the prowl; in fact one could look at this film as being like the Bicycle Thief (looking for a lost item in the dark places of the city) had it been written with a fair amount less sentiment and more grit.
By giving Murakami a very similar history (so similar, in fact, that it comes off as a little contrived), Kurosawa makes the point that Yusa had the same choice as Murakami.
And in fact that was what was so wonderful about it--lose the moralizing of most WWII movies, lose a lot of the American hero myth making.... um, lose a bit of the Italians', uh, involvement in it, apparently..... and you get boys with toys blowing up bridges and cackling madly the whole way.
Meyer is a member of the terrorist team who in fact turns out to be a federal agent who ends up helping griffin.
They are real as much as they can be in fact too real in stark horrific reality of wartime.
The happy ending achieved for all in this story-line is the result of the common sense shown by Loy and Grant; the 'screwball' aspect which is not a genre, but rather a way-of-handling social-mores comedy, is here made to serve a plot that involves several hard-working normative people in a situation that should never have happened but has in fact happened.
Before they found out about the boy they were in the middle of deeply grieving for their daughter, in fact they were so grief stricken I thought for sure they were going to turn the little girl's room in to a shrine or something.

However, the controversy was generated by opera purists, since from a purely artistic viewpoint, not to mention a strictly cinematic one, LA TRAVIATA has never been so well expressed, in fact no opera has.
(He has obviously aged as consequent opera films were made, up to ten years later in fact.)
Many viewers who are not opera buffs do in fact think she is a dramatic actress dubbed by a great soprano.
The show is stylistic, in fact one of the reasons i was drawn to it from the first episode was because of that very stylistic nature.
But the most amazing thing is that the creative team actually manages to balance all the genres well enough to avoid being absurd, in fact, well enough to be thoroughly enjoyable spectacle.
Two seemingly unrelated murders have taken place; police doctor Chet Walker (Richard Denning) discovers that the killers are themselves in fact dead, and are being manipulated, using radioactivity, to commit various nefarious deeds.
I wasn't  sure that there weren't in fact a few professional actors in the cast -- there were some moments when the content came across as more drama than  documentary; several scenes felt staged.
And in fact, since this movie deals with liberty and with persons of very different cultural, religious and aesthetic backgrounds, it is a sociological movie.
The movie didn't address the race issue (which was half the point of its predecessor) and the conflict was a creation of the main character's head where she decided her boyfriend lied to her when in fact he never did.
I in fact worked for a woman who headed a state agency and she was so stupid she couldn't probably spell the word.
This earlier adaptation, however, stands as a prime example of the genre from the more innocent pre-war era; in fact, starting from the year after Â with William A. Wellman's THE OX-BOX INCIDENT (1943), to be exact Â the Western achieved sudden maturity that would lead to any number of masterworks in various veins (noir, psychological, elegiac, revisionist) till it died out towards the late 1970s.
This is a plot less piece of crap filled with cheap jokes, bad acting...in fact everything in this "thing" is so bad, I can't even dare to call it a movie  it may be inspired from Romanian reality, so what?
Numerous gratuitous sex-sequences later, one of the girls coincidentally discovers the three are in fact fugitive criminals who needed a hideout place.
absolutely hilarious (superior, in fact, to anything produced here in the U.S).
'Last' is watched by children too; in fact its one of the few television comedies on now that the family can enjoy.
Despite these elaborate plans to undermine the marriage from the start, the marriage does not in fact work out and the man is destroyed financially, emotionally and spiritually.
Original Sin slipped under the radar and in fact tanked at the box office back in the summer of 2001 despite the fact that it starred Angelina Jolie at the peak of her fame.
It would have been easy to treat this scene as slapstick, but instead it's done with the greatest respect for the characters involved : Mathilde, who is afraid of losing her modesty and giving way to the dark tendencies of her soul, is astonished to learn that yes, according to the Torah, she is in fact allowed to touch her husband's genitals.
Now while this is all super silly and bizarre, the film is even worse than you'd expect because the actors playing the morons are, in fact, real morons--in the form of the "comedy" team of Mitchell and Petrillo.
If James Cagney had played Paul Krohl and Greta Garbo (who had in fact turned down the part) had played Marta Molnar, this film would be a lot better known than it is.
The dialogue could have been more elaborate - that would certainly have upped the quality and believability quotient - not that the film strays too far from reality - in fact it tends to steer back on track and find it's way safely to the end, yet scenes such as the one when Jason Ritter is in the bar by himself with only a few "workers" around him and the things the barman spouts there.
I suppose the moral crisis comes late in the story, and in fact, Charlie and his Mich buddy were not physically matched for fighting.
Emmanuelle, a "girl" in her 20s, played by Sylvia Kristel, is an authentic and plausible character, who gives you the impression that she could in fact be experiencing the many erotic adventures - amongst them many lesbian encounters Â which she embarks upon in Thailand.
The bedroom is only one of the locations where the act takes place - in fact I am surprised the participants weren't arrested!
There is not, in fact, any real plot.
(The actress who played her was in fact eighteen, but the intention seems to have been to make the pigtailed, lollipop-sucking Marie-Ange a bisexual Lolita figure).
Henry Fonda plays a priest on the run from the government after brainwashing people into believing god exists, in fact he actually believe he is right.
The quote by Shariati is in fact very suggestive, and ambiguous in the context of the movie.
It's in fact grounds to put us through two and a half hours of torment.
But 'Metropolitan' is actually quite delightful, in fact because of the very quality of the dialogue - the characters are elegant show-offs, which gives the writer the freedom to indulge them with clever lines.
Since the film's short, bouffant,cocktail dresses and automobiles unmistakably place the film in very late modernity--the Reagan era in fact, and long after the Ray Anthony's Orchestra, top hatted milieu it depicts, we cannot fail to miss the film's core observation--the parallel evanescence of the groups' own social connections, as placed against the simultaneous collapse of civilized life as we once knew it.
All the kill scenes are dull with virtually no build up & director Galindo fails to inject any tension, scares or atmosphere into them just like the rest of the film in fact.
There isn't even any nudity either, in fact when Micheal & Alexandra have sex it is squeaky clean stuff, Galindo merely shows them kissing each other on the lips while in bed.
The island, in fact, is owned by a group of Thai farmers, themselves involved in a much larger cannabis-producing operation, who are happy to tolerate the newcomers provided they keep their community a secret and do not try to attract new recruits.
But after I figured out it was all part of the movie, I became convinced that NBK is in fact, a masterpiece.
Critics over the years have panned this film as a 'glorification of meaningless violence', when in fact the film itself is basically the 90's equivalent to Kubrick's 'Dr.
SO many, in fact, that it takes a special something to make even one stand out from the norm.
If you notice the conductor says R train to Brooklyn when in fact it's the S train which is the shuttle that transports you back and forth between Grand Central Station and Times Square.
I cannot pick out a favourite scene, but the journey of Emily Leighton was poignant and inspirational... as she realized the importance of equality, and that she did, in fact, have "the head for" politics.
One of the best performances of the year (2007), Christian Slater's acting is superb and in fact spectacular.
It seems that every once and a while, an occasionally brilliant film will catch my attention in the late hours of the night (or the early hours of the morning, as it was in my case); I found that film in "He Was a Quiet Man," writer-director Frank A. Cappello's brilliantly acted, smartly written satire about that unlikely hero whose "heroic" act may not have been so heroic, and in fact masked an inner rage that may actually make him the villain.
The star, then, is supported by a most excellent cast: Angela Lansbury (a fine actress but a rather unlikely chanteuse), James Bell (a usurped town leader), Jean Parker (an ageing belle and the latter's wife), Wallace Ford (predictably in the role of the reliable town doctor), Ruth Donnelly (as Scott's gracious elderly housekeeper), Jeanette Nolan (as the wife of a revenge-seeking ex-con whom Scott has killed in self-defense), and an interesting trio of villains Â powerful boss Warner Anderson (who also fancies himself a ladies' man and, in fact, strikes up relationships with both Parker and Lansbury throughout), shifty but nervous gambler John Emery and smooth gunslinger Michael Pate (making for a worthy opponent to Scott).
- scenes from the Polish film   - reenactment of the film by Susan - possibly in her dreams or fantasies  - The placement of the Polish actress into a couple seemingly disparate and unconnected roles (which, in fact make the creation of "Blue Skies" and the folklore surrounding its predecessor "47" unite at a different interpretative level)   -The rabbit people performing within the television with an incoherent but suggestive script and an absurd laugh track   - and especially their audience (key to this interpretation because of its chronological placement in the narrative and the identity of the viewer).
Very few movies have the overall excellence of this one..."My Favorite Year" melds together a superior script, outstanding ensemble cast, and outstanding direction from Richard Benjamin...and the crowning achievement of it all is the tour de force performance by Peter O'Toole...Mr. O'Toole takes a character that potentially could have been a buffoon and creates a hilarious yet touching portrayal of an aging action film star who has to do American TV for his "new business associate- the IRS"...assigned to watch over our British invader is Mark Lynn-Baker, who is lucky to still have hair by the end of the show...which by the way is one of the cooler endings ever...and ya gotta get the movie to see it for yourself...I could say something wonderful about each member of the cast...and you'll want to pay particular attention to Joseph Bologna as "King Kaiser"...in fact, rent this movie, enjoy it, then buy it...you can watch it over and over again and love it each time...one note...the scene with the firehose on the roof is one of the funniest movie sequences ever...but it is all good...and I loved it!
'Stage Fright (1950)' certainly isn't one of Alfred Hitchcock's greatest films, but I like it Â quite a lot, in fact.
When I first saw this marvelous film in 1999 in Russia, I could not believe my own eyes - in fact, I had never seen a single Icelandic film before that, this was the first and what a great sensation!
We don't see it, or feel it... We don't care about these people, because, in fact, we don't know them.
Having said all that I feel I must record that I found it to be pretentious, derivative and self - indulgent......a typical Richard Lester film in fact.
The characters are bland, with very little dialogue, in fact, there is really only an escalation of dialogue after the 40minute mark, till then it is pretty much people running, but don't worry after the 40min mark, people still run for the majority of the film.
Costner caught a lot of flack for this film; in fact, few critics noted the historical sense that he achieved.
For the first couple minutes the baby is hidden and you're supposed to assume it's a normal non-mutant baby, but then his wife holds the baby in the light and you see that their baby is in fact a rubber doll with a monster face.
Troma movies are gleefully bad, in fact, CLASS OF NUKEM HIGH is the worst movie that I have ever seen and I've seen many bad movies.
it is still a low budget movie, a very low budget movie in fact, but that gives this movie just that specific feel and gritty look.
Though seemingly played 'straight' as it were, it in fact, has its tongue firmly in cheek.
The Western elements all build quickly; in fact, it begins with Ken being ambushed in the Canyon by an unknown gang.
Most of the characters and background settings are painstakingly caricatured/reproduced from the first two movies despite their radical looks (which in fact giving a comic book feeling to the series, thanks to the truly talented Paul Rudish of Dial M For Monkey fame, the short-lived segment of Dex's Lab that heavily inspires Clone Wars).
Watching this movie, I tried to forget that I am an Arab, and I see that it is portraying - in a very silly and somehow inaccurate way - two opposing sides, and suggesting that they stop fighting, get over their differences to see that they are in fact similar.
Not surprisingly R. Lee wasn't stretching his acting muscles too much since he is in fact a globe-n-anchor combat vet who did multiple tours in Nam.
For me, 'Knowing' suggests that the universe is in fact deterministic on a grand scale but that determinism is fueled by smaller, random occurrences, if that makes any sense.
There is, in fact, a prison in Huntsville, TX, and the entire movie takes place in Texas & Mexico.
Ten years later with two more films(one destroyed) under his belt the director has put together what on the surface seems an almost paper thin storyline but is in fact an intense and gripping film about a man coping with the loss of his daughter.
We are never 100% certain if in fact he had a daughter but I'd hedge my bets that Kerrigan is too sharp to fool his audience into false beliefs (I recognized one gut-wrenching clue when William mentions to a ticket clerk he lost his daughter on September 11th) particularly Lewis' gentle interplay with the natural born Breslin, a very excellent young actress who also shines in her sad, shy Kira, a child who is suffering as well inside and eventually blossoms into happiness and can see that there is more than meets the eye with William (who's final act has all the suspense of a melodramatic thriller in what the audience fears his truth to become).
Question: These two men are in fact directing their debut effort.
And the film looks great, in fact, better than most $60,000 and up micro budget films.
Even though there are no explanation to them, it still does not matter, as the movie just circles around the characters, and their battle to survive... which in fact never gets boring.
(all this happened in roughly 35 mins) These people were not recognizable, not actors, they were kind of ugly in fact.
I find that what frightens me the most about this film is in fact the appearance of the aliens.
I love all things about Aliens and this film wasn't a let down, in fact, it's amazing!
As for the actual movie, it looks good, in fact is amazing considering it was shot in 20 days in New York masquerading as Chicago (I assume to keep the costs down).
All the kill scenes are dull with virtually no build up & director Galindo fails to inject any tension, scares or atmosphere into them just like the rest of the film in fact.
There isn't even any nudity either, in fact when Micheal & Alexandra have sex it is squeaky clean stuff, Galindo merely shows them kissing each other on the lips while in bed.
And, of course, if there aren't, and there may not in fact be, then any exploration of human nature is going to give us a glimpse into the heart of a darkness that no one wants acknowledged.
Suhasini Mulay as Jodhaa's mother, Padmavati, is apt for the role, in fact, her stature was wasted in Lagaan and Ashutosh finally casts her perfectly.
This is one of the few movies which does not alter or skip the musketeers' dealings with Buckingham, in fact it sticks to the novel with the sole exception mentioned above.
To the dread of the purist, this movie may in fact remain true to the original; certainly not in Â«formÂ», but in Â«logicÂ».
The writer,Rezso did in fact commit suicide.
For all that, it is a good movie, his virtue is, in fact, just absence of originality.
Schlossberg has said that among his many influences for this script were The Shining (1980), and in fact, that masterpiece is directly referenced a few times.
However, we are led to believe that in fact, her death was no accident.
Instead, a cast of pretty good actors star in a film of cheap tricks and an even cheaper ending (including the infamous last scene where you think that all is well until there is some last minute evidence that in fact, the evil will continue unabated).
The unseen killer, or kidnapper, had somehow overlooked the fact that he had two, Aubery & Dakota, victims whom he kidnapped and brutally tortured were in fact related related to each other!
In the end, after finding out she is in fact a twin, she finds her other self buried alive.
The near future in fact.
You don't really know what to think or expect for the first hour or so, as the story is pieced together linking Aubrey and Dakota, and whether or not they are in fact one person.
Despite the punches in the stomach you get while watching it, it's in fact an uplifting movie, in that you see the love inside her family, the blissful ignorance of her friends at the dumpster, the fact that she laughs at herself and wants to go on living to fulfill her "mission".
She is in fact ill; she is psycho.
And in fact I remember gathering around a portable TV to watch the wedding of Charles and Diana with my family while we where camping.
Not a very great moral, in fact, most of High School based movies usually have the cool guys being the bad guys and in the end they lose.
This is surely one of the Tyrone Power vehicles that's most shown on Italian TV (in fact, it was re-proposed just last week) Â but I'd somehow never bothered to watch it.
Danika plays with supernatural elements but is in fact a psychological thriller!
I just saw this movie- in fact its still going on- at the Miami Film Festival and it is another movie about people making movies in Hollywood.
Though he thinks, he uses Norma, it's easy to see that in fact it's she, who uses him for her purposes.
Woody Allen's sex comedy hasn't been well received, and that's a shame because it's actually quite good; one of Woody's funniest films, in fact.
One of the best of the bunch, in fact, is the skit titled 'What Is Sodomy', which stars Gene Wilder.
It is the spring of 1987 and the thought never even crosses their mind that they would, in fact, put them back on quite soon and go to war.
I've never had a movie surprise me like this, in fact, I'd say this is the only animated sequel I've seen that actually meets the standard of quality that its original set.
You might also be shocked to know that Carter was never in fact much more than an average fighter who was well past his prime when arrested for murder so why this movie is making out that Rubin Carter would have been a boxing great if it wasn't for being WRONGLY convicted of murder I have no idea .
Meekly Rubin forgives his captor because that's who Rubin is - A noble forgiving paragon of humility , we're only three scenes into this movie and we're weeping tears for the guy , in fact you have to wonder why such a great guy was ever convicted of murder when he was a decorated war hero with a chest full of medals and we don't have to wait too long because it transpires that the cops are racist .
Because "The Marine", an action movie starring John Cena, Robert Partick, Kelly Carlson and some other useless wannabe actors doesn't even try to be ironic or make fun of itself as it should; in fact, it tries to be a serious action movie.
The director clearly is a fan of Hitchcock, and it's too bad that the film was not better executed, but in fact, it is nearly a parody of pulp fiction, including the soundtrack screeching at us when we are supposed to pay attention.
I have always found David Lynch to be gratuitously bizarre, using strange stories and images to cause audiences to think that he is SO sophisticated that they don't grasp his work; in fact, there is nothing to grasp.
This film makes a rule of this concept, in fact the finale has almost the entire female cast engaged in combat with only their shoes on.
The lead actor is terrible, he cannot act, in fact none of them can act, Suplee does what he does best, plays weirdos and Mewes is doing the same role as usual, it's the sort of film that had been written in a day and then filmed over two days, it is that bad.
I found Drum to be rather wooden and two-dimensional as in fact I found many of the characters.
The sound quality was deplorable, often rendering the dreadful dialogue inaudible (which we soon realized was a blessing, in fact).
I had high hopes of Kal Penn, and in fact I cannot fault his performance (as opposed to his choice of roles) but the film, and his role is so weak that this counts for little.
The editing, in fact, ruined the film for me as the black outs came at the climax.
I am not familiar with the NJ corrections systems but if in fact this young man was in a maximum security prison (which the movie said it was when he was admitted) nothing really made any sense.
Laughable in fact.
Now there are numerous comments here - the majority in fact - which will tell your if you even got to reading THIS review, why it invokes such horror.
My main beef is that, Lord of the Rings aside (obviously) This book, A Wizard of Earthsea, is the most worthy of making into a really long, really expensive film - more than anything by CS Lewis or Rowling (she seems to have taken the main premise of her Potter books FROM Wizard of Earthsea in fact, the magicians school.
The acting is pretty good throughout, maybe the acting was the best thing about Thirst in fact.
Not only he just can't act, he also looks like a moron with his tongue cut out who smiles all the time (in fact, his tongue was cut out, if I remember correctly... Oooh, those savage Arabians!)
There is very little effort (indeed, perhaps none at all) made to make the viewer suspect that perhaps the neighbor is, in fact, nefarious.
But that *still* doesn't address the heart of this movie's problem, which is that in the overwhelmingly liberal entertainment industry, it would be all but impossible to make a movie in which a character is paranoid about a mysterious Middle Eastern neighbor, only to find that said neighbor *is* in fact a "terrorist."
It would be somewhat gutsy film-making, in fact, to make such a movie.
It's not a badly made film - in fact the acting is first rate, and the photography quite stunning - the major problem is the sheer drudgery of it all.
It is in fact a boring art-bullied waste of time.
Toni Collette's atrocious overacting (nothing personal though), especially in the unconvincing grief scenes did nothing to help this lamo movie, in fact made it worse and I only watched it to see if it got better.
There was no emotion or love in any of they're scenes together, in fact, Collette has more emotional energy in the scenes by herself afterward(odd)?
it is, in fact, my very favorite novel Ever!
However, the relationship between Cathy and her father seems almost irrelevant to the whole feel of the movie, from what I can remember, because unlike in the book, their relationship is not developed well, not much beyond that one scene in fact.
Downright beautiful, in fact.
), badly shot and at times performed by people who didn't seem to have any martial arts ability.... in fact, most of the fights in this film weren't 'fights' at all, just people getting beaten up without offering any resistance!
At one point she refers to his "big, thick head," when in fact his head is smaller than hers!
The rest of the actors are not that great either, in fact forgettable...the wig is the star.
This might not be all the actors fault, in fact I blame most of this on the director/writer.
I in fact walked out of this after 40 minutes to catch a second screening of Children of Men in the cinema besides, the only thing keeping me from feeling ripped off.
To balance my views , maybe that I was induced in error when realizing this was a bank robbery movie (I had no idea what the movie was about until I launched it), and disappointed in realizing that in fact it was a movie talking about social relationships.
Sam Gould playing Martin Landau was completely forgettable and I disliked the fact that Landau was such a small part to the story, in fact, by the end, he was forgotten about entirely.
is probably a minute long, and confuses the viewer, never revealing that in fact, james dean was bisexual.
He gave her PERMISSION - in fact, ASKED her to!!!!!
Basically, you have a group of troubled teens who have all been sentenced, for one reason or another, to an evening of detention... for an entire evening... at night... overnight, in fact... with no other guidance than from a manically depressed Vietnam veteran turned homeroom teacher.
There's really very little to recommend this in fact other than for Daniels completists who may at least derive some welcome enjoyment from his aforementioned fighting skills.
It's a sad reflection in fact, that whilst watching this I found myself continuously looking at the video counter to see just how much more running time was actually left, as I was becoming increasingly bored with the unfolding on screen events.
It's certainly not exactly a complete stinker of a movie (in fact it's quite amusing in a B-Movie sort of way), but it certainly doesn't warrant repeated viewings.
Bob's mother actually tells him that the babysitter may have gone home to see her parents after she is killed; in fact, Bob's parents make a career of ignoring pretty much everything Bob says or does.
As such, this documentary is a shameful attempt to seek forgiveness and is just another lie on the part of someone who wants us to believe that he was a peacemaker, when in fact he was a contemptuous war criminal.
As he demonstrates his powers, it is slowly revealed that he is a time-traveler, and his brother, in fact, once traveled back 2,000 years further in time.
The funniest scene in fact would have to be at the church near the end of the film when Sammy's rather heavily sedated sister attempts to walk down the aisle with daddy.
In fact, it leaves out most of the things (e.g., character backgrounds and motivations...in fact just characterisation in general is lacking in this movie) that might make its story logical.
Whereas Michael Bay can just fetishise action and gunfire with copious amounts of explosions and slow motion towards the end of Transformers as that becomes even more empty headed; vacuous and nonsensical than it already was, and Stallone can offer nothing bar mere break-neck action as the baddies get their comeuppance toward the conclusion of Rambo IV, Boll shows us that war is, in fact, Hell and war-zones are places you really don't ever want to be.
(Several of them were quite good, in fact).
The broken airplane hanging on a string, the Lionel train, the village with the name "Plasticville" on the side,the Bernz-O-Matic torch sticking out of Godzilla's mouth, all of these things and so many more make it an absolute agony to watch, in fact, that's what makes it so good: waiting for the next scene to see if it will possibly be any worse than the last one!
Most bad movies are so bad they in fact become entertaining, but this one failed even in that way.
the film did not challenge racism or white supremacy at any level, in fact conversely it coaxed the men to live up to the "American dream" of individualism.
in fact she only cared about her child watching,not her own safety.
That's not to say that the show doesn't have its lighter moments thoughÂin fact, it provides plenty of amusement.
If this doesn't sound dumb enough, later you learn that the Mikhelovs are, in fact, vampire satanists!!!!
The film supposedly delves into the tricky area of older man-younger man relationships when, in fact, the younger man is in his mid-teens and the "older man" is in his early to mid-twenties.
in fact, although it seems close to action movie background music, it just so happens it is done in a manner that will grate on you fantastically.
The writing is the worst part of it, in fact, though the writers did accomplish several feats I had previously assumed were mutually exclusive: they made the plot over-the-top yet unimaginative, the dialogue simple-minded yet smug, and the punchlines clichÃ©d yet unfamiliar (clichÃ©s are clichÃ©s because at some point there were funny, but the ones in My Boys lacked any vestige of humor).
This show couldn't be further from reality if they had the "boys" become bionic cyborgs with the powers on invisibility that can bend space time and had flesh eating incest's that fly out of their mouths, in fact that would be more entertaining because you wouldn't need such a huge suspension of disbelief.
This doesn't in fact happen and I felt cheated by this .
I got confused several times about who was holding the camcorder and in fact, how many camcorders there actually were.
when in fact, any viewer with any brains knows differently.
The film goes to great lengths explain this with the useless 'Chromotic Radiation' nonsense, in fact Horror of the Blood Monsters if full of stupid inane scientific babble which means nothing & Carradine's character is particularly guilty of this.
It's so bad I found myself wondering if it was in fact a comedy instead of an action movie.
Hasnain Hyderabadwala & Raksha Mistry after copying COLLATERAL and making THE KILLER(2006) remake again This time their film THE TRAIN is a remake of DERAILED a film which wasn't that great in the first place  The film looks similar to Emraan's own ZEHER in fact the promos and also the songs plus the adultery theme is so much ZEHER  The film could be a decent thriller but sadly the film comes too late even the chemistry between Emraan and Sayali Bhagat is bad The sub plot of their daughter is good but the rest film however isn't as engrossing  The problem is predictability and also the feeling of deja vu plus the villain's characterization isn't too convincing and the final twist is predictable too  Direction is okay Music is a winner, especially ZINDAGI NE, MAUSAM, WOH AJNABEE Camera-work is good  Emraan is good in his part and is getting more dependable though the role is too similar to ZEHER Sayali Bhagat is weak while Geeta Basra is better much has a way to go Aseem Merchant irritates Suresh Menon is as usual, Rajat Bedi fills the bill
The acting is terrible, the scripts/stories are terrible, the directing and producing in fact the production as a whole is terrible.
It's a 'sea of holes', in fact.
Nobody believes him, even though he is, in fact, correct.
Anyway, I've never before gone through the plot in one of my IMDb reviews but here I will give it a go cause I really am not sure what I just saw... so here's what I thought I saw:  there is this cute lovable guy he's got this annoying girlfriend who would drive a saint away, she's very jealous and her idea is that he must be sick of her cause who wouldn't be with her "boring face" and in fact, she's right about this.
at one point (forgive my non chron account) he even agrees to see this one girl who is not very pretty and who kind of masochistically insists on making it very clear that he doesn't really like her, in spite of which though of course because there is something seriously wrong with this guy he's willing to be with her...in fact when she's shooting a gun it really makes him think she looks "awesome" OK sure why not, look on the bright side why don't you.
when the girl shows up with her old face pasted over her new one, I"m confused as to whether this is cafe girl or original girl... OK maybe Asian womens' faces don't make as strong an impression on me as they might .... but it seemed to me that it was in fact the cafe girl who stole the photo and cut it out and so would be wearing it... unless somehow it got into the hands of the surgery gal.
At first Cathy is spooked to find a Negro in her garden - in fact she is surprised at least THREE times to find a Negro in her garden.
Far From Heaven has been explained as a "woman's film," and a "surefire tear jerker," but in fact it's intended for the kind of woman who would cry at the sight of a washing machine that wobbles a bit during its spin cycle.
as kids story's go,this ones no different-something happens,hero has to fix it(save/find/insert relevant problem here),has abit of trouble on way but alls OK in end-that much am pretty sure can give away without being accused of mentioning spoilers,in fact that could probably describe any child orientated film.If your kids like animated movies,this will make them happy regardless what i think.On other hand though,if they expect anything different on the animation front,they will be disappointed-most of the animation could have been done just as decent(or badly,depending on point of view,) in the 50's,in fact it looks like they may even have had that in mind intentionally when they made it for all i know.
Incidentally, this has to be Presley's most eccentric vehicle: it combines the period setting of the star's own FRANKIE AND JOHNNY (1966) with the carnival backdrop of his ROUSTABOUT (1964); however, he seems quite lost here (this was, in fact, Elvis' penultimate film) in which he's given just one typical number ("Clean Up Your Own Back Yard") and where his hair-do and trademark stage moves clash with the feel of quaint Americana the narrative is striving for!
Is it bloody, no, in fact most killings are off screen.
It's not a matter of 'not getting it' it's not actually that witty, mysterious or thrilling at all, in fact if you don't have the phrase 'who cares' going round in your head there's something wrong with you.
Dwarfism is not a normal human condition, it's in fact a serious genetic ailment with tremendous health consequences, and depending on form can often lead to an early death.
It's classified as a "reality TV program" when in fact Pauly Shore himself admitted a great deal of it is written because he is bored by reality TV.
didn't like it at all was not what i expected it ruined a classic and the story was way off as the Iggy's dad was not the mayor and it was in fact Mrs Claus who went to mother nature not Santa himself and the characters were all wrong it did not have one good point in the who thing they even managed to ruin the snow miser and heat miser songs it was a major disaster i changed the channel and never went back too see it may now Hollywood will leave well enough alone but I'm not holding my breath anyways it was a waste of air time some might find it amusing but i did not and it was awful hopefully it will never air again but I'm not holding my breath on that one either
Now, that might not be a bad thing -- in fact, I think it could be easier to make a good movie about bad parties than about good ones -- but the advertising is dishonest.
By all accounts, his marriage to Catherina who he did in fact paint several times (in contrast to what is suggested in Chevalier's storyline that he never painted her because she did not understand or appreciate his work)was a happy marriage.
My life was never the same...(until of course I saw Jaws 4 when in fact it was 'exactly' the same as when watching this!)
This movie was so bad, in fact, it drove my friend to perform the terrible act of biting into an onion like it was an apple.
I am generally a fan of George Clooney, in fact O Brother, Where Art Thou?
Those interested in facts about the woman can get more from the Internet in 15 minutes than from this 90 minute flick.
The title might suggest that this is a cheap porn movie but this in fact is a sappy made for TV movie.
Our 9-year old daughter told us how disappointed she was that the girl was rebellious with no consequences for that behavior (in fact, she is rewarded), and our 16-year old said it was too sappy for her taste.
Was "Flicka" in fact a mustang?
But as it is, the Bugs Bunny scene is really the only scene worth watching; in fact, if you watch only that scene, you just might come away with a good impression of the movie.
OK, not buying that, your car just blew up, shouldn't you be talking to the cops, shouldn't you be scared and sad at your car, it is in fact a Porche no?
Al Pacino is almost always the best thing about a film, but in Jon Avnet's 88 Minutes, even Scarface himself can't punch up this material; in fact he doesn't even appear to try.
Quite possibly the best film ever made featuring rapping white ambulance attendants - in fact, I think rap and hip-hop music in general received a monumental boost in its quest for legitimacy after Uptown and Mad Mike belted their street-savvy showstopper at the conclusion of Paramedics.
It even had plenty of breast shots, in fact there was loads of flesh on display.
All I remembered was that it seemed like something worth the three dollars the guy was asking, but after years of being burned in my search for decent-bad cinema, I wasn't all that shocked to discover that Class Reunion Massacre is, in fact, not worth the three dollars I paid.
please listen to me and give it a miss , in fact when its on terrestrial TV (in about 4 weeks i'd say) just go out for a picnic or something ... anything to get away from it !!
Walken isn't fading out or losing appeal, in fact he just had a role in the critical and box office hit, Hairspray.
All we get to find out about him is that he hasn't the slightest conscience of killing people (in fact the whole thing means very little to him) and he thinks he's rather funny.
So many in fact; I could not keep track of what was in the movie that was not in the book and vice versa.
There's no romance between them, in fact their kisses seem awkward and forced, and a bit disgusting, given how much older than her he looks (not to mention his lack of sex appeal and passion) The script itself is terrible, deviating from the book, having her challenging him at a time when in the book, she can barely speak to him.
Rowan, proving to her class that some urban legends have no basis in fact, looks in a mirror and says Candyman five times.
Most of the reason for this is because it is, in fact, a video and not a film.
Being Creative is better than being in the Mainstream, and the two are in fact mutually exclusive.
I get the impression that the "composer" employed for this stinker was, in fact, a failed auditioner for Def Leppard's still-vacant keytarist position.
But she doesn't, in fact, she hardly appears in the movie at all.
it kills the book in fact, and changes the plot.
The worst element though is the music, never have I actually heard music that has forced me to hit the mute button until this film; in fact, it may not be a bad idea to have mute on for the whole of the film (except perhaps for the apparently random sex scenes).
It felt more like a Hilary Duff film and I was not surprised to learn the part of Lola was in fact offered to her first.
I don't mind mindless, escapist entertainment ... in fact, that's why I rented this DVD.
So bad in fact that I was actually laughing most of the way through... Best comedy of the year.
The only fight scene in Black Dawn sees one of the worst body doubles ever stand in for Seagal who is fat in this, in fact he is really fat & out of shape in this.
SF just the way Joe Fanboy likes it, in fact.
Though Penn and Teller seem to want to align themselves with empirical science and skeptical intellectualism, they are in fact attacking those very values with their prejudiced and opinionated approach.
Scientific research clearly indicates that second-hand smoking is in fact harmful - a fact that completely undermines their argument.
Well, in good documentaries, you get to see all sides of an issue, in fact usually you have an issue presented.
The editing, in fact, ruined the film for me as the black outs came at the climax.
Jesus was in fact arrested by the Temple Guards (Jewish, not Roman).
this movie is supposed to be a comedy but in fact it is just a mess.
Incidentally, Craven knew when he had a good thing going and, so, reproduced here two death methods from the original Â Berryman himself, in fact, expires yet again at the hands of Beast (though he's met with the fate that had previously befallen his brother Mercury), while The Reaper's come-uppance is an even more elaborate and protracted stunt than Jupiter's demise in the 1977 film and which would have been more appropriate for a Road Runner cartoon!
The title might suggest that this is a cheap porn movie but this in fact is a sappy made for TV movie.
It brings nothing new to the genre in fact it only seems to repeat the same stale old clichÃ©s that have already been done to death - I mean female vampire as lesbian seducer?
And in fact this goes for any fight in this film that I care to remember.
He's here, and in fact is joined by several identical others, who assault Liu Kang with their reflective cardboard blades in a high-flying trapeze act straight out of the circus.
The movie focuses on so many different players and team execs on Team Canada that it in fact gives the audience very little insight into how the players really felt.
Watching this once more without distorted soundtrack, in fact watching in Italian, it is a sumptuous visual and aural feast.
And in fact, to persons of normal morality, he does deserve to hang, since he murdered three people for nothing but money.
The title of this comment is as original as the writing of this programme, what is disguised as witty, alternate comedy is in fact old sitcom rubbish reinvented to create the illusion of decent new age comedy.
Several in fact.
Redemption proves that Don Wilson is no longer the fierce martial artist that ruled the low budget martial arts scene in the Bloodfist movies, in fact Wilson has softened his approach and has tried to use his typically wooden presence to make the stretch as a corrupt cop.
the mannered failure of the principal actress to - well - act is  insupportable, and the annoyance is not decreased by a sense  that the director doesnt particularly care, in fact might prefer it that  way.
She's probably the least significant of the three female characters - and somehow fails to wind up with the man - in fact bizarrely, she is the one whom NONE of the men find worthwhile to pursue!
Now I don't mind torture, gore & violence in the films that I watch, in fact I actively encourage it, I cannot & will not enjoy the constant sadistic torture, both psychical & mental, of women by retarded men for entertainment.
I wouldn't call it scary or creepy & surprisingly there's very little gore considering the subject matter, in fact I can't think of any apart from some blood splatter.
I read that Ellis in fact, stated that in the novel, all that actually ever happened was that Bateman might have horrible thoughts of you and draw horrible pictures as well.
Freeman attempted to make her this convincing detail oriented killer, with a killer body, but the result was anything but scary Â in fact Â one could go so far to say that it was "killer funny".
So while watching the movie it may appear that Goldwyn had to make do with the likes of Phil Baker and the Ritz Brothers, but in fact he had other available resources which he foolishly chose to employ.
So fast in fact, that it's obvious to everyone he needs to make a trip to the emergency room, pronto!
In addition, someone gave them a song to sing that is among the most UNINTENTIONALLY funny and obscene songs ever written--as they repeat the same word AGAIN and AGAIN and AGAIN--in fact, this is the entire chorus (it's a euphemism for BOTH a cat and part of a female's anatomy).
So here we have a present day crime thriller crossed with sci-fi time travel...And, this movie kicks butt, works so well, in fact, it's nuances should be studied in film school.
But it never happens and when the lid, towards the end, slowly slides off on its own accord it turns out that the ones you suspected were bad guys were in fact...bad guys.
The film, in fact, is a bit of a mess Â generally heavy-handed and peopled by obnoxious characters (especially Neville Brand as the grizzled psycho, William Finley Â the titular figure of Brian De Palma's PHANTOM OF THE PARADISE [1974] himself Â as a weirdo staying at the hotel with his family, and a young Robert Englund as a yokel who deems himself the self-appointed local stud).
The only time, in fact, when he doesn't whisper is when he's ecstatic that he's bleeding.
There is some trick photography, but nothing new; in fact, these tricks (superimpositions, stop substitutions, a fish tank between characters and the camera to represent being under the sea, a tilted camera to make them appear to be going up and down stream) had been in use for near a decade or more even by then.
After the Big Fat Greek wedding (that I liked), this was awful... got the feeling that the Greek tourist agency paid a lot to 'force' them to make this movie..... resulting in this uninspired 'movie'..... in fact I would not call this a real movie.... it's more a far too long commercial for Greece...... but it's worse than that because you get a strange impression of the country and I can't imagine that the Greek tourist agency had this intention... what a waste of time an energy.......
The arrogant vanity of all of these people, who clearly believe themselves to be the most beautiful creatures on earth when they are in fact extremely ugly (except for Beckinsale who qualifies as cute but disturbingly vain and rampant), is nauseating in the extreme.
This is not a film for those with low attention spans and in fact it's primary interest besides the presence of Ms. Dor is probably how it's absolutely obscure and difficult to find.
As far as the cinematography goes it's quite nice, brilliant in fact along with the score.
Neil Gaiman, on the other hand, has proved throughout his publishing career that he possesses no more literary talent than one would expect from a prancing-penned, new-age, semi-goth, leather-jacket-and-sunglasses twit who apparently missed the musical bulletin that Bela Lugosi is, in fact, dead.
What The Waitress does is take a case, where dumping the jerk IS more than appropriate, and causes lingering anticipatory angst in a woman's mind, seeing similar things in the men she lives around, stretching now to find them, when, in fact, those things looked for so hard are not even close to really being part of what the men around those women will do or are being, in degree nor goal, even being capable of mimicking.
Her big sister Donna can get all the men she desires, in fact she has a new one every night of the week.
All it is is that Cindy and Donna are sisters, half-sisters in fact, who have a father (well one is the real father, we know this because the one who's the non-biological daughter gets a sex scene with the guy - that's right, near-incest, yum to that) that goes around to various whores and gets addicted to one that's her daughters' ages, and a mother who is drunk 24/7 and complains about her husband without doing much about it.
i really enjoyed the original Tremors.it worked on a lot of levels.unfortunately,this sequel doesn't.it seems to be mostly played for camp value,but i don't think it works very well.i found it very mostly very slow and boring.there were a few almost amusing moments,but overall,it was a disappointment.Kevin Bacon passed on this one,and it's easy to see why.he must have read the script.Fred Ward is back,but without Bacon,he his character just doesn't work as well.Michael Gross returns,and doesn't have much too do.also,i thought the dialogue was pretty cringe worthy at times.plus,the movie isn't really original.in fact it borrows heavily from another big movie that had come out a few years ago.i've seen worse movies,but this one still ranks as a major disappointment.for me,Tremors 2 is a 4/10.
While Edwards claimed the point of this film was to honor Sellers' legacy, in fact he felt the same way of his dead star as Herbert Lom's Chief Inspector Dreyfus did of Clouseau, unable to refer to him in promotional interviews for this movie as anything other than "Sellers."
So enthralled are the pitiable, deluded fools by our lowest common denominator pop culture orts that they expend large amounts of their time and energy on plagarizing what is already watered down Tarantino, Romero, and Zimmer, by which I mean that this movie has in fact more in common with Paul Anderson's awful adaptation of the `Resident Evil' games, in themselves a tribute to Romero's classic `Living Dead' trilogy, Roger Avary's almost equally awful `Killing Zoe', needless to say a very second-rate imitation of `Reservoir Dogs', and the musical excretion of Klaus `The Uncomposer' Badelt, who has become rich and famous by simply imitating his only slightly superior and in general grossly overrated mentor Hans Zimmer.
And those particular scenes are in fact just a shadow of the ones in the original Hellraisers.
There are some decent performances but the whole is a lot less than the sum of its parts, which in fact adds up to less than zero.
But when i realized that this was in fact the movie and that it really was this ugly i almost laughed until i started to cry.
Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one big thrill, in fact.
Mainly because when this low budget movie was originally released by its unscrupulous distributors it was dismissed as another trashy drive-in horror movie, when in fact few realized the brilliance to be found within it.
This is a very good story, and in fact is done very well by the animators.
Not so hot, in fact quite poor.
This film is, in fact, not a comedy at all, but rather one of those light entertainment films which is classified as a comedy simply because it's not a drama.
I saw this on cable last night, just 2 days after seeing the Sprecher sisters' latest film, 13 Conversations About One Thing - that was the reason I stayed up til 2:30 a.m. to watch it, in fact (please read my review of 13 Conversations, posted yesterday).
The original concept, writing and approach to the character in 'The Death of Batman' are not good ideas and, in fact, the entire short is a extremely bad idea.
One of the players, Richard Rober, in fact was killed in an automobile crash in 1952.
I saw this movie and was impressed first only for one reason .The new concept of short term memory loss .But then later when I saw the original one Memento I was totally awestruck by how beautifully the screenplay was done ,you in fact live with the character ,which you can never feel for once in Ghajini .Well thats not the only flaw the whole brilliance and intelligence of Mememto is diminished in Ghajini .
Or you could read the book by John Wyndham 'The Midwich Cuckoos', in fact do anything other than watch this contender for 'Worst Remake Ever'.
I don't recall any mention of that in the remake; in fact, Alley mentions how long she has been observing the children.
They could at least have made some cool blues soundtrack (for which you could hope having read the title), but in fact the soundtrack was colourless and boring as well.
Firstly, I have no recollection of this being set in America (in fact the first book in the series is set in Cornwall...
The movie does a good job between not too obviously demonizing hackers and between in fact doing exactly that, for example, when Kevin is shown having trouble getting along with a girlfriend.
The movie is fine, but what makes me flush it down the drain is that the people creating it portray it as a true story, when it is in fact BS!
The "serial killer" is in fact a crocodile, a large and impressive crocodile, but a crocodile none the less and I'm sorry to say but a crocodile, which kills in defense of territory or for food, cannot be a serial killer.
I, along with other viewers,was duped into thinking that this was about a serial killer when in fact it was about an animal that kills humans.
After you discover that in fact the monster you're chasing IS the giant crocodile you're greeted with some humanitarian green piece film that will annoy you to death.
If in fact this film was based on a true story (as indicated at the beginning), I would be horrified if I were close to one of the victims.
The cyborg love interest seems to have the personality of a cocker spaniel, making it difficult to have much feeling for her, and in fact all attempts to wring an emotional reaction from the material fail abysmally.
What they should've done was make the fur/hair yellow/gold and keep the green tint in the eyes, this would've made much more sense, SSJ 4 in DBGT sucks to say the least (in fact it was the biggest disappointment of the series).
It's that badly edited in fact, that it just looks like a 2 VCR editing setup with a MIC attached.
The kind of movie that possibly passes for interesting outside of Los Angeles where presumably people think we must be so smart and funny and sensitive and so fail to realize that we are, in fact, as prone to vapid fart-noises as to anything else...
I was mislead into thinking that this would be an interesting story from the opening scene but I was more than wrong, in fact the film doesn't really have a coherent storyline at all.
You really don't care who lives or dies - in fact I was hoping they'd all be dead by the end.
They obviously have their own agenda, but in fact the picture in question (which suggests eyes seen through a veil of hair) actually has a certain amount of expressive power, and when Jerome objects, you expect him to say, 'My five-year-old nephew could do better stuff than that!'
Maybe Zwigoff knew all along that he'd attract a certain audience - the type who assumes it's coming to sneer at these tired, overblown, kiss-ass stereotypes - when, in fact, the tables were turned and he's actually laughing at our banal sense of superiority, not to mention our eagerness to project greatness onto any schlock he throws our way.
This was never proved and, in fact, the entire religion actually comes off looking legitimate, especially with the fantasy shot in which the guru touches Ruth's forehead and a third eye opens up in her forehead, which suggests that this guru actually does have spiritual powers, which contradicts the rest of the film.
Granted, this is one of those films where you can actually see where it went wrong for the most part, but of course there's other stuff they added in that's supposed to be poetic or symbolic or something and what it in fact ends up being is really annoying.
This wasn't; in fact this made me genuinely angry.
This is either bad acting, bad script, but in fact it was both.
It's so stupid even a real person would not bitch about it, in fact they would just drink it or not , Thats a simple solution but to bitch repeatedly about it is dumb.
It's only when I saw so many credits at the end I realised the 10 year old directing the film must have a lot of friends, who also must have seen the Australian film called Undead which used similar opening well sort of, but was one heck of a lot better, in fact it was good.
I could not find any dramatic line leading to the violent ending, everything seemed to be just pasted, mixing all ingredients without a functional recipe, some of it worked, animation fitted in quite smoothly, in fact I missed more of it, soundtrack is again quite suited to the action.
She keeps having visions of Ginger, who tries to tell her that the inevitable is, in fact, inevitable.
Very close, in fact, to the first movie.
The premise offers no surprises whatsoever and, in fact, here again we have sisters as the leading characters - one virtuous, one wicked (around this same time, Hammer Films made TWINS OF EVIL [1971] - which were played by Maltese actresses, by the way - and which, alas, I've never watched!).
The film was actually shot in 1970 but the BBFC refused it a certificate - realizing, perhaps, that it was pure exploitation and not really a horror film at all; in fact, it only got released when the producers took the film to the apparently more lenient censor boards of individual towns, after which the BBFC relented!
Hugh and Julianne have been much better in other roles, in fact I don't like Julianne as a comedic actress, her forte is definitely drama.
If you get it into your head that the great Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky was in fact a boozy Welsh actor, then you might be able to sit through this mess.
Now, here is a quality actress who does not mind exposure at all.. in fact she wants it!
More so in fact that it doesn't even deserve 1 star.
I don't regret watching this movie, in fact, where it not for the nudity and language, it would be worthy of MST3K.
There is the grad student in charge of the watching over the kids (this guy is a jerk and he never dies or gets any comeuppance, in fact, it's like they forgot about this character halfway through the movie).
In most respects, many agree that this sequel is in fact better than the first movie ... but they're both so great, I don't even feel the need to compare them.
I was a bit concerned about the fact that this wasn't written by the same team as the first movie (in fact screenwriter Megan Martin seems to have no other credits to her name), but it is actually an interesting twist on the original, written by someone who clearly understood what Ginger Snaps was all about.
I found the ending ridiculous in fact, as in junk, unworthy of the build up of the rest of the film.
The overall movie is not really that great, but the nude scenes with Rochelle Swanson, in fact any scenes with her in are watchable.
I can finally say that I'm cured, I can recognize junk from miles away  All thanks to "The Last Samurai", which I will never forget  Fidel PolvorÃ³n   PS1: this is based on a true story... in fact, it's 100% a true story   PS2: I gave it 4/10, just because Ken Watanabe, Art and Costumes
You may think this is a 'funny' bad film , but in fact its just plain boring.
The gross mistakes and overly clever dialogue (which is in fact, borrowed completely and incorrectly from other, more successful movies) completely distracts from the attempted emotional examination of abortion, death penalty, etc.
Helgenberger is pretty good in this segment - in fact, she's one of the best things in the whole picture.
Talking of Slim's zombie horse the special effects on it are poor, as are most of the special effects in House II: The Second Story in fact, although as I've already said the zombie Slim looked good.
I was really mentally fatigued so i decided to spend the evening with something mindless, just dribble in fact.
From what i can tell it is in fact a documentary made to somehow make us feel sorry for comedians etc for the heckles they get,and i went into it expecting it to be more about showing how comedians handle the hecklers and turn a heckle into the funniest part of their shows (which if handled correctly is often the case),but alas its not.
That man was not a Christian believer at all, in fact, he could be an atheist or any other thing, but not Christian as they pretend to show in the movie.
Johnny Depp is pretty nice, as one might expect, in fact all the cast is pretty nice.
Even though the author of the novel (Ronald Giphart) has a cameo in this movie where he states that the movie is in fact a lot better than the book - this film is absolute crap.
From the "Electronics Department" of the Military, and their semi-serious banter about the technology of their half human, half machine aliens, to the many, many shots containing the inept main characters looking out their windows through the curtains (curtains play a large large role, they hide the fact that there are in fact only two real sets in this film), Target Earth is borish, banal, and most importantly, a bore.
Famous for it's censorship wrangles and delayed release, SON OF SINBAD is like a kids film made for dirty old men..in fact that is exactly what it is......Vincent Price plays the whole thing like he is really Eve Arden.
Soon, however, Hamlet discovers that his father was, in fact, the victim of murder most foul, and vows to avenge his untimely demise.
There are suggestions that Palestinian refugees all "fled" Palestine when many were forced in fact forced out by Zionist militias and/or terrorism.
I liked it a lot, in fact even more than the first movie.
It's also very questionable that history would look anything like they're portraying it if the South had in fact won.
in fact, in the modern part toward the end, it was a little surreal.
in the second half the cast and crew tried it's best to put the audience to sleep, (and a few did in fact doze off) but i kept up with caffeine and bore the film (as it bored me) so i could warn others about this heinous crime against film making!)
It was, in fact, LAPD Officer John Nelson who presented the S.W.A.T.
So have machetes in fact .
Nothing really works that well, while watching it last night I just thought it was a collection of seemingly random incidents stringed together & you never get to know any of the character's, in fact I couldn't really name them now as I couldn't really tell them apart.
It is so bone-idle, that it in fact levers in a cheesy romance plot between Chance and a stray called Delilah!
Egg has a chance encounter in a cafe with a television idol dreamboat that seems too good to be true and, in fact, is.
It is the wavelength that will in fact decrease.
But after seeing how the bullies treat various other students David has none of it, and in fact tries to befriend and help the picked on students.
Of course, no prison can hold Quinn, who meticulously engineers his escape in one brilliant sequence (the best one in the entire film, in fact), teams up with flamboyant arms-dealer Yaz (Color-me-bad former San Antonio Spurs basketball sensation Dennis Rodman) and together the two go after Stavros, who has kidnapped Quinn's pregnant wife and is threatening to kill her once the baby is born and then raise it has his own.
this movie is not that great.i found the story too banal(ordinary).there's not much originality here.it's a combination of many other movies.it's equal parts a Christmas Carol,It's a Wonderful Life,How the Grinch Stole Christmas,and Even The Cat in the Hat movie.the movie isn't very funny,but there is a bit of slapstick that works.this movie is,i felt,overly sentimental and preachy.in fact,i felt like i was watching a 90 minute commercial on how important family is.now,don't get me wrong.family is very important.i just find that subtlety works best with these movies.this was just way too heavy handed for me.but there is some good news.the movie has a great visual style.i mean,it looks fantastically magical.and Martin Short is terrific as Jack Frost,the baddie of the piece.he's not really scary,more mildly disconcerting than anything,and even a bit sad.i also like the look they gave him.this movie is also a bit of a tearjerker.anyway,this is a case of style over substance.and while it's not nearly as mean spirited or creepy as part 2,i still don't think it was as good.the negatives just outweigh the positives.for me,The Santa Clause 3 is a 4/10
And while this comes as a shock to her father at first, despite the insistence of his girlfriend, Janet (Catherine Hicks) that this is all normal for the girl and in fact, good for her, he is still unconvinced and becomes not only paranoid, but soon enters therapy.
I found the ending ridiculous in fact, as in junk, unworthy of the build up of the rest of the film.
The kids, in fact, didn't really talk about how they felt living with two "mothers" and then three.
It looks like the producers (if, in fact, there were any) just stuck two different movies together and hoped no one would notice.
To be honest, the first half of the film is in fact quite amusing due to its low production value and completely dysfunctional storyline, but it becomes somewhat aggravating to watch the latter half when these redeeming qualities get old.
The movie will in fact turn out a lot better if you keep that thought in mind.
The events presented are, in fact, realities of the lives of today's young people: sex, drug use, suicide, and mental illness are all dealt with in some way or another.
The first joke is that, behind a mask of piety and respectability, Victorian men were in fact all incredibly randy.
The device he thought was fake, the one which would purportedly a distant wiretapper to turn any telephone receiver anywhere in the world into a live microphone, in fact WORKED, and Harry destroyed everything in his flat looking for newly-planted bug when the only bug present was the one that had been there all along.
A lot of people preferred the first film also with James Ryan as Steve Chase in "Kill and Kill Again", but I must tell you that the box-office figures tell a very different story...in fact, depending on how old you are, you might remember a film made by Bo Derek's husband John Derek called "10" ...a 'tits and bums' vehicle to show off the many charms of his lovely wife that did very well at the box-office and was released the same year as "Kill and Kill Again'.
The long list of credits disproves my theory that it was in fact, concocted over a drunken weekend by a bunch of bored, penniless students.
The acting is poor, the characters are reaching (striving, in fact) to be more than cliches, and the story is boring and played out.
It was also a surprize seeing the final guest star, playing himself, and in fact a reason for searching IMDb for this movie!
She has a couple of moments so honest, in fact, that they deserve to have been airlifted into a better film.
Shane Black is gone, in fact he walked away from Lethal Weapon 2 when they refused to make it as dark as he originally wrote it.
I only watched this movie for two reasons: 1) it was on sat TV v late at night and I was wide awake working on some emails and 2) I was actually working in Bucharest when this was filmed - it was filmed just near my office in fact.
Both these movies are MUCH better written and succeed in sweeping the viewer away to a magical world of adventure, while Kismet just seems pretty but dopey--in fact, REALLY dopey.
However this movie went from poor too terrible, bad to worse, was just awful, everything about the movie made me think to myself is this for real, several times i paused the movie to check on IMDb that this movie was in fact a horror.
The movie is just summed up when the i become aware that Satan was in fact just a man, with pure white long hair, which is a key stereotype for a angel, so just from that aspect any one can tell this film was so bad that i demanded a refund, i stronger recommend no one buys this movie and watches it for that matter.
This movie should have been an homage to the novel, but it was in fact a disgrace.
This is in fact true for the entire cast.
What you get is quite the opposite - in fact the characters seem to be confined by such a level of endless impossibility that the throughout the film, I found myself fearing an imminent gunfight.
There were no gunfire duals, in fact hardly any guns fired at all.
The plot doesn't matter, it in fact just shows clips from the first movie through the middle of the movie, but when you meet the title character Ricky face to face you realize that the movie is taking a turn for the best/worst.
It is so unrealistic, in fact, that, as the action proceeded, my primary focus became noticing things which just weren't depicted as they would happen in everyday life.
The songs are repetitive and in fact tunes from a previous Rajshri film (Maine Pyar Kiya) can be heard in at least one of these songs (I have to watch this film again to be more specific, but I would rather be corrected than suffer through it again).
Given the filmâs title, this one obviously highlights the living dead â but, thankfully, it doesnât follow the then-prevalent flesh-eating pattern cemented by George A. Romero; the plot, in fact, is pretty complex and also involves transcendental, voodoo and occult rituals as well as a masked assassin!
The film has been released on DVD by BCI Eclipse but, since I canât say that Iâve been all that impressed by the starâs outings so far, I donât own any of them in this format: in fact, VENGEANCE OF THE ZOMBIES itself came via a full-frame English-dubbed edition sourced from a damaged VHS and accompanied by forced Finnish subtitles!
(in fact, Pinhead appears only in the imagination of the characters) 2)There's no computer hackers involved 3)There's no such "virtual Lament Configuration"
The producers seem aware of this shoehorning a squid attack just to remind the audience there's a squid central to the plot when in fact it's the producers themselves who obviously need reminding   As it's produced by Nu Image Films the production values are rather poor with the squid being a rather obvious CGI creation .
It's a disastrous movie and wouldn't dream of watching it - in fact, as a karate enthusiast I'm insulted that they used Karate magazine comments in the trailer (I can only hope they were totally out of context!)
However, not to trash Spike to much, this movie defiantly obtained a cult status, so if the plot interests you this movie just MIGHT be for you, cause its definitely wasn't for me ... in fact I can say this movie was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
Holmes NEVER showed anything but contempt for most women (save two) in the stories and NEVER was sexually interested in any woman--in fact, he was repulsed by them.
Which months in fact included a Pegg parody, "Hot Fuzz."
NoÂnot at all, in fact, but it could have been worse.
Still, the film itself is a bit of a mess anyway: Dracula Snr., depicted as a Max Schreck lookalike, is killed by Jonesâ Baron Frankenstein â the villain of the piece, with evil dwarf Skip Martin for an assistant; Price, on his last legs, turns up as Van Helsing (the film, in fact, was clearly shot in 1972 but released after his death) and Leigh is his luscious secretary â who attracts Nilssonâs amorous attentionsâ¦so much so that he decides to renounce his vampiric ways (except that with it goes his claim to immortality!
And there are parts in "Carpool" where he is, in fact, funny.
I know that he's a bit of a British institution and he was beloved behind the old Iron Curtain, but his movies and television programs were not popular here in the States--in fact, he's almost completely unknown.
Linda does not react with any feelings of betrayal, and in fact becomes his little assistant so that Ray can go from brain to brain and figure out who killed his wife.
What really slowed the series down to a crawl was the need to force certain other characters back into the plot, even though they no longer had any purpose, and should in fact have died in the season finale.
This is not at all rare on the program, in fact it is a running joke I love.
The younger of the brothers, Will (Andrew Stevens, who also produces here as well as contributing heavily to the screenplay), a rather artless character, does in fact espy Nikki in flagrante delicto, but this apparently fortuitous event for Brian is nullified because Will has succumbed to the physical charms of the wayward wife and has decided to withhold the evidential tape from the musician and his attorney, played by able supporting player Paul Carr, causing a viewer to recognize that the lovestruck security guard can not be considered as an example of rectitude.
I thought that the treatment of the characters, their discourse and social relations, was beautiful and authentic...and in fact unmatched by any of the usual Hollywood fare.
I don't claim to be an expert on Blackbeard, in fact like many of us I really have just a basic understanding of who he was.
I only included it in the âEpicâ challenge for this reason and had, in fact, intended to watch Carl Theodor Dreyerâs 1928 masterpiece THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC as part of a marathon to commemorate the 40th anniversary of his deathâ¦but had to abandon the whole idea and, in the process, considerably streamline the schedule for the rest of the month following an unexpected death in the family which turned into a national tragedy!
in fact, i want that hour and a half of my life back.
Given the filmâs title, this one obviously highlights the living dead â but, thankfully, it doesnât follow the then-prevalent flesh-eating pattern cemented by George A. Romero; the plot, in fact, is pretty complex and also involves transcendental, voodoo and occult rituals as well as a masked assassin!

I'm honestly not sure whether this review is in fact spoiling anything, because the trailer does a pretty good job of that on its own.
They're not particularly interesting and to me, and in fact, are annoying enough to give someone the homicidal twitch.
The voice of the dummy is not scary it all, in fact it reminded me a little of Chris from Family Guy.
The government told them so enough times --- in fact certain tenacious hardliners still do.
As far as teen horror movies go, the 80s gave us plenty of them, good ones in fact.
Most of these men are in fact obsessed with Paula, including Principal Dante (Roddy McDowall), which is a little disturbing.
Whereas it would seem a given that the nuclear attack should occur fairly soon into the pilot episode, it in fact doesn't arise until almost the half way mark.
I checked out the director Allan A Goldstien and was not surprised to find nothing of interest in his resume (in fact I am half thinking that this is a pseudo name).
whenever there is a movie showing struggle for independence, it is usually shown that one or two British officers are commanding and giving orders to their servants- the Indian subordinates Â working as soldiers Â and in fact they are the ones Â Indians ie, who used to charge the freedom fighters (FF) with laathis and even gunned them down.now please do not give me examples of 2-3 such soldiers out of 500-1000 soldiers working as spies to the FF Â I am talking about majority Â Might is right Â?
Â here I would in fact like to appreciate the British officers to train the otherwise sluggish Indians and made them workÂfor them of course !
I'm not some Harvard-art-major-film-noir-weenie (in fact, I went to the college at the other end of Mass.
By the halfway point, I had this film in my liked column, but then it just went on and on and on, in fact, even though I have left the theater, I still think the film is running.

The American movie business calls them "comic relief" characters, but in fact that means they are not destined to make it big in the business.
We were young and Bertolucci was very left-wing so it was de rigueur to find this great, but in fact it was boring.
The script is in fact strikingly redundant to the point of plagiarising the tremendous production made several years ago, "Churchill: the Wilderness Years" with Robert Hardy and SiÃ¢n Phillips.
Historical experts who checked Haley's genealogical research discovered that, as one put it, "Haley got everything wrong in his pre-Civil War lineage and none of his plantation ancestors existed; 182 pages have no basis in fact."
Too many thoughts to organize them properly, but here goes: humans have developed an immunity to vampire bites so they can't reproduce, in fact just breathing our air may kill them, which is why the few remaining vampires have a 4-stage air filtration system in their lair.
What I most liked about this film was the sense of realness, as I watched it(though the language was English) I felt that somehow I was in fact watching an actually documentary as it unfolded.
The "love story" between Woodbine and Ms. Ling has no teeth; in fact, the shooting of a gay vampire's testicle is played as sexier.
I don't think we ever did get to see this "perfect city" of New Angeles that was always talked about, in fact, when the main characters finally reached New Angeles, its set in a factory or warehouse full of pipes and walkways; hardly the kind of "kingdom" the owner/creator of an entire city would dwell in.
The editing in the action scenes is irritatingly restless and pointless as the film tries to show many things with these fast edits, but manages, in fact, to show only less by these too plenty edits.
), the costumes look like they were from the Mad Max rejection pile...in fact, this entire film is like one giant Mad Max outtake!
The story is something like BBC documentary supplied with poor and, in fact, unnecessary acting.
The first few times I let it go b/c urban inner-city (read: Black life) does, in fact, reflect some of those things, some of the time.
Not only was the murder scene not secured, but suspects "et al" were allowed to come and go through it at will, and in fact there was never any "boffin" in sight.
in fact, i didn't know much about the movie at all, but after some good recommendations from friends i was quite looking forward to it.
the only way i can describe this picture without swearing is a mess... in fact, it was so bad it encouraged me to sign up to IMDb so i could express just how painful an experience watching 'a history of violence' was!
SPOILER - now, don't get me wrong, i'm always down for Maria Bello with a completely untied dressing gown (in fact i waited what felt like years for that to happen in ER), but, in the context of the film, for the love of god WHY?
However we could see that in fact Caleb feels a bit for him after the party they got together and the scene in the video store where Caleb confessed to Marc 'You are just awesome in the piano"....Certainly this is something that if I was directing the movie I would like to explore more.
Presumably,as a minor, they would consult with his mother before prescribing these drugs, and in fact, it would be very unusual for them to even accept him as a patient without first having contact with a parent -- at very least to arrange for payment (this being the United States).
So Gustin Nash has the student be a thief as well - this poor suicidal character (the suicide attempt, incidentally, is straight out of "Pump Up The Volume," as is Charlie Bartlett's speech near the end and his subsequent arrest - in fact, as he is put into the back of the police car in slow motion, I couldn't help but turn to my friends and say "Talk hard").
The novel's tragic irony is that the 'daughter' the Mayor sacrifices everything for is not, in fact, his biological daughter.
Welcome to Evil's City, where the population isn't in fact 4,320; it's 0!
I gotta be honest when going in to this film i was expecting not much but i at least thought it would have been a half decent cheesy horror movie with plentiful nudity there was in fact a lot of nudity but in this case it did the film no help.
The other user comments here suggest that I am not alone in having undergone this terrifying experience, which can only mean one of two things: a) the film does, in fact, exist, or b) I am but one victim among legions of an international conspiracy of truly sinister proportions.
We just couldn't get enough of these enigmatic stealth assassins in fact.
Despite ninja mania in full swing at the time, the show curiously lasted for only one season before disappearing as quickly as......um.......well, a ninja in fact.
There are no scenes that are just good to look at, no memorable pieces of dialouge or memerable characters... fairly pointless all around in fact.
What is not mentioned is that his "bible" contains only the moral teachings of Jesus, with the complete expurgation of miracles and everything else Jefferson considered spurious, because Jefferson was in fact a deist, more or less the eighteenth century equivalent of the modern atheist.
But in fact the Democratic and Republican parties are both right of center compared to the parties of every other Western industrialized nation.
And if it WERE the former, rather then the latter, all the likability of Brian flies out the window as no matter how charismatic a stalker may be, the fact remains that they ARE in fact stalking someone.
The acting was uniformly awful except for Armande - in fact, the film is almost watchable during his scenes.
Even repetitive bursts of Mike Brady's "Up There Cazaly" (which comprises the entire soundtrack) don't help, in fact it makes things all the more unbearable.
Keeping in the stoner-addled tradition of things in fact, one may even squeeze off a few scatological belly laughs in the otherwise depressingly low-brow, low budget affair.
It's strange too that she look like an ex prom queen when in fact she was born in, where, Tokyo?
The plot from Robert Conte and Peter Martin Wortmann(derivative of "Ruthless People") is pathetic, as in fact is most of the movie.
Now, I really don't have anything against musicals, in fact there are many musicals I love, but this crossed the line between stupid and just unbearable.
She doesn't mention to the kid driving that she knows who he is, she doesn't SMS any of her friends, and, in fact, she makes no comment regarding the fact that she's aware of the situation she's in until five minutes from the end of the movie, when she says, smugly, "I guess you know the words to this one" as she and Eliot share her headphones and listen to the group's song on her IPod.
You can find it in the documentary "Toonheads: The Lost Toons" on the Looney Tunes Golden Collection, and its status as part of Looney Tunes history is about the only thing that makes it worth watching (in fact, I wish that the documentary's narrator had poked fun at it rather than praising it).
Also you always have to be careful about flashbacks piled upon flashbacks, the way this baby kept stacking them up: another movie that revolves around a disappearance, though without a single flashback, and gets it effects a lot more successfully , L"Aventura, in fact there are certain parallels that are fairly striking, even down to the girl friend and boy friend of the gone one winding up in each others arms, though one is a masterpiece, mostly, and this one a mismash.
I am in fact puzzled how someone DARED to actually film this!
But make no mistake, encourage you to watch this movie, in fact that is a MUST.
Glen Morgan and James Wong came up with a great teleplay here - after a darkly humorous teaser, where we discover that the seemingly priggish, uptight-about-swear-words members of a PTC in New Hampshire are in fact a bunch of Satan-worshippers, the story begins as a worthy entry in the bad-things-happening-to-teenagers-in-the-woods genre which was especially popular in the first two seasons of the show.
There are definite problems with character development, as well... in fact, it hardly seems to exist, except for possibly one character.
Bond for the mindless set: no class, no elegance, no humor, a Bond who looks extremely ill at ease in a dinner jacket, violence for violence's sake, endless explosions and fights... in fact, just another car-chases-explosions-and-guns film of the kind that Hollywood cranks out by the dozen, even if this one wasn't made in Hollywood.
His damaged eye is in fact a technological wonder that allows him to see the other player's cards thanks to the mysterious blond girl, in the background, who's eye is a camera placed surgically inside her head and feeds Le Chiffre with her own vision!
At one point she refers to his "big, thick head," when in fact his head is smaller than hers!
He is in fact executive producer and clearly had nothing to do with the making of this film (Jeepers Creepers Anyone?)
Odona was a wonderful actor--and a good foil for captain Kirk even though their romance has little basis in fact.
That's not to say the movie is racist; in fact the movie is for the most part kind-hearted.
The script by Klenhard & Tom Walla is far too pedestrian for my liking, nothing significant happens for long stretches, in fact when I think about it nothing particularly significant happens during the films entire 90 plus minute duration.
It contains absolutely NO scares, and in fact goes out of its way to throw in every cheap "jump" in the book just to make it "feel" like it's a horror film.
I thought Sissy Spacek was great (but then, she usually is), almost unrecognizable in fact.
Many of the prison scenes of riots and shoot-outs are in fact left over footage from an earlier film, "The Big House".
He does not even do his own sword fight yet we know he is capable as seen in Blind Fury in fact he doesn't move much at all.
in the end, it turns out ("fight club"-style) that alex is in fact the killer, and that there was no redneck to begin with.
Although it's a well documented fact that the actress who played her, Dominique Dunne, was murdered shortly after the first film was released, I still don't think it would have trashed her memory to have explained her absence; quite the opposite in fact.
Not that anything is, in fact, easy to make out in this picture.
For me the highlight is Charlie Drake failing to deliver a cake but it's also fun to see Diana Dors sending herself up - as she used to in later life when she lost her slender shape - in fact I just cannot watch this film without getting a very broad grin on my face.
Taken out of context, in fact, Harris actually does some commendable work here.
"The Werewolf and the Yeti" is an incoherent and inept mishmash of half- elaborated ideas and generally speaking just a load of rubbish, in fact.
Robinson is German, and speaks with a German accent (in fact one of the characters says that he could not possibly be English!).
Except, other than its being a gimmick, it in fact served no purpose whatsoever in the film!
It's not giving too much away to say that the cause of the human's strange behaviour is in fact an airborne virus which infects people, then leaves the host for another when that person dies.
Score is straight out of Quake, and in fact the whole thing has that kind of video game feeling, though at least in a video game you are participating in some small way.
A lot of reviewers seem to praise Park's "unique" visual style, but it's almost never in service of the story (in fact more often the fancy moves serve to distract and remind you you're just watching a movie.
It's usually fairly clear why he uses each of these; in fact it's too clear, as every cinematic point is laboured to death, such as the over-the-top montage reflecting April's troubled mental state after she finds out what her mother does for a living.
I just finished watching invasion a few days back, i saw the show on DVD, and to tell the truth i was expecting an excellent series after reading all those positive reviews, but i was quit disappointed with it, it wasn't good at all, in fact most episodes were boring.
So boring, in fact, I left three-quarters of the way through it.
I think it's safe to say John Cusack and I would probably see eye-to-eye on politics, in fact, I'm sure we'd become drinking buddies if we ever got to talking about how great Adam Curtis' BBC docs are.
A bit more research, however, reveals some interesting information: "Dracula & Son" is in fact Christopher Lee's final performance as Count Dracula to date.
Even after Home Alone 2's sadistic effort, there are very few laughs -- in fact, many young kids will be frightened by what they see, while only the nuttiest of adults will laugh.
It's not particularly innovative or original, in fact it sticks to an age-old formula and is pretty forgettable.
propaganda is a universal tool used by Germans, Japanese, Americans, Chinese, English, in fact all government in that chapter of earth's history.
I was surprised, in fact, that upon seeing it again I really disliked the film and thought it failed on so many levels.
Walter Hill has done some GREAT movies (HARD TIMES, his first, is still his best, THE DRIVER, 48 HRS, TRESPASS is pretty thrilling too), but this is among is weak works, unfortunately NICK NOLTE, whom I love to watch, does a hammy job (on purpose, probably), the whole movie is poorly photographed (it looks like "made for TV", but in fact I have seen better photographed "made for TV"-movies !
I still remember the trailer they used to promote this movie in Europe (it's a different trailer than the one here on the IMDb, which is a weak trailer, too) and it was in fact a TERRIFIC trailer, just great, with the soldiers being introduced in scenes I never saw in the movie (you never see the soldiers sparkling in Nolte's glasses in the movie either...), so I remember having felt let down when I saw it first (nearly 20 years ago), but recently I wondered if it's time for a new viewing, when it was aired on TV here a few days ago: well, as said above my memory was unfortunately right and it still has not improved with time (never will).
Overall, this movie is not worth renting on video even, I would suggest waiting till its out there on TNT or TBS or something, in fact, it's not worth such a long review.
This movie is awful, I saw it when I was kid and it did not scare me at all, in fact it bored me.
A stupid film with a pointless title...in fact the whole movie is pointless, but there is no reason that the film should have been called X.

OK now, the woman we think is the mother is in fact the daughter, except she isn't, she's an imposter, then the father comes back, except it isn't really him, oh and there's rape, incest a hint of paedophilia, oh and there's some Nazi's who gas merkin wearing naked women, oh and one of the family escaped the Nazi's and now she's traumatised by those memories.
The son, now there's a loon, he is a psycho, if only for his dreadful dress sense, in fact everyone seems to wear bad wallpaper inspired clothes.
The Salvation films release of ÂIn the Folds of the Flesh' has a very misleading cover, showing a leather clad SS vixen who in fact makes no appearance in the film.
This film, in fact, might just be my least favorite film he did--it's a close call between this film and Persona.
Fans of BOB claim the behaviour shown in this film is in fact typical of interactions between the types of character being portrayed, and the overacting is not as severe as I am suggesting.
He's so sure he has everything figured out when in fact he doesn't know jack.
My favorite scenes include stock footage of a plane taking off (when in fact the plane should be landing), using a caged bird as a projectile, throwing a woman by her breast, and don't even get me started on the ending... Just amazingly awful.
Please understand I'm in no way a comic book purist as in fact I've never even read the comic book version, but I am just someone who really enjoyed the first Hellboy film.
Scared to Death might have been decent it if were set in a spooky old mansion but Cabanne decided on an bland ordinary looking house which hardly generates any atmosphere, in fact it doesn't generate any.
Michelle Lee, tall, slender, gorgeous and WASPish, plays Costello's wife Anne, who in reality was short, stocky, swarthy, and in fact looked more like Lou Costello than she did Michelle Lee, and Hackett doesn't connect with her, either.
The acting is terrible, the scripts/stories are terrible, the directing and producing in fact the production as a whole is terrible.
Don't bother, in fact, run the other way!
As Gwen, Sandy Dennis is pointedly droll, so low-keyed in the face of their predicaments, in fact, that it would not have been out of character had George checked for her pulse occasionally.
I soon realized that it was in fact a TV show, and I could not believe that it was possible to have a show this awful on television.
Directed by Jack Sholder one has to say that Renegades is a really lacklustre & lifeless attempt at mismatched partners teaming up together to bring down some bad guy action thriller & is in fact maybe one of the worst examples I have seen.
They play two small-town Americans who think promotion and a life in New York is Nirvana itself when in fact it is a hell that even Dante could not envisage and no-one can capture the comedy of escalating awfulness better than Simon, at least in America.
This movie may in fact give "Plan 9 from Outer Space" a run for the title of "worst movie EVER!"
Until then recognition of both friend and enemy alike was by banners etc., and was all a bit of a hit and miss affair (just like this movie in fact).
Acting is awful (especially Brian Geraghty, who is always stone like for no apparent reason), in fact, even Slater (which was a bit of a surprise) seems to struggle to play the role convincingly (it's just too over the top retarded I suppose).
Late one night by a pond Darren attacks Jayne & Will comes to her rescue & in a struggle Will stabs & kills Darren who is in fact the son of a centuries old Monk sorcerer who calls himself a sentry & who are sworn to fight & kill Vampires.
Far from it, in fact.
The editing, in fact, ruined the film for me as the black outs came at the climax.
Neither of the them succeed in making us believe that they are in fact secret agents.
I have never been compelled to write a comment about a movie before this, and in fact, the very first comment I ever saw on IMDB for this movie (at the time, it was the only comment and is now the last comment) was pretty spot on (the one where the person saw it with Finnish subtitles).
People with a low tolerance for inept cinema are likely to faint or even die from a stroke during the first half hour already and even experienced bad movie fanatics will, in fact, face severe difficulties to sit through R.O.T.O.R from start to finish.
This movie gets a 5 out of 10 not because it deserves five points, in fact, I don't think the quality is such that it deserves one point.
You can tell that the "vigilante cop" premise isn't exactly original and the monstrous touch is, in fact, the only more or less inventive aspect.
Who hasn't known women who, like Bitch, think of themselves as feminists when, in fact, they're really just bitchy?
well no sooner had milla jovovich done away with her previous zombie killing fest, another adventure lurches menacingly toward her, or so the makers of this film would have you believe, in fact this films does little to further the praise (if there was much for the original) franchise, its loud brash incredibly clichÃ©d, wise cracking black man anyone?
and loose on any meaningful plot, in fact the film makers deemed far more appropriate to deal with the flashy fight scenes and sexy protagonists than anything else.
he was never told by bodie, in fact he deliberately kept it from him.
All other characters were generic with them constantly reminding us that they were in fact evil (they would just come out and say it.
The editing in this film is in fact so bad that a friend had to explain to me what was happening while we watched it.
We get thousands of flashes back to an accident she caused and a really badly dubbed bird that not a single viewer bought into (man, this is one of the most clichÃ©d movie devices ever, in fact we get two: the blabbing, poorly dubbed bird and the "a bad thing happened to me so I'm an alcoholic" character).
in fact I thought the main characters was so bad that I only hoped they got what they deserved for wasting my time.

Only thing good about this move is that it has Donnie Yen (who was fantastic in OUATIC 2, Wing Chun and Iron Monkey [in fact all three of these I consider some of the best of the best], shows off some impressive Wing Chun skills).
I will never know what persuaded Elias Koteas to return as Casey Jones (and, in fact, as a glutton for punishment he takes on TWO roles this time around though neither of them get that much screen time) but he's a small ember of enjoyment in a rather stinky quagmire of a movie.
The films score is also perfect and mesmerizing that fits well by Fred Myrow, it was in fact one of the most powerful elements of the movie that really had me engaged.
(in fact, I had a dream where I was in Hell and I encountered a priest that had been shrunk and dissected by a demon and this was before I saw Phantasm) I know I would be pretty hysterical if The Tall Man was stalking me.
It's these points of the film that for me makes Phantasm an atmospheric and creepy horror gem, in fact it brings me back to when I was a five year old child in a video store in the 90's, traumatized by the VHS covers for Hellraiser and The Blob only to eagerly await the day I was old enough to view them.
The casting of Besser and Hillary Brooke, as the female lead, foreshadows in fact the Abbott & Costello TV show of the early fifties, as both would be regulars.
It has some great character actors in the cast who give good performances Giametti, Guzman, Garcia in fact everyone except the two main actors portraying the central couple Edward Burns and Rachel Weisz.
Unless you enjoy bad acting... and how the h*** did this get on DVD, in fact someone on benefits could of fronted this movie!

Erotic - NO Female nudity - Technically yes about 1 minute in total Sex - NO For practical purposes this was NOT based on the novel by the Marquis de Sade; in fact in the interview the writer admits he rewrote the story to accommodate Tyrone Power's daughter who could not act.
They are so clueless and out-of-tune with their surroundings, in fact, that you can easily sneak up on them and twist their necks (aren't ninjas usually supposed to be the ones DOING that, instead of having it done TO them?).
Same characters same feel nothing new, in fact I swear they used the same maps but I could be wrong.
Alex Jones deliberately ignores and lies about certain facts about all facts that just in a small way could compromise his political statements against George Bush and USA.
in fact it is.
in fact, it is a joke.
Now this piece of trash holds that title; in fact it's the only movies I've voted a "1."
It was an overly melodramatic love story coupled with what the writer probably thought was clever, original romantic, fun things, but in fact we were laughing at it-- not with it...
This is in fact one of Seagal's best movies after "Exit Wounds".
When in fact it served it's primary objective.
?.....folks, it was all downhill from there....  ....okay, so I relaxed and thought, hmmm, set in San Francisco...this oughta be fun...(well, for lack of a better word/phrase....) The movie is absolutely horrible....so horrible in fact, that I could not even turn away from it...AND I HAD THE REMOTE RIGHT THERE IN BED WITH ME!!
in fact,it's basically the same movie.and they couldn't even get the time line of events correct.maybe that was intentional due to laziness or not caring.either way,this thing is a real woofer.it doesn't even deserved to be called a movie.i viewed this as a so called second feature on the disc containing the original The Boogeyman.i thought my head would explode,and i urge you to run as far in the opposite direction of this thing,if you should be cursed with the misfortune of combing across it's path.it should come with a warning label like:Warning-may cause your i.q to drop several points if you are within it's vicinity.for me,there's no doubt this thing is a 0/10
in fact,it's your typical action/crime drama.the characters are stereotypical for this genre.i also found the movie slow and depressing.i was quite disappointed.i was expecting a much better movie than this.the action is slow,and there really isn't much originality here.Andrew Davis directed this one.he also directed The Fugitive,Under Siege and Above the Law,all after Code of Silence.but it's not all bad.for one thing Henry Silva is great as one of the main bad guys,although he doesn't get a lot of screen time.because of it's depressing atmosphere though and how slow it is i give Code of Silence a 4/10
And well there is a lot of other unbelievable details in this movie, in fact the entire movie is a huge surprise, I mean Zeus' thunderbolts are actually made of steel bars normally used for supporting concrete structures, and it is obvious if you look at them.
Koronel's acting was also the best in the film - in fact, I think it was the saving grace of the whole flick.
(for all the wrong reasons) I am in fact, at time of writing, watching Hawk the Slayer on BBC1!
This film has a laughable plot, has no comedy, and bad acting, in fact its a travesty it was ever made.
It should in fact be banned.
Almost all of 'em, in fact.
Not just expensive Hollywood actors -- in fact, no leading stars at all -- but a lot of competent supporting players, some of whom have made careers out of gracing the screen for a few moments with superb performances.
This is often a problem with a great number of movies featuring anti semitism 1933-45 in that by showing us mans inhumanity to man they often feel the need to labour the point home of the cruelty of the regime and the victims fear when in fact less would been more .
that he was in fact, not killing it, he sucked, you can't debate in a musical tone, there was no growth there.
While Lombard was funny the movie itself just wasn't, in fact I barely got through it all.
Why did Mary wed Carey as an adult when in fact she was twelve years old when it happened?
In the closing "write-over", we read that Mary lived happily ever after with the lower class guy; in fact, her family looked down on her and even rejected her because she brought down their status.
Since reading about the truth in " true stories " like PAPILLON and SLEEPERS alarm bells always ring in my head when the words " true " and " story " appear side by side , and if the story is in fact true ask yourself this question : If the events on screen actually happened then why isn`t the case better known .
Upon sticking this in my DVD drive I found that the trailer in fact appeared to show a very different movie.
Occasionally the pistols disappear in one frame and the next he is firing an Uzi, with as much enthusiasm as a stoned teenager playing "operation wolf" on an arcade.. Baldwin gets, NO-KILLS in the whole movie, in fact he is so far on the back burner it makes you wonder why he was even included in the film?..
It was, in fact, a story about a scientific team searching for a great white to study.
Dialogue is, in fact, rather scant.

Of course one day and 20,000 dead British soldiers later changed these thoughts , in fact some historians describe the date 1st of July 1916 " The day British idealism died " .
NCAA Championship won the game outright when in fact there was still time on the clock and the other team failed to score.
When i actually watched the film on DVD this week i soon realised that the decent special effects featured on the trailer were in fact the only special effects in the film.
So we took the bait and saw the movie with absolutely no preconceptions--we didn't know who was in it, what it was about--in fact, we had never heard of it before.
Very small cast, in fact I think it re-uses actors if you watch carefully.
And in fact, it is better, especially the acting.
The message in this movie is that we have become a society with zero morals (which could in fact be correct)but the sickest of all are the internet users where the only joy they will get is to watch humans suffering live on TV or the internet.
But as well all know, or at least all of us who use the internet for many reasons including and what I consider to be the most important of all and that is to seek out the truth when it comes to news the internet is in fact the last bastion of free speech, well in Europe it most definitely is.
If the rumors are true in fact and the whole cast was stricken with cancer as a result of atomic tests nearby, than The Conqueror in some respects may have been the most expensive bad film in the history of the cinema.
Hell the team and even him don't seem to be bothered with doing the production notes and b lo g on their own official site, so from that are we to take it they are re doing the whole thing to actually drill in some intelligent action with a spot of special effects and dash of story line that will blow our socks off, or should we take it that they simply have given up and are now hoping they can get away wit the slow progress of a crappiest produced film of the 21st century and I've now just read that its in fact going straight to sci-fi channel, How pathetic is that Im highly saddened by this because this was going to be the ultimate film for me to watch, I've been a highlander series fan for years and just gained the box set, so to know that they have simply destroyed and made a film worse than end game is soul destroying.
Late one night by a pond Darren attacks Jayne & Will comes to her rescue & in a struggle Will stabs & kills Darren who is in fact the son of a centuries old Monk sorcerer who calls himself a sentry & who are sworn to fight & kill Vampires.
Similarly, Mandy Moore seems to have never fully realized she was in fact on the set of a movie, as she seems firmly distant from the picture throughout, never once generating what could even be considered a facsimile of emotion.
License to Wed alternates between being patronizing, astonishingly ignorant and just plain poorly made - in fact, anything but funny or charming, as it aimed to accomplish.
His magazines are unlimited and he is impossible to hit (which is in fact stated in the movie, he is simply charmed).
She has deserved better, and in fact could be having a Helen Hunt kinda career if she hadn't been cast in films like this.
There was not a single character that made an impression, in fact to be honest I forgot most of them shortly after I saw the movie.
Some say this is an influence on "High Plains Drifter", but in fact it is yet another rip off of Leone's films and "Django".

Right around this time dork finds out that bigger dork used to be in the cult, and in fact may have killed his father!
The script, in fact, never delivers any information about Christine or anyone such that we could even intuit what she finds so spellbinding about the Phantom (after all, he is a murderous sewer ratboy!)
I ultimately decided to give this film a chance despite its awful critical reviews based upon my experience that low-brow comedies are often brutally panned when in fact they achieve precisely what they set out to achieve by providing low-brow laughs.
It won't get you all riled up, in fact you can sleep right through it.
An unmarried woman would have been bad enough, but when it s a married woman, that IS in fact an act of adultery and so is lusting after a married woman too.

What can I say, that was the longest one and a half hours of my life and its safe to say there will definitely not be a sequel and if there is, I shall set pickets outside major cinemas campaigning for a national boycott....  the dialogue was so bad, the story even worse, i cringed for the likes of Robert Carlyle and john Malkovich, this movie was far beneath them, in fact it was far beneath my 98 year old Romanian Gran who has no teeth and cant even act old....
While the animation and style of the movie aren't half bad, in fact (besides of background stuff and vegetation not exactly moving much and the characters seeming lifeless every now and then) it seems better than a lot other animated movies (except anything by Pixar or Dreamworks of course).
You would also think someone 12 and under (I'm just assuming that most teenagers wouldn't take this part too seriously) would not want to imagine that some adults with really big guns do, in fact, hunt kids for a living.
Panther, Saracen, Wolfman) and larger than life physiques must have seemed like great role models to look up to until the penny dawned and it became clear that many of them were just pumped up steroid abusers and in fact one or two even got found out and were penalized by the show's producers.
It is as though the writer came up with what he thought was a good idea, and then after writing a few pages realised that in fact he still had writer's block.
There was one moment throughout the whole movie when it evoked some emotion other then boredom and disgust, and that was when Lexi put her had through the back door and dropped the phone and contaminated ash in the house, i felt anger that she would do that to her husband who she supposedly loved (allthough i got no sense of any connection between her and her husband) i feel bad for the actors it was not there fault they got the parts, in fact i admire that they made the appalling script come to life, its not there fault it was badly written.
Rory Cochrane then repeats his "bug shower" scene from "A Scanner Darkly", but this time with a bottle of bleach, in order to cleanse himself from the toxic dust contact (in fact most of his darting paranoid looks seem to work equally well in both movies).
OK, that is not even a joke, it's a serious line not played for laughs, as earlier that character told mena he is in fact a vegetarian, and if that was meant as a joke, the direction was SO bad it certainly didn't come across that way.
I have seen the movie Knight Rider 2010 and do agree that it is not the best.in fact,it is extremely poorly produced.However-I think Tug 3 should get his facts right.James Doohan is in Knight Rider 2000,and not Knight Rider 2010.Dont' roll over my leg KITT!In any event the original is a great show which,although very eighties,still carries enough punch to make the grade.Reading about how some of the stunt work was done makes the big budget shows of today a bit naff.some of KN might seem a bit cheesy,but then again,some cheeses have a great flavour.and if super pursuit don't blow your mind just see a black pontiac close up-KITT is timeless.cue purple sunset
Because if they told the prison that they are from CDC and the prisons officers would confirm this and the CDC would say they are from CDC but they in fact are from that big pharmaceutical company, then it would mean that the CDC and the company are both involved and they wouldn't even need to lie.
Such is the brilliance of the comedy in Gergory's Girl, that one of the best sequences of comedy is, in fact, one in which a joke is established to exist but never revealed thus acting as a moment of comedy all by itself.
It failed to be scary on every level, in fact the only scary thing about this movie was the girls hairstyles and the conversations about their clothes, boys and food that was supposed to carry the film along.
There is very little, in fact none, blood or gore in the film until the last 10 minutes or so when the red stuff is splashed everywhere.
Since an atheist no more believes in the devil than god (as Hanson in fact repeatedly says), this makes not a lick of sense.
It, however, was unconnected: in fact it seemed to be unconnected even to itself, as the various segments which I managed to watch seemed haphazard at best.
Quite simply, one of the best British movies ever made, in fact one of the best movies, period.
Yes, in fact, why are these 'trying on clothes' scenes in so many teenage films?
When in fact, the effects are horrendous.
So young master Jack Ryan's mommy must say every time she packs him out the front door to go to school,little knowing her cute poppet is in fact leading a double life as a CIA Analyst as well as learning the names of the capital cities of Europe.Doubtless worried he might develop a crush on his teacher,she would be horrified to learn he is dating a doctor nearly twice his age.
This movie isn't, in fact, it goes out of it's way to hide in it's phony world from doing anything gutsy.
I really do not like this film, in fact all that there was in this film were the tattoo's.
Noted for its blending the "Nunsploitation" genre with the typical Giallo formula, these elements ought in fact to have made for a doubly enticing proposition; yet the two styles never properly jell, so that the film is too often ludicrous as opposed to gripping (much less scathing).
Unfortunately Mr. No Legs didn't count on the fact that Tina's Brother Andy (Ted Vollrath) is in fact a cop with the local department, Andy & his partner Chuck (Richard Jaeckel) set about discovering Tina's killer & that means getting close to D'Angelo's drug operations which Mr. No Legs isn't happy about & believe me you don't want to make Mr. No Legs angry as I doubt you would like him when he's angry...
The script by Jack Cowden plays the material 100% straight, is a bit on the slow side during the first 40 odd minutes & has very little of interest apart from the main title character Mr. No Legs, for most of it's duration Mr. No Legs is a standard implausible 70's cop film (in fact you could say the story doesn't have a leg to stand on, ha, ha, ha) about busting up a drug business with little to recommend it except that for some bizarre reason some absolute genius thought it would be a good idea to have a man with no legs to be the films main bad guy, he has shotguns in the arms of his wheelchair, throwing stars & retractable blades.
Visually it's all pretty ugly, and just like with the aforementioned Mr T it's hard to discern (ie care) whether or not the amateur slapdashness is in fact sick slickness.
Wow this movie was a total head scratcher.Firstly I'd like to point out the cast is a bit off.Not only in who is in it but who the star is!And after watching this and checking all the names in the credits and checking here and yes googling it.You know what I have no idea at all!But it's not Carter Wong or Lau Ka Wen aka Chia Yung Liu aka Lau Kar Wing.It's the cop in Turkey yes Turkey who's a karate expert but no names in the credit fit?Anybody see this and have clue who he is?Anyhow the director of this movie is probably the worst part of it.The action is decent in fact some fight scenes are pretty good.However the story is choppy,the acting weak and the speedup of the final fight scene didn't help at all.Although I give it 9 out of 10 for location shoots!The director was intent on spicing this one up with romance and fun in the sun.And hey watch Bolo run run run!Actually there's too much running in this movie entirely.This really could have been a good movie if not for the director I think lol.Oh and don't miss Carter Wong's extended cameo in the lead role!
But they chose to create a total fiction with no basis in fact at all.
One can find fatal flaws in virtually every area of this movie with little effortÂin fact the most difficult task in critiquing the film is remembering everything that's wrong with it.
After we have firmly established that Roy is in fact out of touch already, we get the inevitable temper tantrum that results in his expulsion from the league.
Dracula's Curse has nothing to do with Bram Stoker no matter what the film would lead you to believe, in fact it even changes Dracula to Drakulya.
Normally, I can base a movies value on the names associated with it and their previous work , in fact that's the main reason I saw this movie.
This is especially odd, since up until then he never acted crazy or hot-headed (just the opposite in fact).
I found it impossible to take this movie seriously, in fact, I laughed throughout most of it.
Another big problem with Dracula: Dead and Loving It is that it's just not very funny, in fact as to prove my point the best scene is when Harker & Van Helsing stake Lucy through the heart & are covered in gallons of blood, horror first guys, horror first...
According to Pam and Diane, they didn't use his sperm but in fact resorted to another source to get impregnated.
I can appreciate films that don't have planes crashing, shoot outs, and international espionage--in fact, films that have all of the above aren't my cup of tea.
With a lead character named Frank Stein & a dead body being brought back to life by electricity with a killer's brain inside it's not hard to tell that this is a parody of Mary Shelley's classic novel Frankenstein although to be honest this plays out more like an episode of Dawson's Creek as it focuses on various teen issues & problems, in fact there's little reason to have the Frankenstein subplot here at all.
This in no way touches on the depth of character from Louisa May Alcott's book, in fact it's so bad that when certain important events occur...don't want to give anything away here concerning the plot...one is left wondering why they should care.
It seems that the widely-reported car accident that killed his countries King was no accident but in fact a cold-blooded assassination by a terrorist group.
With nary a plot to get in the way of the killing, Madman should at least have been a mindless piece of relentlessly bloody fun, but it is, in fact, a tedious, badly directed yawn-fest that doesn't even serve up the basic ingredients expected from such a filmÂnamely, a topless babe or two, and some decent gore.
From the very opening of this movie to the very close the viewer is not drawn to have any empathy for any of the characters involved, they are all to self centered and they learn nothing through the movie, in fact their selfish ways are validated and they have no redemption, they just go on doing the same old.
I don't know if the previous comment was made by the director of this awful film but in fact it is just a B series.
In fact I am really angry because there was a very good comment here but in fact it's someone who hasn't the same taste as me, and i'm displeased that he said it's the better mini-series or film made by Sci-fi.
Imagine a fantasy movie that's set in a mediaevel European wood but was in fact shot, by an admittedly skilled cameraman, in a municipal park - there's nothing in particular to give the game away, but you can sense that most of the creative effort has gone towards hiding something.
Movies with lame story, lame script, lame everything, but top CGI, 3D, IMAX, ultra-mega-realistic screening, so the movie downloaded from the internet is, in fact, useless.
The makers of this new version do, in fact, attempt to relate their film to modern affairs.
Such skewed, presumptuous, and (on White's end especially) doubtlessly financial and egoistic aims are especially dangerous; for many viewers will take--and many have in fact taken--this film as a genuine window into the culture of the southern United States.
To begin with, there is only a fair amount of nudity but little sex in itself and none of the hardcore variety; in fact, it's rather heavier on horror content compared to the original, even going so far as to include a completely irrelevant (if reasonably eerie) marauding mummy scene!
Some of the child actors are okay, in fact, a couple have done more acting in Nickelodeon shows.
in fact, it had a reverse affect, inducing sleep.
I don't believe in wearing fur, I do believe in rescuing animals, and in fact have been in every situation that was described in this film, so it's not like I don't have any experience with the subject matter.
Ironically, this movie does not do justice to the series at all, and in fact, tarnishes its name and may be considered evil by some.
So popular, in fact, that he is able to mobilize the kids of America to go on strike until the voting age is lowered and they get a say in government (yeah, man--right on!).
I'm sure it would be hard for any descendant of this sinister couple to come to terms with what they did, much less move on and live for themselves; in fact, Ivy Meeropol has actually put her mind in REVERSE and regresses to a point of blaming everyone but the traitors.
You might also be shocked to know that Carter was never in fact much more than an average fighter who was well past his prime when arrested for murder so why this movie is making out that Rubin Carter would have been a boxing great if it wasn't for being WRONGLY convicted of murder I have no idea .
Meekly Rubin forgives his captor because that's who Rubin is - A noble forgiving paragon of humility , we're only three scenes into this movie and we're weeping tears for the guy , in fact you have to wonder why such a great guy was ever convicted of murder when he was a decorated war hero with a chest full of medals and we don't have to wait too long because it transpires that the cops are racist .
As it turns out the attacker is also ostensibly rather thick as, after being given a quick pasting, he reveals that the reason for his decidedly anti-sociable behaviour was that he had in fact resorted to a spot of DIY justice in response to the rape of a number of women down the alley in question.
The third segment, that is the only good one in this movie, is a sick and totally goofy version of Goldylocks, with the blonde girl as a crazy serial killer of young boyfriends that makes a strange alliance with the Bear family (in fact, a sort of mixture between Bonnie and Clyde and a farmer family coming out of Lil Abner) and find her true love in Baby.
Amicus Studio's death-rattle, and a homage to the 1970s glory years of its portmanteau horrors, if The Monster Club has accrued a certain cult status it's mostly down to its sheer awfulness; yet, bafflingly, The Monster Club, adapted from Chetwynd-Hayes' 1976 novel of the same name, does in fact boast a highly experienced and occasionally impressive pedigree.
Such images don't modernize the central story -- in fact they distract from it.
True to form, the resulting movie was not so good...in fact, it was downright terrible.
And if this wasn't bad enough, the film jumps, cuts, jumps ,and jumps again, in fact every few minutes there is an abrupt change of music or lines of dialogue are abruptly cut off.
The Jean Claude Van Damme original was a symbol of the masculine late 80s action flick.I enjoyed it,but times were different when I saw it.The sequel is moreorless a repeat of that film,a carbon copy in fact,with Hong in the role of Shidoshi and Han in the role of Chong Li.Even the theme of Alex being a thief stealing a sword and then becoming a fighter who earns it honestly is taken from the original movie.There's even (near the end of the film!)
in fact i tried getting high half way through this to see if that would make it funnier.
Having said that, it is still generally more sweet content than deep and complicated satire- in fact it's just like the popcorn that Daniels' character Tom Baxter first tastes- brittle, the stuff is sweet, and like Baxter says, 'gets annoying when you keep chewing on it'.
Mmmmmmmm cheese, a huge heaping pile of Canadian cheese in fact.
Parker Posey, Heather Graham, and Danny DeVito were all good in this movie;in fact, Heather Graham was better than she has ever been.
Danny wasn't even convincing as the pool salesman, in fact!
Perhaps this is in fact the funniest film ever - and the joke's on all the viewers who sit through it.
He is, in fact, revealed as the great-grandson of McQueen's character from the old TV show, but the link is barely mentioned and has absolutely no relevance to the plot of this film.
Yes, Shark Bait truly is that bad in fact it could well be looked at as a new low for animation as a whole.
i therefore deduce that the woman is in fact a terminator, sent back in time for a completely irrelevant mission....at least my explanation makes more sense then the movie!
Any way back to Alias the thing i find most frustrating are 1) Arvin Sloane's implied sense of evil, honestly for a man who is supposed to be so evil i expected gut wrenching evidence of his villainy without this evidence i find it hard to detest this man, in fact i find myself drawn to him and in most cases rooting for him to do something to cement his credibility all ending in disappointment.
I really didn't enjoy this horror movie, in fact i don't even suppose it IS a horror movie or any kind.
So amazing in fact that it very well could be the best movie of the year.
I rarely hate films; in fact the only other film I have been genuinely annoyed at having subjected myself to watching was date movie.
This is in fact the first time I've ever walked out on a movie, so that tells you something.
Script, script, script I hear the gate keepers, the producers, the film council shouting, if the foremost essential key to a successful film, but know one obviously took the time read this one and kill this abomination at birth, in fact it would seem that unbelievably know one read it before taking part in this rubbish.
So honest, in fact, that when she gets OLDER, I am going to make my 12-year-old aspiring Chef read it before she decides in fact to spend oodles of money on Culinary school.
Una Vela Para el Diablo, or the rather more poetic if pointless A Candle for the Devil as it's more commonly known amongst English speaking audiences, is set in a small Spanish village where American tourist Laura Barkley (Judy Geeson who is in fact English) is trying to locate her missing sister May (Loli Tovar) who is a photographer.
Laura tries the small guest-house where her sister was staying, it's run by two elderly sisters Marta (Aurora Bautista) & Veronica (Esperanza Roy) who claim that May left that morning but who in fact hide a terrible secret.
This IS NOT the theatrical version, it is in fact ONLY 67 minutes long!!
If "It Happened at Nightmare Inn" is only 67 minutes long, then that means that "Legacy of Blood" is close to 2 hours and 30 minutes (which in fact is not the case) Regardless, please do not waste your money or rental dollars on this version released under the title of a "Blood Soaked Cinema" release called "Back to the Grave" With the running time only being 67 minutes, then this must be the television version that played in a 90 minute time slot.
Just the opposite, in fact.
As this movie pointed out, Cosell in fact was "Monday Night Football" - without him, as was pointed out in this movie, you didn't have "Monday Night Football," you had football on Monday night.
The movie is about to take you in a journey trough an extraordinary life... Not very overwhelming, one might say... but the story of "Toto le hÃ©ros" is an unpredictable tale about a man who always thought he was nobody, and found at the very end of his life, that he was, in fact, a hero...
The point is that such perception has nothing to do with what being Catholic really means and what the Catholic Church is in fact.
It's all innocent and bland, and some of the movie, in fact, is sort of nostalgic.
Now all of the reason for PLAN 9 being named the worst movie ever made wasn't all due to the Lugosi footage, but it was one of the main factors contributing to the pure crappiness of the film.
If you said four, based on the fact that that is how they are packaged on DVD into a two-disc four-film box-set, then you would be mistaken - there were in fact FIVE films to this series, this last one coming fourteen years after the last effort, "The Great St. Trinian's Train Robbery".
Marvin begins to organise an investigation into the killing & drags his sister into it but they soon find out that what killed Des wasn't human, it was in fact one of the giant mutant cockroaches from the previous films & it's up to him to stop them...
I am, in fact, writing this review as the movie plays and sends otherwise happy guests running for the door to their "next party.")
Nobody gets the girl (in fact, they never show her saying goodbye to the hero).
Okay, according to the writers, Nero is now about 16 when his great uncle Claudius becomes emperor (in fact he was about to turn 4); Agrippina engineers the downfall of the empress Messalina and marries Claudius, who adopts Nero.
He lived until 54 A.D. Nero should have been 31 years old by then by any normal chronology, but in fact succeeded to the throne at age 16.
Maybe the scene or the actors could save it, but, in fact, it reduced all the crew to a poor B-movie.
They all get together working in a restaurant and there is a lot of awkward moments, in fact the whole show is more soap opera with a load laugh track added to make you think it's funny, but it's just one awkward moment after another with a mentally ill woman thrown in for the gut buster (not!).
The gore is there naturally (in fact the title probably refers to HGL rather than the illusionist), but most of it could be created in your own kitchen.
Im not a blind Michael Moore fan by any stretch, in fact I think "The Big One" is probably one of the worst films of all time, and I think that he is an annoying blowhard.
Point in fact though the ending isn't horrible it just leaves a little to be desired.
i found this movie disappointing.to me,the story had very little depth,and the villain for Supergirl is pretty weak.there is too much mysticism for this type of movie,for my tastes.plus there are some scenes which just feel like filler.the movie is very slow at times,in fact it can be downright boring.
signs above each of them and dubbing which, whilst OK in the main, only serves to remind you that it is, in fact, dubbing and you have the recipe for an 80's movie disaster.
wasn't expecting a massive amount from this movie tbh - in fact i only got it coz i have been reverting back to my childhood days lately and have fancied a bit of horror again (i grew up on horror) and the added mushroom factor only poured fuel on the the fire - horror/scary things in general is last thing u want when ur high on that shat... anyway, turned off lights and got settled, trying to give it a chance..
If you do, and can understand them, then maybe we'll go sometime and I can learn to understand and enjoy, in fact I am always looking to broaden my horizons, in fact just ever get a chance to watch Dexter on show-time, now that will make you think.
None of the characters were convincing or engaging, in fact I prayed for their deaths after about 15 minutes.
I am quite certain also that the good money thrown after bad towards salaries, production and marketing on this one, could have funded 5 superior new hopefuls with the aim of in fact igniting a revival in the 'Industry' and saving the rest of us from the embarrassing drivel we got.
Part of the greatness of this movie is demonstrated in the way this scene is shot: it looks a bit like Cinema Verite, but it is in fact largely scripted film-making(with a bit of improv).
Javier Bardem (David) played the role of ex-agent and ex-basketball player who was shot in fact accidentally.
It's a far better, more enduring film, in fact, than some of the documentary "classics" (GREY GARDENS, for example) that were made in the same era.
Lucky Break in 2 words would be utter rubbish, it was not funny, in fact it had about 1 jocks worth of laughter and it was just pretty boring.
I'll be the first to admit that I'm no expert on the Robotech series - in fact, I know pretty much next to nothing about the other instalments in the Macross/Robotech series.
So much of it, in fact, that you will begin to understand where the expression "so bad that it is awesome" comes from.
Something exceptional is presented by way of action sequences, in fact, where attempts at re-enacting simple events on film often fail; namely, the interdiction of a convoy carrying prisoners and a particularly realistic execution scene.
The twist that he's in fact the Bounty Hunter might not come as a big shock, making the pretty cool car trunk shot less effective, but it's not blatant.
We learn most of the story through the testimony of a victim--Elizabeth, and a primary suspect, Martyn Taylor (Daniel Brocklebank), who may in fact be a friend of Elizabeth's.
Well, in fact, the whole film is not important - just skip it altogether and watch something else.
I didn't think the movie would be so good from the beginning, in fact to be honest, there's quite a poor start to it, and I suspect many would switch off before it gets going.
Some of it isn't very plausible, in fact the entire idea of the heroine suddenly becoming Grizzly Adams and fighting off wolves with her bare hands, creating a stretcher out of thin air, cauterizing a wound with a red hot knife, and keeping her beauty and sense of humor through it all, is actually pretty ridiculous if you think about it, but it doesn't matter that much: this is a disaster movie of sorts, so don't think about it.
They don't wave; they barely look; in fact, they don't even recognise me.
Her only film at MGM also came that year, but it wasn't with Gable; it was a gangster comedy called "The Gay Bride," sort of a thirties "Married To The Mob" (in fact, that phrase is actually used in the film).
Mattelli isn't the only racist cop, and in fact he's a hypocrite racist who is taking money from a black mafia kingpin!!!!!
Dialogue - well, it's realistic, but that doesn't make good dialog; in fact, it's dull.
The role was chosen for him so he could have lots of opportunities to go bare-chested and show that in fact he's got hair on his chest.
The Ritz Brothers get to do their thing in making total jerks of themselves and making you wonder if Uncle Stevens, who was crazy enough to hire them, was in fact in on his own kidnapping in order to get away Scot-free with all the money he stole while everyone else, including the local police and SEC, was sent on a wild goose chase.
There is, in fact a "real" gorilla on the loose (played by Art Miles - the makeup, while not great, wasn't as bad as some that I've seen), who can't be the murderer (because first, gorillas can't write notes and, second, he hasn't been on the loose long enough to have committed the murders) but still he provides plenty of comic relief in his scenes with the Ritz Brothers.
Before you descend to the low level of this disaster, I'd recommend "The Three Musketeers" or "Straight, Place and Show," which is in the rotation at TCM (in fact I'm watching it right now, having just suffered through "The Gorilla"), and which features a wonderful acting and singing performance from Ethel Merman.
Poverty, segregation, racism, drugs, guns and violence, the absence of schools, hospitals, formal employment or government assistance, the dire conditions of life in the favelas that affect over one million people in Rio are, in fact, the cause of most of Acerola and Laranjinha's "personal" problems.
There was no disrespect, in fact quite the opposite.
So hard in fact that diarrhea shot out of my butt and onto the guy sitting next to me.
Bird of Paradise surely ranks as one of King Vidor's worst efforts---in fact it's hard to believe that the man who created The Crowd and The Big Parade could be involved with something as shoddy as this.
I've been a fan of the novel for quite a long time, in fact one of the publishing agents came to give a lecture when I was in college on the nature of getting your work published and kept citing the due to be released novel as an example and even then the premise he described sounded amazing.
I'll admit that after reading some early remarks about Robert Schwentke's cinematic version I was very worried, in fact so much so that my expectations were somewhat low.
While there were only two that were particularly negative(and I won't claim that they're in the wrong... in fact, they bring up good points), I found my expectations lowering... and not being much of a fan of documentaries, and having little interest in history, they weren't high to start with.
I'm no fan of Hugh Grant, in fact I hate the man, but he's exactly the right casting choice for this movie and it's almost a shame that he went on to make lots of rubbish movies after it.
And it all flows together, and of course needs to conjoin this way because in fact the three stories are all the same large tale built around the legendary, difficult director/producer played by Douglas.
Douglas' Jonathan Shields is brilliant and ruthless, in fact, so brilliant that it's difficult to see how he came to be in such poor circumstances at the opening of the film.
It was in fact communist guerrillas who said they would murder anyone found with voting stamp dye on their hands during the El Salvador elections portrayed in the movie.
It is in fact very depressing, but shows the cruel and unusual ways of the San Salvadorian government in the 1970's.
The film has the feel of two different editors and in fact that is what happened.
Even though I know that the Care Bears are not real... and in fact are animated- I still view them as real beings and follow their actions by caring.
I decided to see it after hearing pretty much nothing but praise for the film(in fact, the only negative comments I've ever heard about it is that it deviates too much from the original novel... which is something Kubrick was famous for) and because I immensely enjoyed The Shining and Kubrick's directorial style as seen in it.
I haven't seen anything quite like it for a while... in fact, maybe I never have.
Richard Ruccolo is one of main factor to make this movie funny.
The film gets some details wrong - when Nagumo gets word that the first wave has sunk numerous US ships, he orders the launching of the second wave; in fact the second wave took off an hour before the first wave made contact with their targets.
He became known as the Werewolf Of Allariz because his defense against these charges was that he could not control his animal urges since he was in fact a werewolf.
But having analysed the narrative structure and I came to the conclusion that in fact the beginning of the film is the vital part of the film which makes up the middle and the end of the film.
By using amateur actors it masquerades as naturalistic, but it is in fact as artificial as a piece of modern conceptual art.
Some of the one-liners were funny - laugh out loud funny, in fact.
Romasanta comes clean before a court, that he is in fact a wolf who takes the guise of a man to seduce his victims, is he a wolf or just a psychotic killer?
in fact i even named my rabbit after babar!
His defense was that he was in fact, a werewolf and had no control over himself once he transformed.
Murders are fairly few in this one and not gory, the film does however include an absolute rip-snorter of a strangulation sequence, one of the best examples of such slaying I've ever seen in fact.
On the box this movie claims to be better than or comparable to tiles such as A Nightmare on Elm Street and Phantasm when in fact it is a terrible piece of garbage.
Nobody, in fact, is completely an object of ridicule.
Delicatessen is set in a weird, post-apocalyptic, alternate universe that is not entirely dissimilar to the setting of Terry Gilliam's Brazil (1985)--in fact, this could very easily be the same world as Brazil, just that that film is situated in its titular locale, and this would be a less fashionable section of France.
Which ways the story is in fact not really interesting.
It never takes itself too seriously with references to the Mary Celeste coming to mind & the bizarre notion that the Atlanteans are in fact Martians.
Like the previous Connor films the monsters aren't exactly the pinnacle of realism, in fact most people would probably describe them as poor but I'd rather have the charm & personality of a man in a rubber monster suit than a cold lifeless fake looking computer graphic any day of the week.
But in fact, the action from the first sequence was not only as thrilling as the rest that followed, but it was also far superior to the anti-climactic final showdown.
The situations are in fact quite funny, even hilarious.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not against violence in movies and in fact actively seek out the most notorious films around; but while this may be violent, it's also pointless and boring and I didn't get one ounce of enjoyment out of it.
They quickly discover that the local population are in fact Vampire like zombies lead by Drake (Billy Drago)...
The so-called climax of the movie was in fact the most anti-climactic part of the movie.
At one point "Rock" says, "some poor woman is missing her makeup kit" and it led me to wonder if the "poor woman" was in fact the film's makeup director.
Lisa Gastoni (at 43) is still a sensual and attractive woman and has her hair dyed reddish blonde here, but this proved to be the last of several roles in a similar mode Â to which I alluded above and of which I wouldn't mind catching Jerzy Kawalerowicz's MADDALENA (1971) and Giulio Petroni's LABBRE DI LURIDO BLU (1975); in fact, she went into a long period of retirement right after this one before re-emerging two years ago.
It is certainly not a new story, in fact there is nothing remotely novel about the way it is told, and we have all seen this before, and, indeed, much more eloquently by Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry.
But it is in fact, a docudrama based on the worrisome events of the Quebec crisis of 1970.
Yet, if you look beyond its vicious reputation and the nasty sounding title, you'll discover than it's in fact a lot more than just another sleazy Italian horror film.
And it is not confined to rainforests, but in fact can be and is used in modern cities - ha ha and not just to save tribes but sometimes God willing to get girlfriends!
This is, in fact, the live proof that a witty, well-written series can actually be successful in our country, and I hope it will still run for a few more years to come.
Nick Cassavetes is great as the villain - in fact, he's so evil that I named a character in one of my stories after his character of Packard Walsh just as a reference to show how evil my character is.
Dead Life IS in fact shot on 8mm, and it looks grainy and low quality and you know what?
Paul is, in fact, smart and resourceful.
It has been at least fifteen years since I saw a movie so bad that I nearly walked out on it (I did, in fact, walk out on 'Short Circuit 2').
She is, in fact, as comical in her own way as Poirot is meant to be.
It was in fact Pops Racer who drove his first son Rex Racer to the brink of destruction with his strategy of how to best use the technology he developed.
From budget limitations resulting in running gags -the closed shutters "explaining" the darkness on the store setting where in fact they could only shoot at night- to a series of funny customers episodes and even, well "romantic" story lines, the movie is based on a great script and works through the acting skills of its cast, especially Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson.
in fact, almost as much was spent on the three minute Soul Asylum video then was spent on Clerks.
First half of the film is in fact nearly excellent (something like a very good Millennium episode, only - series in question never got that good).
); however, this alone does not make them worthwhile (let alone good) and, in fact, both these films are relentlessly sabotaged by inept handling and matching wooden performances Â I mean, one has to wonder just what went on during the production of such effortsÂwhere, invariably, a writer-director's 'uncompromising' vision was constantly shortchanged by the individual's apparent lack of talent in putting his own ideas to fruition!
For once, and thankfully so, the title does not promise something it cannot deliver: Calderoni, in fact, is nude Â whether for Satan or the audience's ultimate benefit is another matter entirely!
This movie has a resemblance to the typical American romantic comedies, being in fact an English movie.
The capturing of Lennons early years was a masterpiece, in fact the actor should have gotten some kind of award, that is how Lennon was, a very talented rebel, who helped change the world, and would perhaps have made it a lot better place if that lunatic had not killed him.
I found that after seeing LD in several movies, she is great in factual stories, like October Sky.
Mental illness isn't funny; in fact it is extremely scary.
There are theories in both spiritual and scientific circles that postulate that whenever we make a decision like this we in fact make them both.
Or is the ferry simply a way to experience the same space over and over again - a "sameness" - that is in fact "different" every time (every time he rides the ferry there are new people, and he sits in a different place, etc.
The plot does not sound enticing, in fact, it sounds rather plain, however, this is not case fortunately.
And in fact, the way she enters the screen dressed all too flamboyantly like a hooker is a penchant, as much as it is too cheesy for an audience that doesn't understand that at that time, that was the Hollywood idea of a real woman.
He is, in fact, the personification of the ordinary man seeing the Hollywood star Joan Crawford in the real world.
The film, when you look at it closely, is, in fact, quite good.
Little did we know that it in fact, actually did (believe it, or not) SUCK!
You may not figure it all out, in fact I'm  sure that you won't figure it all out.
So much in fact that Hispanic street gangs of today became that way by imitating the lifestyle in the movie.
Marc soon accuses AgnÃ¨s of plotting against him, but AgnÃ¨s is deeply persuaded that Marc has in fact never had a moustache.
Interestingly enough, Peppard and Vincent happen to be the two guys who turned the keys and launched the American retaliatory strike, which we see in the opening minutes (loads of stock footage, as is nearly all of the special effects work) Â but this is never mentioned again and in fact the film completely ignores politics and any kind of moral questioning for a PG, Disneyish adventure mode.
Traitor is a truly audacious movie which goes more far away from the easy complaints of patriotism and human rights which other movies make, showing us that in fact, the world works on a grey scale, and not on the simplistic "black and white" the politicians want to make us believe.
I was expecting some flashy fast paced spy movie but it turned out different from what I expected in that, it has some good drama to go with the action in fact the film has more drama than action.
The fact is I couldn't care one way or the other if the characters are unlikeable, in fact I'd prefer that they weren't.
While the notion of an Internet investigations division of the FBI sounds appealing (isn't the Secret Service in fact charged with this responsibility?
The sophomoric romantic storyline of Bakula and Going, the uber Bill Gates villain played by Judge Reinhold, and the Kris Kristofferson (Can you believe he was in fact a Rhodes Scholar and former Army pilot??)
The animation, while it looks good overall, is actually horrible upon close inspectionÂso horrible, in fact, that it's absolutely hilarious.
The film is quiet, dialogue driven, but that's not to say it's brilliant...in fact, it is very slow, and today's audiences would flick channels in no time.
It was Col.Holloway, a US intelligence officer, who in fact stole the valuable Venacci Jewelry collection while he was serving with the US Army in Germany back in 1945!
This in fact took away Hammer's both bad guy and anything to get results image and made you for once like him.
Although the riddle is not difficult to solve...in fact you may very quickly...the joy is in the getting there.
We travel through 400 years of history and music, to end up in what you might think is the end of the story of the Â«red violinÂ» but in fact, takes you to the next chapter.
Can movies in fact be nourishing?
but in the sixties the percentage of idiots was at a more extreme level(due to the counter culture) and i just think that to observe, and in fact be a part of such historical stupidity would just be the time of my life.
in fact so lame even as a dance pic it tanked completely and struggled to find even a morning session in week three.
Dennis O'Keefe is a wonderful lead as the sleuth figure; in fact, the film is actually more of a thriller since the murders do not have a basis in the supernatural (as was the case with the previous two Lewton/Tourneur collaborations).
William Friedkin's Audio Commentary is a good listen, despite his tendency to describe the on-screen action (though almost always accentuated by his own interpretation of events); this was his favorite among the Lewton horrors - and, in fact, it's very much underrated among fans but, personally, I loved it immediately!
In the DVD Val Lewton Collection , Citizen Kane is mentioned frequently, both for its artistry and for its financial disappointment; (though I have read that in fact it turned a small profit.)
When he doesn't show, she loses track of time and improvidently finds herself locked in among the gravestones and statuary....   A posse sets out to find and kill the leopard, but O'Keefe begins to doubt whether the killer is in fact feline.
The virus is in fact a metaphor for greed, as it arrives at the same time as a development corporation is evicting lower income Bronx tenants via "emiment domain."
This is, in fact, the show that I hoped "Fat Actress" and "The Comeback" might be and deserves equal footing with "Entourage."
There were in fact moments of this film that I got really into and I would say outdid some of the other zombie films.
Then I realized it, in fact, was a comedy/drama.
It made my jaw drop and, in fact, I sat in front of the TV for a number of minutes before I regained my senses.
Still this is bound to entertain kids, and for once the kid actors don't grate at all, in fact its some of the adult members that I found much more annoying.
The storyline in fact works perfectly fine until after the kids decide to do something.
Or, in fact, ANY 'genre' movie.
What follows from here is a story that isn't entirely unfamiliar (in fact, it's dangerously close to this year's WALL-E), and yet director Gil Kenan manages to take the script and turn it into his own compelling take on a tried and trusted concept.
Mr. Yee was portraited as a cold-blooded person and he, in fact, is a true human with love.
They were in fact supposed to end the film with a live concert, but this turned into the rooftop performance (which is a great bit of final energy).
What they show in the film of arguments and sulking is what happens in ANY band, and in fact is usually much worse - I was almost surprised there wasn't more of the taped back-and-forth exchanged in the film, given what's been said how bad it got amongst the fab four during their final year in recording, particularly on Let it Be aka Get Back (the most chilling thing overall is the presence Yoko, who keeps popping up looking like she could duke it out with Bergman's Seventh Seal Death dude and probably win).
I see alot of indy movies (in fact, that's about all I see nowadays.)
Anyway, I believe - if I'm not mistaken - that the Angel's duty was to in fact 'save' him in the end.
Paul Draper who was the dancer/comedian in the cast was in fact blacklisted shortly after this came out.
I was, in fact, quite strongly reminded of Darren Aronofsky's 2000 film-adaptation of Hubert Selby's novel "Requiem for a Dream" Â although the subject matter differs greatly, both films derive their horror elements most strongly from a place that is completely removed from Horror Â and in both examples the source is basically Love.
True maybe some of the gore is excessive but the final transformation of Brundlefly is very impressive .Jaw dropping in fact .
Though no one in the film really seems Greek--more American and British, in fact--it doesn't really matter where the film takes place or what culture it's in.
There is some cheese and then there's some ham (in fact there is no shortage of ham in this film) and then there's some chicken when certain persons lose their courage and then there's some lettuce to brighten and pretty things up a bit, and then there's the daily bread, it's all there.
Watching the movie was very reminiscent to reading The Chronicles of Narnia, or in fact reading a British translation of Astrid Lindgren's book.
It's sad to see a film like this get rated higher than a 3.1, for the only truth; If the Male leads character depicted in the movie was in fact was brought before the public in a real life scenario, we'd gather our pitch forks, and throw him to the jury yelling the sweet sounds of life imprisonment.
Thus, you should realize at the end that Han-Ki was, in fact, trolling for talent at the beginning of the film.
I won't profess to be articulate writing comments about movies (in fact this is my first one on this site), but I found this film wholly unsatisfying and disappointing to watch.
Wife and Husband- This is in fact the fantastic part of the movie, the silentness of the wife is the main tool for getting you into that sweet vacillation of whether things are real or not, but there are lot more, as the costumes she wears every time (Which reminds me to a movie knows as "hÃ©roe" by this latitudes) and the phase-shifts.
he's not a bad father by any chance, in fact he loves her daughter more than anything in the world, but he just dosen't know how to express his love for her properly so he becomes a bit distant from him This leads to Amelie having to retreat into her imagination to find people to talk to since her dad won't.
`Amelie' is the first film where I adored the subtitles and in fact, had a nagging urge to go out and learn French that is still with me today.
There is, in fact, one laugh in the entire movie.
We get to see and experience the world and especially Paris through the filtering eyes and fantasy of Amelie, A Paris that might feel small and limited on the screen but in fact is just as big as it is in the eyes of Amelie.
It's so easy, in fact, it's like shooting fish in a barrel--hence the movie's name.
Pressured by her upper class family to marry, Madeleine is in fact secretly intimately involved with a man from a lower class, L'Anglier (Desny) and has agreed to marry him.
It's in fact closer to the way action pictures are made today -- I would question whether the critics and fans who see this as a "parody" also think that Schwartzenegger's "Commando" and "The Running Man" are also parodies?
There are a couple of scenes, in fact, that are downright hilarious.
Franco also has some interesting things to say in the commentary on the Severin Films version, relating the dead monks in the film to his view of the Spanish Catholic church -- an insightful view, in fact, reflecting popular attitudes in Spanish Catholicism that define monks and priests as theoretically saintly figures that are also motivated by the needs and failings that drive ordinary men.
Carlos believes that if Candy is in fact Irina, her kiss to him can set their souls free, no longer to serve their dark lord.
Though it's largely irrelevant I confess to being a little bemused by the large number of posters who think that Leslie Howard was English when he was in fact Hungarian.
(the description of the mood of the movie may be considered as a spoiler - because there is not much action in fact)  Great one...  Is it for my peculiar interest for the dystopias and utopias?
Although there are a few signs that are similar, just like we say "NO" and in Spanish the word for our no is in fact, "NO".
It claims that Osama Bin Laden is not wearing rings where in fact numerous photos show Bin Laden wearing rings.
Decoys was a very weird film, in fact my first impression, before I read the back, was that it had something to do with monsters or aliens roaming a snow covered forest, kind of like a Windego themed movie, but I was wrong.
Decoys is set on St. John's College campus in New Brunswick in Canada where Luke (Corey Sevier) & his roommate Roger (Elias Toufexis) are two students just trying to have a good time, while trying to return some loose change to blonde babes Lilly (Stefanie von Pfetten) & her roommate Constance (Kim Poirier) Luke witnesses something strange & terrifying, the two female roommates are in fact aliens.
But Luke discovers that they are in fact aliens who have arrived in order to breed so that they can save their race from extinction.
**SPOILERS** Coming over to the Frame home in rural USA to be taken in as a member of the family young Emil Buckner, Skip Homeier, is anything but your typical American boy in fact he was brought up in Nazi Germany and brainwashed to grow up and become a future Aryan Superman in the Hitler Youth.
Gambling is legal in many countries, in fact betting (bookie) shops were legalized in the UK in 1961 !
And, one would also think that those who gamble and do not win as often as they would like would get the message that things are really not going to get better, and in fact they can get a lot worse.
