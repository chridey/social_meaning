Meryl Streep in particular, playing convincingly an actress without talent.
Lastly, two scenes I liked in particular: 1) Lothaire Bluteau forlornly taking a crap off the side of a canoe (very tough to do) and 2) the comparison of the spires of trees and the spires of church columns.
Blackadder and in particular "Blackadder goes Forth" is my all time favourite comedy series.
One scene in particular is actually quite disturbing, with Sister Maria covering her naked, bloody body with her uniform.
Despite these deviations from established psychological writings, Marie's behaviour does in part correspond to some of Freud's theories as set out in "Mourning and Melancholia", in particular when he describes mourning as the process of "reality-testing"6.
The gang, know as the Iron Boat Clan and in particular the men he raided with the 13 Eagles.
Let's face it, people as a rule (and young people in particular) are basic under-achievers.
Frederic Forrest in particular does a great job giving the audience the sense of a regular guy who thinks that something exotic is what he really needs.
In their defense, they make some elements of the plot clearer - the anniversary gifts in particular.
There is one scene in particular where a young woman is interviewing for a job as a maid and she envisions her prospective employer, who is obese and wolfing a plate of pasta)as a hideous looking Pekingnese dog.
The villains, Buffalo Bill Jr. ( aka Butch Galt ) and LeRoy Mason in particular, were both very fine actors and come across quite well in their roles.
The main characters are unexpectedly engaging (Sam in particular is simply awesome, thanks mainly to Brown's winningly sparky portrayal of her), the acting overall acceptable, and the story unfolds at a constant steady pace.
Do note the top-notch voice acting, making everyone come off as champions of their respective roles, in particular the sinister enemy bosses.
Fans of Brian DePalma in particular and horror films in general will very much like The Fury.
With "Sidewalks of New York" Edward Burns pays tribute to this fair city, and he pays homage to Mr. Allen -- 1992's "Husbands and Wives" in particular.
So I don't have to buy into Jakes' vision of the world and black women in particular.
Sometimes they don't get the credit they deserve because we love to hate them, but without them, you can't pull as hard for the good guys as you would, and Johnny Harris in particular pulls off the sleazy, evil, slightly thick Derek with remarkable effectiveness, wearing the characters immorality on his shirtsleeve and fairly stinking up the joint in the best possible way.
I was such a sucker for private eye novels and TV shows, and I loved how Stephen J. Cannell played with that genre's conventions on this show in particular.
Aandhi is a story about Policiticans-one in particularÂMiss Aaarti Devi (Suchitra Sen), a very strong and appointed lady.
Grant and Irene Dunne have been married for awhile (we later learn in court that they met when both fell in love with a puppy in a pet shop), but both jump to the conclusion that the other has been having extra-marital affairs (Grant, in particular, is funny growing disgusted and angrier at Dunne's fairly blameless voice teacher Alex D'Arcy).
For my money, the 70's produced the best shows, detective/cop series in particular: Starsky and Hutch, Baretta, Kojak, S.W.A.T.
roles in FEELING SEXY and (in particular) THE MONKEY'S MASK.
seemed like random things happening with no explanation or leading up to any event in particular.
Here we have the real deal and the action in this blows anything that Tarantino has done, in particular the House of Blue Leaves sequence in Kill Bill, off the map.
The cast of SS is back (excepting Ng), and the goalkeeper of that movie in particular has a roaring time here as the leader of Axe Gang.
I get a feeling that he is somewhat superstitious in his way of looking at the world and this environment in particular.
As a Brit, I find it tiring, even insulting, to see and hear notions of the UK, England in particular, reduced to the level of Dick van Dyke's pseudo-cockney, with the action running in upper-class environments that may have flourished before P G Wodehouse moved to the USA in the 1920s or in Agatha Christie's 1930s heyday, but which had virtually disappeared by the 1950s, not to mention the 1970s.
There are several great nods to the original, in particular one where Jesse finds Nancy Thompson's diary and reads bits from it about Freddy Kruger.
), and during one scene in particular, the entire crowd actually cheered.
Both Iben Hjejle (her in particular) and Anders Berthelsen give very convincing performances and very much carry the film.
On so many shows, you have this token alcoholic character (soap operas in particular) who goes on a drinking binge in one episode and recovers in the next.
Taylor in particular has an effective blend of tenderness with a touch of crazed obsession about him.
This was appropriate and in particular there was one duel with some amusing banter that was a highlight of the action.
I've always been a Burt Reynolds fan, but Dom Deluise and Dean Martin in particular are hilarious.
Re transportation in particular, he aced that section because his aunt--who lived with them--worked for the government train administration bureau or what-have-you.
VV Chopra takes on the director's baton after 7 years and unleashes a treat for your senses... your visual senses in particular.
The second half in particular is slow paced.
But THE OMEGA MAN has its moments, in particular its unexpected, and unexpectedly touching, finale.
The character's are awful, the dialogue is awful, the comedy relief is awful & all the character motivations are awful like continually splitting up & wondering off down corridors on their own, not making enough of an effort to escape, standing around talking doing nothing in particular & this whole film is just bad.
In Flynn's early career he did do films like GREEN LIGHT, FOUR'S A CROWD, and THE SISTERS with mediocre results (the comedy FOUR'S A CROWD is the best of this bunch), but Warner knew how the public liked certain actors as dramatic players and certain ones in particular grooves.
For those of you who haven't (and you're missing out) than you will see an excellent story with a higher budget than the original movies and fine acting by the entire cast, in particular Sean Bean, Daragh O'Malley, Michael Cochrane and Toby Stephens.
Following hot on the scorching asphalt skid-marks of the impish "The Gumball Rally," Paul Bartel's characteristically deadpan, quirky, slyly subversive cross country road race car picture presents a blithely apocalyptic vision that's akin to the anarchic world views shown in the equally madcap "Freebie and the Bean," the truly twisted "The Mad Bomber," and the totally gaga "The Candy Snatchers": All those noisy, tire-yelping, rubber-shredding, metal-bending automobile mishaps featured herein play a crucial role in Bartel's merrily askew and jaundiced presentation of a world in constant uproar, where any sense of balance, tranquility and equilibrium gets messily disrupted on a frequent nerve-frying basis (a savage gas station fisticuffs scuffle and the wildly chaotic mondo destructo Jersey Turnpike massive car pile-up sequence in particular really hammer this point home).
Andress has only 2 dimension to her character (as written, not her fault in particular), but at least one of them is her breasts.
Now for this movie in particular.
One can trace the origins of flamenco and, in particular, its links with traditional Arabic music.
This earned 'Riso Amaro' a lot of publicity, in particular in strongly Roman Catholic Italy.
The beliefs of an overwhelming percentage of the world's population, in particular religious institutions who are of the view we are the sole occupants of this enormous universe, would be instantly proved wrong.
Some who have criticised the movie, in particular students from Melbourne, might be better advised to ask their teachers to try movies such as High School High, Down Periscope or Date Movie to better evaluate how a movie should not be made.
Man, does this extremely cheap and crummy clunker strike out something rotten in every conceivable department: Sisworo Guatama Putra's flat, fumbling (mis)direction, the poky pace, Imam Tantowi's by-the-numbers hackneyed and predictable cookie cutter script, the slipshod editing, the bland acting, Lee Fioole's sub-par cinematography, the dreadful dubbing, precious little nudity, several poorly staged action scenes (in one especially unimpressive scene a native feebly wrestles with a python), the mild gore, Gatot Sudarto's mostly insipid, only sporadically lively score, a pitifully dumb and nonexplicit attempted rape that's followed by an equally lousy off-screen castration, and the colorless, unappealing main characters (Rita in particular is insufferably whiny) all leave a great deal to be desired.
The characters, the robot in particular, are profoundly likable (ok, with a few exceptions ;) and I won't mention how or why, but it had truly beautiful moments, both small and big.
The characters along the way are well acted - in particular the robot creator and his ditsy assistant.
Providence, Rhode Island, and in particular its neighbourhood of the title, serves as but one among many interesting personalities in this well-wrought feature film debut of its director/scriptor Michael Corrente.
The sound, in particular, is problematic -as it was terrible to begin with.
Both Karloff and Lugosi were old enough to have vivid memories of the first world war, and Lugosi in particular shows a dramatic range that would surprise most 1931 "Dracula" fans.
And there are some aspects of the production that are distinctly unpromising - in particular the fact that the director created the film purely as a vehicle to allow (girlfriend?)
Not to mention the fact that I was quite a horror fan, in particular a zombie fan who was very familiar with the original Romero film.
O'Toole, in particular, thought it was a comedown to be directed by aging old-schooler Anatole Litvak, though Litvak does keep the Euro flavor consistent in this.
But there is something about this movie in particular which makes you feel absolute JOY when watching it.
This is mainly because the characters, and in particular the German soldiers, are more than just the kind of cardboard cliches one expects from this type of low-budget movie.
Here, thankfully, the film is blessed with a decent mystery, different sets than most of the others, and several good supporting performances, in particular by the always wonderful, and sadly not well known John Davidson.
Didn't you notice that the cab driver's name is Peter (as in SAINT PETER) and she for no apparent reason starts telling him all her sins on this ride to no where in particular?
Well worth watching, and whether you like it or not you do have to give credit where credit is due to the cinematography and acting in particular.
The performances of Jane Seymour and Dennis Lawson were fantastic in particular, cameos from Pippa Heywood and Camille Coduri were of course welcomed.
This movie in particular exemplifies this completely.
Charlie Brown has been becoming ever more resentful of Snoopy's recent independence (in particular going to the beach to spend time with Peppermint Patty), and, after cutting his thumb while trying to open his can of dog-food, he gives Snoopy a scolding and makes him feel guilty and worthless.
I first saw this film as a boy in my early tens, and even when I watch it now it has lost none of its ability to endear and -- in particular -- choke.
Jones in particular, in his very first substantial film role, ignites the screen as a weary, cynical, born criminal (I have to like his line "I was born dead").
The obvious uses are the digitally filmed closeup shots in low-light of skin in Roman church art masterpieces leading up to the parallel shots of skin when the actors touch ... but note in particular the clenched hand on the sheet at the end of that scene, to be followed later by a montage of clenched hands on ancient statuary (interspersed with an angel) and the almost penultimate shot of a hand at the denouement ....
A fairly humdrum retelling of the Chicago gangster wars of the 20s & 30s and in particular Elliot Ness' long term battle bringing top gangster Al Capone to book on a range of charges from murder, prohibition & bootlegging to his eventual downfall of simple tax evasion.
And this obsession seems to 'infect' his actors... De Niro in particular, who really 'hams' up Scarface Capone.
The acting is great all around, with Costner and Connery in particular giving one of their best performances.
I would like to mention two women in particular.
The writer also seems to have felt the need to invent more than one scene completely out of nowhere; one huge scene in particular  between Cassandra and her father is not only NOT in the book, but it contradicts everything the book stands for-- and in such a maudlin, obvious, movie-of-the- week type of way.
One uncle in particular was a career Navy man and so we knew nautical terminology and such.
One thing in particular that has always stuck with me after viewing this was when SPOILER: Alan Ladd's character finally starts to shoot the Japanese soldiers.
He states that homosexual behavior, or more in particular, "unwanted same sex attraction" has been and can be "overcome" via learning developmental models for homosexuality, and deciding to cure the multifaceted and completely fabricated developmental issues.
The point that this film is trying to make is that many people, Christians in particular, are ignorant about the facts of homosexuality and hide behind a few, outdated lines of the Bible and declare it an "abomination."
She is brilliant throughout but one scene in particular made the hair stand up on the back of my neck.
And when it comes to his family they too are just as candid; it's a little depressing, to be sure, to see the state of his brothers (Charles, in particular, who is actually an identifiable character for many outsiders in the world, only to an extreme), and the tales of his father.
All of the women look stunning in their gowns, Davis in particular.
Danica's hairstyle, in particular, looks stolen from the valley girls in the official Baby Got Back music video, circa 1994.
I liked the character's, Sean Connery's character in particular is very suave & likable, I love the innuendo filled conversation he has with Edgar Trent's wife, Donald Sutherland's key maker Agar provides good support although in the book it was he who turned Pierce into the police & there's plenty of colourful Victorian character's to flesh the film out as well.
The first-rate deluxe Special Edition DVD by Image Entertainment offers a fairly grainy, but generally solid and up to par widescreen presentation loaded with a wonderful wealth of awesomely abundant extras which include the theatrical trailer, a still and poster gallery, funky animated menus complete with songs and music from the picture, screen tests, bloopers and rehearsals (the bloopers in particular are an absolute hoot), pre-production footage and storyboards, animation test footage and work print outtakes, and, most savory of all, a very funny, entertaining and informative commentary provided by Kanefsky along with various cast and crew members.
Eugenio Derbez in particular, does an amazing job as the hardened sidekick who discovers his heart might still be open to caring.
And, more importantly for me, it is clearly an homage to film in general, and Bogart in particular.
A killer starts killing teenage girls and boys which will eventually lead up to the killing of one girl in particular.
It is the story of three astronauts, one in particular, who witness war and nuclear holocaust from a satelite.
One character in particular sounded like one of Alex's droogs.
I'm not a huge expert on Hitchcock in particular though, but I have noticed the humor involved in his suspense scenes, a device he also used in "The Lady Vanishes" and all the way through "North by Northwest."
I also liked the character's here, the relationships between Hale & the sexy park ranger & between Hale & Deakins in particular, I just thought the character's & the way they were written & developed were better than the average action flick with themes like friendship & betrayed.
The acting is alright, I liked Travolta (who was apparently paid $7,000,000 for this) as the villain in particular but he does come across as a bit theatrical at times, I thought Mathis was fine as the love interest although I thought Slater was a bit bland & forgettable as the hero.
If I say that there's a dragon who makes veiled allusions to Wittgenstein, that might convey something of the film's flavour; on the other hand, you might suspect this to be a sample of the kind of pointless eccentricity which film-makers (animators in particular) indulge in so that they won't be accused of being mainstream, and for no other reason.
In considering the characters, this is where the camera-work, colour palette, costume and makeup all come together to really enhance each player - and there are some fascinating visual and social studies of Anna, Clara and Joe in particular.
One extra in particular is incredible.
The Al Pacino character in particular- he is a proper grown up complex person brought to life on screen- doesn't have all the answers, messed up a things but keeps plugging away.
The long closeups, in particular, were especially effective.
One in particular is gruesome even when seen from a distance as Michi is on the phone: a woman throwing herself off a high tower, her body hitting the floor in a flat thud.
We see it happen over the course of this film with one Massachusetts legislator in particular, and that effect could be replicated in other states if we all take the time to share our opinions and stories -- and mobilize ourselves into a political force to be reckoned with.
One scene in particular lets us see some guys getting onto a boat while we could still watch a nice old Mercury woody wagon and its occupant in the background.
The film's principal winning hand is the truly inspired and on the money casting of resolutely scrappy and unglamorous character actors Elam, Brand and Van Cleef as three of the foulest, meanest, ugliest and most menacing no-account criminal scum to ever scowl, growl and glower their way across the screen; Brand and Van Cleef in particular make for a fabulously nasty and odious pair of scary customers.
It encompasses virtually all of metal sub-genres like Hard Rock, Glam, Black, Power (although I have trouble with defining this sub genre in particular), death, prog and thrash.
There's the woman in particular, acted very well (she's the one sprawled out on a couch or other, with black hair, at least I *think* it's her), who responds to the Jodorowsky character at first with disdain, but then noticing his body changes her attitude.
While this film may not be as essential as "El Topo" and "The Holy Mountain" it is definitely a highly memorable film for lovers of surreal avant-garde cinema and Jodorowsky fans in particular.
I am very interested in horror films, and in particular some of the fairly obscure 70's productions.
I originally saw this film shortly after the release of Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill and while I was impressed by the amount of bloodshed, I didn't hold the film in particularly high regard.
Generally the acting is superb, however, in particular this is possibly Orson Welles' finest performance.
characters: 10/10 acting: 10/10 plot: 7/10 result: 8/10  I would recommend this movie to anyone, and in particular people who love drama, just a story of a person.
The production values show where it counts, right down to the Orry-Kelly gowns on Ms. Stanwyck--- one in particular looked like it wiped out half the fox population in Depression-era California.
Alessio Boni in particular as Matteo captures the screen with such tortured macho dynamism that it's no wonder he's gone on to play Heathcliff and Dracula in other mini-series.
One scene in particular really stuck with me - it's the scene during the Rwandan inquest, where a Belgian senator starts to harangue Dallaire over the deaths of a couple of Belgian peacekeepers, who he claimed could have been saved.
Crudup, in particular, has an extremely challenging role - two characters in one - and handles it most impressively.
The kid actors are all appealingly natural (Gossett in particular impresses as the moody and unhappy Johnny).
Wrapped in a maniacal revenge story is a comment about the nature of evil, in particular, the reasons for which evil is committed.
Harry Callahan quickly establishes his action-not-words by driving his car through a liquor store window to free the owners, who are being held as hostagesÂ Demoted to the personnel department, he scorns bureaucracy in general and in particular the Mayor's policy of attracting women into the force, but he is saddled with one, Kate Moore (Tyne Daly) as his by now obligatory 'minority' partnerÂ   Insp.
The ending is obvious from the beginning, but there are some hilarious set pieces along the way, in particular, when Ellen recruits a timid shoe salesman to impersonate Stephen and also when her ruse is exposed as the real Stephen pops up from the country club swimming pool.
Evans' love for and expert knowledge of Japanese extreme movie-making has clearly informed Footsteps, and he has applied that dynamic to an inherently Western tale of societal breakdown, which will be familiar to anyone who lives in the UK in particular.
Women in particular were disenfranchised.
The movie has two problems 1) a problem of perception: it starts off looking like a fairly routine mystery / police procedural, but elements of other kinds of movies begin to trickle in as the plot reveals itself -- which may have confused some reviewers wanting a pure genre piece, 2) the plot IS a little hard to follow in places and depends on one important coincidence in particular.
Robinson, in particular, makes the most of a meaty role that has him cocky and confident one moment, then bruised and bitter the next as his past crimes catch up with him--and his conscience.
His encouragement of adolescent individualism leads to dramatic consequences for one student in particular, triggering a dramatic scenario that engulfs most of his classmates.
Director James L. Wilson and writer Richard H. Wadsack neatly craft a fun and engrossing omnibus outing that eschews the usual graphic gore and bloodshed in favor of creating and sustaining a potently creepy and nightmarish midnight-in-the-graveyard gloom-doom atmosphere; the opening credits sequence in particular is very chilling and the conclusion packs one hell of a terrifying punch.
One quote in particular was worth the price of the rental back in 1988: "That's the problem with insurance.
But the real focus of the movie is on Brad Johnson's Henry Nash, the Arizona outlaw, and Chris Noth's Craig Wadsworth, the Park Avenue polo player... Noth in particular gives a understatedly lovely, nuanced performance as the rich young man coming face to face with Life -- the very thing his family had tried so hard to keep him from ever having to experience.
The cast is top-notch, in particular Lorraine Bracco and Molly Parker.
The effects are, in the main, pretty good, in particular the demon.
The film gives no clue whatsoever if the tales being told have anything to do with some army in particular in some period of history or with the lord of the rings saga..  (Hint: the turks are the orks, and Tirant resembles Aragorn, though no Virgo Mortensen in sight just a lookalike).
It was a scathing if hilarious indictment of the entire Hollywood system in general and the Oscars in particular.
The public just loved Charlie reminding Fields of his alcoholism, in particular his large red nose.
The film is flawed (the middle section in particular lags pretty badly), but I'd rather watch an interesting if imperfect film any day than successful tripe.
He also discovers girls, one in particular, Roxanne who owns a very large dog called Die Hard (you can sense the jokes that this brings).
Zhao Wei in particular is a joy to watch.
This movie is about two young girls dreaming of a wedding in a hotel in particular.
Sometimes I wonder if film festivals, and Artisan Entertainment in particular exist so weirdos and nutcases, i.e.
Even though I consider myself a classic horror fan (and a fan of the classic Universal horror movies in particular), I readily admit that Dracula (1931) is not among my favorites.
There are many talented actors in "Winding Roads" (Hunter and Marsters, in particular, made the most with what they were given).
If you're looking for gangster thrills, go elsewhere; this is a movie of ideas, a critique directed at Italy in particular.
Matt Lucas and David Walliams have created a cast of curmudgeons and ne'er-do-wells that are astonishing in their range -- Lucas, in particular, melts into his various roles with an almost eerie changeability.
And one or two are just so gross that I cannot watch the show with my wife, as she'll leave the room (in particular, the guy who is sexually attracted to old ladies--fortunately this gross skit isn't seen that often).
It would take too long for me to go shot by shot, but one thing in particular which is good if you see a few scenes of it, but is annoying the first time is the frequent several second flashbacks...
What it is about is the efforts of a small group of men, and one man in particular, to maintain their faith, their sense of values, and their very sanity under horrible, murderous conditions that would drive most men to insanity or to become murderers themselves.
Not as graphic in the vag-stabbing department as I would've liked but God bless the Nipponese and Hasebe in particular for consistently bringing the best sleazy rape films to the table.
The ending is obvious from the beginning, but there are some hilarious set pieces along the way, in particular, when Ellen recruits a timid shoe salesman to impersonate Stephen and also when her ruse is exposed as the real Stephen pops up from the country club swimming pool.
I'll be the first to admit that the movie was very histrionic (in particular Ms. Crawford's performance) and is pure soap opera as well--but I still enjoyed the film immensely.
There's one scene in particular with Sadako climbing up the side of the well.
On the strength of this, I rented two more Ferrara titles - FEAR CITY (1984) and KING OF NEW YORK (1990; again, with Walken) - to go along with BAD LIEUTENANT (1992; which I just recorded off late-night Italian TV, where it was presented in the original language); the latter two, in particular, are films that I've been meaning to check out for years (I just hope it'll be worth it).
Someone seems to have drained the life out of these performers; Jim Brown, in particular, comes off very badly (judging only from this movie, you'd come to the conclusion that he can't act).
Reginald Owen in particular was given the necessary latitude to offer a different interpretation of the Holmes personality.
But it's still a decent action movie and any fan of Yuen Biao in particular really needs to see it.
Personally, I think that while some of his other movies might be more impressive on a purely sexual scale (the now extremely hard to locate FEMMES DE SADE in particular) this one surely stands as his best combination of hardcore sex with a honest to goodness light 'n' breezy bit o'plot.
In dire need of a more serious tone after the humorous but somewhat inconsistent Shore Leave, Star Trek returns to its tradition of tackling deeper themes from a sci-fi point of view, focusing in particular on Spock's interactions with the rest of the Enterprise crew.
settled down with any woman in particular, I think it would have spoiled the dynamic of the show.
Patrick Lussier's direction was as great as ever, I'd love to see his take on The Crow mythology :) The additional characters were also great in this film, the two vampires during the opening and the two procurers in particular were awesomely performed!
Its often devastatingly difficult to watch (mainly in one or two scenes), most of this story is wildly compelling and human drama due to the immense talents of Lynch and Hopkins in particular.
Elaine May's direction was delicate yet purposeful, allowing for the superb development of characters ( in particular Eddie Albert's curmudgeonly businessman/father) without impeding the flow of the plot.
In Sideways the main characters, Jack in particular (played by Thomas Haden Church), were so personally offensive, in word, in thought, and in deed, that many people intensely disliked the movie solely on that basis.
While both actors are great in this movie, Shue in particular is shocking (in a good way).
Besides being visually gorgeous, the film does a very good job of portraying how very different ancient Graeco-Roman society was from our own, and how sex in particular was not seen as shameful or in any way limited to a narrow idea of what's "normal" as it is in America today.
I knew immediately what had happened and how our mutual adoration with this series and, in particular, this episode had changed the course of history.
Rod Serling had an affinity for boxing in his stories--in particular, the life of an old and haggard journeyman boxer.
In terms of acting, the film belongs to the ladies, Cate Blanchett and Taraji P. Henson in particular.
The last 40 minutes in particular is pretty jaw-dropping, with explosions and bullets gallore, amidst the frenetic camera-work and stylish visuals.
Why was that so frequent in classic movies, in particular?
Much of it owes a great deal to the French New Wave films that were popular throughout the 60s, and it also pays homage to the films of John Cassavetes, SHADOWS in particular.
This time, though, there is no explanation as to why the force is calling her in particular, or even what the force really is and how it has the power to do what it does.
Paz Vega, in particular, is brilliant as Lucia.
The middle lags considerably, in particular the relationship between Lucia and Lorenzo that marches straight to a dead end, going nowhere other than circles.
The acting quality is utterly over-the-top, mischievous and silly - Masanobu Ando in particular appears to be having great fun messing with the role of Fake, a master fine-art forger whose portraits unfortunately look like they were painted by a monkey with two left hands.
The fantastic and poignant song "Pari" which is beautifully pasteurized on the ladies of the night stands out in particular.
The police in particular really annoyed me, but you have to give them credit for trying.
The leading lady, in particular, is ill-suited for the role, one of the most annoying characters ever, and the worst female performance since Maria Putillo in "Godzilla" (1998).
Anyone taking the effort to sit down and watch the film in its entirety will come to realize however that the female characters (Bourbon's in particular) are well drawn, not whining victims at all, perfectly capable of righting the wrongs inflicted upon them.
The set in particular was not good and most of the flashbacks centered around a stained glass window in a door which was entirely modern and looked like it could be bought in any home improvements store.
At the turn of the last century, unless you had the name of Sarah Bernhardt, the theatre business, and vaudeville in particular, was regarded as the prime of indecency, a profession to which shame was associated.
Possibly the greatest (and most celebrated) of swashbucklers, it's also the best Robin Hood film (once again improving on Douglas Fairbanks' already impressive Silent version) and Errol Flynn's finest hour: delightful script (not only providing several great lines for the actors to sink their teeth into - Claude Rains' Prince John in particular - but it's put in the service of a plot which remains absorbing despite its over-familiarity), beautiful three-color cinematography (by no less than three top-notch cameramen!)
The touching cafÃ© scene in particular between John J and Manuela feels like a docu-drama with its unscripted pauses and moments of awkwardness.
Not only this movie shows all the stupidity of communist ideology (and any ideology in particular), it also in vivid manner shows how far would mother do to protect its child.
George in particular is quite sympathetic, and plays it straight in a number of scenes.
Some scenes in particular bring light relief and patch the whole thing up into a marvellous little epic.
One in particular shows Deputy Davis blow up one of the gators with a 'super gun' after which he and his son return to the ranger station.
There's one actor in particular who screamed like a girl, and that made me laugh.
In one disturbing scene in particular, the lovely young lady joins in his laughter, innocently never realizing WHY he is laughing.
For 2 reasons in particular... 1.My brother suffers from Schizophrenia and some of the scenes really rang true for me.
As he's aged his roles have been more of a dramatic nature and I think that this role in particular shows his talent and skill as a cinematic artist.
One scene, in particular, in which the gorgeous tramp and a minor male character are trapped with no hope, and the totally unexpected happens in their actions, but it rings of truth in such circumstances.
As much as a TV show can, it influenced my perception of the grown-up world in general and of New Yorkers in particular.
Rachel Leigh Cook is very good, and actually great and very moving in one scene in particular.
The ending in particular is bittersweet.
Two shots in particular demonstrate a willingness to experiment with special effects.
It was Hitchcock first major Success and one of two films in the 20's (the other was "Blackmail") that gave him an enormous reputation , It offers a possible explanation for"Jack the Ripper" and shows the beginning of many Hitchcock trademarks such as the Wrong Man on the run, fetishistic sexuality and murder, Death and Pleasure, In the Dark Thick Fog, London is awash with fear and loathing over a serial sex murder known as "The Avenger" who targets Blond Woman in particular and leaves their warm corpse lying in the street ,He always strikes on a Tuesday, his Face is covered, and Leaves his calling card always tucked away in the victims pocket, On a Tuesday night Daisy Bunting(June Tipp) a Model comes home to her little flat she shares with her family, her boyfriend(Malcolm Keen) the local chief of police is there boasting how he's going to catch the"avenger killer while flipping a coin in the air, Suddenly the Gas meter switches off and while Daisys Father (Arthur Chesney) goes to insert another coin in , The house goes dark All of A sudden their is a knock on the Door and Mrs Bunting (Played beautifully by Marie Ault) Opens the Door to a pall faced Tall man with his face Covered (Ivor Novello) inquiring about the room for let upstairs,The Pale Antisocial Asexual Unnamed man begins his association with the family and starts More trouble than they can possibility imagine, especially when we seems to take Interest in Daisy who Just Happens to be Fair Haired.Suspicion Falls upon the odd Introvert and coincidence seems to follow fact as Tuesday Night Comes Around Again and another scream is heard in the Depths of the London Fog.
The Lodger is crammed with Expressionist effects, in particular double exposures.
Probably the funniest parts of the movie (to me) are those that play to Robbie's broken heart; it's probably the best depiction of the depression of the newly-dumped I've ever seen (in particular, I love the "Kill Me Please" song).
For a change, Paulette Goddard plays the nurse with most of the male admirers (Sonny Tufts in particular), with Veronica Lake showing up late in a decidedly unsexy role (about which I can't say much more than that, lest I ruin it for you).
What also moved me in particular is the character of Julie, Manu's sister, played by Julie Depardieu.
The ending in particular is made out of Rumors and stories told about what happened.
What makes this click with so many horror buffs, in particularly those who love lesbian vampire films, is the one-time star Yvette Stensgard, a gorgeous Scandanavian child-woman who looks absolutely innocent (particularly when her eyes fetchingly cross), even the moment before she rips open the neck of her next victim.
Efficiently directed in a briskly straightforward and economical no-frills manner by Sam Newfield, with an endearingly hokey script by Fred Myton, plenty of sharply sardonic dialogue, stark, gritty black and white photography by Robert Cline, a booming, melodramatic score by Charles Dunworth, and game acting from a solid cast (Glenn Strange in particular contributes an amiable performance as Bradford's clumsy, cowardly, oafish assistant Andy while Charlie Middleton registers strongly as a jerky ramrod sheriff), this wittily enjoyable Grade B mystery thriller potboiler delivers a reasonable amount of cheap thrills.
Claudine auger(as Renata), in particular, has impressed with her portrayal of a strong and single minded woman who dominates her husband, Alberto(Luigi Pistilli).
This giallo in particular would go on to influence the American slasher genre.
This Bava slasher is best remembered for influencing other movies in the subgenre (the "Friday the 13th" movies in particular), but the truth is that it is almost unwatchable.
One scene in particular is the one where Lillian, and Lewis, first encounter the Native Americans.
The story structure was essentially unprecedented -- with the exception of that same year's Freaks, which was unprecedented in practically every way possible -- in that it featured multiple characters with independent relationships and intertwining narratives (in other words, it laid the groundwork for every Robert Altman film ever made -- Gosford Park in particular).
We are used to seeing this now; (think Altman, in particular) where characters are all somehow connected, even though they may not even know each other.
Director Adam Marcus, working from a clever script by Dean Lorey and Jay Huguely, relates the compelling story at a constant snappy pace, maintains a mean, brutal tone throughout, delivers plenty of nasty gore (a young lady getting impaled on a tent spike while doing just what you think with her boyfriend rates as the definite splatter highlight), further tarts things up with a welcome sense of self-mocking black humor, offers a generous sprinkling of tasty female nudity, stages the murder set pieces with rip-roaring brio (the delightfully outrageous diner massacre sequence in particular seriously smokes), and really goes for broke with a gloriously wild ending which comes complete with one doozy of a sequel set-up punchline.
In his autobiography, "Cagney By Cagney" Mr. Cagney told of many actual events in Mr. Chaney's life that were used in the picture and one in particular that was so sad they decided not to include it.
Two aspects in particular stand out.
Finally, there is a meditation in here on film in general, and romantic comedies in particular.
In a documentary this might be interesting with a voice-over, but in a narrative film like "Kekexili", the scene appears heading for nowhere in particular, merely extending the running time.
It is very well directed by William Wellman who draws first-rate performances from the supporting cast, in particular Lionel Stander as a heartless, slime-ball studio hack.
We are not aware of the true extent of things until much later but looking back at the events in the opening hour, the leisurely way in which the gang hang around and talk about nothing in particular considering what they have done is shocking.
Bogart and Stanwyck are genuinely competent in their roles; Stanwyck in particular turning things up a notch when it becomes clear that she could wind up a murder victim.
Don't get me wrong, the manufacturing industry, and the chemical industry in particular, had and has issues.
I in particular consider to be Landi very successful in exactly what he aimed for: Adult entertainment.
As anyone who has seen Giallo a Venezia will expect, much of it is of the misogynistic variety; with one death scene in particular, which sees one of the ladies have a poker rammed up her vagina (in a really rather bizarre scene that has to be seen to be believed!)
But the effects - the afore mentioned one in particular - are so badly executed that their impact equals zero.
This one in particular is a keeper, as I was surprised that they showed this scene as "up-close and personal" as they did.
There are directing nuances that remind me of Kubrick, in particular the parallel of montages between Mr.
Globetrotters, par excellance, the travels of Sam and Fleming provide effective narrative ballast, and in particular, Fleming's adept narration carefully focuses our attention, so that we feel privy to the historical events Sam lived through during the early and mid 20th century.
However that scene in particular seemed hollow.
With this in mind, one has to consider the development which the comedy genre underwent during this time: from the mildly risquÃ© sophisticated antics of the Doris Day/Rock Hudson films of the early 1960s to the cynical anxiety-ridden variety that started emanating towards the tail-end of the decade Â with which the likes of Jack Lemmon, George Segal (the male lead of this film) and, in particular, Woody Allen (since he was his own writer and mostly directed himself as well) are forever associated.
There is however one actor in particular that I wanted to touch on and that is Michael Rooker.
Instead of having an offensive or critical view of anything in particular, the film takes more of a funny spin on things.
These are often done in a single take - one scene in particular, early in the film as she is leaving the house before Olivier arrives home, talking rapidly to Richard Wattis as they walk down the long staircase, is outstanding.
Director Stuart Gordon relates the absorbing story at a brisk pace, does an expert job of maintaining a tough, gritty tone throughout, and stages the thrilling action scenes with rip-roaring verve (the climactic jailbreak sequence in particular is quite tense and stirring).
What really makes this movie are the outrageous scenes - one in particular is very memorable - taking place near the end, which I dare not spoil for those yet to see this.
There is simply no point in watching cut versions of Exploitation-King Joe D'Amato's movies, and "Antropophagus" in particular is a movie that is intended to shock, so the uncut version is essential.
Carly Pope in particular is strikingly beautiful and very talented.
The majority of the characters are stunningly rendered (Beowulf in particular) in close up, but they somehow look less convincing at a distance.
Not saying that the new Zealand audience in particular is easily misled, i think any nationality would have been fooled.
In any case it is a highly interesting film featuring many impressing names sharing the hoax and i would recommend it to anyone with a interest in either movies or Peter Jacksons Pre-LOTR career in particular.
Eastwood in particular has stemmed together three recent films Â The Forgiven, Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby Â that each dealt with a person of persons dealing with the emotional weight of violence that they were witness.
Those two fights in particular even though they are choreographed, look very REAL and are as hardcore as they come!
But as everyone does know, the fairy tale turned into a pointless, roundabout existence, including a hopeful collusion with the Nazis, (in particular von Ribbentrop, a close friend of Mrs Simpson) who wanted to put Edward back on the throne as a puppet king to prevent any interference from Britain to Hitler's nasty little designs in Europe.
Powerful anti war movie - the scenes with Frederic March in particular and Cary Grant are quite intense and grim, but there is some relief to counter balance this aspect of the movie in the characters played by Jack Oakie (comic) and Carole Lombard (sympathy).
One actress in particular was a mind boggling bombshell.
Lithgow in particular is good as a scientist driven mad by the eighth dimension.
To my mind, Basilashvili, in particular, added to my previous perception of Woland and expanded this character if that's at all possible.
But by embracing the lurid, sensationalistic hyperbole heaped upon the founders of the Roman Empire by later writers (Suetonius and Tacitus in particular), Graves concocted the ultimate in dysfunctional families, weaving a tale of scandal and debauchery capable of shocking even the most jaded of modern audiences.
It's literally impossible for me to pick out one in particular as they are all as great as each other.
I paid little attention to him during his heyday, when his face, in particular, looked like that of an inflatable girl dildo.
Apart from the always brilliant David Suchet in the leading role, Elliot Cowan in particular made an impression amongst the supporting actors, giving a delightfully menacing and genuinely haunting performance as David Hunter.
The story centers around Sun Ra's return to Earth after an extended absence, and focuses on his concern for the fate of humanity and African-Americans in particular.
The plot is ridiculous, in particular the killing of the prostitute.
It's such a brilliant mix of everything, personally I don't think there's anything wrong with it, I know I'm probably too old to like that sort of stuff but I watch anything me if the trailer looks good, I'm more into CGI/animation movies, there's soo much more that they can do compared to live-action and if Astro Boy had been live-action then it wouldn't have been as good because they wouldn't have been able to accomplish half the stuff they did in the CGI version, hell I don't even know how they managed with the live-action series back then :S But seriously, if this is your kind of movie, don't listen to what the bad reviews are telling you, experience it for yourself and just watch it, because it is a really fun/thrilling movie that can really make you smile, just as it did with me :)  Another good thing is that they haven't changed anything too drastically, normally when a movie is adapted from TV or a book they tend to change it, sometimes too much but I feel that they have changed it only slightly so that it appeals greater to our modern ages, the great thing though is that Astro is the same.. you know, same name, look, even the undies... but at least he's wearing clothes.. well up until the end... ha ha :D Although I'm not really sure what to think about the new characters apart from the RRF who are just hilarious, but I guess some of the others resemble or remind me of the old ones but the one in particular is Cora, who is mean't to be seen as a potential love interest for Astro (I think...) is just not needed really, I mean she's probably there just to fill up the space, I don't think there's an actual reason, I mean I can't see them getting together and stuff... but maybe that's just me.
The acting is pretty good & I suspect we have Cronenberg to thank for that, Joe Silver as Rollo Linski stands out in particular & dominates every scene he's in.
It is fairly nasty in a visceral sort of way but it's also derivative, (it's "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" in all but name), and appallingly acted, (look out, in particular, for the elderly European couple with the walking frame), so that any serious point it may be making is lost.
Here, Kurosawa doesn't quite have the sureness of touch which would characterize most of his career, but Stray Dog is nevertheless a fine film noir and an effective exploration of Kurosawa's ideas about postwar Japan in particular and the human condition in general.
So, in summary, it's both a comedy as well as tragic in a way, but certainly well made and in particular very authentically acted!
The last performance in which Lenny is on stage in nothing except a raincoat, in particular, is eye opening - according to the trivia it actually occurred and was sent in by a student who was at the show.
Morales' polished cinematography are up to speed, and there's a decent smattering of yummy female nudity (Misty in particular as usual looks quite scrumptious in her birthday suit), but overall this movie is too poky and plodding.
What I liked in particular was how they took two of his earlier non-Keystone comedies and analyzed the many, many changes the film underwent thanks to Chaplin's obsessive-compulsive film style.
But likely for most the prominent reason would be for the realistic acting, in particular by its star Duris.
Grant, in particular, has a heartbreaking scene where Roger begs a judge to allow Julie and him to keep their baby daughter despite their dwindling economic circumstances.
One studio in particular, the Japanese Disney, if you will, Studio Ghibli.
It alternates between the "main" storyline involving Spike and the others, and the occasional vignette or flashback about a character in particular.
Sitting down for Macbeth the Comedy I was rather expecting a kind of Iris Murdochesque production, full of in-jokes about Shakespeare and Macbeth in particular.
Sitting down for Macbeth the Comedy I was rather expecting a kind of Iris Murdochesque production, full of in-jokes about Shakespeare and Macbeth in particular.
There is another scene in particular I keep thinking about that sums Long Time Dead & it's silly script up, when two people break into a police guarded house & turn the lights on only for the police officer on guard to be conveniently looking in the opposite direction & only looking back at the house literally seconds after the lights have been turned off.
From this point on, Morgan's life turns into a living hell, as Sloan decides to wage a little war against the ones responsible for the death of his son in particular, and apparently against the rest of the world in general, namely the local police station, families, friends and other innocent people passing by.
The team is comprised of four young hot archaeologists, and two locals, one in particular is a hungry stud (Gary Hamilton) who is by far the best looking 70's hunk I've ever seen naked on screen.
But many a mark on my mattress, sofas, carpets, towels, and other items bore evidence in my youth of the indelibly sensual impression this film -- and Sylvia in particular -- left on me.
In the latter film, Angelopoulos' views contradict the "official" Greek history and constitute a fundamental revision of history in which the Left, in general, and the Communist Party of Greece in particular, are given their proper places, and are not depicted as the moral threat to Greek democracy.
The stunningly gorgeous and adorable Gabriela Hassle in particular impresses with her warm and charming performance as Michael's sweet gal pal Alexandra.
And the songs that play... one example in particular is a key scene that takes place on a street.
Lynch will never tell us what any of his films are about - if indeed he knows or would ever admit that a film might be about something in particular.
In one scene in particular, he confronts Q (Omar Epps) in their high school hallway and we see the really ugly and crazed side of his character.
Unflinching insights into emotional cruelty and power imbalances in relationships are one of the most under-appreciated aspects of Hitchcock's films ('Rebecca', 'Notorious', 'Vertigo' and 'Marnie' in particular, although even the minor barbs James Stewart throws at Grace Kelly in 'Rear Window' hit the mark squarely), but here one of the most calculated betrayals in all of his work has absolutely no emotional resonance.
Writer/director Harry Essex, who also wrote the scripts for the classic 50's fright features "It Came from Outer Space" and "The Creature from the Black Lagoon," pukes forth a 50's style micro-budget clunker that boasts all the necessary bad movie vices to qualify as a real four-star stinker: the flat acting from a lame no-name cast (flash-in-the-pan 70's drive-in flick starlet Maria De Aragon in particular just takes up space as fetching love interest heroine Jeanne), sluggish pacing, ragged editing, rough, grainy cinematography by Robert Caramico, meandering narrative, a roaring, overwrought score by Robert Freeman, several ludicrous touches (the fireball stalks people before it kills them!
As for the other actors, they are all outstanding with Dennis Quaid in particular turning in a great performance as Doc Halladay.
Flawed in so many ways, hard to pick at anything in particular.
Now, what in particular was the points which dragged the movie down?
The villains in particular, are slimy and nasty.
He begins shouting at no one in particular and at the same time he begins to struggle to keep them at bay.
Although perhaps a bit too scary in places for more sensitive youngsters (the kitchen attack scene, in particular is quite frightening), Gremlins is great fun for monster movie addicts of all ages.
Browne in particular added some good comedic moments.
Zhou Xun, and Tony Yang too, at times sounded a bit off in their Cantonese diction, but that doesn't mar their performances, in particular Zhou Xun's excellent delivery of dual roles.
It took me about 5 hours to complete the story, and the overall the game is quite good, but after Spider-Man 2 (and, in particular, Ultimate Spider-Man) I was hoping for better.
As far as asserting facts unsubstantiated by evidence, the series contains numerous examples but one, in particular.
One character in particular is felt sorry for and that is the old lady.
his Twilight Zone episodes in particular.
The stunningly gorgeous and adorable Gabriela Hassle in particular impresses with her warm and charming performance as Michael's sweet gal pal Alexandra.
One scene in particular had said effect on me... around the one hour mark, involving a chainsaw and a shotgun... anyone who has seen the film already know what I'm talking about, and I won't say anymore so as to not spoil it for anyone who hasn't.
The characters are well cast, in particular David Jason as Pop Larkin and Pam Ferris as Ma, who live life with abandonment and cavalier disregard for society's expectations.
With its preposterous plot laden with totally bonkers moments, a crazy killer who is revealed only in the film's closing moments, and over-stylised direction with a strong use of colour, I Know Who Killed Me shares a lot in common with Italian horror, and, in particular, the 'giallo' genre of movies: horror/thrillers that are often weak on story, but loaded with great visuals.
One scene in particular was really quite funny, and while I'm not sure if it made the film less believable or was in it's favor, I know it made me laugh a few times.
All the songs are of at least decent quality but three of them in particular are just amazing.
Nicol Williamson stands out in particular as the creepy Merlin, but it's fun to see Helen Mirren, Patrick Stewart and Liam Neeson paving their ways to future stardom.
There are parallel stories, weaving the news of the nuclear technology around the conflicts of Chismore's mental cruelty and abusive behavior to his family; in particular, his coming-of-age daughter Rose (Annabeth Gish).
Yehuda Levi as Jagger, in particular, was very likable and made the point that he was both idealistic, boyishly-goofy, romantic; and though he may have appeared naive, his blind innocence that came across made him more endearing.
I needed more between Jossi and Jaggar - in particular more kissing because it was wonderful.
Based on a true story, the film is warm-hearted but inconsequential, with some annoyingly jerky hand-held camera movements, and the climactic scenes are a little too restrained to be entirely successful (though Knoller, in particular, gives a truly remarkable performance in the aftermath of a devastating plot development).
Bonita Granville & Mickey Rooney portray the youngest siblings in the family, with Rooney in particular having some very funny moments.
This film in particular was very sought after in the 1980s, because unlike the other two it was not widely available on video.
The funeral of Delilah also is notable, for the appearance of members of the Black Middle class in the scenes, in particular the men in quasi-military uniforms who must belong to some "mason" like club, and who give the deceased a goodbye beneath their outstretched military sabers.
On the other hand David Striesow's (Phillip) performance attracts the attention of the viewer, and is highly commendable, in particular his swift changes in mood.
It tries to clever & say something about immigration & racism in particular but it forgets all about the entertainment value in the process.
The disturbing reality is that governments and, in particular, intelligence agencies, e.g.
One girl in particular seemed incredibly disinterested through the whole thing and delivered such a lack-luster performance it was almost funny.
Her storyline in particular was excruciating to watch.
Having read the message board posts for this program, a lot of people seem to dislike both the new "Marple" adaptations in general, and this episode in particular.
The evil was heaped onto Charlie Strom, Gary Oldman's character, so heavily in the first half of the movie that it's difficult for him to escape from underneath the mountain of badness that he is under even when we see the reasons for his actions, but the good guys in particular, are not as good as they seem.
Larissa in particular really seemed to like none of the guys, although apparently her and jock boy were dating for a quite a while afterwards.
One scene in particular when the lead actress is captured and thrown into a holding cell.
Co-directors Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger have a unique and occasionally ominous way of letting nature unfold in front of the lens, and the cinematography is vivid and expressive; however, they don't seem to know much about actors or about the strength of performance--the technique seems to elude them--and Jennifer Jones in particular comes off looking like an amateur (which she is most assuredly not).
On one hand, the film had some exceptional characters (in particular the aunt).
What bothered me in particular is that Stefania is supposed to be an adult.
The good actors involved are coasting (Billy Bob Thornton in particular looks as if he's performing from the vantage point of a prozac coma) and the bad actors are left to use their questionable skills to turn every other scene into full-tilt soap opera.
The acting is poor by an obviously amateur cast some of whom appear to have been very badly dubbed in particular the Sheriff.
It sensationalizes crime, celebrates materialism, denigrates Black Africans in general, debases Black women in particular, and glorifies Whites in the same subliminal ways that are so prevalent in Hollywood.
A great shame, as the first Stuart Little in particular was a great hit with my daughter, and one of the best children's films of recent years.
Apart from being full of colors and sweet melody, the cinematic opera falls short of achieving that true great flavour that one has come to savour out of the classic Javanese Dance dramas and Ramayana in particular.
With just Wood showing potential, the rest of the cast with Chris Klein in particular produces an emotionless and petty display that is more wooden than anything.
first of all this show has loads of humans in it who don't need to be there and one in particular completely ruins this show.
Cream in particular deserves some kind of award for being the biggest baby I've ever seen in an animated series (like The Powerpuff Girls' Bubbles with even more saccharine cuteness tacked on to compensate for the complete lack of likability), in that she does the most crying of any other character in the series.
The ever-annoying Bob Monkhouse aside, the cast are likable enough, in particular Kenneth Connor (always my favourite Carry On-er) as a hypochondriac chased by canteen lady Dora Bryan; and Charles Hawtrey, who has a whale of a time as usual.
Billy Connolly and Frances O'Connor in particular give delightful performances with the material they have, but their talents are squandered.
What a steaming pile of nothing in particular.
Frances o connor, as the Professor's assistant Kate, in particular stands out for one of the most hammy and immature female portrayals i have ever seen.
Not very I imagine---and in particular the plot itself tends to confuse the audience as it has virtually no connection to the first (which sequels really should have, though a number of them rarely do)!
The plot focuses on vampires; in particular, the legendary Count Dracula and the action kicks off (eventually) when a businessman receives a mysterious package from London containing a case of brandy.
The cast of ASSASSIN OF YOUTH is solidly capable for a roadshow production, and several actors have opportunities to shine in comic roles (in particular, the judge, the old checker-playing codger and the Margaret Hamilton "wicked witch" look-alike).
Lewis is the only player whose style is self-effacing, Varney in particular seeming to have a genuine belief that his lines are actually in some way funny.
I liked the music, in particular the main theme.
The casting is certainly interesting; these stars must have had a vested interest in the proceedings and felt a great need to be a part of the experience, even if three-dimensional roles weren't exactly waiting for them (Kirk Douglas and Elizabeth Taylor, in particular, are poorly used).
I have to question several choices La Marre makes, in particular why he keeps switching into Aramaic for some of the final scenes.
The walk in particular is my favorite.
First of all, the death of Johnny Cage in the beginning scene of the movie destroyed a lot of expectations as there were many who became fans of Johnny Cage in particular.
Directed with an admirable lack of taste and restraint by Andrea Bianchi (the same sweet, subtle, sophisticated gent who blessed us with the insanely gory and over-the-top zombie gut-cruncher "Burial Ground"), who pours on the gratuitous nudity and explicit violence with cheerfully crass abandon (the kill scenes are quite vicious and gruesome while the generously well-proportioned Femi Benussi in particular offers the viewers an amazingly ample eyeful sans clothes).
I happened to stumble across the film-maker's website, and hope to see more of their back-catalogue - The silent snooker film in particular seems just as well-scripted as this masterpiece!
Lastly I'd like to talk about one thing in particular that really upset me about this film.
Yet, his Oscar-winning chops at least make his stereotype less offensive and brain-draining than the other actors, in particular, Harland Williams and Rachel Dratch as a mouthy American couple.
We get great gory close-ups of her slobbering kisses with some of the most disgusting men one has seen in a long time, one young blond fellow in particular whose mouth is larger than her face is wide, so that one wonders how she avoids being swallowed.
I found nothing in particular to recommend this one.
"Flashback" scenes are over-explained, and one in particular (involving Cato) comes so totally out of nowhere as to be confusing and disruptive.
This pathetic movie about a talking detective dog shows nothing but contempt of people in general and children in particular.
What's worse, instead of trusting God, he happens to trust science--in particular his computer.
The locations are macabre beyond belief, in particular a room with hanging animal bones and bone constructed furniture, and the whole film has a hot, musty orange glow about it that almost makes you smell the dead human meat in the cannibal house.
To make money and in particular to take yours!
In a time when made for television films from HBO in particular and Showtime et al seem to be taking more chances with riskier topics than those flooding the theater screens, along comes CARRY ME HOME with a thud that hearkens back to the whiny tearjerkers of twenty years ago.
I generally don't notice lighting, but my friend (a former film school student) was practically vomiting in rage at the way more often than not shadows fell on the actors' faces and the light would be in the background, focused on nothing in particular.
A bunch of good actors are wasted in bit parts (Erik Clausen in particular) and a highly inappropriate soundtrack, as another user mentioned, make for an unimpressive movie.
Now,I'm 14 so I haven't seen many good mondos in my life.But,this is by far one of the best mondos I've seen yet.Traces of Death and Faces of Death are similar,but have one thing different.In FOD,the narrator explains what is going on,whereas the narrator in TOD,doesn't say much.Also,Faces of Death has about 85% of the footage faked.From what I hear about this movie in particular is that most or all of this is real.My problem with these types of movies is if they are real or not.This looks more realistic then Faces of Death.
And the visions are accompanied by flashing lights and sudden camera moves and strange sound effects; the sounds in particular reminded me of the robots changing into cars on "The Transformers."
As for the camera work, well, I have nothing in particular against slow motion or tilting the camera, but was it really necessary to use either so lavishly here?
The next thing I noticed is that this really wasn't a biography but instead was more like a series of sexually explicit episodes (a lotta rapes in particular) and beatings that were linked together by the theme of Marilyn Monroe--like it was inspired by her life only!
This episode in particular is particularly awful - the first half absolutely does not make use of its creepy setting.
Mary Banner(Lilith Fields)is a victim of accident when a prank by a certain jock in particular goes awry.
Curtis Armstrong, in particular, is terrific in his medical student role.
Berry in particular, needs to learn to enunciate and project her lines.
There is one scene in particular that goes on too long and you just can't take it seriously, but let's have your viewing ruin it for you!
It lays on the werewolf mythology pretty thickly, in particular the unconvincing dictionary definition of lycanthropy that opens the movie, and the poem that several characters repeat boringly throughout.
There's one scene in particular that stunned me, it's just after the first attack when Rich is killed & as Wes drives the jeep away next to a sheer drop & Sean grabs the steering wheel & they have a struggle which sends the jeep over the edge of the small cliff & causing themselves all sorts of problems.
Legion of the Dead seems to handle about all sort of things, but nothing in particular.
The film details the lives of the young workers there, focusing in particular on the ups and downs of a couple of relationships.
I hardly ever review movies, but this one in particular i felt i had to review.
Jim Davis plays a scientist who sends some animals, a few wasps in particular, into space to see how they fare under radiation.
'Saathiya' is an excellent example of how his music influences the look, texture and feel of a film, very similar to that of masters like John Williams, Tan Dun and, in particular to the much cherished collaborations between Zbigniew Preisner and the late master Krzysztof Kieslowski.
There's one decapitation scene in particular that far exceeds the quality of anything else in Vengeance of the Zombies.
Five gamers in particular Â Chelsea (Katheryn Winnick), Allison (Anna Tolputt), Derrick (Khary Payton), Mike (Henry Cavill), and Jake (Christopher Jacot) Â have been invited to a "Hellworld" party, hosted by a peculiar man (Lance Henriksen, who just seems to be looking for work nowadays, which is just depressing) who knows all about Hell and more.
The court didn't believe her, in particular since they never got to see all the evidence, nor did they hear some key witnesses who could have defended Mata Hari.
Bale in particular, as always, got the notice of critics when the film hit the festival circuit, and came and went in limited theatrical release late last year.
The prologue in particular was so poorly written, it needed a voice-over to fill in all the details that had been left out.
This absence (of dialogue) stood out for me for two scenes in particular: (i) after the shooting of the boy, one of the men returns to the eatery to tell the grandfather that his grandson is dead.
Imagine my absolute horror when members of the audience, and in particular, female members of the audience, could be heard laughing hysterically.
The script is a dazzler, the action is brutal, effective and extremely exciting and the final half hour in particular cranks up the adrenaline to maximum effect.
The plot in particular is awful.
There's one decapitation scene in particular that far exceeds the quality of anything else in Vengeance of the Zombies.
When I reviewed that I said that Henry Fonda's actions, one in particular would have been grounds for a mistrial.
Some of the supporting performances are fine - John Nettles and Richard E. Grant in particular.
If all that is not enough, there are other lures to consider - the blaring disco music; the groovy, circa-1979 clothes; the forced slapstick (in particular, a fruit-throwing mÃªlÃ©e and a very non-spontaneous pool dunking at a garden party).
Even Sellers genius couldn't save the many dull moments in this film, which consists of dull people talking about nothing in particular, Sellers listening to them, making unfunny comments and generally having his talent wasted.
Love those tails in particular!
The representation of the power of the press and TV in particular, was well reflected, although the conflict between the general public's attitude and those seeking to change things was at best ignored... and at worst, misrepresented.. Middle class Americans weren't all standing around angrily holding baseball bats, or disowning their wayward daughters.
Several scenes in particular are horrendous: like a Super Sweet 16 party equipped with an elephant that is so mind-numbingly retarded that I was sent into anaphalectic shock and needed as epi-pen to be revived.
there are not too many good things about this horror movie.one good thing is the performance of Larry drake as the psycho.he really puts his heart into the performance.you can tell he really has fun with the role.the only other good thing is that in the last 25 minutes or so,the movie starts to get good.the last 15 minutes in particular are really good,and there is one scene near the end which is priceless.unfortunately the first 70+ minutes are pretty lame.there really aren't enough positives are enough to make the movie worth watching.that's my opinion.
The acting is so well performed I could easily assume that these were real people, in particular Jordan Kiziuk's performance of Alex.
Being passionate about cinema and world cinema in particular, I walked away incredibly frustrated.
George Hamilton in particular just delivers lines and in no way gives us a character we can care about.
Cyclone features one scene in particular that is as cruel a scene as I've ever seen.
Michael York in particular goes through the whole thing with an ironic smugness that suggests no one was really taking Stevenson seriously.
You could tell in one looong scene in particular where he was with the bald(er) guy with a beard--a highlight he was--where he was given set-up after set-up but came up blank.
An acquired bad taste in particular.
I didn't find the first few scenes of the movie fit in particularly well with the rest of the tone, but it was a minor annoyance.
I am in particular struck by the roles played by the two males leads (Chad Allen and Robert Gant) and the nuanced, powerful performance by Judith Light.
The climax in particular is so ridiculous that it becomes obvious that there is no attempt at credibility to any of the action sequences.
Director Michael Sarne would have the filmgoing public believe that the studios, the actors (in MYRA BRECKINRIDGE in particular), and 'the system' torpedoed his career.
One regular client in particular, Dr. Christian (D.B.
Greenstreet in particular has two nice ones that come to mind: when he notes his favorite set up (a Strauss waltz on a gramophone and a dead body on the floor), and later when his plans have all collapsed, and he is informed he must return to Berlin (his quick look of horror at hearing what will be his death sentence is done very well).
Finally, I feel that there was an unusual amount of campy scene work for this film, even for Park's standards(in particular the angelic halo scene in the prison).
Jar Jar in particular is a collection of mannerisms, nothing more.
It was extremely well acted by almost all the cast, and Robert De Niro in particular gives a performance worthy of an Oscar nomination.
The script bears little resemblance to the real lives of the two comedians (Costello's daughter in particular was so incensed by this movie that she wrote her own book to refute it and the book it was based on); however, even if it was 100% accurate and Costello actually was the ogre the movie paints him to be, the horrendous miscasting of Buddy Hackett and Harvey Korman destroys whatever possibilities the movie might have had.
The plot is also a bit nonsensical with characters behaviour, the villains in particular, not being believable.
The Porcelean Birds episode in particular put the entire 18-35 demographic on suicide watch for a half hour after it first aired.
!If those of you, who's still having life pumping through your veins,are going to watch this worthless pile of crap, be prepared for a couple of scenes in particular that is probably some of the greatest comedy ever put on screen; the scene with "evil" genius getting angry at woman for having a dog, the scene in which "evil" genius and woman is attending a concert together, and right after, the scene in the carriage.
This movie, in particular, is over the top awful.
One incident in particular is the scene in which "boomer" valiantly smashes through an assembly of stained glass windows on her motorcycle and carefully times her departure from the vehicle in the form of a triple back-flip, projecting the motorcycle at high speeds towards the apparently "bullet-fast" creature within the building's confines, only for the motorcycle to attain a vertical position along the creatures' abdomen, turning perfectly, exposing the "ever-so-small" gas tank, allowing "boomer" an effortless, but nonetheless accurate shot at the flammable contents of the tank, and thus "efficiently" dispatching this foul creature from existence... With her flawless perfection of shot, and ample bosom, how could anyone despise this movie...for laughs.
That last point is where the first sequel, and this one in particular, went wrong.
Susan Smythe in particular is an eyeful.
The pacing is bizarre with a ton of plot simply explained through voice-over (the hanging verdict in particular seems unlikely as shown) in the first half the second half with Karloff stalking the elderly drags.
The ending in particular is just pathetic - it's as if they had run out of ideas and came up with the most ridiculous deus ex machina of all time.
There were several scenes that were absolutely lost upon me (the scene where Johnny the Fox and Pilot are spinning around, high on drugs, and there's some nonsense being muttered, in particular).
Various central-casting western types cycle through, brandishing their mustaches and petticoats, and seem to have been left to their own devices on such matters as line readings (Keenan Wynn, in particular, barks his dialog as though dictating it to a sign painter).
(Christie stories, in particular, always manifest the dreaded potential to come off badly in the hands of an unskilled director).
It's a film of big ideas, in particular about the folly of America's obsession with guns; presumably it's this liberal agenda that enticed an astonishing cast, each member of which is as bad here as they've ever been before (Jeff Daniels plays an arrogant businessman who gets away with murder; Joan Allen is the wife who leaves him to work for loopy billionaire Gary Sinise; they and four or five others get intertwined in a web of violence).
For Jones in particular, the about-to-retire bit is inadvertently cruel: in the preliminary 1968 flashback shot he already looks as though he was born with the century, his noble visage defeating all of Friedkin's technical wizardry -- i.e., getting the actor to wear an oversize hat to cover most of his face -- to assert otherwise.
Well maybe I could have worded that better but it's a film about nothing much in particular, it goes nowhere and the jokes are very weak.
There are very few highlights, one in particular involving John Cleese as an automated chauffeur.
I really cannot understand why films like "Kill Bill" which are based on so much blood and gore are so popular... "Kill Bill" in particular, is 90% ugly scenes and 10% anything else.
This movie was a slap in the face of veterans in general, but especially disrespected Warrant Officers and the Military Police Branch in particular.
I've seen most of Fulci's output (that's available in English anyway) and even I found this one in particular to be disappointing.
There are some surprises, but I feel the movie really lacks from characters whom one can care about: in particular Betsy Brantley, who plays Kate, seems desperately out of her depth here.
The rest of the cast are appalling, in particular the actors that play Baldwin's wife and fellow detective.
There's a sense of improv about the whole effort but much of the intended black humor vaporizes  Worthwhile for students of film history and in particular the careers of De Palma and De Niro .One should be thankful that somehow they were encouraged to proceed with their careers.
Beyond that, there is also the question of whether humanity itself (presumably Western civilizations in particular) now saddles itself with unjust laws and punishments which do not "fit the crime."
The hats, in particular, were very wrong for the time.
Anyway, this spoof of "Basic Instinct" (with such side targets as "Indecent Proposal", "Body Of Evidence" and "9 & 1/2 Weeks") is certainly not lazy - there's a visual or verbal gag every 10 seconds or so - but, unfortunately, only a small portion of these gags score; the first 10 minutes are the best, the last 10 minutes, in particular, degenerate into sloppy idiocy.
I went to watch this one without expecting anything in particular from it.
The CGI is so bad that when the bugs attack one guy in particular it looks like a gray liquid is covering him.
All this is embellished with parallel storylines taken from the life of our hero (Haralambides, lest we forget) or nowhere in particular (as if anyone cares).
For years, Cannibal Terror was believed by many to be the work of horror/sleaze director Jess Franco, a reasonable assumption since the film bears what seem to be most of the prolific Spaniard's hallmarks, most notably a dreadful script, unconvincing locales, inept direction, terrible acting, and endless meandering shots of nothing much in particular (and I guess, for some, it was also hard to believe that there might be another person out there who could make films quite as bad as Franco).
I've personally never really enjoyed those whole day-in-the-life-of/intertwining stories films that are so popular anymore, and this one in particular didn't really appeal to me based solely upon that said type of plot line alone.
Not too much to recommend but it's not horrible, so it's the type of film to watch when you're bored and feel like an oater, but not something worth seeking out or re-watching in particular.
Posing as a representative from a farming company needing to fill tractor orders, he gains the trust of the town and in particular, a woman (Melissa Gilbert) and her young daughter who buys his story, trusts him, and then, along with the whole town, shuns him when they find out that he might be cutting their job.
One thing in particular annoyed me: Cancer man in the "past-life".
Edward Van Sloan as Van Helsing has the unenviable task of slogging through lumps of dialogue about the vampire mythos and Dracula in particular, convincing the other characters with very little effort that Dracula can transform himself into a bat and a wolf.
When they acted like they were together it wasn't believable, Baldwin particularly seeming the most uncomfortable out of the two.
The production design by Carlo Simi is very good especially the interiors and the saloon in particular.
Imagine a fantasy movie that's set in a mediaevel European wood but was in fact shot, by an admittedly skilled cameraman, in a municipal park - there's nothing in particular to give the game away, but you can sense that most of the creative effort has gone towards hiding something.
The dialogue was weak and, in particular, the special effects were disappointing for this day and age.
The characters, Hugh Jackman's in particular, seem unrounded and without any kind of back story - seemingly plopped into the middle of an obsessive pursuit without any explanation as to where said obsessions may have originated.
Good music gets lost amid individual sketches occurring in a old RAF base, a field, a strip-club, and nowhere in particular.
Gort in particular is a computer generated monstrosity that looks like he's been imported straight from a Nintendo 64 game.
This one in particular is bad because it is an endless cycle of quick edits of a hellish experience.
And this film in particular shows a side of the American psyche which is all too often neglected and unacknowledged in movies.
Beswicke, in particular, is the most darkly beautiful actress I have ever seen, and I could not keep my eyes off her whenever she was in a scene.
Lockwood, in particular, just can't seem to get with the program - half of the time, he doesn't seem to know what to do with his arms.
Nielsen and Lockwood are actually in pretty good shape for older male actors from that era, and Nielsen in particular is pretty buff with his shirt off - but they aren't fighters and they look silly and stiff trying to mix it up with the bad guys and with each other.
As is often the case with this type of movie, and especially the ninja genre in particular, much of the enjoyment to be derived from them is from the unintentional laughs to be gleaned from the on screen antics.
The supporting players outperform the leads; in particular, Shepperd Strudwick (as Jerry Banning) and Paul Kelly (as Dusty Rhodes).
It addresses both the important role stories, in particular film, have on providing an escape for real-life and the danger of becoming so wrapped up in fiction that it is hard to face reality.
Baxter's ignorance to the real world gives way to some hilarious scenes, in particular when a whore unknowingly leads him to a brothel.
Neither good or evil, a story about a time and a place and a people ends up being a movie about nothing in particular and no one of any interest.
What a wonderful film this could have been about Savannah culture and society in general, and Mr. Williams in particular, as played out against the backdrop of the Georgia legal system.
The rest is just padding, in particular the Macarena scenes of which there are too many and they are too long.
Unfortunately, where Aliens in particular excelled was that it managed to give every character a third dimension.
Nicole Kidman, to whom the role was first offered, would surely have been better, in particular, she's displayed flawless English accents in films such as The Others and The Hours.
Vince Vaughn's character, Gary, in particular, was horribly annoying whenever Aniston's character, Brooke, was around, and, while Brooke was at least likable, many of her actions seemed mean and reprehensible.
In fact, take away most of Vaughn's dialogue and some scenes involving characters talk about nothing in particular and the film would be pornography.
However, someone must have really had it out for Ameche, as in addition to saddling him the with Ritz Brothers, many of the songs they gave him to sing (in particular the first one) were simply awful.
Additionally, young Carson's family members, equally moronic fellow students, and school staff are seldom well-drawn, the only characters of abiding interest being Sharon (Tracey Mann), a new teacher at the high school and, in particular, "Redback" (Steve Bisley), owner of a junkyard for motorcycles, who gives Steve an opportunity to learn a trade (welding) and also to restore a wrecked motorcycle, thereby opening a way for the boy to flee from an uncivil environment.
It seems likely that the only thing getting 'The Breed' off the shelves is the lure of it's young cast, and in particular, its co-stars Michelle Rodgriguez and Oliver Reed.
Some of the contestants have been good, and one in particular has been fantastic: the 11-year-old Bianca Ryan (I think that's her name - we'll be hearing it again, undeniably), who belted out And I'm Telling You like nobody's business.
Aretha Franklin's lip-syncing in particular was horrible.
The original film, in particular, suffers.
His interior filming in particular is a lesson in cinematography.
The last 20 minutes in particular are devastatingly emotional and provide the needed payoff for the slow beginning.
I guess it will be understand and loved more by people who like realistic movies in general and socially engaged movies in particular.
Seeing Matt in particular struggle with his unwanted hero status and seeing his friends grow up, move away or die is really something to see.
Lombard in particular deserves a decent biopic, as her timeless, iconoclastic qualities still resonate today.
Eisenstein in particular is good for this approach because one thing that ties music and imagery together well is rhythmic editing, something he is famous for in the first place and also something that he had previously successfully used to create sound-like impressions in completely silent films (like, for instance, quick cutting between a machine gun and its firer to represent the sound of the machine gun unloading).
I noticed that as the show came to an end, that 3 episode in particular seemed as attempted spin-off pilots for some of the cast.
The cast is outstanding, the children in particular, Kate Maberly as Mary Lennox above all.
Fortunately all are up to the task and the film, the final scene in particular, results in a brilliant piece of motion picture art.
His speeches are actually very nicely done and the one he gives on the nature of mortal religion is in particular very thought-provoking (and almost sure to offend those with strict Christian sensibilities).
The opening of the coffin floating in the water and the black servant dragging the coffin actually rather reminds me of the German expressionist period and the film NOSFERATU (1922) in particular.
Her observations on life, politics and celebrity culture in particular are always dead on, witty and ultimately thought-provoking.
Its study of relationships, and one relationship in particular, manages to cover some pretty far-reaching ground and comes complete with a lot of different sorts of content; but the film always keeps its eye on how these instances, and the nature of the relationship, shape the persons engaging.
One scene in particular is worth looking at again and again.
Ultimately this eruption cost fifty nine lives, but two of these in particular provided the media with ongoing human interest stories and later provided the core story for this movie.
Shot wholly on location by the estimable Carl Guthrie this a tight ,taut movie that moves with pace and efficiency .The acting is excellent with special praise to MacRae ,John Russell as an educated drifter turned soldier Travis ,who becomes a confidante to Vinson ,Forrest Tucker as Irish born trooper McGurney (the role Andrew McClaglen usually played in John Ford pictures)and Anthony Caruso as the Native scout Pawnee .McRae in particular shows us that he could play morally complex and driven characters every bit as well as did James Stewart in his movies for Anthony Mann .Vinson is an angry and bitter man ,qualities the actor brings out well Joseph M Newman directs briskly and stages some lively action sequences in what is a predictable but highly entertaining minor Western
He encounters a sullen police detective Emily Sanders (Charlize Theron) who appears bruised by life in general and by her prejudiced co-workers and military men in particular.
This movie is about no war in particular -- every war in general.
James Berardinelli, in particular, seems curiously _angry_ that this film depicts the moral degradation of war in a frank and honest fashion.
However this isn't the true problem because nobody seems to care for Harry in particular.
This story in particular showcases why keeping abortion safe and legal is so very necessary.
Surprisingly, there are also a few touches of humour (two incidents in particular involving passengers in cars), which serve to break up some a monotony which could develop around what is a very bleak picture.
One scene in particular, when she finally meets the family of her fallen friend, is a showcase for what an extraordinary actress she is.
A series of brutal and bizarre killings takes place.When Mara witnesses one of the murders the black-gloved killer starts terrorizing her-she turns to her boyfriend Lukas for assistance.But will he be able to uncover the culprit before his girlfriend becomes the next victim?Antonio Bido's "Watch Me When I Kill" is an enjoyable giallo,albeit heavily influenced by Dario Argento's works,especially "Deep Red".The film is an above-average effort filled with enough suspense and shocks to satisfy fans of Italian horror.Surprisingly effective murder scenes are another reason to check this film out-in particular,the muder of Fernando Cerulli in a bathtub,set to opera music,would make Dario Argento proud.The performances are pretty good and it's nice to see Fulci's veteran Paolo Malco in one of the main roles.8 out of 10.
At the same time that the movie is entertaining, it is educational -- in particular, the interviews of Clinton and Dole.
Pretty interesting look behind the curtain of the world of crosswords ... in particular the New York Times crossword editor, Will Shortz.
I was impressed with the production design credited to Elliot Scott & the sets in particular, some of the Atlantis cityscapes were obviously just flat matte paintings but they looked good overall, from the dungeons to the higher cities which have a palatial feel to them & as a whole Warlords of Atlantis is quite a handsome film to watch.
This really was a strange little Movie.The Musicians in particular had a great time playing (or miming as happens in Film) up on "Sally Gap" in Wicklow in Ireland in November where it was at least 8 degrees below and the cast and crew were up there for 12 hours at the wedding scene.It really was freezing.I played Bodhran (Irish Drum) and i had to put my hand in hot water because it was frozen to the stick which plays the instrument.But for the fun value we had making that movie deserves 9/10.We filmed the pub scenes in Ardmore Studios which was a much warmer affair.Maybe i'm wrong but i seem to remember a day being taken off when Malosovich was captured due to Goran our Director being an immigrant Serb.
Sure I have my favourite scenes, one in particular, which make me laugh just thinking about them.
But in the end this plot goes nowhere in particular.
Danny Aiello in particular does a great job in the central role, bringing out the strengths and weakness in the character and never crossing the line to histrionics.
John Guillerman's briskly efficient direction keeps the rousing zesty momentum humming along throughout, the action scenes are suitably rough, strenuous, exciting and dynamically staged (the stick fights in particular are the genuine happening article), there's a welcome sense of wryly self-deprecating humor (a male assassin in drag tries to plug Shaft in an airport bathroom!
Boothe and Foster are both terrific and virtually everyone else is an authentic-looking non-actor (Polonah in particular, as Wanadi, the Chief of the Invisible People and Tommy's surrogate father, is superb).
This film is not easy viewing and features certain things that go over and above what I'd call 'bad taste' - a sex scene between a man and an eleven year old girl stands out in particular.
There are some truly mesmerizing moments here; badgers mucking about, a lynx chasing the fox through a snow-littered forest; one scene in particular when the fox is being tormented by a pack of wolves is quite intense and even frightening at times.
its simple telling of a child's love for nature and in particular a fox is told well.
It's movies like this -- cheap and devoid of any real effort to uphold the horror legacy, but which get cherry spots on Blockbuster shelves because they're packaged with slick cover art -- that give horror movies in general (and zombie movies in particular) a bad name, and that make horror fans so wary.
Randal, in particular, steals every scene with his existential musings ("I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class.
No one in particular wins and the movie you see depends a lot on how you see the world.
But "Private Eyes" is better than you might expect; the setting (Biltmore Castle) is beautiful, the supporting cast (Fox in particular) is hilarious and a lot, if not all, of the gags are priceless.
One boy in particular, Kaspar Weiss, is considered a child prodigy.
One scene in particular the violin changes hands several times yet it remains in the same part of the frame with each person.
This show in particular shows what can be done in cinema but not in writing--very, very unique.
That she can even participate in such a dead-on send up of her industry in general and her self and her family in particular earns her great, noisy props!
Clutch, however, is more concerned about trying to create a welcome home party for his daughter while Kay in particular seems more concerned about trying to capture the attention of Clutch himself.
Like something blended from a video game universe (Bioshock in particular) and 12 Monkeys' post-apocalyptic subterranean sewer-world (or even Terminator's hypogeal bomb shelters), City of Ember packs adventure and intrigue into the wondrous exploration of a society crumbling from age and deceit.
Lee goes further from his "Brokeback Mountain" to enhance the degree of explicitness by bringing the leads' body/pubic hairs, Wang's underarm hairs in a close-up in particular, into mise-en-scene to connote the rawness and liberation of the couple's desires.
Every single one of them was having a blast, maybe Paul in particular because finally the others had caught up to him and were making the contributions to the effort for which he had been waiting.
Some folks might not have cared for all the phone conversations, but one in particular (here be spoilers) when Flynn has to make two dates for the same night without them overlapping is hysterical.
Director Bill Melendez and Phil Roman, working from a very warm and witty script by Charles M. Schulz, expertly craft a sensationally breezy and snappy 25-minute cartoon romp that brims over with engaging characters (Linus in particular really shines as he explains the historical significance of Thanksgiving in fascinatingly thorough detail), deliciously dry humor, and a spot-on relevant message about the true meaning of Thanksgiving (it's all about friends and family instead of food).
This is one of David Lean's early films, and there is one scene in particular that reminded me of his last - "A Passage to India".
One song in particular is a bit overdone but, all in all this is a nice romantic film.
Mary Page Keller in particular was magnificent to help make up for a wooden Matthew Laurance as the other lead.
