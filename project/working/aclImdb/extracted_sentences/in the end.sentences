It all depends on whether in the end, when we see the three murders again, this is what actually happened (which would be awfully contrived and pretty bad) or whether it's another one of Ishaan's stories, made up to save himself and the other two prisoners (which would be a very interesting twist).

It's a classic boy meets girl movie with that dash of "damsel in distress but is now hardened and tough due to life being so rough and who now finally meets a man who breaks through it all and understands and loves her for who she is" - as far as romantic comedies go- it was better then I thought it would be and even gets the heart strings welling when Ed Harris tells her "this could hurt"...The story itself can be at times almost childish, but in the end that's part of it's charm.

What is unfortunate about this movie is that it is, in the end, irresponsible propaganda to make light of the most disastrous thing happening to Americans today- they are losing their jobs because politicians have been bribed to look the other way or worse create new legislation that makes it easier for scumbag corporations to live in America, manufacture outside of it, and still charge similar prices as if it was produced by American labor, and they destroy local economies in the process by removing all wealth from the community via offshoring their jobs to India or china.

The story has been remade so many times very few people know of the original, and the best, in fact I had not even heard of it until I found a copy in my dads huge collection of old video tapes, and I decided I might as well watch it, what else to do, in the end it ended up being one of the best films I had everseen.

(Anyway, I may too pessimistic for this scene because in the end Eddie and Molly can get along well.)

The brutal massacre in the end kills almost everybody, after building in us pure hope, not through melodramatics (no rape scenes or male nudity for example), but through hard realism.

Given the typically British austerity of the film, an illfocused and bleak story, an almost complete absence of passion, and what are by film standards rather sublunary events with no payoff in the end, this flick was barely tolerable.
It also turns out to have much more weight than just a comic device: Donahue survives in prison as well as he does, and it brings about the profound changes of character--Donahue becomes much more authentic, realizes his potential, gains material for his art and even gets the girl--because of his continued misprision (in the Bloom sense) about life outside of New York City, and in the end, it enables a "return to the market", as they say in Zen Buddhism.
And since that isn't the plot point that the movie hinges on, it doesn't feel like it matters in the end.

I had trouble deciding if this was great acting or just a good impersonation, and in the end decided it didn't matter, for the material in Lenny seemed to capture the real Lenny Bruce.
I wanted Narnia to come alive on screen like it did in my mind and I think it fell a little short of my expectations but in the end made me smile.
NARNIA is a fascinating example of a film that doesn't exactly add up but in the end is satisfying.
As I have said previously French films can either be very good or like this one where the director seems more concerned with an esoteric format to produce what is in the end nothing.The film starts with potential but degenerates into a series of angst that the main character is attempting to resolve.This leads to a very disjointed movie where nothing of consequence happens and the viewer is left to employ some form of rational to begin to understand the story line.
As difficult as it is to watch, turn off the phone, dim the lights, and immerse yourself in the film with ones you love - you will be a better person for it in the end.

Perhaps in the end, it was the humor that let Bunuel alive, while its absence killed Pasolini.

In the end we have that this actually was the story of the son of Akira, who actually saw how both of his parents were killed, having in the end gratitude with the gunman and later finding his own way to Italy (a really memorable and even hilarious final detail of the film).
Expect mass casualties along the lines of a Greek tragedy in the end.
So in the end I'd say that the film is pretty graceful - gracefully written, acted, shot, though out - from the beginning to "Billy, you got what you deserved", and after that it turns into something else, another type of movie which we could call "the-plot-twist-contest-kind-of-movie".
Bonny doesn't understand this kind of us-selfish love till it is almost too late and then in the end, finally she figures it out.
That Martin Scorsese, a director who has amply shown his calibre in such films as `The Last Temptation of Christ', `The Color of The Money' and `Taxi Driver' among his best titles, should try his hand at an involuted regentist victorianism so abhorred by Europeans for at least 75 years, is more than surprising and turns out in the end to be even irritating.
Also, was Janis dead in the end as she was put into the ambulance?
All the plot tied together in the end.
The younger sisters opposition and departure from her sister is in the end pointless because she tries to fight the war of a whole culture trying to adapt in a new world.
The scene in which the white boyfriend tells jokes that has the family roaring with laughter but then suddenly frigid when one joke goes too far is highly symptomatic of the confusing problems behind the race issue: namely, that there are identifiable differences culturally between (most) blacks and (most) whites, but that some differences are more sensitive (on both sides), and that, in the end, we all wish they would go away.
Yet in the end, when Bernie got what he originally wanted, he discovered it was no longer so as he learned how much Simon/Kutcher really loved his daughter and that Simon indeed had principles even if he didn't play sports...

However, despite these pros Rice Rhapsody in the end culminates in a flat, unremarkable experience that won't stay with you very long, unlike other products in its range, like excellently emotional Yi Yi (2000).
There were probably many ways the show could have been made, but in the end, its writer chose a very straightforward tale which tries to cram as many Doctors, companions, concepts, monsters and enemies into the same story and, like I said earlier, it succeeds in part.
Although in the end it's a bit simplistic it does have an undeniable poetry in it that is in the league of the director's finest work.

Episodic and without much real plot - the only real forward motion in the film is to be found in the ending, which feels a little contrived, and is my only real gripe with this film.
Though it starts out intriguingly, in the end this espionage film is rather much ado about nothing.
Much like the mini "Pride and Prejudice", all the plot lines sweep to a happy, clean and simple denouement in the end, but the ride is sure-footed with many interesting characters to bewitch and fascinate along the way and a suspenseful drama to hold interest.
Yet this film is not flawless, it was good entertainment over all, yes and it was very good in the beginning and in the end, but in the middle when Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio) loses it, so does the film and that is a shame.

Richard Todd's performance in the end makes this film more special.
The film goes on too long and I didn't like the sanctimonious message in the end especially when the director's commentary on the DVD confirmed that he was trying to show the futility of violence.
See how the master manages to introduce his characters to us, and in the end we almost become friends with them.
But in the end, a very nice movie you'll have to see!
The best drama movie of 2006, so sincere, real, intense, inspiring but at the same time challenging you to participate in the movie, you are being dragged into the movie, in the end it will not only bring happiness to your face and heart, but it will also make you a better person or at least highlight the great parts you have in your character.

And in the end, after you watch it, you really will wonder if thats a possum or gremlin in the vent ;)
First I found the love that Connor had for Jenny Perotti to be unbelievable and unable to convince us that Connor would actually repent in the end.

'The Descent' managed to show the monster's faces and they were pretty ugly.In this movie, You can only see their whole face either near the end of the middle or in the end.I must admit that I had some fun with this movie.I will plan on seeing the sequels even though they did not get as good reviews as this one.
The spoiler if there could be one is that while a dichotomy grew up as a discussion about "Positive vs Negative Freedom" the discussion was one sided and delusional, and in the end based on the mathematics of the brilliant but paranoid schizophrenic John Nash, whose beautiful arithmetic had only one flaw, it only worked if everyone was at least as much a brilliant paranoid schizophrenic as he was.
but in the end i did enjoy it & say anyone going into it with a open mind may so as well.

It's also true that in the end the movie is just a bit too supernatural, which goes at the expenses of the credibility of the movie and story.
One of them, Dakota, not only wasn't whom he wanted to do a job on, by torturing and leaving her to die, but that in the end she would be the one who does a job on him!
That major mistake on his part in the end was what not only tripped The Man in Blue up but caused the confused psycho to expose himself where he ended up getting run through by a hysterical and wildcat-like Dakota Moss!
As a result it was touching and funny and wholly absorbing, and in the end extremely moving.
being a jerk who gets into fights, ignores his friends and doesn't do anything at school will help you turn your summer crush into a smoking cool girl who ends up with you in the end despite all the times you tried to get into her panties?

Nevertheless, just like many other recent flicks out there with a twist in the end, 'Danika' turned out to be ambiguous for no reason and it tries to deceive the audience and doubt about their own intelligence.
But in the end, Sunset Boulevard stands out, as one of the finest examples of the frenzied circus of obsession, fixation, and greed that is oftentimes symbolizes Hollywood.
There are also several events that really didn't happen in the book that they put into the movie (but some of them would ruin the end so I won't say incase any pain seekers actually want to see it).
Playing the story straight, as they did with "The Hobbit," the R/B team set out to take all the best elements from Return of the King and begin the film in flashback, with Bilbo's 129th birthday party, as he, Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Gandalf and Elrond look back at the good times and excellent adventures that culminated in the end of the Third Age of Middle-earth ..... and with it, in Gandalf's words, "the beginning of the New Age of Man."
I suppose the original novel must be to blame for this; the black maid character is very poorly developed in both films (so I assume it was the same in the novel), and, in the end, they both lack focus.
We laught/cried in the end, we had rented it for some money, and, well...

They will just think you are paranoid and put you in an asylum, even if it turns out in the end that you were right all along.
But in the end, it would be Gabe who would give his life to destroy the cell, thereby becoming a hero and doing his 'civic duty.'

And in the end where there is gonna be a showdown between Mortensen and Irons, it's over before you even noticed what happened.
This is extremely outrageously boring and dumb movie, what in earth did encourage Ed Harris make this movie, he thought he can make something like 'Unforgiven' plus 'Hondo' and he obviously got his head too much into some stuff that aren't important in western and in the end he made this pile of junk.
It was momentarily amusing to see Jeffrey Combs (he of the unusual but entertaining performances in REANIMATOR and FROM BEYOND), but in the end, he was pretty darn bad.

Then he takes on a sumo wrestler and in the end serves grenade-filled icecreams to, as he puts it, 'Japs, hundreds of them!'.

Not really taking sides, the movie in the end shows Adam's girlfriend Dana (Dominique Gonzalez) explaining why she had to abort the baby: "ÂI panicked when I found out I was pregnant.
If they both died, that means someone just took a complete stab in the dark at what probably happened out there while they were missing, which in the end really made me mad, because that is also what I predicted was going to happen, and if they both didn't die in the "true events", I think it was a poor choice making them both die in this movie.
Although, at times the movie was annoying, all the minor slights were forgiven in the end.
Once again, Kelly's parents aren't given subplots nor are they developed and fleshed out, so they're simply plot devices in the end.
This film is sooo clichÃ© and so predictable, I could even speak some dialogues in advance, its the same for the jokes,they are so lame...I couldn't connect to the characters and feel sad or touched....all together this movie just got on my nerves...even if it got a bit better in the end..
This tries too hard to be a quirky romantic comedy, but in the end leaves you with just a slightly dirty, creepy feeling about the main character.
This is, unfortunately, simply a Til Schweiger (popular German heartthrob) delivery medium -- the story was written so that he wouldn't have to step outside of the same role he always plays: a smirky, semi-jerk who, in the end, proves he really does have a heart if everyone will just give him a (2nd) chance to show it.
But hey in the end the guy meets a groovy chick and they go to san Francisco and probably live happily ever after in a camper van.

So in the end, "Sisters of Death" gets 3 dead sorority girls, out of 10.
As many other stories of science fiction this saga begins with one prophecy of one warrior who will kill the ultimate evil who destroys his world, then all the classic elements are changed just to put a bunch of laments characters commanding a big space ship of an ancient insect race who manifest in the end of the fourth movie with the form of a human(at least the face).
The entire cast are all very ordinary and uninspiring which results in a potentially fascinating and aggravating true story (although claimed to be fictitious in the end credits) becoming an uninteresting drag.
The real tragedy here is that despite the young woman and her unborn child who were viciously murdered, we're subjected to being asked to sympathize with this vacuous, promiscuous, uninteresting woman, who in the end profited far more from this whole gruesome chain of events than anyone else involved - and far more than she would ever have realized, otherwise, from her limited qualities and talents.
The last third of the movie isn't too bad though, delivering some decent suspense scenes, though there is probably one "twist" too many in the end.
I don't believe "Raintree County" was meant to make a statement - they didn't even allow the actors to see the rain-tree in the end !!

The flashback was a minor spark in the end.
I rate this a two, because I know some of the actors' are better then the material, and there are a couple decent kill scenes in the end, though nothing special.
Okay, it's nothing a friend should do to cheat on his best friend with his wife - but hey, feelings sometimes make us do things that are not really clever, but still that's what feelings are there for in a way... and since it always takes two persons to cheat on a third one, I really could not understand what this movie wanted to express in the end.
Overall, it was probably too late to scrap that one but I strongly suspect the only reason it got made in the end is because of many people who are fans of the writer and his work.
The actors seem to put enough effort and energy into their parts, but it just doesn't come across in the end.
Creepers, in the end, however, just doesn't live up to the standard set by it's predecessor.

The film is no doubt going for some form of quirkiness, but it is also clear that they are going for a serious meaningful angel as well - and neither works in the end.
Our heroine triumphs in the end writing her own best seller exposing the exploits of another best selling novelist that co-incidentally lived in the same hotel before she arrived.
And if Tong Po REALLY killed Kurt (which he didn't, as I said, this film didn't happen), just bashing him up in the end is not getting revenge.
Sam had no brilliant, save-the-day ideas and in the end, she baked cookies and kissed Cam on the cheek.

I wont tell anybody what it's about but I can tell you this: It's the typicall thriller that tries to make you believe that everybody could be a potential killer and in the end they come up with something totally predicable.Just rubbish, so please someone tell me why, the rating of six.

It's a pity this movie is practically unknown, 'cause it would be a serious contender to reach the top of one of those "worst movie" lists...

The movie tries to pull off the fact that he has a good heart in the end which pulls the movie up a little bit but not enough for me to recommend it.
While the movie "Inside" at least had suspense in the first half of the film, in the end , the movie Broken is just another excuse to show how much the human body can take getting ripped apart and how much an audience can stomach it.
This movie is one of those movies that we heard in jokes, it's so bad that in the end is funny.
But of course this bit of exposition sure does pay off in the end when the kidnappers take off with family in tow.
No, all our heroes do in the end is nuke the artifact.

Then in the end of the movie the whole thing becomes clear after one or two plot twists.
Well, as you can guess, all things work out in the end and we get to hear one of the silly songs(there are about 4 songs in the movie and all are pretty silly) to close out the movie.
There are extra, pretty useless characters, like the drunk brother that waste the viewers time and don't really pay off in the end.
It kept you thinking and guessing at what was really going on, and in the end, all the holes close.

It got a little of everything, but it is nothing in the end.
As in real life, Eddie screws and gets screwed, but in the end I think you will cheer for him.
Ritchie could not handle this film and in the end The Survivors is probably a film that neither Williams or Matthau wants to remember.
So in the end I don't really recommend this film in any circumstance except that you may just be looking for mindless filler for 80 minutes.
First the characters, there's the moody, unshaven hero with personal demons to exorcise but turns out be be a throughly decent chap in the end, the clean cut hero, the computer whizz, the tough female character, the token nobody who is there to die & nothing else just so something happens & the character who has other more mysterious motives for being on the Island.

Then in the end, she refuses to allow the child to continue her education on scholarship at a private school.

Most movies either result in the end with something either being gained, or else something being lost.

This had little plot, and was your standard romantic comedy, with an EXTREMELY predictable triumphant "get back together" in the end...

I didn't like them, I couldn't find them sympathetic, I couldn't relate to anyone, I couldn't understand why they loved each other so much, and in the end I couldn't help but feel that none of them deserved the luck they had (which was a lot in some cases).
While the premise of the story appears to be warm coming of age of a young girl with only a single mother to guide her growth, the film fragments with so many subplots that are quickly and incautiously pasted together in the end, resolving everything in a shallow overly sentimental and unsatisfying mess.
The initial conflict is somewhat interesting and even intriguing (a huge corporation controlling 90 percent of the Earth and a bunch of free-thinking teenagers opposed to it - plus some mysterious Darkside planning some 'renewal'), but it leads to nowhere: the protagonists talk a lot, but in the end you get none explanation.

Furthermore part of the success of the novel is it left so many questions in the end unresolved.
It has some scary moments but in the end it doesnÂ´t mesure up to a total for a good "scary-movie".
Though that still doesn't begin to explain the end result.
But...   Usually in a movie like this, the multi-linear loose ends will cleverly tie together in the end showing why these particular characters were being followed.
Usually in my reviews I try to say something like: 'this movie isn't recommended for people who don't like slow-developing plots' or 'it's not for people who want the plot wrapped up neatly in the end'.
Finally, in the end, Jack gets his journal back, threatens to call the cops (duh), takes back the wife who's cuckolded him, and quits his business so he can now live life again (something that would have been forced upon him had Ling published her story).
The story is actually about a man who plays the game with many mafia-type gangs and ends up being the top honcho in the end.

That in the end the only way to keep some of the universe's life-forms from racing to a celebration of war as depicted in other films such as "Wood Stock" and "Schindler's List" was to electronically engage and control the minds and movements of those who chase a special moment based on the destruction of others.
The difference in the end was the sausage and the workers.
She's lost a good man, friends (I doubt she'll be seeing much of Fritz after the wedding), and in the end her career is in the same spot it was when the movie began.
But in the end, all you wind with is a terrible film that has no meaning or substance.
The actors are very good.I never cared much for Liza Minelli before but in this film she gives the perfect performance.Being very believable as Sally,who goes through so many things but still,in the end,decides to continue like before.
And of course, director of this genre must understand that retro films are stylized genre in the end, because naive admiration of the past may easily turn into a conservative, nationalistic political manifesto(Really the campaign for this film's domestic sales,including DVD release, gradually have got such nuance, saying "We are happy to have been born in Japan"!).
I put a question mark after spoiler alert because the fact that they off themselves in the end wasn't particularly shocking.
Holmes, in the end, is able to figure out what exactly happened, although it does not please his client.
I appreciate when some movies wait to fully explain things in the end, but this movie makes one feel like an explanation is coming at some point -- yet it never comes.
It comes from nowhere and goes nowhere, and adds nothing to the movie except provides a spot to slide in the ending, which leaves you with the feeling that the writer was hit by a truck or they ran out of money or just lost interest.
Unfortunately that was destroyed in the end by incompetent writers.
Thats it thats all there is to it in the end.
Gus van Sant's "Elephant" tops the board in its classic understatement, and weaves disparate strands together in the end.
The way Makoto was thinking after Chiaki made his confession was very irrational and stupid... and she never really sat down to think and just leaped through time whenever she felt like it, even if in the end she leaped for Chiaki... it just feels like the characters never learned anything fundamental.
You meet your sweetheart in heaven in the end?
Heidi Lenhart is tolerable in her role as the knuckle-headed fish out of water, but only wins in the end because the writers (I assume there were writers) penciled in a happy ending.
And last, but certainly not least, the main character...the one that comes in thinking they have no problem, but in the end realizes and works to get better and tries and usually ends up making an impact on some of the people there.
The music held my attention-sort of swung along...I was glad to see Arthur swing in the end also:-)I'm probably not a Hoskins fan.He always seems to try to hard.
Second, when Gooding gets out of his car in the end after quitting the asylum, he climbs out of the car and with more sappy music swelling does the Tim Robbins Shawshank-escape Jesus pose in the driving rain... unbelievable syrupy tripe.
American teens prevail in the end against the entire soviet army, who have popped into existence in the heart of middle America, by means known only to John Milius.
They are certainly the highlight of this movie which in the end seemed to spend most of their time making that trailer and such which goes to show you can bring in some money even with a rather weak movie, if you know how to advertise.
He finally gets it right in the end to place them apart from each other.
I tried to take all this into account, and all these mitigating elements help a little, but in the end, "Double Team" is obviously the Beginning Of The End.
I already forgot how the bad guys were stopped in the end.
They will thank you for it in the end...I promise!!
Then, in the end, it's all taken away.

There is a neat twist almost half way through that cannot be described without spoiling the central premise, the only truly interesting part in the film, but in the end nothing remotely remarkable is done with it.

Ultimately in the end not worth the effort or your precious time.What still amazes me though, is how in hell did IMDb give this movie a 7 out of 10??
I saw the promos i was interested especially the first promo but the last few promos gave away and i hoped the film won't be as bad but the film is worst  Abbas-Mustan tried to make a commercial potboiler instead just to appeal to the masses who like such nonsense films  The film starts off okay, 2 songs at the start itself and then slowly each characters are introduced but then the film gets boring because All characters are jerks  Paresh Rawal- Johny scenes are stupid and too loud and crass Shahid- Kareena scenes are worthless and boring They is little hope when Isha is murdered but the director is too involved with comedy, romance and nothing makes sense in the end  The Johny- Tanaaz finding a dead body in the briefcase is too childish and then the entire investigating scenes are not that great  But the end takes the cake, one of the worst climaxes ever Even the CID episodes have better culmination  Abbas-Mustan give their worst ever film Music is good  Shahid and Kareena who were a pair that time are truly wasted Shahid just keeps making big eyes trying to look funny and make weird noises while Kareena irritates Akshaye imitates his dad Vinod Khanna at places and is the only actor worth mentioning here Tanaaz and Johny overact Paresh Rawal overacts too while Payal Rohatgi and Isha are dismissal Upen Patel with a dubbed voice is painful rest are poor
"Produced in association with Sci-Fi Pictures" appears prominently in the end credits, and it certainly explains the dreky parts of the movie.

It does not take much effort to figure out what happens in the end.
I went to this film because it was advertised as being in the "Bend It Like Beckham" vein, which was not only a misleading come-on, but in the end also a film as ineffective as the real Beckham in the recent World Cup.
The series had gotten steadily worse, but in the end they were watchable.
The 2 actual cenobites include that annoying chatterer wannabe(in the ending of the movie he has a neat toy though),and the guy whos has a black cloth on his eyes and mouth(any help on which movie this guy is from?).
I think the woman that turned out to be a man in the end was a parody of a movie directed by the director of Plan 9 From Outer Space, and I knew the three stooges.
My brother convinced me to sit and watch moving target and in the end i was pleased i did.It wasn't the god awful acting or the laughable dialogue that brought a smile to my face it was the fact that this movie was basically a remake of an earlier film of wilsons.By changing a few names,filming in a new location (uk) and mixing around a few scenarios they tried to pass this one off as a fresh idea.If you have seen bloodfist4-die trying there is no need to waste 90 minutes on this movie because if you've seen die trying your watching the same story...same ending... same man...just on a different continent,the only reason i kept watching was the constant laughter prevented me from being able to reach for the remote

They all die in the end but, as I said before, I really didn't care.

Bastard Boys should have been about how the workers, the unions AND Patrick's did the wrong thing, and how after all this fuss it was worked out in the end.
But in the end, the complete product shows a disrespect towards the audience, a hatred for its own characters and story lines except a few precious upper-class New Yorkers, like I've never seen it before.
The movie makes them out to be magical, which perhaps is a popular shorthand used in African discourse...but in the end fails to "take us backstage" as a way of demystifying African discourse.
It turned out to be a cheap trick that in the end made the movie a cheap exploitation rather than the gruesome thriller it could have been.
The main problems arise in the tediousness of a whodunit that's all too obvious in the end.

I really don't like the changes that the production made to the book, specially in the end of the movie.
There were ten survivors in the end not six.
It may sound disappointing, but this movie is a joke, it's no more than a teenage sex fantasy film, trying to have a "moral message in the background", but fails to afford one in the end.
The problem with the main event is that there is a tradition with Wrestlemania where the good guys win in the end.
The plot meanders on, the acting is wooden, and in the end you don't know if there was a story there at all.
So, in the end, it works best as a so-bad-it's-still-bad-but-uproarious treat for those who gorge on works that slip by in pop culture that are so sapped with the vigor of commercialism that to read through the mixed messages would take a pot of coffee and a fine-toothed comb.
There are many ways to interpret this story and almost all of them begin in the ending moments.
While he allows her to get pregnant by another man, Sir Clifford insists that the man with whom she copulates be someone he approves of, though in the end she never reveals to him who her true lover is.

Still though, in the end it boils down to a fight between Van Dame and the bad guy, in the rain.
We have: 1) The authority: a mean and not-so-cold-hearted school principal, who pretends to be to tough to care but in the end proves that deep down she has feelings and all.
Boomer kept sabotaging stuff for 3 seasons but was redeemed in the end.
Instead of fixing the glaring problems of the previous seasons, they introduced new ones, contradicting a lot of stuff, and creating whole story lines -the aforementioned "final five", for example- that in the end turned out to be just a big red herring.
"12 angry men" was really a disappointment for a guy like me who waited for 1 hour to watch a story in the film...but after an hour i have realized that how wrong i was to download such a film..i was so much desperate to watch dis flick and in the end it disappointed very much.
11 were in the favor of GUILTY for the kid, while one was saying the kid on whom the blame was to kill his father was NOT GUILTY and after more than 1 hour of distracting and boring discussion the alone juror who feels the kid was not guilty was successful in changing the mind of other 11 jurors and in the end saved the life of the kid.
The plot leads us to an interesting, but non-surprising twist in the end which leaves the audience questioning elements about Aaron's wife and her actions.
Grades: Acting: D- (This would be an F but Jeff Thomas does a decent job as the lead) Suspense: C- Sometimes this movie was too slow sometimes it was too fast Gore: B- This was the best part Story: C It sucked at first but revealed a lot in the end Characters: D You had no clue who was a main character or if they were dead Overall: C- had the potential to be good but nothing was explained well Do not buy this movie!
There is no real suspense or humor, and in the end you are just glad it's over.
And this happy end where everyone forgives everyone and all is good in the end, right?
Although the beginning was cogent and mood-setting, I was disappointed by the lack of subtlety in the ending, which differed from the Christie ending.
And to make it powerful in the end there's the whole dramatic separated lovers story.
Anyways in the end Drew's publicist finds out about the project and probably said to her, "Look Drew, you're gonna seem like a huge bitch if you don't meet up with this guy," so they get together for an awkward 20 minute lunch.
So, when I see him, I know not to care much about him or I'll just have my heart broken in the end!!
It stretched the story to have HIM kill the teacher character in the end.
I know that deep down nobody won in the end;the losers were the British viewing public,and the producers who most probably spent several million pounds on this amazingly pointless drivel,which could have been better used on genuinely talented actors,writers and directors,making worthwhile programmes.Now that it's cancelled,will TV bosses spend similar amounts on the former,or more "reality" shows?
And finally in the end when he is gored by a bull in the ring it is the forgiving Carmen, his only true love, that comes to his side to comfort him as he lays dying.
I wouldn't be surprised if in the end the main hero shot himself in the head, all of a sudden, just like that.
i don't know what to comment about,there's nothing in the movie to comment about the first half was a teen-movie the second half was worse(the cave scene was okay) burrow scene was pointless(actually i found the entire movie pointless) there was no emotion in the end scene and the dumbledore's death scene(i was happy dumbledore was dead and the torcher movie was over) ginny weasley is given way too much importance(she hides the HBP's book and not harry) and i cannot imagine lavender blabbering about ron in front of the teachers let alone the headmaster dumbledore asks harry about his feelings for hermione there is plenty of these idiotic scenes,i don't understand how so many gave it 10/10 this might be the worst movie i have ever seen,shame IMDb doesn't have a 0/10 rating
All the more disappointing then that in the end, Draco went through all this effort just so Bellatrix could burn down Hagrid's hut.
BUT.......as a viewer you should remain aware that, in the end, such a goal is not going to be successful.
The evolving love story is completely dispensable as we know who she'll choose in the end anyways.
However, when effects like that are mixed with bad actors, a half baked storyline and a plot basing on the most ridiculous idea that 2 guys would actually compete over a woman with an abomination as a haircut you get a silly film in the end.
In fact, if Jean Reno and his team hadn't done anything, the bad guys would have killed themselves anyway in the end.
And in the end, what always happens?
What counts in the end is staying power.
And, in the end it's even sappier than the brief marriage of George Lanzenby's Bond to Dianna Rigg in the 1969 "on Her Majesty's Secret Service."
However the makers of this spin off must have forgotten that if it is any other secret service agent movie than please there are better options than watching almost physically disabled L. So in the end, it is a movie with a hole ridden plot that dwells more on mannerism of L rather than a good storyline.
At least the sixth sense took the time to explain its self in the end.
The script has the same worn-out themes of hidden rooms, mysterious deaths, kooky neighbors, weird histories and the disbelieving husband who discovers the truth in the end.
A mysterious woman and a wierd dog are tagged on to the script without much of an explanation as Ally Sheedy (looking eerily like a young Kate Jackson) and her husband, William R. Moses, dump their life savings into a house that predictably burns down in the end.
), you got to ask yourself the question in the end: why in God's name do we need such a film?
But the characterization is incredibly lame and in the end nothing about the guy adds up.
The ending was meaningless does it mean he has another chance and why Dr. Newman was his father then became Dr. Newman again in the ending... such a waste of time and money...
If you are delaighted with uncertain movies that clear up in the end this is the choice for you.
It's even fine if the audience doesn't for a while, but I find it incredibly annoying to invest a couple of hours into a story only to find out in the end that it was all just a dream.
The leads aren't very likable and I didn't particularly care if they got together in the end.
in the end, it turns out ("fight club"-style) that alex is in fact the killer, and that there was no redneck to begin with.
anyways, the alter-ego-"fight club" (and X other movies)-like twist in the end serves only to justify the completely unlikely plot and over-the-top bloodshed before and, inadvertently (unlike in "fight club"), makes 90% of what we've seen totally illogical and impossible to have happened.
and if alex killed her killer alter ego in the end (i.e.
I have always been a biggest fan of AAMIR KHAN and this is one of the finest performance by him.From his hunky funky flirto type to intense mature person in the end, you love him all the way.
D a potential bad guy or guys that will come around in the end.
You can take a pig, dress it up, put lipstick on it and call it Monica, but in the end it's still a pig.
Mimi Rogers gave a grand performance as did David Decovney, but I spent the entire movie wondering if it was coming from a Christian perspective, or if it was just an ill conceved thriller, and in the end that question was not answered.
To be honest, in the end I rather enjoyed watching most of The Descendant, though I couldn't admire it.

I really wanted to like this, but in the end it's a poorly made film with too few laughs.

And Van Cleef and Garland's confrontations with the creature in the end will have you rolling on the floor.
SPOILERS:   In fact, in the end of the movie, after finding out Rohit didn't die after all and they all go back to their village, Nisha's the only one missing.
The film fails in the end in that it presents characters that 99.9% of us can't relate to and doesn't ever really make us care what happens to them in the end.
I was attracted by the cast, with Dennis Hopper, Ann-Margret and Billy Zane, but I in the end I was absolutely disappointed with the coincidences and the insane and totally unbelievable story.

We know what's going to happen in the end.
Bad guy (aka ultra-violent freak) tries hard but in the end the good guy wins.

However, in the end I could not get over the fact that the lead character does illegal acts voluntarily and without any regrets later.
What the original movies had in charm, in script and in the endearing performance of their cast (even Mark Hamill pulled it off in the end) was largely lacking here.
The leadman, Joe Lara, is lucky that he turned out to be a cyborg in the end.
This is the type of movie where you root for the entire cast of characters to die in the end.
Oh, and in the end let's blow up the village.
I never laughed so much in my life when Kate got what she had coming to her in the end of the sequel.
and in the end, Karloff catches fire for no apparent reason other than it's the end of the film!
I had to switch to another movie and switched back to see if this disastrous entity had any hope of redeeming itself in the end.
Stir in the endless shrugging off of numerous instances of casual racism and misogyny, and you're left with a pretty empty document of little genuine significance.
The boyfriend cheats on his girl, and in the end it's the male and female main character, the slut, and the cool horny guy who stay the night after a couple of party goers get killed.
So even though I feel that it is an important topic, it could have been covered in a better way, or at least it should have had a Long message in the end.
It's only redeeming quality is the actors were good, but they had such garbage to work with that it just didn't matter in the end.
A building is broken into, stuff is stolen, numerous laws are broken, a work truck is repeatedly used without permission, adults are physically assaulted...but hey, they saved some dogs so all that stuff is cool and the kids "did the right thing" in the end.
It certainly doesn't work as all of these and in the end just comes off as very boring, with any sign of decent action at the end, by which time you've long lost interest.
This is one of those con-movies which in the end could have had God in on it to save the day.
The thematic is quite fine, a deep space station used as a psychiatric facility is exiting knowing the visual taste of Caro and the cast is well done too, but in the end every way you look at it the movie never fully unfold his potential.
Omri's character really is childish, yet endearing; his parents seem to pamper him, he's afraid of the dark, and he has lame 90's action figures; but he does mellow out in the end of the movie.
Maybe it was just the cut of the film I saw, but nothing was made clear in the end.
Unfortunately, there's a bit of a culture clash between the lovers, since muses aren't supposed to fall in love, but it all works out in the end.
The characters are also horribly developed, and in the end, this movie is a complete mess.
Ooh, but then she overcomes it all in the end, with the help of her boyfriend...how surprising.
The Webster character is totally unnecessary and a more maniacal Gorman working in solitude would have been far more menacing But the catch is that with Pryor in the role of Gorman, the producers obviously felt a need to allow him to redeem himself in the end, so I say they should have removed Pryor, too.
Having heard both from people who loved the movie and hated the movie, I watched it with an open mind, but in the end it was clear to me that this movie is weak.
The plot, while obviously overdone, is quite capable of producing an entertaining movie: boy meets girl, boy dates girl, boy and girl have a relationship, girl cheats on boy, boy breaks up w/ girl, boy wants to get back together w/ girl, and they're together in the end.
What counts, in the end though, is that the kids enjoyed it.
I was looking forward to seeing this movie, but was kinda disappointed in the end.
But being a 70s made-for-TV movie, you know everything is going to work out fine in the end Â not that you really care or anything.
Yet does he actually end up using it in the end?
As we've seen in other films about the long arm of British imperialism, a soldier's military training ultimately wins out in the end.
At first he is depicted as a cunning warrior out to save his fellow Maori, but he makes some very stupid mistakes in the end, ones that defy explanation and logic (unless you buy the "revenge always trumps intelligence" line).

The saucy temperament and sharp tongue he loved in the beginning began to wear on him in the end.
I didn't like either Tripp or Paula, and the film would have been much better had they gotten what they deserved in the end: a couple of punches in the face.
Did they assume they could chat it over in the end and be good friends again?
And in the end, this movie should be avoided at all costs.
The only spoiler I will give you regarding the story is the following: in the end, the zombies all die of starvation... because there isn't one single person in the film with a brain worth eating.
What Chapple doesn't know is that whatever Dr. Lombardi is doing is not and act but the real McCoy and in the end he's to get the shock of his life finding that fact out.
It's only good to watch if nothing else is on and seeing Courtney receiving her faux-Carrie comeuppance in the end.
As I said in the summary line, in the end of the movie when the screen went black, had I not paid so much for my TV and if I knew it would have done good, I would have thrown something at it.
Still, it is heartening that this detailed version is faithful to the novel's setting of 1880s London, and the premise that Sarah's father has truly died, altho his "dear friend" finally finds the long-lost Sarah in the end.
All is well (unless by this point the cheesy porn music doesn't make you want to pull your ears off)until this hairy geezer shows up, with may I say equally bad acting, he wants to romp with the American's wife, but she is having none of it, in the end you get to see more Spectrum special effects, a woman changing into a robotic style bird with horrendous flapping wings and more crap music.
It contains interviews from the band members the videos from one step closer, crawling, paper cut and in the end.
It also goes in great detail about the making of the in the end video.
The little fighting he does is in the end of the movie and it is so bad that you wonder if he has gained so much weight that he can't move anymore.
Like in the end with Seagal's "smart" words-"love is forever and forever is eternity"-or some sh*t like that,really can't remember cause couldn't decide whether to laugh or cry.
The only entertaining scene was seeing the psychopath get it good in the end.
Also, what's up with Sayaka appearing in the end just in time to do NOTHING???

They are all trying to examine the horrifying side of machinery and the cause it will have on us in the end.

This is my opinion but I think it is how the majority will feel in the end.

And in "Die Hard: With a Vengeance" Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson did not at first get along, but in the end their differences are put aside and they emerge as friends.
**SPOILERS** Ok, I'll try for the ones that linger most: Zeta-Jones doing those ridiculous ballet-moves to dodge laserbeams; she can dodge in in 2:30mins but dodge out in 30 secs; in the end they give back the 8 billion dollars minus 1 billion; like they didn't notice!

Other than that, "Eurovision" is nothing more than a fastuous pop concert, carefully rehearsed and re-rehearsed, so that in the end, it might be a good idea if a hearse carted it off to some out-of-city rubbish-dump and left it there unceremoniously and unprostituted for future generations.

In 2003 there is NO excuse for films in which the only homo characters are either raped or killed, 2/3 of the queer women characters speak of childhood abuse (because of COURSE no one would be a dyke unless "men did us wrong") and the bisexual character ends up with a man in the end.

Billy Bob delivers a good performance as the balls buster tough PE coach whom we discover has redeeming values in the end.

This is not a review of the film.This is a spoiler.Haha.To begin with...well,let me just say that Dracula can't beat Frankenstein's Monster.The original monster has the combined strength of a 100 men and,as we all know,he's INDESTRUCTIBLE!But Al didn't know that and obviously he was a Dracula fan.So,the monster became an "artificially created man" which was torn apart in the end by Dracula.If Boris Karloff was in that forest,in which the "final battle" takes place,he would have pounded them BOTH into oblivion.But fear not Frankenstein fans!There are other films(not to mention comic books)in which the monster defeats the "lord of the manner of Corpathia".If you are a Dracula fan,then enjoy this.You will never see Dracula defeating the "monster" again.But If you are a Frankenstein fan,then please avoid it.

This is a script which must have appealed on paper to the actors - there's lots and lots of snappy dialogue - BUT the pacing, structure and action sequences are woeful and in the end it leaves Paul McGann, Susan Lynch and Tom Georgeson, to name but three, in limbo, mouthing silly platitudes at the end and embarrassing themselves and us in the process.

But during the movie and especially at the end of the first con on Penelope he was very passive and he lost lots of credits as he is just about to fail during the play of the con and actually fails in the end...

Thus less excitement...

Despite being a box office hit, Hook wasn't the film that Spielberg wanted to make, in the end, he isn't fond of it and frankly neither is Julia Roberts for that matter( take a look at the trivia, clearly she didn't have a good time as it would seem).

i wanted to like this movie,and i really tied.but in the end,i just couldn't justify it.it's billed as a comedy,except it's not funny.or even amusing.i will say that the two lead actors,Daryl Hannah and Dudley Moore are appealing,as are their characters.but the movie is just too slow and talky for my tastes.and there's also too much swearing for no good reason.it doesn't add anything to the movie,and it doesn't really have any relevance.the movie has an ensemble cast of well knowns from the time period(in this case,1990),but they can't save this movie.it's not quite horrible,but it certainly isn't very good,either.for me,Crazy people is a 3.5/10
