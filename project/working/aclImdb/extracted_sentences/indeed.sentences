It's clear just looking at this film that it didn't benefit from a large budget, and indeed the locations do all look very cheap.
And yet, Moore has so successfully replicated the brutish world of the Native American that the viewer who can overcome modern Political Correctness will indeed find himself wishing not for their destruction but that they and their enemies could, in one sense, cease to be Huron, cease to be Iroquois, for their own sake and for each other's, before it is too late!
A very enjoyable view indeed.
The general lightness of tone might indeed startle in light of the subject matter, plus there's even an astonishingly erotic moment when Marie imagines herself being groped by both husband and lover in an elegant masturbatory fantasy.
And indeed, shortly after moving to a new apartment with a dubious reputation, Nikki meets a handsome and seemly sophisticated man who quickly turns out to be the devil in disguise.
Tho the strangely preternatural rat co-star is indeed of 'UNKNOWN ORIGIN', it sounds more like a sci-fi title than a movie about Peter Weller being driven insane by an escalating rat problem in his house.
Not really a horror film, except that something does indeed go bump in the night, and often too.
The one thing that still astonishes me to this day, 16 years later, is indeed the Predator.
she has a very though fate indeed, facing a lot of sadness and only a little happiness..
Rock School is extremely entertaining and very interesting and compelling because of one thing Paul says early in the film... "It's easy to be a novelty act, a bunch of kids playing rock, but the goal is to do it very well..." The kids can indeed play.
I felt that Mr. Green was indeed hamming it up in parts, but it didn't hurt the documentary at all.
Everything one expects would create a cohesive, sense-making narrative film is inverted and indeed develops an immediately conscious connection between itself and the audience.
"Grouchland" is indeed smelly and trashy .
Teaching kids to rock is a noble calling indeed :) Can't wait to see it again when it comes out proper.
What indeed  I wouldn`t say this is the best Bosnian conflict movie ( That accolade goes to PRETTY VILLAGE PRETTY FLAME ) but it`s probably the most accesible to a western audience .
We get Lucille Brown as the "Prairie Flower," and Leroy Mason as the head villain, also from the better 'Texas Terror' (1935) in which Lucille gets more screen time than the villain, and when finding out that John Wayne is indeed a good guy at the end, rushes to his cabin to spend two hours alone with him!
The Puppet Masters, a book from the 50s, is essentially fairly lightweight albeit the invasion motif is similar to that of much 1950s science fiction in echoing a fear about the spread of communism - indeed, the parasitic slugs in Puppet Masters form a single entity - a commune if you will - and are therefore a fairly obvious analogue for the red menace.
Dana Carvey is an extremely talented comedian,which makes it a shame that his efforts since his Saturday Night Live days have fallen,at least for the most part,miserably flat.The latest effort,The Master of Disguise,is no exception.This film is horrid from top to bottom.It is a poor execution of what was a poor story idea to begin with.Executive Producer Adam Sandler's ideas about comedy may work when Sandler himself is in the film,but he has yet to produce a good effort when solely behind the camera.Carvey's efforts to make this a good film are indeed valiant,but he can't do it alone.Even the character names (Pistachio Disguisey?)
Though I wouldn't expect it at all, this was indeed a good movie.
This is ingenious indeed, I never saw it before, and I saw a lot of werewolf movies.
But with "Twin Dragons," it appears as though the story did indeed destroy the movie, to the point where even the action scenes couldn't salvage the film from its inherent ennui.
Wall Walking upside down if you please and reverting to a spirit state where you can indeed walk thru walls and invisible (to the human eye only) structures.

Asoka and Kaurwaki (unbeknown to her that he is indeed her love Pawan), gather their forces for the final show down confrontation known to history as the Battle of Kalinga, whose outcome decided the fate of civilization and destiny of Asoka.
As the story develops more, Asoka and Kaurwaki get married but on the day of their marriage, Asoka is asked to return to Magadha as news makes him aware that his mother is very ill. As the entire story from here unfolds, things take a real big turn, as Asoka does indeed become larger than just retaining the throne, he also loses his communication with Kaurwaki and her younger brother Arya (Suraj Balaji) and the story leaves you with a shocking and questionable ending.
For a commerical bollywood film, its cinematography & art direction is the most exotic & decadent works in reccent times and it actually makes one believe that the setting was indeed the second century B.C.
This film is not intended to be derogatory towards Buddhists, but does indeed enact the historical beginnings of Buddhism.
What is also said a lot is the the movie is (too) complex, indeed you have to think and pay attention to get everything, but since when is that not a good point.
The villain was utterly forgettable unfortunately, although the monster effects were quite memorable indeed.
I can't answer for its historical accuracy beyond Connery's philosophical Amundsen being nothing like the ruthless egomaniac of reality that he had become by this time (indeed, Amundsen's death in this rescue did much to salvage his heroic reputation after the public backlash to his bitter score-settling memoirs).
We learn almost nothing about him, he has barely any dialog, and the end reveal is very fleeting, making him quite a mysterious entity indeed.
The peaceful serenity of their world and surroundings does indeed seduce one.
INTO GREAT SILENCE is indeed a cinematic experience much more than a film documentary for entertainment or educational purposes.
Well, when they started work on their first Fox feature, the movie they made, Great Guns, came on the heels of the success of Buck Privates and if one looked at the original script of the Fox/L & H picture, you'd know that indeed the studio wanted to capitalize on the Universal/A & C blockbuster as evidenced by this unfilmed exchange between Stan & Ollie: O: Wait-, S: What's the matter?, O: Don't throw the water out there!, S: Why not?, O: The sergeant is just liable to come walking in!, S: What's the matter with that?, O: Don't you remember?
Whodunit indeed!
Cheers indeed!
I haven't been moved by any of his comic turns since... indeed upon reflection, could it not be suggested that Raging Bull was in essence, high class comedy?
Be honest: you wait with bated breath until the movie provides you with the sigh of relief that the swim coach was indeed male.
Are we supposed to assume that he was indeed having an affair?
Dunne indeed has the perfect timing and one of my favorite parts in this movie was the scene where she puts on a double act, pretending to be Grant's sister.
Tho sure enough love never quite runs as expected, and can indeed be a truly complex thing, especially when the other parties involved are human, a cheeky cat, and a rather smart and astute canine!.
It leaves the audience in no doubt as to what is, indeed, Better Than Sex.
The cast of the movie was fine the only one I thought helped was the guy from the first Species movie as the motel manager who was indeed the original one.
This movie was indeed a lot of fun and it very well made.
He has evil minds indeed, but he wishes to be a good guy, he wishes greater power will happen to him so that can save at least his girlfriend, and then if possible, save the world.
B-movies can be very entertaining indeed but there is nothing here that appeals to me.
Released in 2000, the film finds her living in New York, where she has considerable cache in the avant guarde arts world--and obsessing about her weight, her smoking habit, her past, her present, her future--and indeed virtually everything.
"Still of the night" is indeed a very silent and dark movie.
We were interested in the story and did a little research - the basic facts appear true (he did indeed take part in this race) although there is a liberal amount of poetic license, of course.
Also, the ending is indeed startling for a picture of this type.
"Kramer vs. Kramer" meets "Rain Man" in this abomination passing as a movie; it is indeed one of the worst films I've seen in the last few years.
Now to the point:  This film is very sad indeed.
It is indeed the worst of the series (and there were quite a few bad ones).
A very interesting movie indeed!
A science fiction story is usually utterly improbable, indeed impossible, but its internal logic is vital: it must be consistent.
Very refreshing indeed.
... "i dunno, but it sounded like a cow pissing on some leaves" ....heh heh... which indeed was an accurate description.
After visiting the US in the 80's and 90's with its malls and fast food chains (and indeed looking at the kind of product Hollywood churns out these days) it's clear that his kind won the race in the end.
This film may very well be the most memorable film I have ever seen and, yes, I agree with all the other comment-writers that it should indeed be brought into the light of day (WITHOUT "remaking" it!!!!!)
Very good indeed.
Tate stated at the beginning of her career that she wanted to do light comedy and "The Wrecking Crew" proved that that genre was indeed a perfect fit for her.
A film that splits people in to two groups indeed.
The Prisoner of Zenda's release was timely indeed with memories of the abdication of Edward VIII who would not step up to the plate and do his duty by his country.
The political part it's very short indeed while a lot of space is given to the artist's new belief: the Kaballah.
Obayashi tries every cinematic technique in the book and while his special effects are indeed dated, they provide the audience with a jaw-dropping bombardment of weird images and set-pieces.

The "hollow" crowd reaction at film's end did indeed echo my own assessment of a cliche' ridden and drawn out relationship journey.
Carole Landis was indeed one of the most Beautiful Actresses to grace the movie screen.
The serious viewer must not expect to have all the mysteries solved by film's end; indeed, most of the loose ends remain resolutely untied.

- Bombay Times, Times of India  "Eklavya indeed marks the revival of Indian cinema" - Business of Cinema  "Eklavya - The Royal Treat" - Glamsham.com   "The aesthetics - exemplary; the almost song-less grand illusion - world class."
'Eklavya' is proof, as if 'Black' wasn't a slap-in-the-face Amitabh is just getting warmed up after three decades example, that he is indeed a legend.
And indeed they all do complete justice with the tight one hour and forty five minutes of total screen time for this feature.
Seeing Heston with a machine gun mowing them down was indeed a guilty pleasure.
It's disturbing indeed to note the subliminal message of the inter-racial love affair -- the nice white man is happy to take care of the black woman and her children, but only after the assertive black man is dead.
This is the type of four-person drama that hardly makes it to the big screen anymore, and indeed this 2001 movie originally aired as an HBO film.
So he could act very well indeed.
But, this little film, made about 10 years before his demise shows he was indeed, an actor and not merely a star.
However, it is not merely how much White relies on Black for survival with the treacherous confines, but it is also how much Black relies on White, as the director twists the uses of Black and White and indeed Good and Evil as roles interchange in all quarters.
Thin stuff, indeed.  
This was exaggerated to the hilt for dramatic purposes, but that's okay once you know that because the story is, indeed, "inspirational."
Action, scifi shows do indeed make better reunion progresses than sitcoms ever will.
Beginning and ending the film with nicely contrasted mirror images of "the Princess" running across some dimly lit corridor and Raymond van het Groenewoud's haunting musical theme, it makes for a very neat composition indeed.
Jade soon sets her sights on the owner of the carnival's freak show, despite her aversion to those poor people, and with her curvy figure, toothy smile and blonde good looks (indeed, Brennen here looks very much like the young Joni Mitchell), has no trouble roping him in.
Their stories are indeed heart wrenching, because unlike the Jews, they have forced to live quietly, unable to share their horrific experiences for so long.
Not a good movie indeed.
Fairly easy indeed.
The acting is superb; the Polish brothers are completely believable as the conjoined twins Blake and Francis Falls, performing feats like deftly buttoning up each other's shirts or playing the guitar together (Blake strums while Francis manages the fret for chord changes) as if they had, indeed, done it all their lives.
I must agree, it's a family film that indeed shall be grater than any others that will proclaim so in future.
In the end (indeed, 10 minutes into the film) not only do we not care at all what happens to her, but we rather wish Walken would just lose his cool, lock her and del Toro in a closet someplace, and dance away into the sunset to a Fatboy Slim song.
Much discussion was made of Streep's letter-perfect accent and her scenes as a prisoner, and indeed she's quite remarkable; however, Sophie isn't allowed to bloom as a person.
There is a subtle implication at the end that Chad may indeed get what's coming to him.
All is calm until he encounters Keiko (Misa Shimizu) who closely resembles his murdered wife and indeed is suicidal from her own slashes in an attempt to negate the genetic threat of her mentally disturbed mother and her own consignation with an underworld lover Eiji Dojima (Tomorowo Taguchi), a man who holds her under his control to gain the mad mother's money committed to his evil schemes.

Here the lead does nothing sensible at any point during the whole of the film and the plumber who is very annoying indeed comes off as being not quite as silly as her.

The Graf Spee would have made quite the prize indeed.
Having Vinnie Jones star in this movie was indeed the one and only redeeming quality of this one.
Nice movie indeed.
This episode was regular for almost the entire length, but it was build up to the end so ingeniously and unnoticeable that the end indeed made such an impact.
I watched this movie three times at different ages of my life and always did enjoy it very much indeed.
indeed.
However, despite Fuller's reputation for not being a sentimentalist, the last 15 minutes of the film are indeed heavy on sentiment and actually is about the worst part of the film.
Plus, in reality Reavis only got a 2 year sentence (not 6) and his wife did indeed leave him--and the way the film ended and how he was caught is pure fiction.
Once the story proper begins, though, the pace is brisk (one is indeed surprised at one point to find that three years have elapsed in the course of one dissolve!
The scam paid off, very nicely indeed.
Richard Conte is less convincing, possibly due to the uneasy character he has to play: a famous analyst who, indeed, is incredibly dumb in getting the mental problems of his adorable spouse.
"The Petrified Forest" is widely regarded as Humphrey Bogart's breakthrough film, which indeed it was.
It is true that Fred did indeed have a drinking problem for which he was fired but evidence shows that much of this was due to the immense strain he was under rather than a wilful character defect.It could be said that he was the worlds first commercial aerial navigator.
I have my interpretation but some points are missing or does not make sense, and I did not understand the bond between Su-Yeon and Seungmin (the homosexual love between them is subtle and not clear whether it is corresponded or not) and who is the killer indeed.
In Bertram's Hotel (shown just before this one), she looked very poor indeed.
Eventually, however, Snoopy and Woodstock reach the hospital where Lila is staying, and her spirit does indeed rise when the dog suddenly appears by her bedside and enriches her enthusiasm.
A bizarre scandal indeed!
The title character is therefore made to appear like a good guy who was indeed hoping for a US-backed "third force" to intervene in Vietnam.
), and being privy to the volatile, seismic shifts in their relationship in this film, I conclude that "Fanaa" is indeed the title that says it best.
Being "properly dressed" ie blazer and all, was not reserved just for "going out" but could be felt to be an obligation once breakfast had been cleared away indeed perhaps before breakfast (part of "keeping up standards").
But Fleming is wise enough to know when to calm things down, and indeed the more sedate scenes have a greater impact after the usual flurry of action.
As the would be love birds plot on each other and cheat on one another with their new girlfriends, we, the audience are subjected (treated) to vulgar atrocity after outrageous one-liner after obscene sex act, a delightful little movie indeed.

In years to come, I will watch this movie with my kids (I hope), and hope that they will learn what I have today-- that the Bollywood movie is not dead, indeed it is alive and kicking, and Kal Ho Naa Ho, this movie will be a perfect monument to 2003 Bollywood cinema.
A typical "Karan Johar love triangle" indeed.
This is indeed a breathtaking movie!
The plot somewhat predictable (and I better not to rehash it) but Nikil Adhvani as a director made it with a sense of love and that make this as a warm, subtle and deeply moving, a great entertainer indeed.
:-o - I also particularly enjoyed the running joke about Aman and Rohit being a homosexual couple - one could indeed ask oneself who is really in love with who here?
I am just saying that Movies like KAl ho na ho, Dilwale Dulhaniya are the PRIDE of Indian cinema...So the industry should not forget that...  and the even more BETTER thing about this movie is that You can watch this movie like GAZZILION times... every time i see it i love it... its funny and superbly written... Karan Johar is more of a BETTER Writer...... his dialogs are so FUNNY....... like the reference to Preety as MAA-mother.... and the emotional scenes..........how well written.......no matter how FIlmy...there were tears in my eyes so thats the BIG thing.......  the leading lady PREETY ZINTA proves herself as a BETTER actress... this is a ROLE she was born for...She is JUST way toooooo BRILLIANT... no one could have been better......and i mean NO-One...Thanks GOD kareena Refused this film...

One has to categorise this show as as satirical comedy, and indeed the first season begins humorously and playfully enough.
To start, Rufus Sewell, a fine thespian indeed.
Next comes Kiefer Sutherland, a fantastic choice for this film indeed as the Igor mad scientist.
Actually, this movie reminds me a bit of the 1925 silent The Lost World...from what I have read was indeed an inspiration for this film.
As the film progresses and we meet Shumonto's ambitious wife, Supriya, and his mother, Koyel, who seems to be tied up with something in her past, we realise that the son is, indeed, haunted by his father who was a somebody.
But even still, its a very, very good film indeed.
But that does not make the opinions original, controversial, well-thought-out, appealing to any but the most philosophically naive, or indeed anything but what they are: a reactionary position against the established order which would not succeed on its own merits and thus must actively strive to emphasize its difference and novelty.
This is an under-rated movie worth watching and the female lead is indeed an actress under-rated - she is lovely and supportive.
The writing is smooth- indeed, this show got nominated for two Emmys for writing.
When she leaves the room he immediately switches chairs and scootches around on it to see if indeed the sound came from Cindy or the vinyl.
This Charley Chase short has a rather silly plot but because the film was written so well and Chase did a great job pulling it off, the whole things works very well indeed.
Yes, indeed, the acting is abominable and some of the characters are corny, and some of the takes take the speed out of the proceedings.... yes, this is all true, BUT:  The handful of clues (hopefully not RED herrings) strewn throughout the movie gave me the hope that this one - at last - would be the dreamed SciFi movie to top all other movies in the field of such intriguing questions as:   "Where does mankind come from?"
And indeed that's exactly what this sublimely shoddy stinker is.
I've been to Laredo/Nuevo Laredo once and indeed it seems to be like this.
I don't know if that's a good thing... Lynch is a very strange man, indeed.
The strongest side of the movie is the acting and what a great actors play in this movie indeed.
Connery's experienced Irish cop is a wonderful role (indeed, the role which deservedly won the big Scot his only Oscar), while De Niro demonstrates how to portray evilness as only he can (his baseball bat slaying of an associate is shocking and disturbing in the extreme).
Catherine Deneuve, John Malkovich, and the other actors are trying their best, but inadvertently fall short, because of the poor script; however, the polyglot setting they are involved in is indeed an interesting idea, albeit inadequately exploited.
Some of the photography is indeed captivating , if you have never been to Pompeii or to Athens , then you might as well visit them on the screen.
I especially agree with the reviewer from Hong Kong, who stated that this is indeed, similar to real life, and he is in a multi-cultural city, where many languages are spoken.
Stephen is indeed a beautiful guy.
It is indeed a pity that these very talented comics are all but forgotten now.
Although there is a wealth of intrinsically 'good' characters to be found in the story, Cassandra is unmistakably the most likable one and indeed she propels the film with her warm, caring charisma.
It often offers delicate and classy humour in the juxtapositions of the seedy, drafty castle life with the glossy upper-class dinners at the American brothers' estates and indeed the whole film is peppered with light-hearted comedic situations and crafted with humorous, charming strokes.
The film does show that Wuornos is indeed a monster.
I think the premise might have viewers scratching their heads, it is indeed quite an outrageous story, but I ate it up.
The library scene(..where the police stake out the WRONG library) is a doozy which only makes life harder for Virginia, who must somehow, someway, convince her boyfriend that the psychopath is indeed from some horror book she reads.
That particular episode with 'Little Billy' surviving is, indeed, a classic.
Last, but not least, is David Stagnari, a New York film maker, who's film Catharsis seems to be the most 'artsy' of the lot, if that's indeed a word.
The characterizations where over-the-top and annoying, the characters were mostly (including the lead, who was indeed gorgeous) cardboard, two-dimensional characters; completely unsympathetic and without any redeeming qualities whatsoever.
No detail of someone's life is too private to escape scrutiny, indeed the more personal it is the better the story - not a big stretchÂ The symbiosis between the media and fame is depicted as an incestuous co-dependent relationship.
Not being sufficiently versed in the actual history I suspect the relation between Marie and Powers' Count Axel was blown up or perhaps even invented for drawing power, and indeed I find the film's weakest parts the rather purple moments between the two which do seem to encroach into the realm of melodrama.
But the supporting cast alone almost compensates for these deficiencies: Robert Morley side-stepping caricature to make Louis XVI touchingly human; John Barrymore and Gladys George contributing brilliant, razor-sharp vignettes as Louis XV and Madame du Barry (indeed, the confrontation between Marie Antoinette and du Barry is one of the film's highlights); and Joseph Schildkraut redefining the term "oily" as the scheming Duke of Orleans.
Death Wish is indeed a pioneer in the genre for which it spawned, and overall it holds up well today as it did in the 70's.
I knew that there was also a kind of historical context for the times, of how it was in New York City as well as in others during the 70's (though especially in the 70's)- I remembered my mother telling me about how the atmosphere of 'Death Wish' with its thieves and rapists and abusers was for real, that they were around every corner, and that crime was indeed at an all-time high then.
This is indeed so terrifying and real it tops a scene like the one in Clockwork Orange with the assault on the writer; it's somehow even more shocking when its in an apartment in the now, with hoodlums as random and sadistic as the ones here.
Bronson is, indeed, great at being, well, Bronson.
Surely the development of Naomi, how she grows up - and indeed has to grow up - through friendship and also sorrow, is the driving force of the movie.
I think he was indeed very passionate about this film.
Touching indeed.
In that regard it was truly a fun ride, and if it is indeed over, I will miss the best of it.
Based on true events that indeed took place in 1855 the film doesn't really strive for historic accuracy & is a crime caper in the mould of The Italian Job (1969) with a charismatic & likable criminal & his gang staging a daring heist to steal lots of gold & a throughly entertaining tale it is too, I have to say I liked it a lot.
Enid sees the functioning of the adults in her life as the subject of her ironic amusement, and, indeed, the actors brilliantly flesh out the subtle (and not so subtle) humor in their struggles.
Very disappointing indeed.
A very good scene indeed is the moment when Holmes throws some dice to estimate depth... look out for it.
All the time I was watching I didn't recognise the Holmes I saw on the screen, indeed, for the first ten minutes, I assumed Holmes was some other man to further the story along, until Watson followed him and called him by name.
- poor child actor #1 has indeed become president of the United States.
), but when it finally got a limited release here in the UK it got very good reviews indeed.
The original Paul would never have deigned to appear in a piece of work like this, indeed, if he sees it, he'll probably squirm in embarrassment and fury, as did I at the depiction of this couple - and I'm not a Beatles fan.
Very sad at the end, very sad indeed.
So begins the adventures of Carlitos as he begins to learn that the world is indeed full of unseen bad folks who will not hesitate to traffic him to child smugglers.
Though Dunne certainly has an excellent singing voice (and it is, indeed, her own voice), the contrast between her solemn, operatic songs, and Fred and Ginger's playful vaudeville routines is too great to sit comfortably together.
Of course most of the photos, such as the ones of the pyramids of nude prisoners, or the sequence of photos of the corpse of al-Jamadi, document atrocities that can hardly be explained away by any imaginable context, and such practices were indeed judged as criminal.
Or maybe they were indeed uncaring jerks.
But if anything the movie has actually gotten more poignant over the decades since it's creation: We now live in a world where middle eastern fanatics do indeed shape global events & have shown themselves capable of inflicting apocalyptic events.
It's no longer just an escapist nightmare/fantasy to suggest that what is being depicted in the film might actually happen, and the filmmakers should indeed be congratulated for pretty much getting the look of the apocalypse right ... though I do think that people would have found more opportunities to wash their faces & would think that ammunition for firearms would be a bit more of a rarity.
This movie was indeed a pleasure for me to see.
The early-war (indeed, technically, 'pre-war') setting allows for reflection on just what a mess the Americans were gradually getting themselves sucked into, and its effects on the officers and soldiers who were sent out into the jungle without being told quite what they were actually supposed to be doing there.
It was, indeed, obviously a labor of love, but now, we at least have SOME idea of what the audience saw in 1927...here it is, 2006, and I thought that for it's time, it probably WAS frightening.
The actors are one for one top quality but the star is indeed BenoÃ®t Poelvoorde from my beloved country.
Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell were a brilliant screen pair (indeed, it seems that no one was bad casting when paired with Cary Grant) as rival reporters in a furiously paced news office.
Eric Mabius was a surprise indeed for the lead with Kirstin Dunst on hand in a supporting role.
There are some very gruesome moments indeed and much flesh is displayed, but the levels are down exceedingly.
It's not mind blowing by any means, but it is indeed a thought provoking little film, voiced very well and animated in a really interesting style.
On the whole...it's very good stuff indeed.
This movie will make you run the gamut of emotions; you'll laugh, cry and at the end be satisfied that yes, there is indeed a God.
Mr. Shyamalan -- you are indeed 'wide awake'.
There are some very dark moments here, very dark moments indeed, for the times in which it was made, of bravery and courage, and too, the hands-on violence towards the women and their children.
Like a beautiful and complicated piece of music, one sees something new at each viewing; in one viewing the look on "Joseph's" face as he stands at the window waiting on "Anna" to arrive to look at a new apartment, and realizes she will NOT be there, that she is indeed immersed in "Sean"; in another viewing the changes in Anna's" expression as she is 'rescued' by Joseph on the beach--at one point there is an instantaneous look on her face signifying her realization that life with Joseph, and WITHOUT Sean, will be devastating for her.
It's just a steamy murder mystery that happens to be very well played indeed.
Sleepwalking down the street dressed in pajamas & bowler, he is indeed a very droll sight.
Yes, CITY OF WOMEN indeed leads us into the tunnel of lustful fantasies.
The editing could be improved if indeed this will be shown in two parts when as a whole, it is amazing.
If this is the case, then this trilogy will indeed constitute Steven Soderberg's masterpiece.
During 'Guerilla' I kept thinking how this could indeed work as a quality European-style miniseries, which might begin with a shortened version of Walter Salles's 'Motorcycle Diaries' and go on to take us to Guevara's fateful meeting with Fidel in Mexico and enlistment in the 26th of July Movement.
I can assure you, firsthand, that David's mother would indeed have been far too frazzled and depressed to carry on a relationship with a man even so patently wonderful as Sam Waterston's character (and I've had a crush on Waterston ever since he played Benedict in "Much Ado About Nothing").
There is indeed quite a deep and interesting flow to this documentary and Dunn not only managers to maintain a subjective and professional roll in his research, but also managers to maintain his integrity as a metal head - this is indeed, a credit to him.
Twenty years later in the unfolding story it becomes indeed a razor's edge on which to tread when former wife Elizabeth again encounters John, who is now known as Erik Kessler, middle aged, graying, and has difficulty getting around.
So while every ensuing meeting brings them closer to the truth of their former relationship, it is a very thin line indeed that separates them from the possibility of true recognition of each other and the memories of bygone days.
The death scenes are indeed questionable, and tend to be laughable.
I just saw this movie on HBO, and it was really good...a tragic love story indeed!
Then it's on to scene two: unattractive women with huge fake knockers dancing topless to a seemingly endless array of pop tunes which were never popular or indeed heard outside of this movie, as far a I can tell.
Said to be based on a true story, I made inquiries back then and was told that there was indeed a ship that sank as quickly as this one, the fictitious Cresent Star, was purported to have done, but there was no incident with an officer passing survivors off of a lifeboat into the water.
The Aquarium would not pass muster today for the cramped, indeed life threatening, conditions its inmates were forced to endure - but that in itself is part of the realistic picture of life in the 30's seemingly minor films like these can offer.
There are indeed comedic aspects.
The grandfather is played by great German actor Bruno Gantz (who indeed played one of the most realistic portrayals of Hitler I have seen, in "The Fall" - Last Days of Hitler -"..or something like that).
however those scenes are "ok" and she looks great indeed).
The young man at the forefront of the piece is a certain private by the name of Alyosha Skvortsov (Ivashov), a boy whose war exploits would indeed make a fine story to tell any mother; friend or friend of a mother in the sense that in the heat of conflict, two Nazi tanks are wiped out by the said young man who has both the reality and responsibility of fighting on the Easatern Front thrust onto him at this early age.
The teaming of Oscar's two most famous refusniks sadly provides no sparks Â indeed, there seemed to be more drama offscreen between director John G. Avildsen and writer/producer Steve Shagan over the re-editing of the film, resulting in a compromise cut that probably satisfied no-one (it's a genuine surprise to find them jovially sharing the audio commentary on Warners' new DVD).
As one of Chukrai's effects brilliantly illustrates, war is indeed a world turned upside down.
Amongst all the laughs there were touching,"real" moments of life like retirement or "The Lou and Edie Story" when Lou's wife Edie leaves him or "Chuckles Bites The Dust",the best known episode of TMTMS when the station's clown,Chuckles,dies in a bizarre elephant crushing,Mary is disgusted at the sick jokes until she gets the giggles at the funeral,then there is a debate about people's reactions to death,all very deep indeed.
No one could say Mank didn't have a checkered career: In the 1930s he was castigated for daring to re-write Scott Fitzgerald (in his capacity as Producer on Three Comrades, Scott's only solo writing credit, he felt obliged to 'tidy' up several sequences) and in the 1960s he was the guy brought in to re-write and 'salvage' Cleopatra but in between he initially wrote then wrote and directed some very tasty fare indeed culminating in his two magnum opii A Letter To Three Wives And All About Eve.
Having studied this period of history, I'm afraid you will have to accept the fact that the BBC left out some of the most shocking aspects, and indeed this is what life was like in the Italian Renaissance.
"The Borgias" did indeed reflect reality, except, as I have said, this is a bit sanitised and not as opulent as it should have been.
Believe me, this film did indeed earn my vote of 1.
I felt no sense of "preaching", indeed it was the brevity of expressed points of view that lent it the sense of reality that one lives with every day.
A serious attempt at film making is often lost in a need to be gay and throws in unnecessary and explicit love scenes and nudity for no other reason than to remind the viewer that the characters are indeed homosexual.
Salutations indeed to the casting team responsible for this project.
My greatest praise indeed to all responsible for this vintage production of one of Austen's best known and most loved works.
A must-see for all readers of Jane Austen and indeed all who wish enjoy one of the most brilliant pieces of film-making ever.
The main character, Johnny Twennies, is indeed the hero and is uniquely performed by Gibson Frazier in a throwback to Bogart,Jimmy Stewart and a dash of Groucho Marx.That is the only way to describe this unusual character.The music in the film is great and is reminiscent of some of Woody Allens films.They are from the jazz age and are legitimized by the appearances Lester Lanin and Bobby Short.
The gimmick of a living anachronism is a powerful one indeed but to someone like myself who was raised on reporter movies of the 20s, who saw Cagney, Raft and Powell play these kinds of roles, using the same slang and expressions, now so out of date, I literally howled with delight.
We were indeed in this "Peoples' Republic of Chicago" and I had been taught that you don't voice opinions contrary to the (Cook County Democrat)Party Line.
the only flaw was indeed the sound, but ive seen a lot worse  i indeed watched this movie twice in the same day after buying it, it was very enthralling.
But it has absurd and drive indeed.
This is a triumph indeed for the director Mr. Giordana and all the people who contributed to make this a most unusual and poignant portrait of a people and a culture.
The child is indeed healed and all returns uneasily to their separate lives.
But when Charles II declares women may indeed trod the theatre's (& London's) stage(s), he finds himself haunted by the persona he has become.
But, as has been said, the play is the thing and the acting here is uniformly engrossing, indeed superb.
A much more atmospheric and involving film, indeed, this is the story of a woman who dreams fitfully about her accidental murder of her twin sister at the age of ten, with a slightly more complex plot involving a circus performer and pedophilia.
Although Cary Grant is justifiably remembered as a screen legend (indeed he was probably the most adept of any of his contemporaries at romantic comedy), it seems criminal that Irene Dunne is almost forgotten these days.
Who knows, perhaps the movie would had been even better if indeed Leo McCarey ended up directing it, like originally was intended.
Dunne was indeed a rare actress who could peerlessly balance madcap humor and genuine pathos, without ever appearing forced or contrived.
Reeling from this final tragedy, he goes home - but instead of unlocking the door and going inside to continue his life of loss, pain, being ground underfoot by Lady Luck, and honest graft being rewarded by nothing but poverty and misery, he makes a snap decision, he loses his last marble, and embarks on a very different life path indeed - one steeped in violence, rage and brutality.
This brooding, nihilistic and enigmatic depiction of Britain's vile criminal underworld - or indeed, an extension of its mainstream Saturday night vicious chav culture, come to that - replete with sex, drugs, more drugs, in-your-face violence, amorality and no respect for human life is a highly accomplished and self-assured work and places G.H.
In this case, it is indeed fully indicative of what's to come: more of the same.
Mommyyyyy..... Mommy indeed, because the director needs her mommy to spank her a bit and teach her some brains.
It's indeed a rip off of Alien, but it's much better than Alien, Alien is a very boring film in my opinion, but I think that Mutant is just fantastically good!
The rising and declining tunes indeed express the emotional states of the main heroes: Hungarian in Paris who finds himself in the most unexpected circumstances, a poor girl who dreams to be rich and independent.
Plus, I was really impressed by Peter Cushing's performance as a surgeon on a crusade--his speech before the graduating class and impassioned argument with old established "surgeons" was very impressive--some great oration indeed!
It's certainly not to everyone's taste, and if you can't handle high camp, you definitely don't want to see this; but if you like your films wild and wicked, Serial Mom is a treat indeed!
This was indeed an excellent movie, but I remember seeing it on the big screen, I am quite sure it is not a "TV movie" as several others have said here.
Jones is indeed superb, and though the premise is somewhat far-fetched, it is not important, because the drama remains.
Joe's wife, "Kate", is unable to accept the fact that one of their sons, Larry, who went missing in action as a pilot in the Pacific theater, was indeed, dead and not, "missing".
In a sense, this movie was indeed the celebration of Dead Poets the world over !
it is very happy and indeed very good at playing fast and loose with many different styles of cinema (sergio leone western with rocket launchers?!??!
Not that that's a complaint: indeed, it gives the film a strange texture that you don't naturally associate with this kind of material that adds to its anonymously professional uniqueness.
Some historical points have been stretched a bit, here and there...Bucky O'Neil was a madman who refused to keep his head down and got shot right through his cigarette ... Fighting Joe Wheeler was a bantam rooster of a man (5'3") but with the heart of a lion who did indeed keep referring to the enemy as "the Yankees"...TR's Rough Rider's attack was up the nearby Kettle Hill (Cero de Olla) where they racked the Spanish position across the narrow gully with deadly fire; when the Spanish [and there were about 1,500 men-- not 500, as some reviewer suggested] broke to fall back to Santiago, TR boldly took off alone toward the San Juan Heights (Los Altos de San Juan)having forgotten to give the order to charge...  OK.
Brent appeared with John Barrymore in "Raffles" (1917) and "Night Club Scandal" (1937); indeed, he had just received his fourth divorce.
When she reveals that indeed she is a performer in the circus, charlie glances at the poster-bill behind them both advertising the "Sword Swallower" With a mischievous grin and lilting eyes, he inquires as to whether this is HER role in the show.
But if I'm making The Circus sound like a serious film, then I've been deceiving you, for it is a very funny movie indeed: Chaplin's gags are innovative and perfectly timed, and he always managed to keep his running time perfectly suited to the audience's interest.
Yes be warned there is graphic violence and nudity all the way through, but look past this and you'll find something unique indeed.
I also think that the way the scene was shot with the white mami was indeed in horribly bad taste.
At the core of the film is Bulworth himself--and it is indeed the human element which redeems what could have been a cold, bloodless and unremarkable movie-as-statement (as in Wag the Dog).
The mechanisms of this transformation was the strong point of the story, and was quite effective, indeed.
If you are indeed a fan of Christopher Guest and his projects, this will not disappoint in the least.
It starts very, very well indeed.
1939 is considered to be one of the best years for filmmaking in Hollywood, and indeed it is,"Wuthering Heights","Wizard of Oz", "Gone With The Wind","Dark Victory","Ninotchka" just to name a few, all came out in that year.
'Won't get fooled again' is indeed the cynical motto of the years from Punk and Beyond.
Viewers need to realize that fact at the beginning before reading this or indeed any review.
Cry for Argentina, indeed!
I hope I have given some facts that will give a clearer perspective to some viewers, in order to better appreciate "Agents Secrets", which may indeed seem a bit difficult to understand for those who are unaware of the real-life background it is based on.
They make, indeed, a beautiful pair, and I wish they would have had a chance to be happy together, somewhere, somehow, at the end.
Some of his native friends are indeed in trouble.
40min version of this film and i must say, knowing what is missing from the 32min version, that it is indeed far more impactful and superior.
Midler's songs are the only real highlight, and the thing is indeed watchable... but only just.
Truly, the ULTIMATE gift indeed.
And I can say right away that the most exciting thing about this movie indeed was... the cover-art!
IcÃ­ar has matured and is indeed herself a `flower from another world'.
He is an ardent defender of rural Spanish life, which, over the last 30-40 years, has been declining, and indeed he lives in or spends large parts of his time in such places as the mountainous `Ancares' in the province of LeÃ³n, north-western Spain, or in the pre-Pyrenean areas of Huesca in the north of AragÃ³n.
Hmmmm intriguing indeed.....
Although not even a mediocre player would fall into this trap - much less a grandmaster, even when being annoyed - it really is a fitting position for the movie, for undoubtedly, any chess player who commits murder for fear of losing a chess match is a fool indeed!
The film imagines Washington D.C. 50 years from now, and that very prediction of our lifestyle is ambitious indeed; cars which drive themselves, home appliances which operate on voice command, holograms and highways which even run vertically Â the most wild and imaginative concepts are placed together into one single movie, and even though it eventually builds to disappointing level of cynicism and implausibility, it's still wonderful to look at and experience.
Bottom line, this is the type of picture to see twice, first to get the feel and presence, and the second to clear up any misunderstandings in the plot (or maybe to avoid Scooby Doo and Windtalkers), since this is indeed one of the best pictures of the year and one of Spielberg's best recent pictures.
Three people (the precogs) do indeed give up their freedom in order that millions of other people may be safer, and yes, there is an issue here.
Suffice it to say that when we think we know where the story's going, we may indeed know where the story's going - but Spielberg is only allowing us to see so much of what's coming up in order to obscure the rest of it.)
Bad editing indeed.
This has got to be one of the lowest budget films ever produced in Britain , and considering it`s a British film that is indeed saying a lot .
The film's musty Southern setting ought not to work but it does somehow, for how can one deny the effectiveness of Dracula Jr.'s coffin rising from the depth of a swamp; indeed, substituting his castle in Transylvania with an equally gloomy and mysterious Southern mansion was an inspired touch.
The acting of the Dog, played by Bibo, was stunning, especially when you know that she has received NO formal training whatsoever (and she did indeed act, not react!).
To me this film is, indeed, a dream (it has one character).
The dream was indeed spiritual; I couldn't find the spiritual symbolism of the triangle other than the typical Christian trinity, but this film goes much deeper than Christianity.
At first sight he seems an odd choice for this basically urbane character, but he acquits himself very well indeed and gives him a multi-layered personality.
Good indeed but little seen...
The sight of Ben Kingsley playing a silly cross-eyed Indian guru (who has his apprentices fight with mops dipped in his bodily fluids) is very depressing indeed.
The mentally impaired can be lovable, as indeed Lennie is in many ways, but even they have bad hair days, and I wish that just for once Lennie had showed a petty or venal side.
This could have created a very boring script indeed, but with a few exceptions, it doesn't.
Little Britain's characters do indeed resemble exaggerated versions of people in the UK, and they do mimic some Britishisms such as chavy 'yeah, but no, but yeah'.
I like Little Britain very much indeed.
He agrees and in the girl's apartment he finds her diary, learning that she is indeed his old friend Ling Ling (Qi Zhongyang).
'An average war film' indeed Â one has to wonder whether he/she actually watched it!
The rest of the movie is indeed intriguing, but has a few weaknesses which makes it feel a little half-baked.
Mitchum is a rather amiable, self-confident, yet low-key lead who's easy to watch, although his fight scenes are indeed hard to swallow.
The story of this movie has potential, indeed.
Although Cary Grant is justifiably remembered as a screen legend (indeed he was probably the most adept of any of his contemporaries at romantic comedy), it seems criminal that Irene Dunne is almost forgotten these days.
Who knows, perhaps the movie would had been even better if indeed Leo McCarey ended up directing it, like originally was intended.
Dunne was indeed a rare actress who could peerlessly balance madcap humor and genuine pathos, without ever appearing forced or contrived.
And if this is true, then Christina's childhood must have been hellacious indeed.
It was a Crawford movie, indeed, but it was also an ensemble cast- the characters, Eva, Avery, Judd, Jen, and Carol were all part of one story.
"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has."
Rikiya Otaka also deserves a mention as Yoichi (the little boy from the first film) - his expressions of blank terror and occasional moments of rage are very effective indeed.
Chabrol and the Leguaffs have indeed taken their stand with this shattering portrait of male terror--one that explodes out of a convincingly two-faced man, and is thus all the more effective.
The plot is indeed very strange and a touch nonsensical, but the movie has such a fast pace that I never questioned any of the happenings too much.
And this new place is sheer hell indeed; Shu finds himself prisoner on a dominating fortress where children from other parts of the world are being whipped into war soldiers.
I thought "Life is Worth Losing" was indeed one of Carlin's harshest acts, but it was also very funny.
I applaud all that allowed her story to be told...because she is indeed a woman of many talents and excellence.
Quite fortunate indeed, as tragically, this film was almost not made.
Quite fortunate indeed, as tragically, this film was almost not made.
The main problem is that Hollywood had little experience with focusing on a group rather than on a single character, so Ford's attempt is indeed laudable.
That is indeed the Duke himself, John Wayne, playing a Swedish hayseed named Ole Olsen who the other sailors aboard his ship want to see safely en route to home.
It seems pointless, and hopeless, but the Enterprise does indeed detect it and beams the Galileo's crew safely aboard.
I have no doubts that this is indeed one of the show's best offerings.
Matheson is fine in the lead, Beth Winslet proves Kate is not the only Winslet who can act whilst succeeding in being different from her sister, and Coleman is very watchable indeed.
The casting of Luke Ford and Rhys Wakefield paired as the two brothers is a godsend, indeed.
It becomes apparent, however, that debut filmmaker Elissa Down has instead crafted a very fine and perceptive film, indeed.
The silliness of the film also reminds me of films like Arsenic and Old Lace or Bringing Up Baby--and this a a STRONG complement indeed!
His "problem child" is indeed a means by which to expand your consciousness.
Well done indeed!.
And in "Ringu 0" (2000), the prequel to the original, we get to see the face of Sadako Yamamura, heretofore mostly hidden behind long, stringy hair, and, as played by actress Yukie Nakama, it is quite a lovely face indeed.
This is indeed a harsh punishment, as the girls know nothing about the "work ethic" and are astounded to find that they have to get up at 5:30 am and work eight hours a day!
In this case Ate de Jong & Brian Helgeland indeed made a great use of their imagination.
Sadly, neither Powell nor Francis would ever win an Oscar----Julia Roberts indeed!
Now, while these picaresque episodes are indeed exotic, weird and funny, it is Fellini's vision that makes this film unique viewing.
A slight loss for affecting drama and a few borrowed elements from notable predecessors can't detract from the amazing journey at hand, one brilliantly entertaining and curious indeed.
Oh, what a curious case indeed.
Possibly the most anticipated winter film of 2008, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a curious film indeed.
Life in itself is indeed very, very curious and Benjamin Button is no less of a wonder.
Hence the jam in the phone booth with a girl you want becomes eventually more important than a lively fantasy you may live Âlike the movie fulfills indeed - with your own calendar girl.
It's probably no stretch to say that, yes indeed, everybody liked Ike.
Upon learning that there was indeed a survivor, the killers set about erasing Jeb from the planet, thus Jeb spends all his life trying to find out what the hell is going on, and just why did his adoptive mother raise him in the first place?
It's all fairly well paced and taut; director Lewis Allen isn't usually named as one of the greats in the genre and indeed he doesn't seem to know what to do with all of the too-large cast in the short running time, but the basics work out pretty well, and Sinatra's tormented, sweaty and nervous characterization makes the film a must for devotees of the psychopath.
While the film has some very special moments I do feel that with extra funding this could have been very special indeed.
"Outlander" is a wonderful adventure and a great surprise for me indeed.
"Singapore Sling" is indeed one of the craziest Euro-cult movies ever released; a totally 100% original hybrid between 1940's film-noir and relentless 1970's drive-in exploitation, shot in elegant black and white and introducing some of the most eccentric characters movie-goers have ever beheld.
Other than that - a fine exploit film indeed...9/10
Let me first say that this film is indeed a work of art - it is lyrical, spiritual and visually intriguing.
Few would argue that this is not King Hu's masterpiece and indeed it is just that a masterpiece.
Spanish cinematography is indeed the finest!
And indeed, the fighting sequences are brilliantly done - there definitely has been no progress since 1969 - but there is not only that.
The acting is brilliant, and especially a more masterly 'great master' character, a monk in Hsia Nu, would indeed be difficult to find in any martial arts movie.
I am not sure whether this was the intention of the director Julio Medem, or whether his screenplay is indeed only confused.
Very poor indeed.
Again, because of Genet's own tastes, there is an element of sado-masochism mixed into the eroticism: indeed, all the characters but one are oppressed prisoners, literally in "bondage."
It did indeed.
If one likes poetry, they will indeed enjoy this movie.
The story is well written, nicely paced and very artistic indeed.
But there is the great Bollywood quality in this movie with the significant and magnificent set and locations...the locations were artificial and it was a great hard work which i understand by the producers...Salman and Rani portrayed their roles indeed great than any other movie..The songs were beautiful..But the story could have been more tight on audience with ups and downs......There were such scenes in this movie which were unnecessary like the jumping over puddles and those things...The 1960's set's concept was mind blowing and the lighting and makeup and the technical background was superb i should say...
It is indeed a totally new way of making a movie and for me it strengthen the believe that if some one can bring Oscar to Sub Continent then it has to be SLB's art of perfection...
The sheriff reluctantly agrees, takes the boss's woman home, and relieves his frustrations on her before trying to carry the Indian awayÂ   Meyer does indeed have a fascination for very richly gifted women, and this film is no exceptionÂ The scene where Bolger talks the nurse into giving him a body massage is a classic erotic teaseÂ Also, Meyer has very cleverly juxtaposed a sensual lesbian scene against a bloody battle between the sheriff and the IndianÂ But much of the sex is unmotivatedÂ Meyer cuts so quickly, however, that it is more of a lack of respect tease than an exploitive treatment of sexÂ   Larissa Ely (Raquel) is wonderful as the steamy, sweaty, desert young womanÂ Linda Ashton (Cherry) is delightful as the sexy nurse, but Charles Napier steals the show as the violent, explosive, cruel of a sheriffÂ
Seeing a gold mine and wins with Nanu as his athlete on campus, Coach Archer lures him to their university, where Nanu indeed excels in sports, but also feels homesick.
Good news for all admirers: this film is now indeed out on DVD (2006 release), with an interesting lengthy text biography of the novel's author (Vita Sackville-West) among the special features.
It is indeed a most beautiful heartfelt movie that is timeless, as it touches aspects of life that cannot be lost with changes over the decades.
This is indeed an odd flick and I assume Bogart agreed to star in it because it more closely represented his real-life political and social beliefs.
But those positive elements are indeed present.
Here's something new, a film about HIV/AIDS that doesn't use the words "HIV" or "AIDS", doesn't have any significant gay content, and doesn't focus on sexual transmission - or indeed on sexual relationships; the sex in the movie is mainly about exploitation of one kind or another.
Madrid indeed offers Europe's most intense nightlife, and it is depicted to the hilt in this wild film.
Warren William used to play ruthless bosses and all out cads, and while his role here is good and he gets to do some sleazy arguing and engineer some tricks on Mae West, GWYM was indeed a big step down for him.
It is indeed a mild comedy, but the script was somewhat more educated about how India really is.
It is also quite remarkable that both authors are not Indian: asking my Mumbai-native friends for a reality check, they only confirmed the movie did indeed capture a good realistic snapshot of what India is like.
Most of the favorable reviews are indeed for the dance and music in the movie, not for the film itself.
The joyous answer is that indeed it does.
Funny stuff indeed.
It's people are hitherto untouched by war , or indeed much of the outside world.
It may even sound "cheesy" at some points but it's indeed one sweet anti-war movie!
Whatever the case, the acting is first rate and I think the film should in the coming months gain worldwide renown ( if indeed it is diffused in other countries than France ).
If the whole movie had been like this few minutes of good humoured hoofing from a guy who knew how, then it would've been a very pleasant experience indeed.
In fact, if imitation is indeed the sincerest form of flattery, this original version of the Lost World should be blushing from the attention!
After making a tremendous, indeed, outrageous, sacrifice for her, he discovers it is all an utter waste.
Yet the "10 attitudes" or Ten Chances for Love (as it is known here) are UNIVERSAL, and the film makes its point very well indeed.
She looked beautiful in her plain clothing and makeup, a nice change indeed.
In this process, first I watched Page 3 (by Madhur Bhandarkar), and then Satta (again by Bhandarkar) and after viewing these movies, I realised that I indeed was missing some thing in life.
The one character I liked was Rakesh...the mixture of neither feeling he belongs in America fully, but at the same time knowing he cant go back, and dealing with both realizations is indeed something many expats go through (altho' I haven't heard the term second class citizen too many times these days).
This man, if the story is indeed based on fact, was totally lacking in any redeeming characteristics; cruel to his "friends," unattractive physically, a thief, liar, con man, a criminal, violent, talentless and ignorant.
The Butcher is indeed all of those things.
It is indeed (or at least was) one of the better toons on TV.
Well, I read in some of the reviews here that the story is not really highly original and that is indeed true.
There are indeed moments of rallies, door to door campaigning and even the occasional shouting match, but the overall effect of the editing is more Fahrenheit 911 than a true documentary.
)This indeed is one of those films that is so bad it's almost good.
I sat down and watched this the other weekend, and I have to say that it was indeed very enjoyable; and has been permanantly added to our DVD collection.
This Harold Lloyd short film is very funny indeed!
Overall, if I was to describe this film in three words they would be very funny indeed!  
Fluffy indeed.
in his shirtsleeves); absolute confusion as whether these nurses were Red Cross (civilians) or U.S. Army and Navy; the usual tiresome 1940's litany of wisecracks; not a single, solitary mention of the U.S. Army medics and Navy Hospital Corpsmen who, unlike the nurses, indeed WERE in the front lines, decimated, and left behind with their patients (no Australia for them); Claudette Colbert and Paulette Goddard obviously too old for their roles; Veronica Lake with hair shoulder length; endless, childish cat fights; and a scene with Veronica Lake, Japanese soldiers (who don't fire but obligingly gather around), and a hand grenade which has no competition for the 20th Century's Prize for the Hands Down Stupidest Scene Ever Filmed in a War Movie.
It indeed is a gem in a plastic box.
The reporter in Citizen Kane is an experienced hack who is indifferent except to the front page; Agnieska is at the start of her possible career, making her graduation film, the one which will make her name and determine her future and looking for a story that matters in itself; indeed, Agnieska's story is as important to the film as Birkut's and in some ways her story reflects his.
It is indeed very different.
Does anyone out there know is this indeed was OSB, or another Sci-Fi TV series title?
All of the narratives were recorded all across the U.S when many of the former slaves were very old in age.All of the stories were then put into an anthology on which this film is based.This is indeed a film everyone should watch and learn from.
and indeed, when you have ever been to London (or England) for a longer period of time than you will be able to see that story and characters could happen everyday in everybody's life.
  Although not classified as a film for TV, `Wonderland' is very much in the style of a production for that media, and indeed might even be classified as `soap-opera'.
Here indeed is a richly rewarding 100-odd minutes of your time.
The acts of violence that the prisoners perpetrate on their victims and each other are conveyed by the filmmaker with a dispassionate efficiency and awe-inspiring swiftness that are indeed chilling.
A safe bet  Brazilian cinema is getting stronger, indeed.
Again, it is a very good movie, Hector Babenco talent and the cast talent make the experience of watching it pretty good, and it is indeed one of the best movies of the last years.
While there indeed a few "what in the hell were they thinking" moments in the chase scenes, I felt that on the whole, the movie was a wonderful success, gripping me in a way that T3 never came close to.
And indeed if our visitors are actually our closest relatives and living here on earth too.
Presumably the powers that be rejected the idea of making Billy Joe black--and there is some justification there, for Gentry never said he was, and if indeed he was black the entire plot of the film would be obvious the instant the character appeared on the screen.
Eccentric indeed.
What lucky people they are, indeed!
At this critical juncture it becomes manifestly clear that God, after all, is indeed a damnable thing.
For some reason this film was not as successful as other Mike Myers' efforts such as the Wayne's Worlds, and it does appear that audiences prefer Myers in character than as himself, and indeed you will come out liking Myers better as his father than as his main role, but nevertheless a great movie!
It went by a host of AKA names, some such as 'Bloodbath' and 'Carnage' were indeed accurate descriptions, but whatever the title, it comes highly recommended as arguably the most influential film from one of the most important horror film-makers ever.
It's obvious what will happen next, and indeed it does.
Many films on the Video Nasty list are horror cinema's answer to well-respected classics; The Last House on the Left offers a new spin on Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring, Island of Death is a more brutal telling of the story of Bonnie and Clyde and, indeed, this Mario Bava film owes its plot to the French classic, La Ronde.
This film would be properly categorised as a slasher, but its Italian roots ensure that it's often labelled a Giallo, and indeed Mario Bava does include Giallo elements; from black gloved killers and an array of odd characters, all the way to an amazingly convoluted plot.
Very clever indeed.
Although they are indeed fascinating, their performances are distinctly out of synch with the rest of the film, where a more natural style of acting is the norm.
Earlier in this review I made mention of the film's supposed flaws, and Grand Hotel is indeed far from perfect; many of the cuts are rough and uneven, and some of the plot developments come off as sudden and unbelievable, but the film is only better for it.
The Baron is a bankrupted noble, a very gentle and refined person, but indeed a thief of hotel rooms.
The style of acting you see here is old fashioned indeed, no one could remake Grand Hotel today in the same style.
This isn't the worst film ever but it's certainly a very bad, cheesy, poorly acted, amateurish title in the "Jason" series and the fact that it was indeed NOT the last "Friday the 13th" film is rather ironic in itself.
After Jason was killed in the last 8 entries, it seems rather stupid to try and explain that this would indeed be the last time, especially since they would go back on their word, also their Final Chapter was hardly the last.
Anders Randolf & Sam De Grasse are the black-hearted pirate captain & lieutenant whom Doug must contend with and they are nasty indeed.
Chaney was indeed the child of two deaf mute parents - he got his gift for pantomime in communicating with them.
Yes, he is indeed!
Several scenes might strike one as being more appropriate for a documentary: indeed, were it not for the fact the film is re-enacting the 1990s effort at animal conservation, "Kekexili" might better be made as a non-fiction picture.
Several scenes in the film have made their way into my head and are most disturbing indeed.
Meadows also gets across the element of humour early on in his film; indeed, when you see Herbie (Wolfenden) trundle down the road in his Citroen 2CV with the other guys in the back, you cannot help but smirk at how real this all feels; at how these people are presented as people who live, breath, hang around in apartments and drive obscure cars.
Screwed was indeed funny, much more so than for example, Anchorman.
And after the credits roll, I found it to be a film that stayed with me for some time after - indeed, I am still trying to shake it from my mind.
It is no secret that the immigrant workforce in California and indeed of much of America is the foundation of our economy, which is why it should have been so obvious of how little there was to do with the premise of Mexicans disappearing and leaving all of the poor, helpless Americans to pick their own lettuce and tomatoes.
The telepathic murders are gruesome indeed - who could ever forget that scene with the fire poker, talk about your phallic imagery!!
Some of the cameos are fun, and newcomer Michelle Burke has a nice presence as teenager Connie Conehead, but this is otherwise forgettable stuff indeed.
The brutality and vulgar cruelty - bested upon Anthony (a very good turn by Kebbell making for very empathetic/sympathetic victim needing to be vanquished) whose only crime was not knowing the common sense in seeing just how ugly his new 'friends' could be (again told in a certain amount of restraint in the scratchy black and white sequences, jarring as they are) - indeed are in need for swift retribution and when we first see Richard, a slight, malnourished pasty-white, scratchily bearded, porcupiney scalp of Considine's character we assume he is just one of the unassuming, local blokes of the pub/ pool hall that one of the goons is dealing drugs in.
Although I am not familiar with filmmaker Meadows and his previous films (and his collaboration with Considine including this script with a credit to Paul Fraser as well) he has a keen eye for detail and how to set an appropriate tone of absolute dread (nods to ace work done by composer Aphex Twin (AKA Richard James), Danny Cohen's cinematography and the editing team of Celia Haining, Lucas Roche and Chris Wyatt all make for moments of absolute dread and unease); a compliment indeed.
The fact that there some people in the audience crying and others sat in silence after the movie had finished, showed that the movie had indeed touched all of us.
It is indeed a bold step of shining the light on a dark period of recent history but "Amu the Movie" , is the step is taken in the right direction.
A follow-up theatrical release of GAME OF DEATH with a reworked beginning (omitting none of the available footage in its present form) would be worth paying to see, indeed.
Court records indicate that Henri Charriere (Steve McQueen) later called " Papillon " which is french for Butterfly, was indeed a minor burglar and safe cracker.
The script by Clive Turner & Freddie Rowe is based on the Howling novels by Gary Brandner takes itself extremely seriously & for the most part is pretty slow going for about 70 minutes with virtually no indication that this film is indeed about Werewolves, one is neither seen nor the word Werewolf mentioned for over an hour.
High praise indeed!
Week by week, however, the show grew on me, and whilst not as glossy as the Swedish show and definitely grittier in terms of their investigations of everyday crimes, it certainly provided a very satisfying weekly viewing meal indeed.
I found that to be the scariest thing about the film, that these depraved people could indeed live next door to me or share a cube at work.
Although the acts of murder and vile mutilation are a major and indeed gruesome part of the plot, there is a more wholesome and intriguing aspect to the film which often neutralises its more shocking elements.
All i can say that i cannot find a single mistake in the movie, The Movie Direction, Shot Composition, Cinematography, Music, Acting all were Absolutely Perfect  John Abraham's Acting was really Flawless, as for Priyanka's Role, As far as i can say A Very Hard Hitting Challenging role it was indeed it was by far her Best Performance,   Direction was like WOW!!!
If indeed the story calls for an albino I'd expect any respectable casting agent to go out and find such a person.
This is indeed a GEM that needs to be uncovered.
An 9 indeed!
Julie indeed killed Franck, because he resisted her attempts to seduce him.
I did not dislike this movie, but I believe it is indeed an excellent idea, wasted in a very disappointing conclusion.
Perhaps this reflects a view that 1914 was the year that witnessed the modern age's loss of innocence and that the history of the twentieth century would have been immeasurably happier if the First World War had indeed been averted.
He was a hero meerkat, indeed.
A small tribe being abducted to be sacrificed did indeed happen in the time of the film 1517 & 1518 the Post Classical Maya period.
And indeed he simply seems to float along the stream of life so that events occur TO him; rather than he be in control of his life.
But this is obviously a movie you don't need to watch in a single sitting; indeed, for the reason stated above, it's perhaps best watched a little at a time.
Yes, indeed.
Well, indeed, it's hard to find an uncut one, mostly they clock in at 88 minutes, my version was the double disc from Schriek Show.
And the acting is indeed a joy to watch, particularly the great Tony Shalhoub, who is so often under-used.
Even though the narrative was indeed disjointed, if you have the attention span, you can figure it out.
Echavaria show he is indeed the new J.C. Van Damme(Average acting, Great fight scenes)But the coolest part has to be the chemistry between Echavaria and Kong Li(Kickboxer's Tong Po)They Try to Copy the Rush hour routine and succeed.
Letterman is mostly a likable guy and can at times be very witty, and of course satirical, which is something about him (as indeed his writers) that I enjoy.
Anyway - after they finished painting them & went inside the camera remained outside, for several minutes - while the viewer did indeed "watch paint dry".
To be fair,this was a mildly interesting idea at it's inception,and would've been just about acceptable for one series.But such has been the dumbing down of UK TV,and indeed seemingly British society as a whole in the new millennium,that the powers that be at CHANNEL FOUR have elongated this woefully thin concept to at the time of writing,an eighth series.What is disturbing is that this has led on to other tawdry reality shows springing up on other UK TV channels (I'M A CELEBRITY GET ME OUT OF HERE,LOVE ISLAND,THE FARM,CELEBRITY WRESTLING,even CELEBRITY DETOX,CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER,etc,etc,etc...)like unplanned illegitimate sprogs,with the British viewing public acting as unprepared,unwilling parents.The aforementioned programmes are virtually as tedious,dreary,lazy,banal and pointless as this one,but BIG BROTHER is wholly deserving of the lowest possible vote because it is possibly the main cause of the shallow brainlessness pervading most of UK popular culture in contemporary Britain.For example,the only so-called "celebrity magazines" at the turn of the century were the highly resistible OK and HELLO!,whose sickly,ghastly and vomit-inducing sycophancy to various public figures (most with very minor talents) was initially mocked by comedians,satirists and journalists,but even this mickey-taking soon became passÃ© as it didn't seem funny to mock something which was already too unintentionally amusing to begin with anyway.
Anyway, the good part of the movie is indeed the gore.
As to the one comment in the discussion section, yes, Mariel does indeed look a tad 'Manish' (except for the lovely set displayed in the shower of course : ) but ever since seeing 'PERSONAL BEST' (cough...) I'm afraid that I've been quite taken with her (and THAT was PRE-implants!!!)
This movie indeed is a shameless ALIEN rip-off.
In fact, although the cover describes it as "The cult BBC Science Fiction film", I'd hesitate to call it science fiction; indeed, I'd hesitate to label it anything at all.
To some it may seem intolerably slow & lacking pace, but to others like myself the Film does something that nearly all Films in the Fifties and indeed many now do not even attempt to achieve, and that is take the time to investigate the main characters in depth and in detail.
Particularly profound is the scene in the tent with Claudius where he seriously, and with an almost profound regret asks Claudius if he is indeed mad.
Someone else here has written that this series has everything, and indeed it does.
I found this a message of lifelong importance in both politics and management, and it is rare indeed that such a remarkable piece of drama and entertainment is also so fundamentally educational.
Unfortunately, he was also the director on this project, which explains the inability of the director to add a different perspective on the written work, and a 3.8/10 rating here at IMDb would seem to support the fact that something did, indeed, go wrong.
But all the possible merits this movie has, can't prevent you from feeling you are indeed watching a trashy Euro-Horror flick.
I hope younger homosexuals will not disparage the old-fashion-ness or the lack of modern day cinematic sophistication of this outstanding piece of film work: indeed a thing of beauty and a joy forever.
I picked this DVD off the shelf and flipped it around, looking for the tipoff that this was, indeed, a British flick, since it is called "For Queen and Country".
At the end of the movie Elliot says that "it's a long story"; very long, indeed, particularly when one considers that there isn't enough actual plot to even fill a 25-minute TV episode of any "Tales of the Something or Other" type of show.
It's a laid back gem indeed.
"Taken at the flood" is in my opinion the best, and indeed the most dark and haunting, of this year's films from the Poirot team.
Until the monster really begins to strike the film is a very British affair, stiff upper lips and tightly controlled and when the monster does strike the reactions to it are British indeed, making for some chuckle worthy lines of dialogue.
Worth it indeed for Sun RA and some Jazz fans.
The time has run away from this movie indeed but forget that when you see this.
This is a rare film indeed.
I saw that the film got quite a few bad reviews on the net (and indeed on here).
I think possibly some might not get the accents, or indeed the feel of the film - ultimately, to really enjoy the film, you have to have lived in Swansea to get the most out of it, as if you have, a particular location or character will tie in with certain memories you have of the place, whereas otherwise, it might not.
Being a Swansea girl originally, I had no trouble in deciphering the accents...  Swansea is indeed an Ugly, Lovely City, and the stark and honest portrayal of life in the dull valleys of south Wales, where unemployment is high, was a piece of script writing and directing genius.
Serling packs plenty into those twenty minutes and tops it off with a very neat twist indeed.
BUT, I must admit that I was very glad to discover, that this comedy was very funny indeed!
That is indeed quite weird, but maybe YOU and I didn't even notice.....someone is missing at the end of the movie.......
When a person is at that point, the people with whom they connect are indeed rare.
Wilbur indeed wants to kill himself, tries and tries again, so that you immediately understand from the onset that the point of the film will be his finding a reason not to.
However, it startles me to discover just how obscure the film has now become; indeed, much of our country's cinematic output has long vanished from public knowledge, an unfortunate consequence of our ever-growing reliance on Hollywood.
Several commentators have claimed that the filmmakers deliberately stretched the truth in their advertisements to entice larger audiences (indeed, the film travelled the world for more than twenty years and achieved phenomenal commercial success).
Sadly, the past tense is appropriate here, as the film is now not known to survive except in fragments ... and some of those do indeed appear to be out-takes, as a previous IMDb'er has noted.
Being a devoted Michael Caine fan I was horrified after watching "Shadow Run" that I indeed had spent money on the DVD.
I, like most other contributors, had bought this film for 99p merely because Michael Caine was in it, and then I read that someone else paid only 97 pence, I was indeed robbed!
Movies that can present the extremes as mundane are dull indeed and this is one of them.
Certain elements of the film are rather nasty, and indeed the book was originally denied by many different publishers for being too graphic!
stacks of shoes, dismembered traffic jams and indeed Bed sitting rooms clog up the toxic horizon, all glum and desolate, you half believe the story, as the landscape seems sort of real.
Through research I was convinced that I had, indeed, seen the entire thing.
This recent Astro Boy movie is indeed, in my opinion, a good way of reintroducing Astro Boy to a younger generation.
Inevitably, the movie keeps itself faithful with the source material on Astro Boy's origins but there are indeed many little alterations made in order to update this Astro Boy as being this generation's version.
It is indeed worth your time & your money if you are looking for a family-friendly movie this week.
so i would have been more than glad to give this movie high praise if indeed it was worthy of it.
This great thriller will live longer indeed.
and in quantum freak- a spin off of the 90s US show, Quantum leap-,there is even a short but famous scene taken from the film, The Graduate where Mrs Robinson shows off her legs, or indeed one of them in front of our superhero.
If this is indeed cut to bits like I've read, the original must have been fantastic.
As far a "values" go, the movie contains some disturbingly twisted messages that most people could find indeed offensive.
Other joys of the film are the delightful vignettes, such as a dipsomaniacal country doctor's tirade against journalists (In vino veritas, indeed!)
"Shivers" is the first movie of this great Canadian cult director David Cronenberg, indeed a very low budget trash movie, with a final cost of US$ 179.000,00.
When the locals find out that indeed she was expelled from the Navy because of sexual deviation (i.e., lesbianism), she is discriminated and rejected by them.
There's people shopping downtown, there's people getting their hair cut, there's people at the baseball game, all of these people everywhere give the impression that the city is indeed full of people and adds to the mood and atmosphere of the movie.
Very Russian, indeed, and viscerally impressive; extremely atmospheric, suggestive, rich in urban life touches, with a strong load of eroticism in quite a few scenes, naturalistic and brutal in some respects, harsh as tone and bleakÂin many ways, rather unlike Kurosawa's ulterior elegiac and lyrical success IKIRU.
I guess if you've got a Patsy or Liz 'thing' you might put up with this, indeed there is an occasional Hurley boob flash.
For someone who had directed mostly (if not almost all) musicals throughout his career, and indeed made his name on Broadway before winning his Oscar for Cabaret (beating out Coppola for the Godfather no less), Bob Fosse was the last person I would figure directed a film about the iconoclast comedian Lenny Bruce.
But 'Lenny' was indeed a Broadway play by Julian Barry, and here he makes it into something that works extremely well cinematically, and at the same time has that appeal of the theater, of that rush that comes from seeing someone like Fosse direct or Bruce on stage.
However the pacing is slow and given that we know the pathetic final reel (indeed it is used as the first reel and we work backwards!)
I'm not so much of a fan, but indeed found this movie to be quite the entertaining adventure.
The film is often said to be a rip off of The Dirty Dozen (and indeed, the tagline nods to this) although having (unbelievably) not seen The Dirty Dozen myself, I can't really comment on that.
If 'words' are indeed 'power', then here in this film for all to see was a MAGNET of a man, a beacon.
You don't need to think too much about it, indeed you only need to be conscious to see this one.
Several hours later he is neither tipsy nor showing any ill effects (or indeed effects of any kind) whatsoever.
That is high praise indeed.
Aslan, indeed, is on the move!
Temple is very good indeed as a teenager; her teenaged films are for me the best of her filmic outings.
When he tries to get one he is effectively laughed at since he is 28-years-old and is very much out of practice and indeed never really practiced that much.
I think this is a more of a woman's picture than a man's, indeed it is a 'weepie'.
Bravo indeed.
But these are two very powerful performances indeed.
So, indeed, Grave of the Fireflies is bleak as hell, but compelling because it doesn't stray from its path with these characters, and that in many scenes we're connected to them without the overbearing heart-tugs of a common Disney feature (though, ironically, as Ebert points out on an interview with the DVD, the big eyes in most anime is based upon those in early Disney films).
Ghibli have rarely produced anime that doesn't fall short of great but Graveyard is something different indeed.
The animation though detailed and indeed beautiful in some sequences (namely relating to the title), is not by any means flashy but captures emotions and interactions between the characters perfectly.
An incredible package indeed, and this applies to the entire production.
My only regret is that they did not make sequels out of the second and third Lavransdatter novels to complete the trilogy, since, indeed, the ending of the movie and of the first novel leave you hungering for more.
In this anime, you'll learn about true friendship, love, loneliness, the consequences of the past, and life indeed... not to mention the super packed action scenes.
Bebop is a solid watch indeed.
As usual Gary proves able to sculpt a sympathetic protagonist who is able to win over the audience into rooting for him regardless of the sometimes violent methods he uses to defeat his foes and here his vengeance against the criminal fraternity who destroyed his family and friends is nothing short of apocalyptic.As well as the superb physical skills that Gary brings to his performances he is capable of portraying strong human emotions also.He is always very effective indeed in scenes involving children and it can be no accident that he is often cast as a father in his films.Martial arts are absent from this tale until the final thirty minutes and when they finally appear in a series of brutal and superbly well choreographed fights you realise that you are watching a master at work.There are simply no current screen martial arts stars (Chinese,European or American)who could have brought what Gary Daniels brings to this role.This is a movie that should be sought by anyone who professes to enjoy action and if they enjoyed it half as much as I did then it won't be long before they seek out other Gary Daniels movies.They won't be disappointed,if anyone working in this genre delivers the kind of energy that Gary Daniels does in every role then they are being very quiet about it.Keep the British flag flying Gary for there isn't any young actor in the UK today who looks as if they even have the strength to even lift the flag up.Only the US is capable of producing a movie like RECOIL and long may they continue.
Bunuel's humor is always taken to the profane as many judge, but indeed is just another evidence of how reality often times makes us uncomfortable even in our own privacy.
A durable tale indeed.
I much rather prefer divertis, but the movie itself is indeed not bad all things considered.
I also thought Angelina was perfect for the role of julia/bonnie she really captures the essence of the femme fatale and I greatly sympathized with her character she wasn't really playing a villain she was more influenced by her accomplice/lover Billy who manipulates and twists her mind into thinking that no one could ever love her.In my opinion Julia/Bonnie was struggling with inner emotions and was even more confused by what she was feeling for Luis which is why she tries her hardest to deny that Luis does indeed love her.
It would seem that this portion of the film presents the harshness of an authoritarian regime as misdirected and even naÃ¯ve rather than inherently evil, although it is equally likely (and, indeed, probably more so) that it is a message to those very regimes (specifically that of Franco) of the reality of their form of government.
He builds a sumptuous, even fastidious, set, decorates it with some rather good actors, and uses highly toned up coloring, no doubt as if to add insult to grievous occular harm, which, for 1870 New York, was indeed a gross insolence and incoherent injustice.
Yes, indeed, the zombies are quite acceptable in this movie and act according to the standard model of zombie behavior.
Yet in the end, when Bernie got what he originally wanted, he discovered it was no longer so as he learned how much Simon/Kutcher really loved his daughter and that Simon indeed had principles even if he didn't play sports...  Opposites attract, plain and simple - Simon is businessman and Theresa is an artist...
The title is fitting; indeed, even if we may think otherwise, Charlie is the one who ends up learning from things.
Was it indeed in CearÃ¡?
Ideologically, there are indeed some problems in dealing with this material three enlightened (?)
These days, it's hard to imagine that there was indeed an erotic cinema before EMMANUELLE as the film's style as well as its substance have forever influenced and perhaps tainted the genre since with its exotic locations, lifestyles of the idle rich and empty philosophies on the nature of love, fidelity and jealousy.
One owes it to oneself, and indeed to the world in general, to experience physical pleasure in as many ways as possible, with as many partners as possible, and to liberate oneself from all ways of thinking that might hinder one from this aim.
This movie deserves a slap in the face to wake it up a bit...but no...terminal cuteness indeed.
The story had indeed some emotional involvements and was above the average.
M. Batignole is a timid hero indeed but a genuine hero nonetheless.
The story begs the question to the Priest and, indeed to all of us; would we do the "right thing", if we were put into such a position.
It indeed is a one of a kind movie.
While the characters and situation are indeed taken from the book, The Fugitive is radically different, not just in the manner in which the main characters are treated, but more importantly, in the message it carries.
For the majority Death Race is way too brash, ugly and destructive to appeal, indeed the car scenes are messily edited and repeated.
Victoria & Albert is a good mini-series from the BBC capturing the ambiance of the early Victorian era very well indeed.
Those whose tastes run in that direction will be very pleased indeed.
Fortunately, the hype was well-deserved because this is indeed an excellent movie.
I did see it on TCM and although the theme was indeed on homophobia and the like in movies over the years, I hated seeing her glossed over in the commentary afterward.
For a movie coming from Peru, I think it was very good, but it cannot stand with international standards: most of the actors were pathetic:) Now, don't understand me wrong, the movie is nice, and I recommend it, BUT is still far away from the Italian neo-realism (It is indeed a neo-realist film..) and WAY far away from the Taxi Driver, that many people compare it with.
Its exquisite and unique shots differentiate the movie from many others - turning what would otherwise be a boring scene into something that at times feels like a stunningly incredible cross between the animated scenery of The Nightmare Before Christmas (indeed, the animations were done by the same person in both movies) and a presentation of Jules Verne's 20000 Leagues Under the Sea.
DiCaprio is, indeed, excellent as a young man searching for life's ultimate experiences, and getting more than he bargained for.
When I first learned that it was indeed a Danny Boyle film I was a bit disappointed that it didn't have any of his "original" cast members... the people that he always works with.
It's had its greatest success on TV ('The Twilight Zone', 'Outer Limits', HBO's 'Tales From The Crypt'), and therefore every filmic variation will indeed suffer by the comparison of style and substance to what had been set before.
It should come as no surprise, however, that there has indeed been more bad than good horror anthology films.
The fairly complex structure and unexpected plot twists also always stay several steps ahead of you ... indeed, like a hard-to-solve puzzle.
title "Puzzle" fits the film just as well, as this is indeed a highly compelling and intelligent puzzle, which is capable of stunning the viewer from the first minute.
Naka, the man responsible for the entire Sonic series, NiGHTS, Phantasy Star Online among many other classic, and indeed pioneering games, has added another gem to his CV with Sonic Adventure 2.
The line between madness and normalcy is a thin one indeed and there are many disturbing lessons to be gained from watching this small but well-done film.
Lynch will never tell us what any of his films are about - if indeed he knows or would ever admit that a film might be about something in particular.
In the mean time, there's a ghastly mortician who likes to dissect things (While eating his lunch) who confirms that the mutilated bodies are indeed the work of an aquanoid.
This film is indeed about more than 'plot', though it hangs on the path of a man who is shown going about his typical, elliptical life in London, where he seems to be a holed-up DJ for some obscure station.
Her character, Eve Gill, is basically a petty schoolgirl, driven by silly but unwavering aspirations to uncover the truth, and her delicate personality is punctuated by moments of stubbornness, and, indeed, some occasional bravery.
She returns to London and finds out that indeed, Jonathan is the prime suspect.
But no, indeed this seems to have more than a touch of cinematographer, Nick Roeg.
Trouble ahead, trouble behind indeed.
The result is indeed refreshing.
On the other hand, if you can leave this movie without a burning indignation that any American child of any race should have to struggle just to have a place to sleep, you must be cynical indeed.
Please, don't let the audience think for a second that the main character may have indeed been protecting his life and property which was being burgled every night.
Linden Ashby is the most striking doppelganger; indeed, he seems to be a physical reincarnation of Morgan Earp.
So in summary this movie is indeed a nightmare for the viewer.
certain scenes are indeed quite disturbing; malcolm's slicing off of a victim's fingers during an interrogation, malcolm's massacre of a gypsy family led by christopher lee and malcolm's subsequent rape of the scientist's beautiful daughter (kay lenz) after removing his nazi branded briefs (charming).
A lovely, lyrical examination of lesbian love - and indeed love and life in general - throughout three very different decades.
It is indeed an underrated comedy show, IMHO.
This film as some have noted is not only a very specific account of a possibly schizophrenic man, but also a study of urban angst, a depiction of how crazy-making urban spaces can become for every person who approaches them without armor.Michael Atkinson's statement about this is perhaps a bit too sweeping Â- "Keane" (he says) "is a painfully specific figure but at the same time a totem, lean and frightening, for a morass of modern anxieties" Â- but the borderline between Keane and us does indeed at times become hauntingly blurred.
If there are half a dozen or so worser films from the last decade; indeed two decades; indeed half a dozen decades; indeed EVER; then we all, collectively as a human race, ought to hang our heads in shame.
Date Movie has indeed earned a well deserved place in IMDb's bottom 100.
Hoyt Axton is indeed a hoot as the inept inventor, and Keye Luke is great as the Grandfather(Mr Wing).
Nostalgic purposes, indeed.
And it does indeed entertain.
This is, indeed, instructive.
This movie, simply put, is Charles Bronson at his absolute best, and proves that he does indeed have the ability to handle drama/suspense.
I'm not indeed an adolescent, but definitively I have fall in love with this girl.
But there needs to be either more context with this character (and, indeed, a version of this film- a mini-series for Swedish TV- is double the length), or nothing at all, as everything that needs to be said about the strife in the two of them is actually there in the sub-plot with the angered villager Nordenson.
The jealousy she exudes is almost tangible and the pathos of the character's end is touching indeed Â she truly deserves a reputable mention.
This is indeed appropriate.
A dark moment, indeed.
For entertainment and for a picture of life for black musicians of the time this is indeed good.
And, indeed, rather risque for its day since there is a supposition at one point that Ann Harding's character, Joan, in trying to trap William Powell into marriage, is giving pre-marital favors and is actually caught in the process.
I guess the people waiting for a 20yo to play an "adult" are indeed going to be disappointed, but let's leave those thinking about the absurdity of their expectations.
To them, I'm sure it does appear to be a strange world indeed.
But the real star is indeed Percy Kilbride, better known from the Ma and Pa Kettle films.
I think Wagner is used better here than in the chopper scene in Apocolypse Now and that is high praise indeed, because that is one of the most magnificent scenes in all of film.
Anyone seeing this movie will be moved to believing that one day Arthur may indeed return to redeem us all.
The armour, weapons and castles all look very authentic, and indeed it is in the battle sequences that the film excels, especially due to the stirring music selected to accompany each pivotal scene.
A joy to watch such old - and smart - b&w (Hitchcock-stylish, indeed) Hollywood at its best, and an especially juicy box of chocolates for movie lovers and cinephiles, with all the famous real-life star faces... As much as "Singin' in the rain" a terrific movie about the film industry itself, a non-flinching self-inventory and the changing of the times pushing old stars out of the spotlight, with a truly great, moving portrait by Swanson.
They had indeed, especially after this searing comment on celebrity status.
On paper, a comic fable about a randy, drunken, fading poet sounds like a recipe for disaster, but to the enormous credit of all involved, this film works very well indeed.
With all the negative news about LIza in the past decade or so, some people tend to forget that in the two decades after CABARET Liza was indeed a superstar of the first magnitude - if her movie career never really took off (remember duds like LUCKY LADY and A MATTER OF TIME?
", "Where There's a Whip, There's a Way" and "The Ballad of Frodo of the Nine Fingers and the Ring of Doom" are all singable, they help the story along (indeed, in the case of "Where There's a Whip, There's a Way," it has the proverbial great beat you can dance to --- or, one presumes, torture your enemies with!)
It didn't win anything, which indeed speaks for itself.
Of course, some say that back in the 30's you never found blacks and whites to be so close, (but indeed there were some and Imitation of Life proved that.)
While not listed in the credits, the dancing ensemble also deserves kudos for their supporting contributions to this singular and indeed historic concert.
Slasher-film wise, it was indeed a slasher flick.
DNA joins aspects of those two films to make something very cliched indeed.
Newhart was indeed a funny and brilliant show without being crude or vulgar.
The one redeeming factor for me was the opportunity for a realistic glimpse of rural Thailand, and some scenes were indeed beautifully photographed.
Looking at voting here people seem to think better of the show, but I know my friend and I who were both watching the show thought the same of it - very little indeed.
But indeed it had its moments.
As I watched, it did indeed go somewhere - downhill.
You know it's a pretty screwed up place because one of its twin queens is played by Elvira and the evil high priest is Henry Silva in one of Diana Ross's old Afro wigs that's seen much better days (as indeed has he).
So there are indeed redeeming moments in this movie.
This is indeed the film that popularized kung fu in the 1970s.
Michael Dudikoff is always well worth watching and many of his movies are great fun, indeed.
The Brotherhood feel it's essential for Kate to accept her heritage so Dr. Barker, Dr. Gauss (Henry Silva) & Dr. Fraser (David Hemmings) devise a programme of conditioning to convince Kate that she is indeed a Vampire who must drink blood.
The idea that a religious Jew could become a Nazi is indeed compelling, but this film never lets the viewer in on the WHY behind the main character (Balint's) decision, so, to continue watching, you just have to take it on faith that for some reason he has his reasons for inspiring a group of fascists to begin executing Jews.
Maybe it's because those Arabians don't do anything throughout this movie except sitting in a castle and riding horses (yes, indeed: Boring!).
There is very little effort (indeed, perhaps none at all) made to make the viewer suspect that perhaps the neighbor is, in fact, nefarious.
It is ashame that the movie disappoints in the end by insinuating that the neighbor was indeed a terrorist.
OH MY GOD, indeed honey, OH MY GOD indeed!
Well, FEARDOTCOM is certainly mindless; indeed, I muttered out loud when the credits were running, "Oh my God!
As a result, that terrorist mastermind directs every aspect of the film, and the erstwhile protagonist is utterly impotent and, indeed, evil.
If the survival of horror films depends on titles such as this "FearDotCom", we are indeed facing the downfall of the genre.
In the age of Cousteau, "Jaws", National Geographic, and the Discovery Channel, there have been tens of thousands of shark fanatics, and indeed there has been a sea change in popular opinion about sharks.
The answer is that organizations such as the CIA are terrorizing innocent individuals and families to foment division among people, to induce individuals (fearing harm to their own family members, and indeed fearing God) to commit crimes on behalf of these organizations even as they fully believe that it is an Islamic extremist group.
Well, indeed, this film is atmospheric.
Well, what a strange film that was indeed...
Indeed the characters and relationships are funny to watch, and indeed the general self-derisional plot (a movie version of a manga about the misdeeds of the manga itself, plus a bank robbery plot with hostages progressively taking the roles of the robbers themselves) could have been of great interest.
I found this nearly unwatchable, indeed, I'm not sure I have paused a movie in Tivo so many times to go do other stuff.
A real life disaster, would indeed probably go down with people crowded in barns, hating each other trying to make due, but so what?
Yes indeed and sadly not one of the better ones I might add.
The Frightening was indeed BAD!!
The characters portrayed in the movie made me feel very less intelligent indeed.
At the club, they're pretty happy watching women dancing, but when the call Truck again they're warned again, and indeed most of the people at the club are vampires!
There can be no question about the polished savvy of the creators here, indeed, their accomplishments seem all that more astonishing.
Why indeed!
This is a poor movie indeed.
As a matter of fact, it is not really comparable to any of the great westerns because it is inherently small and my bottom line is that to the extent that it is worth watching, it is because it was a sincere effort but that is the best I can do and it is faint praise indeed.
But death and torture are his thing indeed.
"Deadgirl" is indeed frightening, but not in the way it's been advertised.
This is the first British comedy - indeed, the fist "British" film of any kind - I have ever walked out of.
These factors combined with the style of the production (with people walking on and off camera much like they'd do it in a play) made me realize early on that I was in for a very long ride, indeed.
Captain Applejack is a most dated item, fortunate indeed to have been preserved in both a silent and sound film.
If you're a film student, this film is indeed technically brilliant.
Surely if the Pixies were indeed 'one of the most influential bands of all-time,' then these secondary sources would be overflowing with information that the filmmaker could have used to place in the Pixies in the context of modern music for viewers who aren't already familiar.
It's a re-watch indeed, but I don't remember ANYTHING from when I first saw it a couple of years back on TV so I decided to re-watch it again.
These people are indigenous French equally Ã©tranger to Christianity or at any rate very open-minded indeed.
Yes, indeed, they have.
It was indeed beautifully shot and the set dressing was perfection.
Woolsey was indeed arrested, but died of his illnesses before reaching the Tower.
By now, most of the Tudors' historical inaccuracies have been well pointed out; indeed, it's safe to say that the only thing that wasn't changed was the names.
Great satire--indeed, great art--is always an examination of *us*, of what *we* are like.
The acting was indeed cheesy and corny at times.
She may indeed feel some disdain for the "lesser" animals she deals with, but she might be forgiven, considering the life she's lead.
I felt sad for the white chick (grilfriend), not because of her colour, but as a women I could relate, when you think you know somebody but and realising that you don't and in such a matter is just so painful....., but on another hand....there was that element for me, of our black brothers going for white chicks... when they are loaded....even though in this movie that wasn't what brought them together.... interesting story indeed...
The list of Christmas films in the past decade that might go on to become beloved classics is short indeed.
Also, the couples' relationships, which come and go between these parties, are unexplained and mostly unexplored, as are some individuals' character changes, and indeed, almost everything that doesn't happen at the parties themselves.  
CinemaScope fluff directed by a water-treading Vincente Minnelli does allow Peck to loosen up for a change, but the screenplay seems to have been written around the opportunities for mini-fashion shows (indeed, costumer Helen Rose devised the movie's premise, which helped win a Best Screenplay Oscar for writer George Wells).
But "Tarzan and Jane" is indeed the worst of Disney sequels, where the story was dope, the characters were boring and aren't as lovable as they were in the original movie, the music was awful, and the animation was rubbish.
(a la "The Producers" storyline) If that is indeed the intent (and it's probably painfully obvious to those in the know) then I have a suspicion that they may have succeeded.
Cutting to the diner and the acting in there was truly awful indeed.
Funny too, because there IS indeed a good film in here somewhere; the story itself is very good, the actors obviously are good.
Saw the movie on TMC and it was indeed a classic.
Some of Alan Menken's music is quite catchy, especially "Mean, Green Mother", and the scenes involving sadistic dentist Steve Martin and masochistic patient Bill Murray are indeed very humorous.
Even when he puts his foot down, like a mischievous child she circumvents and tricks him, which inevitably turns out badly because the thing he was standing for indeed held disastrous consequences.
I'd also like to clarify that Troll 2 has nothing whatsoever to do with 'Troll 1' or indeed a troll or collective trolls.
The special effects in this movie are, indeed, special -- like a one-legged blind woman with Alzheimer's.
(PrÃ©parez vos mouchoirs, indeed).
If they indeed had a script, that would be even scarier.
The back of the DVD shows Seagal holding two guns crosswise - a technique he does not use in this movie - and indeed it's a younger, fitter Seagal holding those guns, wearing that leather jacket.
Live action anime without any action, or indeed any life.
This is indeed a special show that is continuing to pave the way for the facts of our history to finally be told with truth...Instead of the whitewashing we've seen our whole lives to make us feel better about ourselves.
And it is a dirty look, a pornographic eye, indeed, that does the looking.
Pornographer indeed.
In order to hang on to him, she does indeed get pregnant -- it's not a hoax.
The piece is heavily cut for distribution, and editing is very choppy, increasing the episodic nature of a script that consistently meanders, scenes honouring logic being very rare indeed.
No doubt the director thought he was being clever but it makes the story unfathomable and isn't helped by some very poor performances indeed .
Poor Harrison Ford, looking like he hasn't slept in days (and this is BEFORE his family is kidnapped), seems to sense that he is indeed at the nadir of his career and thus turns in a performance that is so lacking in energy and interest that he seems more bored with the material than we are.
This is indeed a true treat for those with an appreciation for smut.
The success of Carpenter's seminal flick was indeed responsible for the peak in the cycle, but Friday the 13th must take its share of credit for launching the mass of killer in the woods titles, which included Don't go in the Woods, Just Before Dawn, The Prey and more recently Camp Blood.
And oh...was it just my imagination, or was that indeed an anal sex joke that Nino pulls on Edwige at the film's tail end?
A very dangerous plan indeed, but the military isn't given the opportunity of coming up with laughably absurd ideas and then having them work.
I couldn't relate to the humor, if indeed humor was the aim, and when Chris Tuker speaks I get angry.
Yes, indeed, there may be worse movies.
Suddenly the film's much-touted "farce" status becomes realized and obvious, with a series of odd events, some of which, indeed, mock "traditional romance themes" (e.g.
a difficult task indeed.
"The Bat" is indeed a very silly low budget mystery film.
Now I understand that it was popular among some Horror fans because it's indeed a horrible movie.
And I will agree with auwhite that it was indeed very disturbing when, let's just say, certain aspects of her wardrobe were missing, and that part of her body was sticking right out in front of the camera.
why indeed would carradine even think of acting along with her.
Yes, it had the very occasional laughs, but very few indeed.
And indeed the underwater scenes provide the film's most interesting moments, especially the evocative images of the zombified captain swimming up from the depths to claim more victims.
Zombies living in lakes or waterlogged conditions are of course nothing new, with Jean Rollin's ZOMBIE LAKE being perhaps the most well known example aside from Carpenter's THE FOG, which may indeed have been inspired in part by DARK ECHO's basic story.
The underground setting alone should be overflowing with great shots (and indeed many of the sets look wonderful; it is the way they are used that wastes them).
It seemed to have a different tone from the beginning and indeed it managed to keep the same feel through most of the film.
But then, near the end Sarah's character tells Hilary that her friend falling was indeed and accident, leaving the viewer bewildered as to most of the antics the frat did in order to cover up the "accident".
However if you put to the back of your mind that this was a patchwork film made from material filmed before Sellers, and indeed Inspector Clouseau, sorry Chief Inspector Clouseau died, you may enjoy it.
Such a movie cannot keep the interest of the viewers even for its about only 80 minutes without good acting, and we get indeed here two excellent actors that pass well the screen and the challenge of explaining their characters beyond the physical appearances, which as with the story is the principal acting problem they face.
I read a review that said her emotionless performance should be nicknamed "Frankenkeller", because she does indeed walk around like a robot!
His professional life seems to be modeled after master chef Thomas Keller, who was exalted in the same way by food critics when he opened his "French Laundry" restaurant in Yountville (which is indeed fantastic).
Always charming, almost improvised, the voices are top notch, weird and sometimes distracting, but very intimate indeed.
And just to add cream to the syrupy concoction, a voice-over promising us "this was not the end, or the beginning of the end, or indeed the end of the beginning, but the end of the beginning of the middle of something - or other..." I was too busy laughing to catch it exactly.
The Wajnberg brothers, Marc-Henri and Alexander, are two strange men indeed.
The plot was so superficial and generic that it could indeed have been plucked from a 1930s Saturday matinÃ©e serial.
But none of these things can ever truly save a movie whose story is weak and whose characters (except for Sinclair) are indeed as paper-thin as the comic-book creations that inspired them.
the children all wear matching clothes which, in the original, was logical since in England children do indeed wear school uniforms.
I guess, this tells us, if indeed these are his memories, all the real terror and sorrow must have been over the decades entirely suppressed.
Yes, this makes me very scared indeed.
What seemed the height of sophisticated froth in 1955 (and was indeed a smash commercial hit, of which I had fond memories) is painfully unwatchable today.
Sinatra and Reynolds may have indeed proved to be a splendid screen-couple, but they are trapped by "The Tender Trap", which curdles from coyness.
But humor is indeed a very subjective thing.
Unfortunately, I guess they'd never seen a number of classic old films, such as Hell Is For Heroes (Steve McQueen), Sahara (Humphrey Bogart), or, indeed, Pork Chop Hill, starring Gregory Peck.
It's ironic that the novel Uncle Tom's Cabin was intended as an abolitionist work, and indeed did arouse sympathy for Blacks, (so much so that President Lincoln called its author, Harriet Beecher Stowe, "The little lady who started the Civil War") while this movie, in which Uncle Tom's Cabin plays a prominent part, is, by enlightened standards, crudely racist.
Not because of its director's typical predilection for extreme gore (of which there is some examples to be sure) or the fact that the handful of women in it parade topless all the time (it is set in the Dark Ages after all)Âit is, quite simply, very poor stuff indeed.
But as a movie geared for older kids (given that the young characters have no problem letting the expletives fly and hence the PG-13 rating), it is indeed, as another viewer wrote, predictable.
Where there are indeed many parts of the story that border on funny and is sometimes even thought-provoking, the overall feel of this movie is as arid as the Outback.
But in its relentless quest to show that, yes, an Asian guy can indeed sleep with white chicks, this movie gives us an entirely unsympathetic main character and throws him into completely implausible situations.
Apparently Mr. Hofman is indeed a totally stupid, psychopathic masochist.
It is hard to believe that THE DARWIN CONSPIRACY was made in 1999 as it plays like really bad TV of the 1970's; indeed, the director's earliest work was in 1970's TV ("Barnaby Jones" for example).
Little did I know there was a farcical 1990's low budget Hollywood version, and this indeed was it.
In the original, Gloria is indeed a former gun moll, kind of ballsy but classy, never really hard-edged; here, as written, she's little more than a cheap, hard floozy.
Wipe transitions take far longer than God, or indeed Satan ever intended.
I never thought I'd give anything a 1, but this is indeed as worthy a candidate as I've ever seen.
The villain is indeed creepy and it does have an eerie atmosphere going for it, but the bigger picture is just too bland.
A real feat indeed.
The film was indeed well done and what struck me the most was the focus on that of the villain.
Sorry to say but it was indeed exceedingly low rent at best.
Paltrow plays an aspiring air hostess with ambitions to travel the world,rather than just domestically in the US,but is torn between love for her boyfriend back home (Ruffalo) and eventually goes back to him.And,er,that's it.A story so paper thin and obvious that it seems to have been written by an inexperienced,first time hack (as indeed it apparently was),with forced and shallow comic situations,dialogue and characterisations.Some surface attractiveness and slickness do not detract from it's persistent banality and lack of depth,and events did conspire against VIEW FROM THE TOP from the start.Filmed in 2001,it's original release was held back (due to the events on 9/11) until two years later,by which time it flopped rather dismally.
They seem to have full control over this terrorist network indeed.
The plan WAS indeed quite suicidal and the gains from it merely hyphotetical at that point.
While that is indeed quite an accomplishment and all technical aspects are admirably handled the fact remains that this film is a complete and utter dud.
A very dangerous plan indeed, but the military isn't given the opportunity of coming up with laughably absurd ideas and then having them work.
It does however have the feel of The New Addams Family, and indeed, coming out at the same time as that series, it seems that this was released to promote and be an introduction to that series.
Bad stuff indeed.
I've already said the demon looks impressive and above that, it knows how to kill, indeed.
This film is indeed horrible.
As luck would have it the crystal skull was indeed buried with Jesse's great great Grandfather & even luckier that no one else had thought to look for it there...
The world is a strange place, indeed.
The course of the story is clear from the beginning to the inevitable end; indeed, KaurismÃ¤ki reveals the whole story in his synopsis of the film.
An almost unrecognizable Kathy Griffin, (pre-surgery indeed); the usual solid performance from character actor Blake Clark; newcomer Adam Sandler, a tad bit raw, delivering lines like he is at a stand-up event, the guy has come far; and Robin Williams, who steals his scene and is probably the funniest part of the entire film.
If indeed the kids were killed by the conductor, why would they push cars to safety?
good films can indeed be made on a low budget.
The set and lighting, while not thoroughly professional looking, are good indeed and do help to make the movie as good as it is.
Potter must indeed be an "aquired taste".I found this mini-series really hard going.I recall the 1930s and the traveling salesmen who led a hand to mouth existence,maybe unpleasant memories were evoked?
A realism that is vulgar "   " But it's the lack of realism that is vulgar "   Or   " Passion embraces your lips with its hideous fire "   I'm not exactly reminded of Oscar Wilde with these lines or indeed William Goldman or Robert Towne .
I kid you notÂ My little niece has a toy like that and I must say it really looks scary indeed.
Sad, it's very sad indeed there is no truly gripping and compelling storytellers anymore.
Yes, this is a goofy movie indeed.
There's no explanation for it, but he did indeed have it.
The title is very appropriate because this film indeed leads to nowhere and it's Gregg Araki's view on the subject of teen-alienation.
It made me remember there were indeed a few barrels of toxic waste in some shots.
Hence it is not fair to hold the movie's own lousiness against it - you should have known that, expected that, and indeed -hoped- for that going in.
A woeful script - if indeed there was one - combined with the worst comedy-special-effects known to mankind, make this film possibly the worst I've ever seen.
If director Donald Jones would have been capable of gloriously depicting all the rancidness he suggests in the script (including rape, torture, necrophilia and incest), then "Schoolgirls in Chains" indeed would have been a genuine exploitation classic, but now it's just a mildly offensive & amusingly inept 70's trash-gem.
I love Sidney Â love him, I tell you Â and watching him work the cable circuit in what is practically a watered-down version of A Raisin in the Sun is disheartening indeed.
But surely they could afford a much higher budget and overall better actors (With the exception of Lou Gosset Jr and a few others - indeed the fact that they can keep a straight and serious demeanor through out the film shows that those few actors really are outstanding in their craft) but I suspect this film is aimed to appeal to the truly stupid people.
It is indeed sad that so many people seem to praise this mindless, uninspiring, unoriginal, and not even particularly amusing pearl of wisdom as though it had virtually descended from the gods on Mount Olympus.
I wonder if the author or actors were trying to sneak in subversive hints that this is indeed a scary, unhealthy relationship...under the surface veneer of obeying the Hays Code and enforcing gender role "norms" and the illusion of romantic comedy.
The quintet of Hollywood veterans provide the only pleasure to be had from this meager production because whenever they are offscreen things get pretty dull indeed.
Strange as it may seem, this is really the most annoying thing about this film: the score persistently tries to convince you that you're watching some sort of grand epic, instead of the low-budget limited-action film you are indeed watching.
That is indeed unfortunate, as it does have some aspects which may have made it a pretty decent film.
Nonetheless, you might be tempted to give 'Disaster Zone' a look if like me, you're a fan of both disaster flicks and indeed volcano disaster flicks.
Fortunately there is no silicone also, and the naked bodies are indeed very beautiful.
It's not the worst film ever made, but it's nowhere near as good as the first two in the series and indeed doesn't even feel like a Beverley Hill Cop movie.
Low budget indeed, some footage seems to come from other films.
Even Maurice Jarre's music did not seem much inspired, as it careered rather hesitatingly among various influences, and indeed the best was when the native chants took over.
There's none of the fast-paced, joke-a-second, semi-hysterical mayhem that marked the best of Everett's television work, and (surprisingly for a film scripted by Barry Cryer) there are very few actual jokes - indeed, when director Ray Cameron presents the viewer (in the opening moments) with a barrage of shockingly violent murders, shot and staged in a bizarrely straight-faced manner, one has to wonder what on earth is going on.
Outside of some amusing set-pieces, like the much-discussed Carrie-inspired decapitation by can-opener, Everett's short-tempered surgeon yanking the innards out of his patient to hurl at his derisive colleagues, the use of John Williams' ominous theme from Jaws (the punchline to this bit is best left to the adventurous viewer) and virtually every moment spent in the company of a deliriously hammy Vincent Price, Bloodbath is a dour and po-faced affair indeed, saddled with rather too much genuine tastelessness (Pamela Stephenson rapidly coming to enjoy being raped by a poltergeist, for example) and the most feeble of finales to make much of an impact.
While the movie isn't wretched in the fashion of pap like "The Majestic", it is indeed painful to sit through as one scene after another drags the stale plot through the French countryside.
After the railway journey she is seen alighting in a supposedly war-torn, yet oddly blimp-free and undamaged London from a post-war (indeed relatively modern) London bus.
Notwithstanding the fact that never would such an emotional girl either have passed the scrutiny, or indeed the strict training of the SOE, she is sent to France on a probationary tryout.
Aishwarya Rai does indeed have stunning eyes - but does the camera really need to give us close-ups of them every 4 minutes!?
To go from a star of the highest rated show on TV ("L.A. Law") to this drek was a fall indeed.
His presence was the best part of this movie and Mr. T did indeed provide some comic relief.
If she was indeed guilty, and in that case for what, is a complex issue, considerably more so than the film in question.
The problem was that Mata Hari had indeed accepted to work for the Germans.
It is hard to believe that THE DARWIN CONSPIRACY was made in 1999 as it plays like really bad TV of the 1970's; indeed, the director's earliest work was in 1970's TV ("Barnaby Jones" for example).
Only George Zucco, as a police inspector, makes much of an impression, and the story itself is minor stuff indeed.
'A Wintery Tale' indeed, is intense and melancholy with everlasting tight shots that never puts the viewer at ease.
But the real crime here was the woeful miscasting of Cate Blanchet, and this I think, is why the movie never really took off at the box office.To any Dubliner, or indeed Irish person, her accent is just wrong, and given that she is surrounded by native Irish actors of some account, her pain is palpable.
What bothered me was the complete lack of effort in giving us enjoyable villains, a charismatic hero and indeed intense fight sequences.
A good premise, where many plots element are supportive is the argument that one person, can indeed make a difference.
Hardy-har indeed.
it is very slow indeed (described as art-house by some reviewers) but some of the scenes are so slow we were laughing at them, its like someones forgot there's film in the camera.
This story could have had a lot to say, and indeed, some of the technicals of this film are quite effective.
There's nothing physically impressive about either of them: indeed I had hoped and still believe that someone like Tim Roth could've throttled them to within an inch of their lives, golf club or not!
Apparently, their was no money for fight choreography either The only conclusion you can make: very disappointing indeed.
Sad indeed.
The grim truth is that this 'wild' couple, often deemed the British version of Bonnie and Clyde, were two very common criminals indeed.
Or if the king actually had a court and palace, as was indeed the case in ancient Mali, instead of sitting under a tree?
I have nothing against the fact, that this indeed is a low-budget movie.
The scenes of zombies running around various industrial areas and hacking people are totally hilarious indeed, but sandwiched between too many random scenes of talking heads.
The CGI work does indeed create the most fearsome beast - far better than the poor German Shepherd pressed into duty in the even worse Frewer version.
Sadly, this attempt to bring a more modern aesthetic, while marginally better than the dreadful Peter Cook and Dudley Moore spoof, is nonetheless a very poor show indeed.
--a very good question indeed.
Yes, very intelligent indeed.
During the film I wondered what Professor Leakey (the famous British anthropologist whose family live in South Africa) would have made or said of the plot!The ladies looked like they had just come out of a Hollywood beauty salon, which indeed they had i.e.
Spongebob Squarepants is undoubtedly one of the most overrated cartoons of the 90s and 00s, indeed probably _the_ most overrated.
Ann Heywood is gorgeous and enigmatic--so enigmatic, indeed, that one wonders if there is anything to be enigmatic about.
"Sacred feminine", indeed...I'm a woman, and "The Davinci Code" insulted my intelligence.
I picked up the Versache Murder DVD at Big Lots for $3.50... since my wife is a fan of cheesy TV docudramas and true crime books, it seemed perfect, and it was indeed worth every penny.
His wife was, indeed, Barbara Ann Spooner but she displayed little interest in Wilberforce's political activities, tending herself to bearing him six children in less than 10 years and tending to his failing health later in life.
For both of them to appear in this, they must have reached dire straits indeed!
It's hard, shallow, and harsh indeed, but people simply don't go around like bubble-headed retards abbreviating half of their sentences.
The guest stars were all good - indeed, Ron Pearlman was the most likeable character in the film, and I'm talking about his 'fascist politician' scenes, too.
Cousin Bette, the movie, may indeed appeal to some viewers, those who ask for nothing but sub-The Young and the Restless melodrama dressed up in period costumes.
There are indeed several twists in the plot, but all of them are predictable and absolutely unable to make the film a little interesting.
The action sequences, if that is indeed what they can be called, are plodding, poorly thought out and mostly non-existent.
To watch this entire movie is a feat indeed.
In the end this continued attention is utterly frustrating, since the ending manages to further let one down and, indeed, the rest of the film.
Forcing oneself to ignore his unfortunate aesthetic choice (and this is hard, for there is no avoiding it for the whole frigging movie) one realizes that Mr. Bellott may indeed have something worthwhile to say.
I am disqualified through reasons of age and culture to comment on the Ibiza music phenomenon,the raising to sainthood of disc jockeys,and the apparent ambition of every teenage boy to become one.I do understand - in the form of a distant memory - the urge to procreate that overcomes one at the age of fifteen to the extent that little else is of any consequence.Thus Kevin and Perry exist in an almost permanent state of priapism,their whole object being to divest themselves of their virginity at the first available opportunity.This can be - indeed is - amusing for five minutes but all too quickly palls.There are some gags that actually improve with repetition but unfortunately "Kevin and Perry go large" doesn't actually have any of them.
This brought me to the trusty old IMDb, where I have now learned that it was, indeed, an intended straight SciFi.
The logic of the film is left generally untouched.... indeed it is hard to figure out how anyone could make such idiocy logical.
Before watching the film I saw the very high IMDb score (but forgot to look at the number of votes) and was expecting to sit down to a cult classic, indeed the first 2-3 minutes set the scene with a suitably art-house feel but then.... oh dear.
Cyd was indeed very beautiful and a talented dancer.
Sometimes the film overcomes this bit of illogic, though more often it just derails the film's credibility completely because it inadvertently reminds you that you are, indeed, watching a movie.
END SPOILER - so in this respect, Cronenberg doesn't hold back with, or indeed glamorise the violence, and certainly shows the immediacy and horror of it all, but to be honest, so what?
The gore and bloodshed is shocking, indeed, but you can't possibly neglect the many moments of boredom and the overall execution of "Cyclone" is downright tasteless and sick.
If the objective was to make the worst movie of all time then this movie is indeed a success.
It is quite amusing indeed.
The actors that they had portray Ryan Phillippe's Christian and Sarah Michelle Gellar's Kathryn are very poor substitutes indeed.
Furthermore there are indeed some funny scenes like Helge trying to get the newspapers under control in the hurricane or the alien-scene at the end of the movie.
And if this movie inspires even one REAL stalker (and as I said before this film is a sham and a PR ploy), but if the film inspires a REAL stalker that would be quite a shame indeed.
A pity indeed.
They may not all be on top of their game, many even out of the limelight for some time, but a common friend indeed they have with their oft-ridiculed, former television dork dad.
Lots of western clichÃ©s, but served up very well indeed.
Sutherland trades a few romantic quips with a village lass played by Jenny Agutter; they have maybe five or six minutes of conversation (fully clothed, which is rare for Agutter), whereupon the lass falls so deeply in love with the IRA man that she shoots the English lout dead and proceeds to betray her fellow villagers -- indeed, her entire country.
But, "Buyu," which was sent to me by a Turkish friend from Australia is indeed a reminder that bad- truly bad films can still be made in Turkey.
Instead of being a potboiler, Save Me (which indeed could have used some rescuing from the back burner of publicity) gently simmers its characters in a subtle stew of reason and emotion.
I'll agree that the movie is indeed awful, but it nevertheless brought a nostalgic smile when I came across the title as I was looking up some information on Ian McShane now that I have caught up on all the Deadwood episodes but still find myself wanting to see more of him.
I've got no problem with this in theory and indeed some of the 'fake' Emanuelle films (fake rip-offs of rip-offs could only be made in Italy) are very good - but that is not the case here, as Emmanuelle on Taboo Island is really very boring.
The middle of the picture is indeed dominated by Donald Sutherland as a rich dude who takes Joanna and some friends to Africa.
Affecting a bizarre stuttering accent, one can't help but be entertained, even if one suspects that much of the reaction of modern audiences is the result of familiarity with Sutherland more than the skill of the performance (indeed McKuen insisted that Sutherland's accent came and went so frequently that much of his performance had to be edited around and drowned in his music!).
Unfortunately, it seems that the screenplay writer raised so many weird situations that he was not able to conciliate all of them in a satisfactory ending, and indeed the plot has a very disappointing conclusion.
Most of the more spaceport-like locations are so undetailed that it makes the next problem look suspicious indeed.
to save capitalist domination and indeed to establish it afresh on an even wider basis than its present one."
I genuinely urge anyone who has only known this DVD to try and see the VHS version before concluding that The Plank is not a very funny film indeed
However, it all feels very random and the plot running through all these ideas fails to be interesting at every turn, thus making the film very boring indeed.
But when the Sky Marshal crashes on a apparently deserted planet in the middle of the Arachnid zone matters look grim indeed.
Farhan,very well done indeed!All the best!
Oddness, though not immediately apparent, is indeed present.
And they say this is a good movie indeed.
Greetings and if any of this does indeed spoil the movie for you then you really have not missed much anyway but there is a disturbing aspect with this production that just must be commented on.
However this will remain to others, who have seen more than this movie and have a different understanding of this world in which we live in, an intellectual 'wheelchair' to the Liberal base that doesn't indeed look for the good in America but continues to find a 'Villain' in the U.S.   My question is, before 9/11, when there were still three thousand people in one piece, and Bin Laden was offered to President Clinton, on two different occasions, when William passed on taking him, because he said, "We have no business, with Bin Laden."
that I refuse to acknowledge that this indeed has anything to do with Kickboxer 1-4.
Redemption:Kickboxer 5 doesn't even have that to fall back on and indeed there is hardly any kickboxing at all to be found in this super lousy sequel.
Personally, I thought that the Plaza Hotel was, indeed, luxurious and spacious.
indeed.
While I don't agree with those reviewers who claim that "Pod People" is the worst movie of all time - these viewers have obviously never seen "Teenagers Battle The Thing" - it is, indeed, a very painful viewing experience.
I wonder if the real Nostradamus could indeed see the future, and if so, could have foreseen this horrible film and been suitably upset by it.
It just goes to show that Coixet can indeed get great performances out of actors as long as they're not Penelope Cruz.
In truth, he doesn't fail to return on that promise, but the lines do not come off with the same charm that the first movies held; indeed, how could they when the lines themselves are delivered with two-by-four accuracy?
While I don't mind any of that (and indeed was willing to watch this movie), still, I found the characters to be weak and mostly fall into type.
When forced into the production by contractual obligation, Howard and his counterparts gave it their all, but sad to say the camera did not lie: they were indeed too old.
Why indeed?
Fatigued entry in the 1930s back-from-the-dead horror cycle doesn't allow Karloff to do anything fresh or substantial (indeed, several of his big moments seem lifted straight from "Frankenstein"!).
"Scared To Death" is probably best remembered, if indeed it's remembered at all, as Bela Lugosi's only color film.
The screenplay is terrible: the viewer can see that the story is in a Latin country (Argentina indeed), but the explanation is only found reading the cover of the DVD.
It only has some innovative (yes, indeed) demonic behavior scenes which fans of such movies like my friend might enjoy.
An hour and a half later, I was indeed irate at the loss of my three bucks; I could have put better use to the money by plunking twelve quarters into an arcade machine or a stuffed animal crane.
A classic indeed.
He moves stiffly, and his accent is poor stuff indeed.
I could go on for a good while yet, mentioning for example the 'influences' from other films that verge on plagiarism (the madness scene in the asylum looked as though it was lifted straight out of the 1930 'Dracula'), or what indeed that whole scene had to do with anything, but what would be the point?
I am certainly not averse to watching junk, indeed some films are enjoyable precisely because they are bad.
The IMDb reckons The Thirst: Blood War had a $1,000,000 budget which I find hard to believe unless it went on Todd & Connery & if it did indeed have a million dollar budget than the film get even worse in my eyes as the production values are awful with most scenes shot outside on a random path or in front of a tree or something.
Low-budget indeed!
As you can understand, mein liebers, it's very hard, very troublesome, very sad, very much, indeed, to talk about this talkie film.
Ah, and that's a problem, indeed!!...
There was indeed some good acting, however.
The lab falling apart in second chapter was indeed an old thriller type of stunt.
Of course, the teachers and students dutifully applauded, shouted and stomped (to indicate to the viewer that this was indeed the climax) but I was just thought he was an old fool.
And Chrono Cross, the sequel to the aforementioned Chrono Trigger, was a very good game indeed (save the ending).
He is, indeed, a ghost that Michael simply refuses to give up.
The film does indeed begin with a virus being let loose upon the good citizens of Great Britain.
An interesting premise indeed as today's audience is ready to accept such unconventional subjects but what a pity that neither the idea is developed properly, nor the subject is explored well.
In a time capsule, this aspect would be interesting indeed but today it is distasteful.
Not surprised one bit - it's a terrible movie indeed and I'm flabbergasted someone like Caro could be behind it.
When it's not being burned down, the town -- a tent and two wood-frame buildings whose Nouvelle Vague minimalism is echoed by a cemetery with just one grave -- is regularly assailed by Janice Rule's hilarious Irish accent, though she certainly gets her just desserts (as indeed, do nearly all the cast, shot down either accidentally or deliberately in a climax so stupefyingly barmy that you wonder if Russ Meyer assumed the direction after Kennedy took an errant slug.)
He naturally then gets shot by the "bad man" and walks out of the saloon like a zombie and then drops to the floor - a very dumb scene indeed.
The plot is very simple indeed, and takes a bit too long to reach the conclusion.
And yes, Franco Nero does indeed have a cameo at the end as some kind of Christ figure.
Perhaps there was no getting away from it, but Broadbent's performance did indeed depict Longford as a dithering, pig-headed old man who didn't care to consider the feelings of the victims' families, nor the possibility that Myra was making a prize pratt out of him.
But this was indeed a good performance by Reeve.
If you even begin to compare these similarly themed films Guerin's piece begins to look very clumsy indeed.
It was unclear if Streep's superficial relationship with her children was because she had no life outside of the magazine or because she was indeed that superficial.
Somebody did it, a good job indeed, with very plain examples.
Low budget indeed.
The mummy herself is indeed disappointing enough without the bad hand effects.
I googled Bram Stoker to find out if indeed there even WAS a Bram Stoker's "Mummy" and haven't found anything he's written with that title...yet...
I have to say that this is indeed one of, if not the worst movie i have ever seen.
Though it is indeed supreme if you need one and a half hours of cheep laughs i rate it 1 because it is technically the worst movie i have seen.
A very disappointing feature indeed, Rocket Science suffers from virtually all the symptoms of AIFD (American Indie Film Disease).
This time around high school angst hands us a lad whose additional teen burden is indeed a heavy one, severe stuttering.
The reviewer who called on us to take a vomit bag was very right indeed.
Quaid was positively stunning as the android and this is easily Murphy's best performance ever, Oscar worthy indeed.
Moreover, watching Chinese speaking Italian (some are VERY badly dubbed) is kind of ridiculousÂ Chinese proverbs are scattered in the screenplay, and no one of them makes any senseÂ The ships and the setting are indeed beautiful, but why not spending all the money they cost in other stuff, an average screenplay writer and an average director for exampleÂ oh, I see, they are the same person.
The BBC made a TV series of this in 2003 and then decided to flog that horse again, so this was the result, an inferior feature film, very badly directed indeed by Justin Chadwick.
In the latter part of the film, where at last she has a definable character and situation which she can at last figure out, she delivers some very powerful dramatic acting indeed, but always with too modern a touch.
Anne's ambitions are apparent from this very day, she indeed seems to find her father and uncle's schemes appealing and agrees to "hunt" his majesty.
Gregory is taking a huge risk here by suggesting that the allegation levied upon Anne and her brother George was indeed founded in truth, borne out of Anne's desperation to get with child after her miscarriage.
It's difficult to take this movie seriously, indeed if nothing else it will make you smile it's so campy.
In fact, he does such a good job that I really did think that Tripp was made of cardboard and that his emotions were indeed drawn onto his face with a magic marker.
There is no chemistry between any of the actors, the writing is on middle-school level, and any movie that dares to invoke Katharine Hepburn in one scene and then drags its characters through one contrived and pointless and flatly-acted episode after another is indeed crud.
They moved to Sicily and ... since then the movie can be summarized in four words: Sicily = hell Finland = paradise  Sicily is not the perfect world and Finland is an indeed very nice country.
Of course he does it really well ... filling out some rather ugly 80s-wear very nicely indeed.
To the viewers relief we discover that this near homicide was committed by Sheriff Arnie before the biker was indeed revealed as an impostor (phew).
By this time I could almost hear the Simpsons McBane character explain why women always leave the toilet seat up or remark that he indeed does wear loafers!
The line between reference, homage and plagiarism is pretty thin indeed.
I knew some were deliberately in there, but some were indeed mistakes.
The documentary aspect of the film is very shallow indeed as it simply glosses over things and never really actually educates or demonstrates anything, we are just treated to some very basic facts figures over the top of some visuals that are, admittedly, stunning.
Just goes to show that clunkers were indeed made back then as well.
That is not obvious here, rather, Steven Soderberg's film goes the longest way possible to get a conclusion that is obvious, if indeed the film has a conclusion in the first place.
One must give kudos to Vickie Brinkford (Costume Designer) in this movie, as indeed, the wardrobe was the true star.
As I scan the many laudatory reviews of this movie posted above, I find myself asking myself just what kind of movies from the past 30 or 40 years these reviewers have been watching, or indeed if they've watched any.
Hardly, since it is hard to imagine a simpler way for the mark to find out that the note he was buying WAS indeed a fake than to send the currency expert along with just such an offer?
"Kook's Tour" is indeed an important piece of Stooge history, but it is not a worthwhile film.
Yeah we move from A to A, great character progression indeed!
  Average sci-fi thriller movie back in 1973.But today due to numerous improvements on the ideas presented here,this movie is only likely to be enjoyed by the most avid sci-fi movie completist.The special effects here was ripped off by numerous 1970's sci-fi TV series like those countless Six Million Dollar Man/Bionic Woman shows.If one has seen those TV shows before seeing this movie,nothing comes out new or fresh.Come to think of it,the Six Million Dollar Man pilot episodes came out before this movie!So actually,the special effects here were not too original after all.Also,they were not content with the Six Million Dollar Man rip off,they even stole the actor who plays Dr.Rudy Wells in said TV show!No sirree.They can't pull a fast one on a guy like me who has seen a lot of movies and TV shows so I am NOT IMPRESSED at all and do not buy into the hype.So now what have we got?Story?The story looks to me like a reject script from a 1960's Twilight Zone episode.The story was too full of plot holes it's not funny.Yes indeed.
I admit, I was at the edge of my seat during the pursuit, and very pleased (and relieved) when Richard Benjamin's character, which to me had the appearance of an attention-deficient 10-year-old with a mustache, showed that he indeed owned intellect.
Though i quite like the original, i absolutely hated this movie, and if it is true that Dark Castle productions are indeed planning to remake a whole host of William Castle movies then i hope they do a better job!
I couldn't wait for this movie to end simply because I knew exactly how it was going to and indeed did pan out.
The IMDb reckons The Thirst: Blood War had a $1,000,000 budget which I find hard to believe unless it went on Todd & Connery & if it did indeed have a million dollar budget than the film get even worse in my eyes as the production values are awful with most scenes shot outside on a random path or in front of a tree or something.
(or, indeed, a reason to live)
Every scene of this movie hit you over the head with the fact that it was - indeed - a movie.
They've already been listed in triplicate in the above comments, so I'll try to find something new to bring up... how about the obvious allusion to INDIANA JONES with the penultimate 'driving sorta into the sun-set' scene and the unspoken but palpable hunger the filmmakers had for someone to be moved by it, indeed, to hope for a sequel, an elaboration of the continuing adventures of ROWSDOWER AND WONDER GEEK.
Having been a disaffected youth into this music myself, I don't recognise these characters at all and this moral line on a little rebellion leaves a very nasty taste indeed.
Whatever happened indeed!
Sometimes seeing crime is interesting--this is more like being and experiencing the murders first-hand--a nasty proposition indeed.
Deadly indeed.
Anyway, when you finish watching this movie-crap you feel that someone got framed indeed.
I want to know indeed what's in here to be watched ?
"Soul Assassin" is a horrible movie, indeed a festival of clichÃ©s.
In a nutshell my favorite actor in this film was Eva Marie Saint who indeed gave a saint of a performance - The scene of her talking to her husband (Gleason) in the hospital, spilling her guts "What Happened to us Max?
Whilst maintaining sufficient momentum within its story, 'Tommy' goes one step further, managing to produce not only a stream of interesting and distinct sounds, but indeed a few memorable classics.
Computer animation is, indeed, not the shoe-in, cure-all solution to a great movie.
Awful it is indeed, but in a manner that is nothing but... awful!
she's really old Mr Jones from the abandoned amusement park, and some more ninjas attack people very badly indeed, and make "whoosh-SMACK!"
Sadly, the viewer never learns anything concrete about Lila's background, or why the drug sets her off the way it does; indeed, the only thing we can discover about her comes from the film's admittedly hypnotic theme song.
The performances of the whole cast, this time, are indeed deliberately campy.
The movie is creative in some ways, indeed, and has an artisctical and conceptual value, but the average is mediocre for me.
And indeed if one were actually ON acid while watching it, the movie might possibly be funny.
the gore is very poor indeed and the casting is incredibly poor with Danny Cannon stopping just short of saying fo'shizzle at the end of every sentence because he's a bad ass gangsta pimp army man.
Normally, I'm wary of anything that I find in the pages of the Sunday Mail but this (DVD freebie) was a pleasant surprise indeed.
The shooting locations, the cast and visual effects were indeed more than satisfactory.
The film establishes Gregory's thinking during the film's point of attack as that of one that isn't necessarily attuned to what it is that's around him, indeed, he likes football and girls but doesn't seem to put an awful lot of thought into them; somewhat dismissive of football as "just entertainment, for fun".
This having of a male dominate the kitchen space, indeed he corrects a female character on whether it ought to be female dominated, as well as a female do the same thing to a football field could be read into as a going against generic gender roles in society.
As far as coming of age tales that fall into the realms of comedy go, Gregory's Girl has more than enough laughs as well as a genuine fondness for its characters of whom it pays close attention to, indeed enough to recommend over a good number of other films of this ilk.
All I can say is that it is indeed a massacre!
', followed by holding the spear up so we can see he is telling the truth and does, indeed, still have the dragon spear.
In between some scenes, we cut to a shot of the moon, perhaps to assure the viewers that there is no need to worry, it is indeed still nighttime.
But Sinatra's never will; indeed, he never does.
For just like the act of gambling itself, or indeed, not unlike the Air Bud movies, Owning Mahowny seems enticing at first, that is, when you and your friends are just planning to see it, joking that you might strike big, that this might be the one movie that comes out of nowhere to surprise you, but then from the moment you enter the theatre, every time you give this movie a chance, it's just one bad hand after the other, until eventually you are completely numb to it, and you stop paying attention to your wife, and you start cutting out of work early, and you no longer enjoy anything again in life anymore because all you want is your Owning Mahowny.
We have indeed come a long way.
Now I do NOT recommend people avoid his films--after all, throwing out his films would do a disservice to his talents and living in a 100% politically correct world where we cannot allow evidence of "incorrect thinking" is a scary prospect indeed.
It's not just that, terrifying but true, he looks like a young Tom Hanks but his acting is clumsy, his voice weak and he occasionally looks unsure of how to act to camera: hard to believe that you're watching the first steps of a future screen great here Â indeed, just about the only line to ring true is when Stanwyck tells him "I'll see you in 1966.
A poor effort indeed.
Well if you witness this cinematic monstrosity, you will see existing proof that bad disaster movies were indeed churned out after "The Swarm".
The story of a cult of dead teenagers attempting to turn other teenagers into One of Them is so incompetent in ever single aspect, that just watching One of Them try to act is a daunting task indeed.
When they came up with the title, if the filmmakers meant the seemingly endless stock of poor genre films that are being pumped out in the wake of digital film-making, then this is indeed "one of them".
The acting was, indeed, well-done - which leads me to assume that there was some good direction happening as well.
But that's indeed another story.
It is, indeed, a Technicolor treat to the eyes.
I think this is indeed a cult item, the songs will work for a certain crowd, as well as the grotesque costume designs, and the industrialized look of the world, fallen to ruin, degradation, and decadence.
The reason is presumably that this detail was plagiarised from the life of Lana Turner, whose boyfriend Johnny Stompanato was indeed killed by her daughter Cheryl in self defence, and as Lana was still alive in 1987 too much attention to the incident could have resulted in a writ from her lawyers.
These scenes may prove to be of interest for some; and indeed they may have for me too if they were involved in a more interesting film.
I' m sorry they are objective.There is not even one good point about this movie.The original one had a weird, awful storyline, plot, as a matter of fact a meaning.Deep down there, you may understand the work.But this title; well nothing more than a scary movie trial.Same solid lack of storyline, same concrete example of NOT acting.Well, there are certain examples special effects which are not bad indeed.
The point was to demonstrate that the aliens did indeed have the ability to destroy the earth.
When locals do enter the lens, the encounter is always brief, shallow and artificial--indeed, many of the interviews seem staged--and the overall feeling is often _exploitive_.
This becomes very, very annoying, and one might even begin to feel embarrassed for ever having believed that Jackson's nose was indeed made of plastic, or that he slept in oxygen chambers...  Do yourself a favour: after watching this TV movie, it is absolutely necessary to watch "The truth about Michael Jackson", in which you'll see the footage Bashir never showed, in which he for instance praises Jackson's parenting skills.
Overall I did indeed like this movie!
I could go on in a similar vein about Troy and Mr. Fox, and indeed on and on... but unless the TV versions rapidly evolved into the characters I have known and loved for a decade, they are not anyone I know, nor particularly would want to know.
"Triple Cross" is one of the movies Terence Young wished he'd never done, and it is bad indeed, even though it had all the ingredients a good box office hit needs: an international all-star cast (Christopher Plummer, Romy Schneider, Yul Brynner, Trevor Howard, Gert FrÃ¶be, Jess Hahn, Claudine Auger from "Thunderball", Howard Vernon and Bernard Fresson), a massive budget, a director at the height of his international fame, a Bond-like story, a Bond-like score (Georges Garvarentz) and Bond-like locations (Jersey, London, Paris, Lisbon, Southern France).
A very strange movie indeed.
For the first half of the film, indeed, one at least can be forgiving to the film because the characters inherent (and physical) beauty at least provides some sort of motion to the storyline.
At first this discursiveness seems rather stunning and unexpected, but a quick look back over a few points of the first half of the film start revealing that indeed, it seems Pabst really didn't have a clear understanding of overaching tones, themes, motifs.
As for technical, I can assure you Europeans that the English dub is equally as bad, though one can tell that indeed the characters' mouths were animated for English.
charles band is indeed the ed wood of our era..this movie was done and over in 65min.full moon is robbing us in the redbox for a buck.iam a true monster fan but this one was the worst of all of the full moon madness DVD .band's puppets are even better to watch then this guy wrap with toilet paper and turning people into stone.more time were spend on some kind of a lesbo scene,which was the best highlight of the movie.charles band should be banned from stealing other people's money.no plots,no acting,no screenplay,no gore,no f/x and band as the director was sleeping doing this piece of junk..ed woods is laughing from his grave..please don't make a part two..a junk is a junk and a movie is a movie..watch it for free instead.
The two characters are apparently friends with a history together- which would indeed add an interesting dimension to the story- but their relationship is never really elaborated upon.
So I really think she's got a chance at this and if she makes it, it will indeed be a rarity.
Oh yes, a strange concoction indeed.
We all know that HÃ©ctor Lavoe wasn't a saint, and his life was indeed a tragedy from when he became famous on... but the overwhelming feeling you get from all real-life sources of information and trivia that have described his life in the past is that, contrary to the despotic, abusive brute portrayed in the film, HÃ©ctor's character was way more generous, more people-friendly (I'll talk about this in a minute), pained, multidimensional than what we're fed with through Marc Anthony's interpretation.
Let Variety proclaim that the announced Actors Strike was narrowly avoided - I'd say that it did happen indeed: and it happened during the shooting of this film.
I'm sure the people making it thought this was hilarious and indeed this is exactly the sort of film Id make if I had a bunch of mates with loads of free time and a camcorder.
Top cast indeed, but it ignites few sparks, except for Lady Chablis.
However, the actors in it are obviously more talented than the weak script warrants, and the issue of sexual dysfunction could indeed have been treated in a way that is both humorous and at the same time enlightening - something the film failed completely at.
For a far more enjoyable Mad Max/Road Warrior inspired outing try instead some of the Italian entries in the genre which are infinitely more memorable and indeed so much more fun than this.
Yes The Creature Wasn't Nice is indeed painfully bad, much of the humor is flat and the plot hangs together like cottage cheese.
Weird story, indeed, that makes you think a bit.
Ringo Starr, in Frank Zappa garb, has some curious speeches that attempt to clarify Zappa's concepts of society, and some of the rock music is indeed exciting, but Frank Z. is far too defensive to be much fun.
Very similar indeed.
Stevenson novella - opting, instead, to indiscriminately incorporate elements of lycanthropy and vampirism which make no sense at all...but which lend the film value as a unique curio and one which, in view of its sheer audacity, it is difficult to hate (indeed, the whole misguided enterprise reminded me of the contemporaneous FRANKENSTEIN 1970 [1958])!
It seems that Atwill's ranch has a runway with lights and a beacon--very posh indeed.
The characters, themselves, are indeed very strange--almost like parodies of real people, but the movie takes itself far too seriously to allow them to seem realistic.
This 1997 TV production is called "Jane Eyre", but except for a similarity to the plot of the novel there is preciously little in this film to remind you that you are indeed watching an adaptation of Charlotte BrontÃ«'s literary masterpiece.
Believe it or not, but they indeed managed to turn one of the most interesting and complex figures of English literature into a brute and a bully.
I would suggest that the makers of this film take a long vacation, a long way away from their usual haunts and let time heal their unfortunate souls if that is indeed possible.
So far, vintage Italian horror has an obviously different tone indeed from vintage and especially new American horror in the way that there's an unnerving sense as one is watching (if you haven't seen the particular film before or many in the genre, like me!)
It's not about it being bellow the standard grindhouse experience, the splattery violence is indeed present here, no it's about the presentation, specifically about the lack of such.
With every minute it becomes more and more unbearable indeed this truly is a torture show.
Juvenile fantasy/adventure with an impressive cast of old reliables (Sean Connery, Peter Cushing, Trevor Howard, Lila Kedrova, Douglas Wilmer and Wilfrid Brambell) all operating below-par alongside the resistible - indeed wooden - presence of would-be star Miles O'Keefe (fresh from two similarly low-brow Ator films).
When he tells his parents they become worried coz of the weird things their child is talking about but then the maid gets killed and all the stuff is found which she stole so Sush realizes her kid was indeed seeing the ghosts all the while.
Furthermore, pilots were indeed NOT permitted to instill their own personal insignias, considering that, unlike World War II, pilots were rarely assigned individual aircraft, often dispersing their ranks among the types available and typically sharing planes out amongst each other.
The unexpected violence is unsettling enough, but with the film over, and loose ends nowhere near being tied up - indeed, just initiated a narrative, in the dying seconds - the audience is left agonising in the dark.
Very tasty indeed.
Unfortunately, I suspect that the author of such one-sided point of view cannot tolerate anything that does not come out of Hollywood whose films are indeed well-structured, well-paced and contain humour but at the same time are mostly idiotic, shallow and meaningless.
While Sirk's films have often been branded "woman's pictures", "There's Always Tomorrow" is indeed very much a man's picture.
Despite its baffling ultra-rarity, the film is peopled by an interesting pool of talent both in front and behind the camera: Lancaster is in his third adventure flick; Gilbert Roland is his usual laid-back, womanizing Latino self; John Dehner the proverbial rotten apple in the group; George Tobias (perhaps thankfully) sacrifices himself early on; Nick Dennis and Mike Mazurki are among the rowdiest of the 'Ten'; Gerald Mohr adequately provides the required villainy; this was the second product from Norma Productions (which first partnered Lancaster with producer Harold Hecht); writer Roland Kibbee would much later go on to share directorial credit with Lancaster on THE MIDNIGHT MAN (1974; which I will be revisiting presently); associate producer Robert Aldrich would later direct Lancaster in four movies Â including TWILIGHT'S LAST GLEAMING (1977; which I'll be viewing for the first time during this ongoing Burt Lancaster tribute); and, most interestingly perhaps, this was multi-talented Willis Goldbeck's most notable directorial effort but, at least two of his screen writing credits are highly impressive indeed: Tod Browning's FREAKS (1932) and John Ford's THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE (1962; Goldbeck's last film work)!
VVG indeed.
This film is indeed a testimony to Lucie and Raymond's relationship, but in my mind, the film serves equally as an insight into France during the occupation and the political state at the time.
A very mediocre adaption of Jules Verne indeed, even if it appears to include bits from every story Verne ever wrote.
There's also a joke where two characters are discussing the robbery they're going to pull when one exclaims " Let's get out of here , it's like a public park " The camera then pulls away to indeed show the conversation was taking place in a public park .
I think that the idea was very imaginative indeed, and my only complaint was the movie was over too quickly.
The laughs are very dry indeed, and are guaranteed to appeal to people who appreciate jokes that are aimed at offending people.
It is indeed, total, but realistic Americana as well, transposed to the hallowed world of surfers, who we find out, must some day ALSO, "grow up"!
This proved to be one of the pivotal moments in 70s cinema, and indeed in American History, signifying loss of innocence, tainting The American Dream, and squirting out the final puff from the spliff of the Hippy Movement and Freedom.
Yes, indeed, as much as Joaquim Phoenix IS Johnny Cash; it seemed he was born to play Cash, as it seems Brolin was born to play Gable.
He is indeed very good, and I kept forgetting that it was not really Clark Gable.
The Bad Old Days indeed!
Severl old hands turn up yet again, indeed if Resnais can be said to have a repertory company it would certainly include his long-time wife Sabine Azema, Pierre Arditi, Lambert Wilson and Andre Dussollier, all present and correct here along with first-timer Isabelle Carre with Laura Morante completing the sextet.
That is indeed a fine description for this film which stars The Ritz Brothers mixing their comedic hijinks with Horror icons Lionel Atwill and Bela Lugosi.
Many praises are sung about the soundtrack, and those are very true indeed; great rock songs with very good pace and vivid vocals accompany the action.
The mecha action scenes -another highly hyped point- are indeed fast and furious, and have some very intense moments.
Clearly SF, The Time Traveler's Wife has none of the superficiality of character all too common to the genre; indeed, it's as sincere and genuine a love story as you'll ever find in the movies.
It's a fun movie indeed.
This film is highly reminiscent of the gangster films made by Warner Brothers throughout the 1930s, though oddly it has less action and more talking--a strange thing indeed for a silent film!
I'm not going to go into the whole plot of the film, as it is indeed a parody, so it doesn't really matter.
The jokes indeed come fast and frequent, some better than others obviously.
Worse is when, at the end, a bit of voice-over repeats what a character stated less than a minute before hand, showing indeed one of those pesky and annoying horror movie motifs where apparently the director or producer or maybe the studio or something decided that the audience wasn't intelligent enough to get the point (plus, it leads the way to a possible sequel, which is predictable).
Lionsgate apparently thought they had a marketing nightmare on their hands... which may indeed be the case.
He would lie, cheat, sacrifice and tread on anybody's heels to get his pictures on the screen, but he is not evil through and through, like most cinematic baddies and indeed like some of the real Hollywood producers who were out there at that time.
The two women want to donate a comfortable couch to the local hospital's lounge for relatives awaiting news of the condition, indeed fate, of their loved ones.
The filtered lens only maximizes the almost enchanted beauty that pours through from the screen and onto the viewers' eyes; indeed, this is nostalgia for a time gone by, a trip down memory lane and a subtle incursion into a denouncement of the horrors of war which never rears its ugly head but whose presence ultimately swallows a family, whole.
I am not Jewish so I had to do some "googling" to learn that El Moleh...is indeed a prayer for the dead.
And the two title characters do indeed fight it out at the end.
Dracula Vs. Frankenstein quite literary has everything, it has a Frankenstein monster that looks like a speeding train has hit it's face head on, Count Dracula with a silly looking beard & an afro hairstyle, who talks with a bizarre echo throughout & has plastic teeth that bulge out of his mouth, a drug addicted mute hunchback assistant, a wheelchair bound Dr. Frankenstein with a gay looking goatee beard, ancient comets, lab equipment that would look dated during 20's, we do indeed see (well almost as it's filmed in the horrible day-for-night process) a Dracula Vs. Frankenstein fight at the end, a biker gang & a weird guy named Strange who gets excited about playing with an old tyre in an alleyway with his girlfriend!
Oh I was amazed indeed.
Essentially a tale focused on Alex's journeys in jail and his process of being re-submitted to the world after inhumane treatments to cure the evil out of him, "A Clockwork Orange" is indeed as offbeat as its title.
In the USA, there is indeed post-traumatic stress and its consequences, but it's a problem that's treated, not ignored or swept under the rug.
He has been through so much in his life that he is indeed "burnt out," but there is also a good sense to this term.
I have read several books on the case so you can't say it wasn't made up when it indeed happened.
Fun to watch if you've a son who know nothing of the 1961 chase when this viewer, indeed, remembers being told by adults that Mantle, not Maris, should break the record.
But the film is surprising because Hitchcock manages to have absolutely no staircase, no flights of steps, with or without mezzanines, and yet don't believe me that easy because it is not flat country indeed.
This is a rich comedy, though a very dark one indeed.
That is indeed six-year-old Jerry Mathers as Arnie a couple of years before starting his six-year run on "Leave It to Beaver".
Others have gone into the historical inaccuracies and blase' treatment of Danish history, but 5,000 years indeed!!!
A Royal disappointment, indeed.
It wasn't until the much talked about "Real Life people" sex scene that I paused, checked and found it was indeed a film by Carlos Reygadas!
As has been well documented, the sex in "Batalla en el cielo" is very explicit indeed.
You will indeed find yourself well-rewarded.
The movie does have its laughs, does indeed contain its moments, but it could have been much better if it didn't try so hard to appeal to the kids.
The performances do indeed enhance the experience, but some are underused; best example is Chris Rock.
True, no one can top C. Aubrey Smith as a grouchy English aristocrat, but Freddy Bartholomew was always annoying as Fauntleroy -- or, indeed, as anything.
"Arna's Children" is indeed a very powerful movie.
Strange goings on indeed.
It is indeed black comedy, but I urge you not to be scared: there's nothing nasty about the taste, and the dominant tone is one of optimism.
And what a family indeed.
As the scene progress and it becomes eminent that this little girl is indeed going to have sex with her father, you feel a genuine unease.
It was indeed a festive occasion and we all felt very happy and high-spirited afterwards.
For indeed I believe in the introductory comment by Goran Paskaljevic, the director of this beautiful film, whose presence together with that of the wonderfully acting Colm Meany was of course also part of an utmost enjoyable cinematographic evening.
We then enter the conversion phase where they try and convince them, indeed this is the main part of the movie.
The Usher family's secret is a curse indeed!
I don't recall if it had a laugh track, but I don't think it would have needed one if it is indeed as funny as I recall.
Oh, almost obligatorily, he dances us over to that edge and gives us a big whiff of all that, but instead of jumping in and wallowing in the stereotypes, he deftly pulls it back and carries it all off and away in a new and different direction, indeed in an uplifting direction.
In war and comedy, timing is indeed everything.
What makes this fine film unique is the child's stance on the adult politics: what may seem like exciting challenges for change of an existing corrupt system for the adults may indeed be an unwanted rearrangement of the wants and needs of children whose political acumen is less advanced than the need for order and consistency in everyday life.
Crystal and DeNiro indeed mold amiable incentive between themselves, therefore quite a few hilarious moments emerge from their perception of the well-written script by Kenneth Lonergan, Peter Tolan, and Ramis himself.
Robbie Coltrane and Maximilian Schell round out the cast quite nicely indeed, particularly Schell's colorful turn as the dangerous Diamond Dog, the Fagin type who taught the brothers everything they know.
Pure indeed.
Robbie Coltrane and Maximilian Schell round out the cast quite nicely indeed, particularly Schell's colorful turn as the dangerous Diamond Dog, the Fagin type who taught the brothers everything they know.
Unlike Brick, most of these arts are devoted to making us laugh, and the first 1/2 to 2/3rds of the movie are very funny indeed, and well worth seeing.
Sergiu Niculescu is indeed quite a famous Romanian director.
I recently watched an unremarkable early movie of his "Lafayette Escradille" featuring in a very minor role with hardly any lines at all, a nondescript young actor by the name of Clint Eastwood - unexpected routes indeed.
Now Christy's niece lives in the Locke family home with dad and her grandma, the ominous Mrs. Locke (Gabrielle Rose), whom her cute red-haired granddaughter calls a "weirdo", and she is indeed, since she disappears from the dinner table and prefers to eat alone in her place.
That would truly be an AWESOME day indeed!
If indeed it was based on true events then the producer/director has been a bit careless with the some of the facts.
It is certainly not a new story, in fact there is nothing remotely novel about the way it is told, and we have all seen this before, and, indeed, much more eloquently by Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry.
Eventually, spring comes around again, and the young child finds her fox, and indeed does strike up a friendship with the animal.
Luc Jacquet is a hugely talented, and indeed rare film-maker, and I was expecting some superb, breathtaking cinematography, sweeping vistas and brilliant footage of the wildlife.
Nightmare indeed.
"Cannibal Apocalypse" indeed feels, at times, a bit like Romero's "Dawn of the Dead" (1978), but the one movie that kept coming to my mind was David Cronenberg's "Rabid" (1977).
All the mystical stuff is indeed actually down to earth, factual and to be embraced.
Strange, indeed!
Although Kanika has a short role, the young lass shows that she can indeed act, a rarity in Tamil movies.
When Sharpe discovers that many women children and indeed babies have been massacred under the Frenchman's orders, he is outraged and promptly executes without trial the two French soldiers they have caught, making an enemy of Loup who now vows a bitter revenge.
La Semana del Asesino concentrates on Marcos & his thoughts & feelings, what makes him commit murder & the situation he has created that he can't seem to escape, no mention of the police investigation is ever made if indeed there was one.
Clerks is a rare thing indeed a low budget (about $25,000) indie comedy that's actually funny, not in an intellectual gentle way i.e.
At various points throughout the movie the viewer will notice the deterioration of the film stock, showing that TWO ARABIAN KNIGHTS was indeed rescued, like the princess, just in time.
Bottomline, apparently not an 'A' feature, but indeed worth watching for fans of a diverse range of films: Xfiles, Millennium, Point of Destination, Fallen, Prophecy etc.
So as a matter of fact, the legend about Ferrari plus racing driver, the engine noise and the gear change sounds are all fake - and pretty much "trucage", indeed.
Anthony Perkins is great as the creepy terrorist Lou Kramer and he is very odd indeed - a great role for him!
It features a totally off-the-wall performance by Roger Moore as an anti-terrorist expert who has some bizarre habits indeed, such as sewing, raising cats, and drinking whisky at 10a.m.
Maybe this is the flaw in the plot, since the guy indeed was a disgusting traitor of his country for money.
She is indeed "trampy" in this performance and lacks any subtlety whatsoever--probably not a bad thing considering the character she plays.
Anyway, I'm glad I did see her in this because she proved that she was indeed an excellent actress.
However, I have a feeling it's the former scenario which makes Sadie Thompson more than just a smart, wisecracking hooker and perhaps was indeed the personification of evil that Davidson railed against.
The title character, handsome and bi-sexual, added the homo-eroticism that made for a very happy young gay movie fan indeed.
Think Identity only the personalities do not die when they are killed, all these people are in his head with the exception of the nurses who are indeed real(paranoid schizophrenia), one personality Doctor Eck knows it enough to diagnose it, but the personality called Dr. Ek has an ulterior motive, aka the book of magik, therefore Trevor has no reason to believe that any of the people are not real.
Please note that the DVD is indeed edited.
Excellent self-adaptation of a short novel by Emmanuel CarrÃ¨re, La Moustache delivers the spectator with much more than it promises, in these days a rare occurrence indeed.
I think that viewed objectively it is indeed a better mini-series.
The sky effects are indeed pretty neat-looking, and I'm sorry I didn't get to see them on the big screen, though the near-complete failure to try to maintain registration between moving (or even stationary!)
There are some films, like Santa Claus the movie or indeed Hook that are continually panned by critics and cynics alike.
This is a step by step depiction of infiltration into a Qaida terrorist cell at a very high level indeed.
Omar ends up making excuses for Samir so he gets byÂbut the screenwriters cannot help but continually remind us (in the character of Samir) that the majority of Muslims reject violence (whether you agree or not with that idea, it just feels the point is made ad infinitum throughout the film perhaps in order to 'soften the blow' or 'balance things out' since the films' antagonists are indeed Islamic terrorists!).
Good one here indeed hence the 10 stars I'd give it even though it ain't win no Oscars or nothing of 'em nice awards.
The David bowie song ashes to ashes is heard at two pivitol moments in the movie and indeed makes the movie that much more enjoyable.
It is speculated in the film that Dolly told Kerr-McGee that Karen had gathered some particularly damaging evidence against them, which indeed Karen had done.
Going to the reporter from the New York Times was indeed the boldest thing she has ever done.
He has the talent of drawing the audience into the role he is playing at the time and that is a rare thing indeed!
Or more interestingly, from Saint Augustine: "Beauty is indeed a good gift of God; but that the good may not think it a great good, God dispenses it even to the wicked."
In an age when serial killers are deified, what Val Lewton and company wrought so long ago must seem tame, indeed; quaint.
More footage of the actual bang would have been appreciated, and indeed, I believe many guys will pick this film up expecting it to be pure porn.
It is rare indeed to find well written characters in films today and much less so in horror films.
What a contrast to the last film I saw (My Wife and My Dead Wife (1/10)), thanks guys for restoring my faith that there are some film-makers (and indeed talented actors) with intelligence and creativity who can use low budget challenges in a positive manner.
It is indeed sad to see so many talented actors tangled up in this unfortunate yawner.
My thoughts on the movieÂ Fabulous work paid to the environments, sets, ambiance, all in all, the entire community and style of ember was very enthralling and interesting indeed.
And as they come together and the Beast takes Belle in his arms, sweeping her in dance across the elegant ballroom floor, it becomes one of those rare cinematic `moments' that are entirely transporting, and it does, indeed, take you away.
Rather than a formal documentary style, it seems indeed that the more looser, almost experimental, style of production was en vogue at the time.
Senator Clark intends to cut the funds to the research of time travel, unless Dr. Phillips can prove that can indeed send a man back or forth in time and return him safe.
The shark attacks on the mini-subs are not convincing (indeed, the actors inside act more like they're getting ready to ride "Pirates of the Caribbean" at Disneyworld than they do reacting to being attacked by a 70-foot shark).
Rectal orifices, indeed!
Gable's "Blackie" Gallagher is not a paranoid hot-head like Tony Camonte or Rocky Sullivan, and, indeed, remains oddly passive throughout the film.
There's symbolism if you look hard enough, but the joy of the movie is the way it deals with different themes - homosexuality, identity, love and death - and shows us that life is indeed a little bit crazy.
Finally there is Jackie Cooper, one of the greatest child stars of his or indeed any era.
I very rarely give movies a 10, and I was indeed considering a 9 for a while, but for me this is one of those movies I will come back to time after time.
The movie maintains the same ambiguity about her guilt or innocence of the crime, indeed ending with a voice over narrator asking the title character as to whether she was guilty or innocent.
As history indeed bore out, it was a recipe for personal disaster.
That's no crime, but the bubbles in this champagne have gone very flat indeed.
Cagney was indeed brutal and off his rocker, but it was more controlled and offset with his characters smarts and sense of humor.
Very touching indeed.
The events which unfolded on 9/11 were indeed, well-coordinated, well thought-out, planned years in advance and executed with (just enough to fool the average dummy) military precision, by not by Osama Bin Laden or Saddam Hussein, that's for sure.
There was, indeed, something good about the period, too.
Levinson/Link production won raves upon its first network showing, and indeed it is smart, focused, and without stereotypes.
And this is a very delightful courtship indeed!
Yes, J.K. is indeed armed and dangerous.
