I have to say when a name like Zombiegeddon and an atom bomb on the front cover I was expecting a flat out chop-socky fung-ku, but what I got instead was a comedy.

Originally, Audrey Hepburn was the not the first choice for Breakfast at Tiffany's, instead they wanted Marily Monroe, and she would have been great, but her schedule wouldn't allow, and many others lost out to roles like these did.
The film instead essays a very peculiar mutual dependency, and it's a fascinating relationship to digest in the hands of these two gifted actors, both of whom make every scene they share sizzle as they play off of each other.
Back comes the previously fat and unattractive Goldie but instead, she is thin and looks even younger than she looked decades ago!
They concoct an  elaborate plot to push her car off Mulholland Drive, but Willis ends  up pushing her down the stairs instead.
It only resembles the comics in the visuals (which, by the way, still borrows a whole lot from Jeunet), but the plot takes the characters and gives them a 360 degrees rotation (if, in the comics, Ofelia ever kissed Mortadelo, instead of feeling pleased his reaction would be more like puking).
This film was rated G. If there had been live actors instead of animation, this thing would be rated PG.
I strongly suggest get the DVDs of "Machine Robo: Revenge of Cronos" (currently out on Region 1) instead and see how the Gobots & Rock Lords should have been done.
Sometimes they can be distracting (for example, you lose the illusion that a movie should create and instead you get the feeling that there are production people behind the camera) but still, the story and some of the characters depictions are so strong that you are still left with a haunting and depressing feeling long after the end credits.

This does not diminish our sympathy for them and the difficulties they face as a result of the arrival of Europeans--as it should not--and instead actually shows the great extent to which Native Americans in early colonial history had power and affected the course of events.
So, if you are avoiding this film because you hated Dances with Wolves and fell asleep every time you tried to watch Last of the Mohicans, try this film instead.
The Indians of that time didn't knew how to prononce R. So, in the movie, they say : obe noie, instead of Robe Noire (Black Robe).
McInnerny is back, and going by his wish to avoid being typecast as the innocent, and remarkably stupid, Percy, he instead is cast as a slimy rival to Edmund, with the unbelievably(though based on an actual poor bugger) unfortunate surname of "Darling", creating an utterly hilarious running gag.
Gore and torture pornography centred films like Saw and Hostel seem to have stole the foundations of horror and instead of focusing on truly scaring people through suspense, meticulous direction and script, these films focus solely on shocking people.
Rather than focusing on creating an atmosphere of fear, instead it works on drawing up sympathy for Laura's plight as events transpire against her and her family and the past comes back to haunt her.

As the gang attends to the customers to keep all quiet, they realize that instead of just robbing the place, they can make even more money by keeping the money that the patrons give them for pumping their gas!
The problem is that, instead, we get a boring, slow-moving, predictable "suspense" with a plot straight out of zillions direct-to-video movies, where Lamas' "interpretation" of his "character" sinks it to new depths (who ever asked him to be an actor anyway ?)
The screenwriter should have been shot instead of this movie.
Quentin Masters' spare, sharply observant direction wisely avoids the usual stylistic overkill excesses which mar many counterculture films made at the time, opting instead for a more timeless, largely unadorned and plainly naturalistic style which has dated pretty well.
The man he has wronged is also compelling in that instead of exacting quick revenge as we see with other martial arts films he wants to know his families murderer to find out why he killed them.
Now, instead of contrasting the interrogation of an Arab and an American, if the film makers would have woven together the stories of an innocent person being questioned and a terrorist making his way through multiple levels of bureaucracy - that would have been interesting.

when he sees Duwayne staring at himself.Why?Belial laughs wickedly after Duwayne explains about wanting to be normal.Again, I ask why?Sure, they had a nosy reporter trying to expose them,but not much else.Gore and violence seems like it was just thrown in, to keep the audience awake.But even the violent scenes are poorly executed.The one liners thrown in by Duwayne after a violent act,made me groan in pain.I wanted to throw rotten eggs at him.At least Freddy Kruger knows how to throw in funny oneliners.Then there is the scene that made me cringe(BRRR).If there's something I never want to see in a movie,its this.I never want to see ugly people naked or have sex,and I never want to see ugly monsters naked or have sex.It had belial and Eve having sex,ARRGHH!Eww, that was something I can live without.I'd rather have my toes cut off!And that painful excuse for violin music sounded like it was played by a dog.Woof!The musical score is Laurie Anderson bad.When Duwayne tries to get it on with Susan,we find out,(SURPRISE)she's a marsupial.And she has a disfigured sock puppet pop in and out of her pouch.The biggest pisser of all, is the fact this was a ripoff of "Nightbreed",a much a better movie that came out a few years earlier.The freaks in that movie were better made,plus the story and plotting were well written.Watch "Nightbreed" instead of this dreck.0 stars for this junk.

The werewolf costume, at times, almost drew chuckles from me instead of gasps and the supposed pairing of a feminine, girlish Derek and butch, beer-swilling, foul-mouthed Sam seems quite far-fetched and unreasonable.
If only the developers concentrated more on the characters and story, making some innovative levels and lots of enemies, instead of rushing this game out, Prey could have been one of the better 3D-shooters of all time.
Watch "Who am I" instead of this one.

Consequently, the humour does not stem from jokes but instead from the terrible production and acting, as well as Marenghi's misguided belief that he has created a timeless masterpiece.
This Movie is underrated I expected to see the average rating of 7 but instead I see 5.8.
This film felt fresh, not so "in your New York face" or centered on ethnicity as the others have, but instead about romance, sex, relationships, and personal responsibility.
He doesn't overpower you with the clichÃ© images of the Empire State building, the Statue of Liberty, or other overblown New York images, but instead makes you feel like you actually live there.

If you have the option pick up another Howard book instead of watching this nonsense.
There are bad guy minions in this movie that look like ninjas and a fair amount of scenes in which the character's voice inflection is completely inappropriate, not to mention the fact that instead of at least attempting to fake scientific jargon, lots of questions are answered with, "I can't tell you that, it's classified," or "it's so complicated, you wouldn't understand."
Please everyone who reads this (hopefully you don't bother the "Movie" is that bad) why don't you stick yourself w/needles under your fingernails instead; it's less painful.

The movie could have been better if it had been done as a theatrical release instead of TV.
They had taped it so they could watch some dumb sitcom instead.
Beyond that, Les Mayfield was using slapschtick humor, and the lot of them -- Jackson, Levy, Goss and Mayfield, seemed to pull it all off with an almost Buster Keaton style; the epitome of poker-faced comedy whereby the humor is delivered in a brown paper bag instead of a piÃ±ata spewing candy all over you (or worse, a pie in the face).

What I was expecting was some amateurish first film effort which I hoped would have enough good ideas to make it worth a full viewing; what I got instead was a minor masterpiece of cinema.
There are of course other nods like a shot that lingers on a doorway for ages instead of showing us what's happening inside which reminded me of a similar shot in Hitchcock's film 'Frenzy'.
The dialogue had a few chuckles but largely felt short of witty, and it couldn't seem to commit to comedy and instead comes off as a not so compelling drama with a few comic moments.

My suggestion is that you watch the "Cheesing" episode of SOUTH PARK and see their dead-on parody of HEAVY METAL instead--it's actually funny and worth seeing--unlike this rather stupid film.

I will admit that I didn't check this out because of Jay, but really instead because of Randy Quaid.
Freudian slips and double entendre are used instead.
The main reason for this is simple: instead of being a talkathon with secondary mystery elements like "Thumbs", this is a good old-fashioned whodunit with nearly all of the typical elements of the genre in place: a luxurious mansion, a large but limited number of suspects, a cunning police inspector, family secrets, intense emotions and rivalries, red herrings, etc.

I was'nt even that lucky...a spoof is always more entertaining....Ramu's factory is stagnating...he should try to become creative for a change...all the characters were so stereotype...the lead Randeep Hooda tried to force himself into the shoes of the silent cold angry young man from the slums with an underworld acumen that was played so brilliantly by chkraverthy in Satya ...although this character can be traced back to Amitabh in films like Mukaddar ka Sikandar, Trishul etc but chakraverthy was its RGV version and so a relevant example to quote here....needless to say, Hooda failed miserably.....he would have done well if he had just played himself......Chunkey Pandey was expecting to redo "tezaab" but those days are long over....his character was damn clichÃ©d just like all others in the movie...this is an era of "Hazaro Khwahishein Aisi" when every thing has to be brilliantly and refreshingly "original"...  ..Ramu should have stopped dabbling with underworld themes immediately after "company" which was his last watchable movie and was good off course...its time he realises that movie-making is an art and you have to "think" and "create" the design every time you make a product, instead of doing it once and then letting the assembly line take care for the rest.....probably his engineering background has to do with it..
Then you will end up actually enjoying the movie instead of panning it as just another mafia movie.

One of the things that he did to infuriate those who wanted to use the Allied victory to unleash a vindictive payback over and against the defeated enemy was to release the Post-War POW's under his jurisdiction, the only set of Post-war POW's to be set free during that time to go back home instead of suffering and dying of starvation and disease in unsheltered open fields surrounded by barbed-wire and shot at by guards as was the fate of others German solders in these post-war death camps.

This gets so hung up with the futility of life that Andre in effect turns off, instead of turning on, Wally to his new found insights.
I could write an entire dissertation about this movie and the aspects it raises about present day life, but instead I'll just simply state that this movie is flat-out amazing and will certainly make you reflect on the path of life you have chosen to follow.
The major flaw of the film is undoubtedly the camera-work, this is especially worrying with a film like this because in theory this should be one the most easiest films in history to shoot but instead of simply taking a subtle approach and showing the characters through two or three angles, the camera will suddenly jerk from one shot to the next in a very disorientated manner.
That's about as profound as this film gets in contrasting a quasi-scientific world view to a quasi-luddite one ("I won't get an electrical blanket because that kind of comfort just separates you from reality in a very direct way [...] and instead of living under the sun and the moon and the sky and the stars, we're living in a fantasy world of our own making" (!?)

Although that's a positive endorsement of the film--it's rare that a film has me basically speechless afterward (I usually suffer from logorrhea, which sounds close enough to diarrhea that you could call it (verbal) flatulence instead if you like)--it turned out to be quite a problem, because we went to dinner right afterward and I had to give a lecture.
A document is supposed to look at the real nature of things and openly present them to the viewer instead of reproducing old ideas and clichÃ©s, lying and controlling the subject to impose a wanted effect on them.

This film, shot on a shoestring (which might explain the poor quality - they should have shot it on film instead) in documentary style by Russell Mulcahy and Nic Knowland (who went on to helm the far less amusing HIGHLANDER and CATS respectively) at the Townhouse Studios in London, captures Cook and Moore in the process of recording the final Derek and Clive album.

Why can't people just let a movie be cute instead of analyzing it to death.
Yes, it was a parody of the secret-agent genre of the 1960s that peaked several years earlier, but I guess the picture is so disappointing because it seems to be built instead around the person of Dean Martin, and his real life image as that of a heavy drinking swinger.
(I suspect the only reason our setting is a newspaper office instead of, say, an insurance agency, was to justify a couple of title card quips about journalism: e.g., the editor has weak circulation like his paper, that sort of thing.)

People often ask, "Why does the Candyman haunt the black population instead of the descendents of those who killed him?"
Whether or not "Shapeshifter" is a SciFi original or not, it is representative of a bothersome trend...instead of trying to compete with other channels showing "classic" films or recent releases that are actually of some quality, give the viewer "original" garbage.

In my opinion Beynelmilel should have gone for Oscar instead of Dondurmam Gaymak.
Â although I must say I prefer the much cheesier video title "Carquake" Â is brought to us by the same team that made the brilliant and unequaled "Death Race 2000" one year earlier, and it many ways it feels as if writer/director Paul Bartel injected all the silly comedy that he couldn't put in "Death Race" into this film instead.

In 1955, the same year this great film was made, Jennifer Jones was Oscar nominated for "Love is A Many Splendored Thing," she should have been nominated for 'Dove' instead.
Not only that he is unfamiliar with his role as being notorious black prisonner - instead he is appearing as this shy,loving,undecided black prisonner.
Light wisely steers clear of explaining Hilley, instead playing the character straight, letting the absurdity of the story maintain the mystery of Hilley.
Also, I didn't understand the ending of the film--I was hoping it would say something to indicate that the director didn't really support the murder at the beginning, but instead it seemed to me to draw parallels between the victim and the murderer that I didn't think were appropriate.
I don't think it would have mattered if Hitler was in the room instead of Sophie, with a migraine attack like that he'd have still curled up with a pillow.
This is not a movie about sexism (while it is used quite often to hide the real truth), but instead the power of manipulation, the power of emotion, and the ability to use your friends to reach the top.
The violence is tame(..the usual beheading, followed by the head roll down a hill, an arm taken off, finger hacked away, all presented in such a way that look completely underwhelming) and I think one can tell that most of the money went to Furlong instead of proper make-up effects trumping our desire to see these characters die in a properly horrible manner.
The movie itself was pretty good, although I would have preferred if the movie was entirely serious instead of putting comic relief in the middle.
Knife meant to teach someone else a lesson by sabotaging a trail near his home,instead, Ko Chun is the victim.
Keep your eye on the clock that records the elapsed time following blast off, you'll note that it goes, 2:58, 2:59, and then 2:60 instead of 3:00, which makes perfect sense considering all the other goofy stuff that was going on.
(That's why three stars instead of one).

The original production had Peter Palmer in the lead with Edie Adams instead of Leslie Parrish being Daisy Mae.
The later scenes with the robbery gang, which should be the sparkling highlight of the movie, come off instead as irritating and quarrelsome.
Making a follow-up for a classic like "Bambi" is not easy, but the fact that the writers (Director Brian Pimental and newcomer Alicia Kirk) decided to explore an entirely "missing chapter" in the life of the young deer instead of making a proper sequel, gave them enough freedom to create a story that not only is fresh and original on its own, it also gives continuity to the original without disrespecting it or blatantly copying it.
By the end of the film, instead of improving, the film takes a nose-dive into wretchedness!
No anger, no recriminations but everyone instead being happy and even talking about setting Joan up in business!
It explores both sides and the ambiguity serves the narrative instead of causing confusion.
It is also good to see that real ships are used in the general shots, instead of models in a bath tub, and some of the camera shots of the battle are excellent.
It's nice to sea genuine warships of the period in their full spectacular and menacing beauty, instead of the usual tacky and implausible models.
Essentially, an evil Real Estate woman unearths a bog body and orders it dumped instead of reporting it to the authorities.
The scene when the two witch and her victim (played by the same actress) are in the house together sets up like a 3 Stooges routine, and the plot begs the question: if the witch wants to possess this other woman's soul, why doesn't she just do it instead of leading these people on this elaborate chase?
This time, instead of seeing that Fry's coming to the future was not entirely as it appeared in the first episode, ("The Why of Fry" season 4) we get to see another aspect of his life that was left behind--his faithful dog Seymour.
Wellman's assured direction is equally impressive; note how almost all of the violence occurs off-screen, which actually enhances instead of lessons the shocking impact of said violence.
Give me this movie instead of The Departed nay day, I admire its effectiveness in making its point without the use of gore, warlike violence and foul language, even if the message is somewhat preachy.
Regarding violence itself, I much prefer the old-style, manlier ways of settling scores such as showdowns, brawls, and duels instead of use of hit men, goons, and sub-machine guns, which may keep the "head" alive, but which reduces the heart.
Why not drop Russell altogether and instead focus on the relationship between the two men?
I put 2 stars instead of 1 just because i didn't change the channel and made me stay and watch how bad a movie can be.
The film ends on a rather low key, leaving you to wonder if there wasn't anything a tad more interesting to do with your 90 minutes instead of watching this incredibly confusing piece of italiana.
Jenny specifically asks for Tye to "entertain" that night--but Tye is "busy" (this INFURIATES her), so instead some gorgeous hot young black man with a honeyed-voice shows up and sings instead.
From a time in which movies were much more innocent, 'How Sweet It Is' is one of many comedies from the sixties that had to rely on script, timing, and facial expression instead of today's toilet humor to make audiences laugh.
Colossus instead gets in touch with its equally potent Russian counterpart Guardian.
If you are a sci-fi fan who likes to think instead of watching brain-numbing action, this film is definitely worth a look.

With all deference to the comments of a previous reviewer (that Big Brother was a TV show, instead of one of the most influential novels of the 20th century), this movie is not about an all-knowing computer that runs every individual's personal life.
They insinuated the gore instead of showing it.
Afterall Alfred Hitchcok made his career from making movies where everything happens in the human psyche instead of on screen.
Suddenly she gets a pair of pants instead of a long skirt, a gun, and suddenly she's Sigorney Weaver in Aliens?!
Surprisingly, he doesn't allow gore to overpower the action, preferring to concentrate on characterisation and atmosphere instead (in fact, what little bloodletting there is tends to be rather restrained and those seeking excessive amounts of entrail eating would be better off looking elsewhere).
Remakes usually are a curse for us, horror fans, but "Night of the Living Dead" is a different story, since director Tom Savini obviously made this film because he wanted to tribute the original instead of using the idea of a remake as an easy excuse to further exploit a profitable franchise.
Gripping, it covers a lot of territory in a HIGH-BUDGET setting (If this had been made a year later, instead of being pre-BONNIE & CLYDE, THE GRADUATE< IN COLD BLOOD, etc.)
Just caught this last night and was expecting powerful drama based on IMDb reviews, but instead found a mess of a movie.
This makes me wish he was given more parts such as this instead of the grade-c schlock he was confined to late on.
The last strange thing - why do they make a film on "Statskiy Sovetnik" (the 6th book) after "Turetskiy Gambit" instead of "Leviafan", which is supposed to be the 3rd book in the series?
And hardly arrest Petju Yablokov later: in the encryption sent by him instead of a word "Plevna" the word "Nikopol" has appeared.

First off the movie would have been better if the movie ended with the astroids instead of 10 minutes in to the movie.
As Allan and Gabby share a passionate conversation, director Archie Mayo poignantly frames their face to face encounter around the background features of Mrs. Chisholm, dramatizing the lost purpose and vitality of a woman who gave in to her family's wishes instead of her own.
Also involved is Elmer (done for the first time by Mel Blanc instead of Arthur Q. Bryan) and the Mama Bear from Chuck Jones' Three Bears cartoons.
For once the mobsters are largely portrayed as nasty, psychotic pricks instead of some Disney like Mr Cool.
Just saw this film last night on Sundance and one thing that struck me about this film was the similarity to the works of Dario Argento, even down to the gloved hands of the murderer (albeit white gloves, instead of the black ones in Argento's films), did the director use his hands like Argento does as well?
TELL ME SOMETHING is one of those rare treats from Asia, as it has no creepy little girls with long black hair, or ghosts, or "rings", or anything like that - instead this film is a straight forward serial-killer horror/thriller, and a pretty damn good one at that...
To cover up, the director decided to use scene with car crashing into barrels of water instead.
Then, when attacked in a dark alley by the murderer in a car, while the murderer is threateningly -- but patiently -- gunning the engine in neutral apparently waiting for the cop to decide where to run, the cop runs straight for a fence, and the inevitable man-climbs-fence-while-chased-by-car scene, instead of calmly stepping back through the OPEN DOOR into the brick building he just came out of.
At one point, echoing a scene from the former, Detective Cho (Suh-kyu Han) is lying exhausted in a rain-soaked alley way, while the killer sits waiting in his car, only two metres away; but instead of running Cho down, the killer screams away into the rain.
This is ( as many people have pointed out ) not an actual Miss Marple book, instead they have taken another book and included Miss Marple in the story.

Don't bother with this--read the book instead.
This could have become a messy stew - instead, it's a very entertaining epic for the romanticists among us.
This is the first episode where Sam & Dean face human villains instead of supernatural monsters.
One of the first shows where the brothers go against humans instead of the supernatural.
None of the characters behave in the typical ultra-stupid "I'm in a horror movie so I'm not gonna scream for help but instead hide until I get eaten" manner which helps.
but we didn't expect kind of barking sharks, wires falling down under water with the speed of falling on land, talking divers though used a normal mouthpiece instead of a full face mask.
I rented it thinking it was another Deep Blue Sea and instead we got a Sci-Fi movie of the week full of stock footage.
It adds to the insane charm of the piece, which is why I gave it a 2 star rating instead of a 0.
The characters are all severely lacking in charisma, particularly the so-wet-you-almost-don't-feel-sorry-for-him cat, the animation is lumbering and predictable, the musical number is flat and the story doesn't build naturally, instead resorting to a tacked on and completely unsatisfying finale in which the cat does a too-sudden about face and metes out a workmanlike beating to each individual rat, a production line revenge that is less than thrilling to watch.
AGain, I do say watch the film if you want to see Madhuri again, the movie does solely get a 7/10 for her presence (or else it would get a 2/10) or watch one of her other films instead such as HAHK, Devdas or even Hum Tumhare Hain Sanam.
In my opinion this is much better than Om Shanti Om and should have been released for the festive season instead of OSO.
So he never tells Naina that he loves her instead of that he hooked Naina with her best friend Said Ali Khan whose a total flirt but later on fells in love with Naina too..

People in the USA want to see stupid, banal movies instead of intensively profound movies that grab you on multiple levels.
Like "The Crow" before it, "Dark City" is heavy on set-design, bleak atmosphere and memorable visuals, but thankfully, the script (co-written by David S. Goyer) is smart enough not to hinge on special effects and set design, and rather, toys with your expectations while delivering something stream-lined and efficient, instead of being overly long and bloated like it very well could have been.
He uses the Gothic and claustrophobic themes commonly and dark colors prevail during the film like "The Crow" .The story doesn't follow a certain order of rule, instead there is some mind games and puzzles in the film, that causes watchers to be active in each minute and motivate to the movie..
The role of the President was originally written for Kevin Costner who instead choose to do The Postman(1997).
Of course, the president does not get captured, but instead eludes the terrorist and complicates matters for them as he frees some of the hostages and instead of leaving himself stays to get his family back.
To subconsciously get into the minds of soccer moms and make them feel safer by making US soldiers (who get paid for this sort of thing) the target for terrorists in Iraq instead of civilians at home?
In terms of "spoofing" "The Shawshank Redemption" (which is what I had hoped for), all they can come up with are stupid puns on words from the movie, like "Randy" instead of "Andy."
I would have liked a big gaping wound when a throat gets slashed instead of stupid red magic marker drawn on the victim's neck - which is exactly what this movie does.
The plot line follows that of "Fiday the 13th" -- the only difference, and it's huge, is that instead of watching the kids die one by one in imaginative efx sequences, all of the violence takes place off-camera.
If you're tempted by the premise, skip this turkey and rent the original "Friday the 13th" instead.
Robert Favreau did an incredible and sensitive job in being suggestive instead of using candid images but there are moments in the film that remain very hard to witness.
There isn't space to get into all the characters but it's clear that Hitchcock opted for genuine faces instead of glamor pusses in this story.
The prospect of life giving fresh rain is replaced by sunshine instead of a storm, but which is better?
The brilliance of this movie is how it portrays good and evil in little glimpses instead of broad strokes.
Usually, this annoys me; but here it's done really well, and the propaganda is actually worked into the story instead of just being there to rally the allied population at the time.
Particularly inspired is the way DMDWP takes scenes from these films that are meant to be deadly serious and reworks them through clever editing and Martin's reactions so they become comedic instead.
Director Carl Reiner and lead actor Steve Martin instead actively embrace the clichÃ©s and conventions of the noir style, adding their own jokes, of course, but primarily drawing humour from the characters' deadpan reactions to ridiculous scenarios.
The funny teaming of Carl Reiner and Steve Martin after The Jerk(1979), brought you a funny send up of private eye films of the 1940's, but instead of it being just a simple spoof, the filmmakers went further, on having old film footage of great actors like Bette Davis, Barbara Stanwyck, Alan Ladd, and Humphrey Bogart for Steve Martin to play off of.
I can only urge anyone reading this to do yourself a favor and rent a porn instead.
This movie is full of hilarious one liners like when Tiffani says that she wishes a guy would say "I love you" instead of "Take it you tight little ..", that and many more.
Al Pacino is once more the great actor of early films such as 'Scarecrow', instead of the theatrical performer of recent films.
You see that they do not come out of the blue, instead they are created by the system and after having been victimized to the point of losing their humanity , they turn up in the scene to respond to all this, and their response does not have a particular aim, it is nothing but the fight for existence, the timing of the response completely depends on the threshold of the ability to stand more of it/or not.
If NBC was complaining because no one watched it, they should've tried advertising it more and keeping it in the SAME timeslot instead of shuffling it around and weakening the small fanbase.
It goes to prove that the head honchos don't know quality when they see it and instead allow a number of abyssal reality shows or sitcoms to run for multiple seasons.
I thought the last episodes were going off in some strange directions which may have made more sense had the show continued: Lindsay following the Grateful Dead instead of going to the Academic Summit, Daniel joining the audiovisual team and playing Dungeons and Dragons, Nick discovering disco, and Ken going out with a tuba player.
The one plot point that could have spiraled into maudlin triteness was the obligatory custody battle, but instead was turned into a chance for all concerned to grow as characters, and was handled more tastefully than any such situation handled on film in years.
What could have been a sappy movie-of-the-week instead stands as a true work of film.
If you're looking for little known good science fiction you haven't already seen, try "The Quiet Earth" instead.

antonio baderas is high in my list of today's most promising directors and this film shows the perspectives he has as a director.. any way you should go see this movie and don't let its rating stop you from watching it because it almost did it to me and now i realise how i would have regretted had i not rented this movie instead of an other
Don't waste money renting this movie, instead if you see it, throw it in the trash.
Progression is the key, and Ernest went for a 70's blaxpoitation thing here instead of just telling the tale as it should be.
For a MUCH better horror movie that reflects the black urban experience, rent "Tales from the Hood" instead.
Then maybe he could just think about what he threw away, instead of suddenly thinking he was a jerk because screw arounds are in for the short haul.
I should have listened to my head instead of my eyes.
The acting could have been much better, I would have liked to have seen tears instead of attempts to generate them, but still the most moving of all four segments.
I especially liked the relationship between Miguel and his brother, Chato -- one of trust and closeness instead of the deceit and backstabbing that's all too common in shows along the same lines.
Paulette Goddard, in the role of Southern belle Loxi, conjured up images of what would have been if she had been cast as Scarlett in Gone With the Wind four years earlier, instead of Vivien Leigh.

I only wished the director has used Brett to his fullest talents instead of as an aside eccentric.
I just bought this on dvd the other day allthough i must admit i wasn't looking for it as i wanted to buy ghost world but the shop didn't have it(DAMM YOU WOOLWORTHS IT'S A GREAT MOVIE NOW I AM GOING TO HAVE TO GO TO VIRGIN IN CARDIFF)anyway i went across to w.h smith and even though they didn't have it, they did have this gem on the shelf, so i bought this instead.
Another is the first meeting between Andy Garcia and Sean Connery, in which the latter decides to recruit Garcia's Italian character in spite of racial feuding (Connery's supposed to be Irish), and instead because he likes his mouthy, bold attitude.
And lastly, what good is a large handful of fully-fledged wonderful scenes if you are not going to juxtapose them with something, instead of dishing them out every now and then to keep our interest?
Let the audience THINK instead of being hand fed everything.
Let's make it so that he'll be out and about in the sea and completely defenseless, but instead they go pick on a jet plane and then be so kind as to leave him alone when he goes to save the mandatory hot female pilot.
But instead of learning from those experiences, he chooses to repeatedly exploit the concept for the cheapest of laughs in a show that redefines the phrase "appealing to the lowest common denominator".
The writing incorporates some very modern scenarios (example: Baby Girl got on the internet just looking for pictures of some pussycats....you can guess the rest) but incorporates them in ways that seem realistic and timely instead of contrived and trendy with a short shelf-life.
Of the three films mentioned, however, I would recommend watching 'My Science Project,' instead.

Perhaps, instead of pondering which gender's rule the E.U.
The whole first part of the film sounds like a bad documentary from an educational channel: we could have read a guide-book, instead.
Rondo Hatton, better known for his role as the "Creeper" in the Sherlock Holmes movie, "The Pearl of Death," also plays the Creeper here Â this time without Sherlock Holmes Â but with such a depth of feeling that audiences more accustomed to hating and fearing monster-murderers may feel pity for the vengeance minded killer instead.
There are some beautiful locations and the cast looks good and seems capable enough, but it's been directed as a heavy drama  with deep dark pain at its core-- instead of a romantic coming-of-age story that mixes comedy, drama and quirky charm in equal measure.
In the book the story is told through the journal entries of 17-year-old Cassandra Mortmain, a very bright aspiring writer, and her voice has an intensity, precociousness and excitement that just hurls the reader blissfully along; but in the movie  Cassandra's voice-over narration lacks every single one of these qualities and instead has a solemn, mournful tone.
Yet he moves away from the Nighy-like acting of "charming prat" here and instead hands in a bruised, broken and tragic performance.
The best Twilight Zone episodes were those where the meaning was not obvious and was instead subtly conveyed via fantastical allegory.
Then there's the fact that Moira is a dominatrix, the film comes alive when she goes into mistress mode & abuses her husband & her scenes are the only reason I'm giving Blood Dolls 3 stars instead of 1.
Blood Dolls is a cheap, poor, plot less attempt at starting another killer toy franchise by Charles Band, do yourself a big favour & watch Puppet Master, Dolls or Child's Play (1988) again instead.
I also wished that Wright was the heroine of the story who saves the day instead of that silly looking creature.
The graphic violence is also memorable, reminiscent of "Dawn of the Dead" in the way that the gore comes off as cartoonish instead of realistic.
Its a Milt Franklyn score instead of Carl Stalling.
With dreadful production values, acting to match, several interminably dull scenes of inane dialogue between the law and a variety of viable suspects, some equally inane chit-chat from the stupid couples who visit the drive-in (they keep on coming, despite the presence of a maniac), a totally incongruous scene where a machete wielding loon is pursued through a warehouse by the cops, an ending that fails to resolve matters (preferring instead to rely on the old 'the killer might be amongst you' gimmick), and very little in the way of gore after the first few minutes, Drive In Massacre will test the patience of even the most avid fan of grade-Z horror.
Eye Candy: Jessica Pare gives glimpses of her ass & a VERY nice shot of her magnificent natural melons(but you have to struggle with the film for a tad more than an hour to get to this, so just skip this and watch her in "Lost and Delirious" instead)   My Grade: D   Where i saw it: @ Max
Bette Davis plays a role in which she could had easily gone over-the-top with, since its a very stubborn and spoiled character but instead she plays her role more humane and realistic, which also keeps her likable.
I am watching this movie now and beside myself at how poor the casting was in this film, it is terribly and terrificly acted by most with maybe the exception of Tina's sister, a virtually unknown actress, maybe the actors have no comedic timing, but Pare specifically makes on camera acting mistakes I haven't seen since on camera acting 101, she is unbelievably plastic and lacks any emotive qualities whatsoever, there are no layers or dimensions in her character structure whatsoever her likability is nil, I'm watching a train wreck by a director who should've taken more care with his film instead of just collecting a paycheck which is what this film looks like
She starts to turn away to leave, but decides instead to extend her hand in Southern feminine cordiality to wish him well.
This film could easily have been nothing more than an homage to R. Crumb's 'seminal' works, but instead offers nuanced interpretation from some intelligent people.
See this version instead.
And instead of a hero that didn't seem to care too much about this killing (though it was mostly just the actor, Tom Jane)we had the cool three dimensional Charles Bronson.
It's not the action-packed thrill-fest that movies like "Kill Bill" or "The Punisher" seek to be, instead it's a haunting, sometimes intoxicating look at our society's views on justice.
When Preston stays in a meeting in the bank instead of with Julie, she wears a red dress against Preston will in a traditional ball where the upper class ladies white to get even, shocking the local society with her attitude.
But instead of a never ending and overly talky film, we get a tightly wound and much better paced film from Scorsese.
However, instead of working in a hospital, they work in the doctor's home which is more like a castle (in Los Angeles, okay?).
The credits roll from top-to-bottom instead of bottom-to-top.
I encourage those who get caught up with the flashy title to instead search for something meaningful, like John Woo's earlier films.
This is why I gave the movie a 9 instead of a perfect 10.
With their third generation of "Godzilla" films being kicked off with this flashy new movie, Toho continued a trend that was seen in generation two, where they discard the events of the previous Godzilla incarnation and instead start with the original 1954 "Godzilla" and work from there.
Toho took full advantage of this new series by designing a distinctly reptilian Godzilla, who as the film opens, has already popped up on the radar of some brainy scientist who argues that Godzilla should be studied, instead of destroyed.
It is 1850's New Orleans, and Julie Marsten (Davis), a head-strong young woman who doesn't find it the least improper to be late for her own engagement party because she feels like riding her horse instead, is getting married to Preston Dillard (Fonda).
Neither of them cracks a smile as they talk about how the parts are bolted tightly together instead of screwed, how the joints must be tightly fitted ("so rare," remarks the lady), and how America is "a land of many prominent erections."
Watch any other Kirk Morris film instead, like COLOSSUS AND THE HEADHUNTERS.
I think the guys behind this should have stuck a maniac with an axe in this instead of a bad looking midget monster.
Writer/director Rolfe Kanefsky's droll, low-key, properly straight-faced and restrained style never devolves into the overly broad or excessive, instead nicely maintaining a dryly deadpan and ingratiatingly affectionate tone throughout.
Worth watching, but probably better as the end of a trilogy instead of the beginning.
If you're interested in a film that got it right, instead of horribly wrong like Candyman 3: Day of the Dead, pick up a copy of the original Candyman instead.
There is a young boy inside, who is asked to jump out, but instead, he pushes the device for lifting and it flies away.
While Enid and Rebecca discover that life outside of high school isn't as great as they imagined it to be, Seymour (who already knows about the loneliness of life) tries for once in his life to actually start living instead of just floating through life.
"Sherlock Holmes and the Case of the Silk Stocking" could have benefited slightly from being shortened to 1 and 1/2 hour instead of the apx.
The Grey Zone, instead, offers no hope or alternative, nor uplifting ways, nor any of the characters show any noble redeeming actions towards their fellow inmates.
This cartoon short SHOULD have won the Oscar instead of Lend A Paw!
It makes you feel it's possible to combine successfully the ingredients of your personality, like in a good recipe, instead of having them at war with each other.
I just despised the physical depiction of the Red Skull...they could have done so much more with the make up...instead it looks like a bad Darkman rendition.
The story is full of holes, lacks logic (why did the Red Skull cut off his own hand to escape Cap instead of plunging the knife into Cap's chest?
Keaton looks at the twig and thinks about hitting the girlfriend but instead hugs and kisses her.
Then, in a moment that has an audience roaring and clapping, Johnnie grabs her and half-throttles her before kissing her instead.
and is turned down because the army feels he'd be much more valuable for the war effort as an engineer instead of a soldier.
The Prodigal has a semi sequel feel to it Purdom plays the rube in the city instead of the cynical doctor, Audrey Dalton is the good girl in Jean Simmons' place and Lana Turner gets to play all three bad girls in the Egyptian.
Now all four of them plus a friend are on the long journey life looking for happiness and instead they get trouble.

But for some reason this film makes it feel like it was the 90's instead of the 80's.
This could have been one of the great science fiction movies of the 80's; instead it's become little more than a curiosity (the movie flopped upon its initial release), showing up on cable TV here and there.
Instead of the modern notion of story-telling and action, the crew was breaking new ground and made a bizarre film that appears more like a series of vignettes instead of a coherent film.
But, instead of having them act out the story, the film shows inter-title cards that describe what has occurred and the cast pose like they are going to be photographed or just make a few minimal movements or actions until the next card appears to describe an all-new scene.
Aimed at the matinÃ©e crowd, this particular instalment features none of the graphic nastiness or raciness that can be found in the first two Tarzan films (the obligatory native killing at the end of the filmÂvia a huge skull-cracking deviceÂis brief and non-explicit); instead, we get mild peril as Boy is attacked by pipe-cleaner tarantulas and a back-projected rhino, comic relief courtesy of Cheetah the chimp, and a lot of fun interplay between Tarzan and his 'son', the best scene being an impressively shot moment of underwater horseplay.
TARZAN FINDS A SON is a grand scale production and the only one in the series set in a time frame of more than the standard months or weeks, in this instance, five years, although the movie itself gives the impression of taking place solely in 1939 instead of from 1934 to the present, especially since Maureen O'Sullivan's 1940s hairstyle is evident throughout, but otherwise, makes little difference to the plot since it's the story and action the viewers come to see.
This film, however, polarizes the two sides of the issue instead of exploring the ways in which they intersect.
While this story concept is by no means a novel one, writer Ligiah Villalobos has provided a script that avoids taking sides, but instead concentrates on creating wholly believable characters caught in the web of immigration - from both sides of the wall.
I'm afraid much of the blame must go to Rick Moranis and Joan Cusack, who instead of playing "the straight man" sort of plays goofy unbelievable characters in the straight man role.
The writers, in my perspective, are getting pretty desperate.. Too bad The Simpsons are still on instead of Futurama.
I just wish FOX were the people who picked it up again instead of freaking' Comedy Central.
All I have to say is the biggest mistake in television history was to cancel this show, and put Family Guy back on instead of this.
Her hair is not the platinum blonde of so many of her pictures but instead a darker blonde.
Clark Gable, for example, plays devoted husband and businessman instead of a tough guy like he usually does.
instead, the film indulges in the American atrocities committed at Abu Ghraib, while sympathizing with those who were jailed.
Morris keeps his authorial influence to a minimum, instead allowing his subjects to speak for themselves.
Apparently, again and again, Laughton ignored his director and instead of a subtle or believable performance, he was shrill and bellicose--looking nothing like the great actor he was in some of his other films.
Viewing this instead as most people do, as Hitchcock-in-development, will probably only lead to disappointment, as can be seen from other user comments.
I think studio heads really saw Rogers' amazing abilities through the end of World War II (after which she was shamefully abandoned) - she seldom played the "classy woman" and we instead find her as a shop girl, prisoner on furlough, society wannabe, entertainer.
But this time, the distributors are Walt Disney Pictures instead of Kids WB!.
He instead meets with the mysterious facts surrounding the death of Lime, learned bit-by-bit from Lime's friends, a woman named Anna Schmidt, who has problems of her own (played excellently by Valli), and two British officers, Calloway and Paine.
Early in the film Douglas discovers his wife's infidelity, and in his confrontation with Mortensen, instead of trying to banish or destroy him, Douglas hires him.
Save your time and money and rent the original "Dial M for Murder" instead.

'Naked Fear' could have at this point simply turned into a boring exploitationer with the main purpose for the camera to linger on De Lucas' nude body as she runs from her nemesis, but instead director Thom Eberhardt crafts a suspenseful and enthralling movie.
Scars instead of paint, and the poetic quotations are missing, I liked that, that makes the motivation of the character more visceral and organic and painful; a way to drag his sacrifice as a reminder.
This movie more focuses on the action of the movie instead of the sadness involved, but in most respects as said earlier, it is a step up.
Eric Mabius makes a really good Crow, though he is sort of a more "anti-hero" filled with rage in this movie instead of a good guy.
Unfortunately, his look as the crow isn't exactly cool, instead, he looks kind of gross.

What is so said is that Turkish film industry keeps using some useless actors and actresses instead of the players of this movie.

Yes, you'll have to deal with four creepy girls instead of one like a normal horror film would.
The film is beautifully made, with a soundtrack that sets the mood instead of "cu-ing" you on how you are supposed to react to a scene (like so many soundtracks try to do these days).
It has nothing to do with characters , plot or even his album (which the movie is titled after) , instead it is about Cam'ron.
My favourite moment of the film is when Dreyfuss's character sees an attractive, young blond early on - he later tries frantically to contact her - she eventually does, but just says her dues and leaves him - the boy, instead of being heartbroken or dissatisfied is happy and upbeat - at least he gave it a chance, at least he lived, as my father put it 'the teenage dream'.
Unfortunately, there are none of the familiar Euro-Cult faces or even a rousing score which would make all this palatable; what we have instead are an abysmal SS anthem, "Lullaby for Monsters"(!!

People were too worried about the movie appearing to condone child pornography instead of watching the movie for what it was actually about: a movie about death, mourning, and re-incarnation.
It is more than a movie to me.I could really relate to Joshua as i also used to think a lot about God at that age partly because i was born in a very religious family.The feelings Joshua goes through in his search for god and how it changes him to a certain extent for eg, when Freddie Waltman-a boy who has bullied Joshua since 3rd grade has to leave school...instead of feeling happy he feels really sad for him... have been narrated on screen beyond words...only a genius could have achieved this.
But Ann Hecht also wears a red wig instead of her usual blond hair and I didn't know who she was until I read the credits at the end of the movie.
I for one am glad that movies like TCM the beginning come out now and again to the same Criticisms that should be praised rather than scored, but then again i am of a generation that applauds the blood, and Gratuitous violence and dreary depression or horror, instead of going eeewww thats gross!

Well, unlike the other films as well as KAIRO, gobs and gobs of money weren't spent on special effects or trying to scare the audience--instead, the emphasis was on the story.
The basic premise involves a haunted website, so when I sat down to view it I was expecting something at the same level of terrible as fear.com; instead, I was shocked to find a truly provocative story full of surrealism and drama that examines the concept of isolation and the deep fear that all people have of loneliness.
"To Hell and Back" is a good war movie, but it would have been better if Audie Murphy narrated the movie instead.
Plus, coupled with a performance that never begs for attention but instead simply plays the man he's supposed to be portraying with no overt padding, Del Toro goes a long way to giving Che the right amount of conviction that is needed to keep thing interesting and dynamic.
No, instead the movie tells the facts as they were, straight from the horses mouth, and while they can sometimes work against the common desires of cinema goers' need for personal fulfillment, if digested objectively, can provide a strongly engaging, interesting and informative piece of historically significant art.
Another plus point for The Mercenary is that it does not suffer from the messy plotting of Corbucci's previous westerns, having instead a very tight storyline from Franco Solinas with screenplay by another Leone collaborator, Luciano Vincenzoni.
But instead we got a good, yet dissapointing movie adaptation.
Why did not this film receive a descent DVD-treatment instead of the much inferior "Two Companeros"?
For the fans of this type of films, I'd highly recommend Men Behind The Sun, Audition and/or Ichi the Killer instead!
What made this movie so groundbreaking when I first saw it in the summer of 1976 was that kids were portrayed as they really were instead of as the innocent, sometimes mischievous cherubs that most movies presented.
Picture it instead as a novel, a novel that you have to sit down, appreciate the plot and the characters as you watch the plot develop over its grand four-disc length.
But he just wants to get paid and get the job over with, but when their first game comes along, the kids get creamed 26-0, Buttermaker is pressured to drop the team out of the league, but instead teaches the kids how to play and recruits a couple of new kids, a girl who's mother he used to date, and a rebel without a cause.

It was what made the series unique instead of MP which always runs and you never have enough ethers for the last battle!
"Civil union" instead of marriage is like the old segregationist policy "Separate but equal", which the late Thurgood Marshall argued, if it's separate, it's not equal.

Except instead of 7, there are only 5 or 6 heros in this movie.
And instead of Yul Brynner we get Roddie Piper.
It is understandable that Fox would want to cut these offending bits (seeing as how they cut an hour of candid footage of David Fincher out of the Alien 3 Special Edition documentaries), so they recut the film and had it focus on the first movie instead.
I like the way the screenplay parcels out needed information instead of laying it all out at the beginning.
One has to wonder why they spent those first 3 weeks building those wonderful living quarters instead of a raft which they could have used to get OFF the island, but hey, then the movie couldn't have lasted as long as it did.
So why didn't they call it a 'uranium mine' instead?!
I would call it a very difficult lesson in life to be learned, about letting go of the past and thinking of present values and the future instead - reaching forward to the positive in life and releasing the past - something not everyone is prepared to do.
I finally gave up on the film about halfway into it, preferring instead to devise ways of torture to be implemented on its demented, sadistic producers.
One slight difference is that the footage is coming in via a live satellite feed instead of someone finding film cannisters and viewing them later.
I have just seen the movie and i think it's really cool The thing i liked the most is the plot I wouldn't change a thing about it it was perfect But the thing's i didn't think were all that great Was the color of the 2000 Mitsubishi eclipse silver They should have gone for something like red or blue How ever the underground lighting kit was cool But that's not the end the other thing i did'NT like was The 2004 Pontiac GTO with the 350 horse LS1 under the hood It would have been better to have used the 05 model with the 400 horse LS2 THAT WOULD HAVE BURNED SOME SERIOUS RUBBER Also the should have used NOS nitrous instead of ZEX They should have of raced the GTO at least once to see what kind of power it had the thing that would have been really cool is to have battled the eclipse against the GTO Another thing that stumped me was how did Dennis hopper know about The drift trick with the hand brake when he was driving the eclipse

they could of saved money and used an extra instead of a porn-star, and used that money for better effects, better actors, or a better script.
It is the simplicity of the art that shows what needs to be shown and keeps the story linear, instead of making a muzzled storyline as in other action films.
It knows that it is an action film and uses this as the foundation to work with, instead of making out it is some sort of psychological examination of killers like so many Hollywood films.

The difference is, "Supergator" takes place in Hawaii instead of some small hick town.
Since Roger Corman has launched the careers of everyone from Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Jack Nicholson, Jamie Lee Curtis and Brad Johnson, I hope the actors in this movie will follow in the footsteps of these fine examples instead of the Candice Railson and Mary Woronov's of his company.

It's hard to make people age 40 years in one movie, I know, so, director, you have my respect for Adriana, because she really ages perfectly, although when you look carefully, you do see she's only in her 30s instead of her 70s... :)
Events in Italian history are not crammed into 120 minutes but is instead elongated, as Matteo and Nicola react in their own ways to the events that occur in their country.
I've watched both previous movies on the Rwandan genocide, but this documentary hit home the hardest because, instead of showing the gut-wrenching and sensational time of killings, it brings to light the inaction of the rest of the world and the reasoning behind it.

I agree with someone who said that his passions must have been diverted away from healing when he set them on Julie instead, and I was not surprised when this happened.
Or I suppose you could just read a good book instead.
Ms. Holland's film is complicated, in that it asks the viewer to think about how Julie's actions to save Nick, her young son, stricken with a rare cancer, clash with the medical science because she goes with her instincts instead, when she takes the boy to be seen by a folk "healer" in Poland.
Ultimately, I found it less effective than the other two pieces, which opt for the understated instead of overt "extremes."
I liked the very beginning of "Cut" the best, with its strange and alluring female specter; I found myself wishing the filmmakers had developed this scene as a narrative instead of the main story.
I had a lot of problems with this story, first of all there were a collection of open flamed candles behind the director, I'm sure he could have used those to burn through the ribbon joining his hands together, and also there was a number of times were the extra came so close to the director that he could have easily swung for him, instead he just listened to him talk.
If it had been done with more polish and vigor this wash-out could have made for an amusing and enjoyably quirky little horror black comedy, but since it's really bland and slapdash it instead qualifies as a very middling and forgettable cinematic dead end.
Feeling that her Job should be in the home doing house-work and bringing up a couple of kids instead of being on the streets hunting and shooting down bad guys.
The credits for The Enforcer show Will Hutchins as "Stakeout cop"(uncredited), but does anyone else agree that that role and character were actually part of the liquor store stakeout/holdup sequence in Magnum Force instead?
and displays unusual brutality in roughing up a man who feigns heart attacks instead of paying his restaurant billsÂ  Advertised as the 'dirtiest Harry of them all,' it is also the weakestÂ Without the experience of Siegel or Milius to help him, Eastwood took a gamble on James Fargo, his assistant director on some of his previous films and the result was competent action but a noticeable lack of depth and subtletyÂ
Try washing your face instead of painting it.
Imagine a hideous remake today for the multiplex mob: Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore instead of Cary Grant and Irene Dunne... with Rob Schneider in the Randolph Scott role.
Don't waste your time on this, watch and watch again "The Awful Truth" starring the same pair instead, and contrast the treatment of Ralph Bellamy's character with that of Patrick's.
Reeling from this final tragedy, he goes home - but instead of unlocking the door and going inside to continue his life of loss, pain, being ground underfoot by Lady Luck, and honest graft being rewarded by nothing but poverty and misery, he makes a snap decision, he loses his last marble, and embarks on a very different life path indeed - one steeped in violence, rage and brutality.
The villains are all memorable and very mean and nasty instead of lovable like say Freddy Krueger became.
i think the main problem with the movie isn't the movie, it's that people are going in expecting a thriller instead of a drama.
If only Negulesco had stayed with this kind of intense dramatic films instead of wasting his time with such later things as the appalling and revolting cream-puff, 'Daddy Long Legs' (1955).
This film could be a real gem if it would not be a fake; it is largely sustained by the great performance of the 2 actors, also there is a pleasant and fortunate choice of characters around them, the screen play has wonderful passages but ... the whole is incredibly wasted under a ton of moralistic non sense mainly anti sexual: the lovers go around spending their passion in thousands of kisses but never are able to complete it with what you are expecting they must do; instead here is the punishment; after the last stupid, unbelievable and meaningless misunderstanding the girl run away and is knocked down by a car; he visits her at the hospital all seems OK but when he comes again the doctor says she is dead; what do you expect him to do, perhaps bursting into tears?
Director Fernando Di Leo is best known to us horror nuts for SLAUGHTER HOTEL (1971), a sleazy "giallo" that forgets to be thrilling or horrific and instead concentrates mainly on getting its female cast members naked during gratuitous lesbian and solo sex scenes.
The first thing that struck me about this particular documentary was that it didn't have a lot of the traditional interviews and there was no voice over - instead the filmmakers developed the story through the characters themselves, and what ensues is a unique approach to this form of film-making.
The script by Erik Anjou plays the concept far more like a standard teen slasher (as if we didn't already have enough) rather than trying to develop the demonic phone-line to hell idea as in the first, instead they take the 976-EVIL premise & simply use it to give some supernatural powers to a homicidal maniac who wants to kill lots of dumb & annoying teenagers, yawn.
Director Wynorski still had the nerve to use his real name on the credits when he made this back in '91 instead of hiding under his usual Jay Andrews pseudonym, the film is reasonably well made but it doesn't have any style or the visual look of the first film.
But it's not quite as satisfying as "The Body Snatcher" on the same Burke/Hare theme because it doesn't engage the dark undertones of the human psyche through its sadistic "graverobbers" as much as the Karloff film, but instead dwells more on the scientific ethics issues.
The lighting seems to come from nowhere and what we're looking at appears to be a rather stark movie set instead of an atmospheric Edinburgh street.
Such as: If you have to hire Pets instead of Playmates for your pandering Cinemax crapfest, you may as well consider a career change.
The acting by Turner reminded me of Annette Bening's in "American Beauty," but demented instead of one-note.
The reason I am giving Empire of The Wolves a strong 8, instead of a pure 10, is because of the scientific mumbo jumbo.
Some of the moments that were supposed to have been scary or striking simply sound like someone hit the Drama Button, eliciting laughter instead of a scream or a jump.
It's not because of any religious undertones (although those are botched too), but instead because of the extremely regrettable fact that this script was not anywhere near as engaging as it should have been.
The worst performance is given by Maximilian Schell: instead of acting like a satanic priest he acts like he's the evil penguin in a children's story.

Joe liked that, but Kate saw it as sacrilegious for Ann to marry Chris instead of waiting for "Larry", her son, Chris' brother, and Ann's initial fiancÃ©e.
But shouldn't the teacher focus on poetry, and having the students appreciate that, instead of trying to turn them all into romantics?
The funniest thing about the film is that the Schwabbs seem to be completely unaware that they're being tormented and instead wander around in a self-absorbed daze.
What a great cast of character parts-- plug-ugly psycho Jack Lambert all wrapped up in ice and apparently loving it; Fatso Zero Mostel auditioning as an assassin but serving as a kick-me doorstop instead; and a menacing Bob Steele brandishing a revolver instead of his usual six-gun, along with such familiar yet unsung faces as police chief Roy Roberts and detective King Donovan who gets an unscheduled face wash and without a towel.
District attorney Bogart's good too, blending in nicely instead of trying to hog the screen as major stars sometimes do.
Bogart's device of confronting the incarcerated Sloane with reminders of his victims almost backfires, but instead sets up the film's climax as it demonstrates the long reach possessed by crime chieftains even behind bars.
Bogey doesn't indirectly lecture the viewers, instead he's picking his own brain as Ferguson.
this was a film that was crying out for an ending that was in keeping with the rest of the film but instead we got a (very) bad copy of 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon'.
Watch that one instead!
Although a Rudolph Valentino film, instead of a movie about a slick Latin lover, it was a breezy comedy about a plucky nice girl that gets ahead by pretending to be a bad girl.
to realize and throw off the layers of claptrap that keep me/us from casting onerous cognition to the wind and instead to indulge the heart and the moment--from literally throwing one's possessions out the window to indulging what might have been an offputting fetishist's fantasies to singing out to engage the spirit of a foreign exotic spiritual procession and be willing to acknowledge in song one's fears and quests).
At first, I thought this was going to be another killer ape picture, instead it was an very cool knock-off of David Cronenberg's "Rabid", with awesome effects by Carlo Rambaldi.

It's like if it was Chaplin himself who was there instead of the little tramp!
Realising that he lacks the means to provide any respectable life for the women he loves, the Tramp graciously surrenders any notions of marrying her, instead convincing Rex (Harry Crocker), a handsome and upright tight-rope walker, to take her hand in marriage.
There is no Stoogesque slapstick here, instead there's Keatonesque timing and choreography.
I watched this film primarily because I believed Anthony Hopkins was going to star in it; instead, I would call Mr. Hopkins role more of a supporting costar.

Get Nightmare at Noon instead.
Worth the rent, if you have one of those pay by the month things, instead of individual movie prices.
I loved it who said you have to be a child/teenager to watch and enjoy, Im 42 and I already cant wait for high school musical 3, its so nice to see young people enjoying life instead of all the hate and violence in society today and they managed to get their first kiss "cheers for them" maybe some young girls will be a bit disappointed with this or wish to be Vanessa or the boys wish to be Zak, ah the young, I was smiling remember my younger days too lol.

Okay, so the day the first High School Musical came out I watched a documentary on PBS instead, so I had no idea what horrors were going on at Disney Channel until the next day at school.
I'm not saying parents have to let their kids watch Silence of the Lambs instead of High School Musical-but please, at least let them watch decent musicals/movies, like The Sound of Music or Dr. Strangelove (which is not a musical but still great-and rated PG!
The sequel does a great job of avoiding the urge to fix what's unbroken, but instead to polish it.
No longer a musical about a musical, it instead becomes a musical about a country club.
This film was released in the fall instead in November 12, 2004.

Oh, wait, apparently children did not write this film, but instead a guy that wrote for the TELEVISION SERIES the Weakest Link.
Although Davis' character, Joan Fraser, is so single-minded, she and Duncan don't make the mistake of caricaturing her, instead making a strong, energetic person who happens to be a zealot.
In many ways, this film came out to capitalize on the publicity surrounding Lana Turner's own screwed up family life (her daughter killed boyfriend Johnny Stampanato in 1958)--instead of running from the negative publicity, the movie exploited it, as the film is about a supposedly conservative small town that instead seethes with a cauldron of rape, murder, illegitimacy and hypocrisy!
You might have expected Ms. Turner instead to have done a movie akin to THE SINGING NUN after the much publicized trial, but instead chose this tell-all tale.
This is a film many will want to acquire instead of renting, for repeated revisiting.  
But in 1941 Peyton Place in New England would probably have enjoyed keeping cool with native son Calvin Coolidge and no doubt voted for Hoover, Landon, and Wilkie instead of that radical FDR in the White House.
"Peyton Place" could have been a heaving, overblown showcase, but instead made its way into becoming an important melodrama that has stood the test of time.
This documentary went far beyond that, showing instead the women inside the prison sentences.
The only redeeming part of this movie is that it's so bad it's laughable, which is why I rated it a "2" instead of a "1."
I had expected mafia-type action but instead I was treated with a fantastic yet dark world of betrayal and blood and an excellent black comedy.
I believe Scorcese (or the studio) tried too hard to make a film for "today's (young) audience" instead of just making (or letting Scorcese make) a Scorcese film.
"Gangs" does not present that same sharp and exacting historical focus to any degree, instead bits of chopped up pseudo history and gruesome violence are thrown around for a bit color in an otherwise monochromatic, by the books, and boring love story.
After viewing this movie I am left with the feeling that I have seen some crappy teen slasher film, only this time the characters wore period costumes and, instead of 90 minutes, the movie went on for 3 hours.
OK, I started my search with Brasil, and I'm tellin' you I wasn't disappointed at all, I was lucky to find very good movies like Tieta do Agreste, Four Days in September, and Central Do Brasil, I switched to Argentina by advice of few friends, I started with this movie,(Burnt Money) supposedly historical what I found was, a melodrama, some good acting, but mostly a lot of bad acting, the set up of the period was well done, but somehow the whole movie was centered in the period or in the robbery, instead I attended to a disgustin' gay melodrama.
It looks like movie goers could have saved money--instead of paying to see this movie, they could have gone to a sewage treatment plant or local dairy farm for a tour---or perhaps just stared into a used toilet for 118 minutes!
Perhaps it should have been a low-budget, college campus comedy instead of an expensive, health farm comedy.
Trying to shock and instead sounding like 11-year old's trying out new words.
Perhaps he has schizophrenia instead?
When Gene Kelly arrived on the scene to direct 'That's Entertainment, Part II (1976),' he found no shortage of interesting clips in the MGM archives, but occasionally had to settle for the secondary musical numbers from the most famous musicals, for example, having to settle with "Good Morning" instead of "Singin' in the Rain."
In spite of his incredible talents as an actor (especially comedic), Christopher Guest has essentially fizzled as a director to the point that his most recent (and best-known) films have been largely-improvised mockumentaries along the lines of Rob Reiner's "This Is Spinal Tap" (in which Guest acts, quite brilliantly), which require little of him as a writer or director, instead relying on the cast.
The characterization is also dull and uninteresting, including none of the over-the-top stereotypes of his previous films (which I assume are meant to satirize said stereotypes and their use in film) and instead pushing the same characters (without the exaggeration needed for humor) we see in all self-referential films.
Not quite as good as 'Best In Show' but much better than 'A Mighty Wind' this film is the first he's done that is a straight story instead of a documentary style although he has cleverly woven elements of that in to this film through the actors doing interviews for various television shows and specials.
This perhaps lies in the fact that the focus is not on something obscure like dog shows or traveling folk musicians, but instead on basic Hollywood, which offers less genuine interest in subject alone.

The episode doesn't deal entirely in the realm of original social commentary, but instead focuses on putting a twist on the classic story of Cartman pranks Butters.

Seeing this film makes you understand just how high the bar the Marx Brothers set for their movies, much higher than virtually any other comic working with a film studio, instead of independently as Chaplin did.
Finally, it is a delight to experience action sequences where the characters actually DO something, instead of making theatre poses and shooting little glowing balls at each other (as in Storm Riders and A Man Called Hero).
It is also a delight to see carefully choreographed movements, instead of slide-shows with chaotic camera-work that makes the scenes completely impossible to follow (as in Ashes of Time).
Despite being stuck with a tiresomely familiar role (the overly caring woman who forgets to look after her own needs), Hathaway refuses to succumb entirely to convention, and instead infuses her character with a spark of gutsy enthusiasm and her seemingly unquenchable trademark charisma and quirky charm - the only mercifully palatable element in the film, and clearly a far better piece of acting than such a film deserves.
Supposed comic relief from Candice Bergen as an obsessive wedding planner translates instead into only more tiresome drivel, and her contribution of a hilariously out of place narration only further draws to light the ignorant and lazy screen writing, as if refusing to simply let the narrative develop on its own.

What started as a potentially entertaining critique of materialism and shallowness is revealed to be a poorly executed farce, with a succession of lame jokes instead of a plot (then again, one of the screenwriters is best known for performing on Saturday Night Live, where the skits have no connection whatsoever, so that may be an explanation) and two atrocious caricatures instead of leading ladies.

Also, the screenplay (re)writer tried to not copy the original, and his tries was funny- Brazilian girls instead of German men, female taxi driver with loving boyfriend instead of male driver with hot girlfriend - the writer tried to use the negative of everything, but it's not a remake, it's the style of a child who copies his friends lesson.
Jack Klugmans excellent as the coroner with an axe to grind and there's fine support from John S.Ragin and Robert Ito.It always makes me laugh though when instead of just doing autopsies he'll investigate and solve the case the detectives never solve it and I think in one episode Monaghan says Quincy should get a Police pension for all the detective work he does.A slice of classic TV with memorable stories and characters Quincy is well worth a watch.

What we get instead is a close-up of a BOOGER complete with NASAL HAIRS.
Instead of playing Curley's wife as the pathetic yet lonely and almost unconsciously sexy woman that Sherilynn Fenn made her in the 1992 film, Betty Field makes her obnoxiously slutty, whiny, loud and shrill, and we are annoyed and repelled at her instead of being made to empathize with her plight.
Whereas most western movies have the hero triumph over evil, giving him the kingdom and the girl in the process as a reward, here there is a twist; the hero defeats the villain, but chooses not to take the kingdom OR the girl, choosing instead to maintain his honor.
Go watch The Office or Alan Partridge instead.
Please try their earlier show Rock Profiles instead, it is far superior.

Forget Ring 2 and watch the prequel Ring Zero instead, to find out what Sadako was like as a human being (as opposed to the cartoon villain we have in this film).
As a result of this, the produces decided to reunite the crew from the first "Ringu" and shot a sequel that followed a new story based on the first film's plot instead of Suzuki's novel.
As I haven't viewed a single scene from the original second instalment (written and directed by JÃ´ji Iida), it's impossible for me to say if it was deserving enough of its incredibly poor critical and public reception to be completely erased from the continuity of the series (although some who saw it commented that they would rather have watched Sadako's cursed videotape instead).

Throughout the whole movie, everybody is driveling about how almighty Dracula is, but when he finally makes an appearance (in the shape of B-movie veteran Rutger Hauer), he turns out to be a lame philosopher who prefers to plea instead of to kill.
I also thought that they could have put a little more romance into it between Elizabethand Dracula and instead of what happened they could have kept him in alive.

Read Petronius' surviving fragments before watching the film, and do not focus on the well known passages everyone has studied in Latin 101, instead consider the disjointed rhythms of the randomly fragmented narrative.

Now, if only John Woo could make another movie like this instead of the godawful Windtalkers.
The true brilliance of Woo's films lies in the fact that he never sacrifices story for action, but instead blends the two together to create a whole that is artistically rendered (his action sequences are something akin to visual poetry) and substantial, rather than having an action film that-- like so many others of the genre-- is hollow inside.
It's easy to think that, in the wrong hands, Sadako could have been turned into a Freddy/Jason-style stalker walking amongst the shadows willing people to death, but instead we have an entertaining character piece with plenty of frights and chills spliced in for good measure.

The riddles used in the film are corny instead of witty, leading the characters in a maze of doors and rooms with the killer knowing exactly where to strike almost at all times.
I think that a filmmaker who decides to make a slasher flick has two choices : having a lot of faith on the screenplay and to trust that he found a new perspective for making that formula interesting or making a completely mercenary film which is full of clichÃ©s for finally making a cheap movie.The crappy film Steel Trap belongs to the second style.The slasher films became popular thanks to Halloween (1978) and Friday the 13th and,since of that,we have seen hundred of movies with similar structures,characters and story.The details change,so every slasher movie tries to be different by using a curious location or a new mask,just to mention two examples.I do not pretend to find a lot of originality on slasher films but what I pretend to find is even the minimum effort for giving the known formula a special element,making it interesting and entertaining.Steel Trap could have chosen that difficult point but,instead of risking,director and co-screenwriter Luis CÃ¡mara and co-screenwriter Gabrielle Galanter wasted that opportunity so Steel Trap is a tedious experience with an extremely weak screenplay,repulsive characters,a boring and generic killer without any personality and a forced and arbitrary ending.I usually do not like to criticize an independent film from my favourite genre but,even on some incompetent works (like Return to Sleepaway Camp),I appreciate some energy and enthusiasm which on some way compensate some fails of the movie.But Steel Trap does not even have that.Plus,to add more negative things,CÃ¡mara's direction is completely insipid.In other words,it seems nobody involved on this movie was really interested on it.The characters are so repulsive that I was glad when the killer started to kill them.Steel Trap is a very crappy film.This is one of that movies in which I feel I really lost the time with it and that's the worst sin a movie can make.If you wanna see a very good modern slasher flick,I recommend you the Norwegian movie Fritt Vilt.Skip Steel Trap,a very bad horror film.
If you're bored out of your skull, I suppose this movie is better than staring at the wall or re-arranging your sock drawer, but if you've got anything, and I do mean ANYTHING, better to do, I suggest you do that instead of watching Steel Trap.

Now, Bobo's brother is set to inherit all his father's money instead of only half if his brother isn't found by his 30th birthday.
The story was watered down and sentimentalized to the point of generating schlock instead of entertainment.
Bringing him back to civilization, she teaches Bobo to read, talk, walk, and write his name in the favor for Bobo's mischievous brother to sign some papers to have $30,000,000 from their late father's savings into his own money instead of splitting the money down the middle.

THE PLOT: A divorced mother of two (Hawn), who coaches a high school girl's track team, decides she wants to live out her dreams by coaching football instead.
'Wildcats' has the same formula those films had, only instead of the Army, Washington DC, or abject poverty, Goldie finds herself coaching football.
Independently produced on a low-budget, "Sleepy Time Gal" is exactly the type of superior filmmaking so rare these days, and the fact that it was sold to the Sundance Channel (where it premiered on March 29, 2002) instead of being theatrically distributed to art-houses whose discerning patrons crave exactly this type of subtle, intelligent, exquisite jewel of a film) is a tragedy.

According to the screenplay, it should be "kindness instead of whips."
Because Fields was in his mid-50s when he made this film he was able to turn the tables, in a sense: instead of reprising his real-life role as a starving young actor he'd graduated by this time to the role of the unscrupulous manager, known here simply as The Great McGonigle.

If only more shows had the same potential, instead of executives vomiting at us with cr*ppy reality shows and poor Knight-Rider/A-team wannabe modern shows...
'Lois and Clark' was never meant to be a deep, dark insight into Superman's history but instead just an entertaining show aimed at both young and old, and I think it succeeds.
As the falling snow is by turn luminescent white in the lamplight, or midnight blue against the darkened night, it reflects how the film's themes of regret, guilt, blame, loyalty and redemption are rarely black or white but instead change, Monet-esquire, dependent on the light in which they're seen.
Women are not raped; they are merely pushed around, but the message is loud and clear ("the mistreatment of our women"), and Prince John's soldiers can be knocked out by a wooden table instead of being martially hacked into pieces by the film's hero.
Try to get this movie and don't make pop-corns - you'll need handkerchiefs instead!
It just felt as if some strings were not tied at the end, but instead left frayed with questions looming in the air.
While in his first films he simply appeared as a magician doing his show, in this movie there is a set build for the scene (instead of a simple circus stage), and while simple, the movie is clearly set in the middle ages.
Women should see this movie instead of any Oprah-like show about understanding the opposite sex.
Instead of exuding such a goody-goody persona, Amira should have projected a more compromised person, someone who would cynically sleep with a guy and conspire to photograph him in a compromised position instead of first asking him if he would help her son.
Is a nice sensation to feel that warmth in a movie instead of being angry with the character.
She should probably be cast in these kind of roles in the future instead of lead roles.
Unlike his previous films, instead of being horrible, it's just mediocre.
And people, please don't make a sequel, but instead give us the first lesbian slasher-movie.
It was great watching a formula slasher flick where the homoerotic subtext was elevated to supertext, and seeing scantily-clad hunky men running for their life instead of buxom babes in bras.
I don't want to give anything away, instead I want to stress this is a very impressive horror film.
I wouldn't sell this an seminal gay movie but it's good to see something which is like a mainstream movie in which instead of a girl in a bra running away from the killer you get to see a cute guy scream and run away like a girl, *smile*.
I had heard good reviews before finally seeing this movie and am already a fan of the horror genre.For a gay slasher film it was done tastefully.I like a movie like this that is more realistic instead of being b-rated and campy.I am glad the gay characters were more normal instead of showing all the negative stereotypes that a lot of TV shows and movies show.It's refreshing to see a regular gay movie about ordinary(but pretty)people in realistic circumstances.In some ways it's just eye candy since every character was cute and sexy,but no different then a lot of other movies.This movie has a good story,good actors,and nice effects with the right amount of suspense,gore and humor.It is very well directed,produced as well as acted.I hope a sequel is made to understand the motive to the killings and to see who is behind that demonic mask.
I'd recommend watching the original Lake Placid instead of wasting the two hours watching this sequel.
Avoid this movie at all cost, if you ever did something for 84 minutes that you wished you'll never do again, you should consider that instead of watching this garbage.
The movie enforces a Gothic impression of Wallachia, following the stereotype created by vampire movies instead of offering a true historical depiction of the country.

The only change that I would make is have the actors speak instead of having words projected onto the screen.
The Unknown is a fabulous film; I didn't like the comments on the main page for this film so I thought I'd write some about this film itself, instead of a biography of Lon and Browning.
"The Unknown" is a silent film starring Lon Chaney, Sr., as carnival star Alonzo the Armless, an expert with gun and knife, who, because of his condition, must use his feet instead of hands.
After watching this film, I wonder why Blank made this bad peice of fiction instead of making a charmingly disjointed documentary on the true story from which Anarchy TV is based.
If Blank's aim was to villify or praise the anarchists and their assault on the airways, why not go to the real source instead of ruining the careers of so many actors.
Why not give me the real story, with real people and real political motives instead of wasting 90 minutes of my life?

The only scene that was an original was Apu washing his hair instead of his mouth after throwing up in front of the girl he was trying to charm and that too, right before they started having that mouth-to- mouth kiss.
Perhaps next time Mr. Dutt should use some marijuana instead of beer and chill the characters.
I thought this episode was particularly average - there are many more worth watching instead.
I could go on with the poorly done gore (done either with CG or badly done Make-Up-though that pick-ax to the face bit is pretty awesome), the two inbred brothers that look like shaved versions of the Geico cavemen (I'm surprised they didn't start complaining about cavemen being depicted as inbred killers)-and are pretty much lifted off of "Just Before Dawn" and the "Wrong Turn" movies (the film feels basically like the people behind it just saw "Wrong Turn" and "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" remake-the sheriff is right out of the "Chainsaw" remake), but I'll go with other problems instead.
He come across much more as a constant pressure instead of an acute danger.
This is Kate Beckinsale back when she acted instead of did action movies for big bucks.
She finds instead: a muck-begrimed tumbledown estate wherein resides a ready-for- Hollywood womanizer (Cousin Seth), an estate-coveting farmer (Cousin Reuben), a daffy romantic (Cousin Elfine), a too-loving mother (Cousin Judith), a 'vengeful god', proselytizing father (Cousin Amos), and an iron-willed matriarch (Greataunt Ada Doom).
The non-closure of Phantasm IV keeps the story alive after the credits roll instead of finishing it for good.
I would have MUCH preferred to see this played out instead of the whole serial killer angle.
I appreciate Chabrol's unpretentious direction..he doesn't call attention to himself, allowing the characters and story to grip you instead.
However, the selection is a desperate one... especially the big, ambling, constipated, blonde (Stephanie Hoover) who seems to barely exist as a human and always needs to run off to find privacy either to 'pee' or to spew (yeah, 'tis natural, if seeing a corpse and feeling nauseous, to have to hold it in and find a place to chuck instead of being real and doing what comes naturally - to vomit on the spot).
Then you have these 3 dumb girls who want to kill Innocent Tomie but just be rude to her instead because they like having somebody to pick on.
The only difference is that he used the Rockaways instead of Brooklyn because the appearance is still the same or at least in 1987 it was.
instead of the dreck the major networks are commiting financial suicide with.
I think this one could have lasted about another hour, and been fleshed out MUCH more - instead of going from day 31 to day 91 so quickly.
Damn this was a disappointing movie...........seriously, go rent Legend of Drunken Master instead.
The only reason I give this film a nine instead of a ten is because there is one moment, late in the film, when the film uses a kind of tired trick on the audience; in case you're not as cynical as I am, I won't reveal what that moment is--but you'll recognize it just as soon as the moment begins to unfold.
The only reason why I give this movie 2/10 instead of 1/10 is the aircraft scene, which was quite spectacular.
Why can't Carter live his own life instead of being barked at by his sister in-law about not being home to hold his brother's hand over the past years?
If not, then save your 9 bucks and rent a movie instead.
These are just a few of the things I would have liked to do instead of watch this movie.
Run, don't walk, to the great original 1971 Get Carter film instead of this atrocity.
How lucky are we that Jack Scalia stepped in to save the day instead?
So a happy ending was used instead.
Why didn't Hitchcock make an outright movie about Jack the Ripper instead of this one, with an innocent "Avenger."
The manner in which Edwards' uses the entire screen instead of just cutting for quick effects requires a little more patience, and can result in quite a payoff - witness the side-splitting scene with Dreyfus and colleague in hospital beds (but, of course, you need a widescreen version to see it).
If you saw this film while you were high it still wouldn't be funny and would probably scare you instead.
This boy finds a small shining stone and brings it to his house and in the morning after the stone was brought, the stone is not there, instead there are pieces of it, and there in that room a small creature is present.
I was expecting a ho-hum story but instead I found myself pleasantly involved with the characters, especially Eric Stoltz, who wasn't a lawyer or a plumber, but a male nurse.
Maybe Bartok should have made that story instead: clueless wannabe screenwriter desecrates legacy of legendary British director of "Tales From the Crypt," causing famed director to rise from dead and turn idiot writer-producer into Hamburger Helper.
Here's something you don't see every day - a mobster movie that focuses on the evil of criminals, instead of their coolness.
A lawyer finds Lloyd in this state and instead convinces him to marry a young lady sight unseen--because she must get married and live in a house in order to fulfill the conditions in a will.
"Wow, it's just like in that movie, only dolls are doing it instead!
It would have been a lot better if at the sugar-coated climax of this animated kid's classic, instead of projecting all that caring, the care bears projectile vomited in the same manner as the viewers--in horror at what the kids of '85 were being spoon fed.
Take them to the park instead.
The Care Bears movie is basically about teaching children to be compassionate; to use their words to talk about their problems instead of keeping it inside.
I guarantee you'll be a little misty eyed by the end, and the kid will discover the revolutionary idea that it's not against the rules to befriend the monster instead of battling it.
Overall, a feeble attempt to squeeze money out of a concept which could have been a theatrical blockbuster if executed correctly but instead became a lackluster second rate action film, which this series pilot does nothing to improve upon...
And so it goes on, until the end: John Connor gets operated on in sandy desert wind, instead of inside a tent or a building.
Another sad thing is to see Rogue as a frightened kid,instead of the sexy and strong woman she is in the comics.
They could have Arnold instead.

I was expecting something clever but instead got something dumb and trite.
Just like Poseidon and Pink Panther, it's clear Hollywood just wanted to cash in on nostalgia instead of creating quality, original concepts.
Or should we refrain from using the term report and say Stories instead... War stories handles just about that.
I guess, since the show was too daring and didn't fit a regular "format", the sponsors threw their weight around, and instead of more episodes of War Stories we got more mind-numbing sitcoms, reality shows, and cheesy thrillers.
A couple of middle aged war buddies led by Charlie arrive at Wolf Lake for their annual hunting trip, but the guy they were suppose to meet isn't there, but instead there's a young man, David and his girlfriend who are care-taking the resort.
Well, yes, there are problems with it, and many state that this film brings little to the franchise history and instead contributes to the growing list of errors and problems with the franchise, but I have to disagree.
Since this movie was filmed in Canada, I feel that the movie should have been filmed in January, instead of warm weather season, or they could have change the location of the movie, where people wear summer stuff during Thanksgiving (like Tennessee or Mississippi or Alabama or Texas (to be filmed in Canada, if that's the case)).
Cheated because of all the talent that could have made a GREAT movies and instead just cashed in big paychecks.
He is their number one target, they capture him and instead of killing him, they just imprison him????
In previous Terminator films, you could always assume that sending anything back in time took a lot of energy and resources - that's why you could accept that there was only one Terminator instead of 2+ working together.
I'd rather watch Kim Possible or Pokemon instead.
They should have just ended the series, instead of just cutting it off randomly and leaving so many people wondering what eventually happens.
After the half way mark in the series or maybe even before, it becomes painfully obvious that the plot is frozen in place and whoever made the series decided instead to put in dozens and dozens of filler episodes.
Yeah, maybe it doesn't seem fair to give Star Trek's time-travel pretzel plot a pass and nitpick "Terminator Salvation" but I mean, there were two huge plot holes in this one that just plain insulted the whole series storyline:   1) SkyNet went through this complicated plot to lure John Connor in with its infiltrator, instead of just killing him with the infiltrator.
He just wanted to share it with others; I implied that it was for everyone to learn from instead of actually having to live it themselves.
'2 Days in Paris' does away with tradition and clichÃ©s and instead plays to a different beat.
I personally don't feel that the film ever crossed the line into becoming exploitative or gratuitous - instead opting for a realistic and confrontational yet "respectful" approach.
Brian, who was also abused, can not remember it at all and, instead, believes he was abducted by aliens and he spends his entire life trying to figure out answers.
While the first one had it integral to the plot, this one instead seems more like it was done because it could've been done.
One got the feeling of stepping into an adult cinema, instead of a semi-mainstream release.
When Hollywood wants to a movie about Mississippi, it almost never actually goes to Mississippi; instead, the director goes to Florida, or South Carolina, or Georgia, or just shoots the film on a Los Angeles backlot.
A newlywed couple spend their honeymoon in their "new" house instead of going to California.
Almost enjoyable it instead misses the mark and falls flat.
You cranks that want to be entertained instead of being "preached to" have found your mindless junk food.
The reason I gave the movie two stars instead of one was: Florence Henderson's wonderful role in reprising her cameo in Weird Al Yankovic's "Amish Paradise", and the totally meaningless non-sequitur animated sequence about two thirds through the movie where you have monsters popping out of fiords.
The couple passed the public library at least four times, the Anichkov Palace at least three, the Hermitage (of all places) twice and bought train tickets to Moscow somewhere at a reconstruction site behind the House of Books instead of in a railway ticket centre across the street where they are really sold.
Throughout the entire movie she insists that she's not going to get married- she going to have career instead.
Our heroine doesn't have an Austenian future, instead becomes a backcountry Louisa May Alcott or George Sand.
There's an undercover cop best friend (Anthony LaPaglia) that wanted to be Starsky or Hutch but instead learns the job really entails filling out a lot of forms and his boss (Alan Arkin) who, if it wasn't for Mike Myer's performance, would have stolen the movie with his portrayal of a Police Chief that can only be described as the antithesis of that character that we've seen so many times in films and TV.
You could strap me to a chair, perform a root canal without freezing and blast Kenny G... instead of torturing me to watch this awful movie again.
I almost wished that Doggett and Reyes had their own spin-off show, instead of the X-Files producers running this series aground.
the boy spends the whole movie trying to get the woman who he has no chance of getting and instead puts the female character in that most unenviable situation.
The video quality is generally good but they should have used better lighting instead of just the ambient light.
Scene 3 = 7/10 (Feels like it was thrown in at the end, but its interesting enough)  Scene 4 = 7/10 (Good, end was kind of a let down)  Scene 5 = 7/10 (Would have been 8.5 if a certain substance ended up on her face instead, such a waste...)  Scene 6 = 8/10 (Kind of a combination of 2 scenes.
You instead cheer and weep for joy.
I personally won't argue, preferring to stick to my own personal views instead of following the herd.
There was concern that putting so much talent into one film, instead of spreading the stars out over 4 or 5 films, would lose the studio money.
He is pitiful and sometimes I feel like I was trapped in this horrible situation instead of him.
Well, it would have been nice if the Creighton Duke character had been a little more heroic instead of being such a jerk.
And to be honest, when I found out that New Line had decided to produce the films instead of Paramount, I knew that some how, some way, there would be some Freddy reference in it.
Also, you only had to sit still for 90 minutes instead of 4 hours.
It is instead about a love story between two elderly people, Wendell and Fanny, who embark on a new adventure when at the ripe old age of 60, Wendell gets a major new job in his chosen profession.
Jang had the potential to create a strong, deeply emotional film about sex and its effects on people, but instead chose to focus his strength on the pornography element more than the actual human element.
Obviously an independent film in nature, it felt more like director Jang was trying to make symbolic references out of nothing instead of your typical independent of this nature.
Overall, I think I could have liked this film and there were smaller elements that I did enjoy, but I felt this film was rushed, repetitive, and played too much towards the taboos instead of breaking them.
Laura (Goddess Supreme) Gemser matures in her roles and actually plays the boss of women instead of just a rebel.
The dead here are cut from the same cloth as the speedy zombies from the "Dawn of The Dead" remake and the infected from "28 Days Later" and it's sequel, only generic instead of interesting or frightening.
I strongly recommend that anyone considering seeing this movie should NOT see it instead.
The movie tells the story of Snapphanarna in SkÃ¥ne (the southest "state" of Sweden") and the war between Sweden and Denmark during the 17 th century when SkÃ¥ne became a part of Sweden instead of Denmark.
Snapphanarna was a "movement" amongst the citizens of SkÃ¥ne that were against the swedes overtaking their land and on occasion forcing them to swear their oath to the Swedish king instead of the danish.
A partisan group wanting to make the shire "SkÃ¥ne" part of Denmark instead of Sweden, fighting armed battle for their cause.
When they understand that and hire someone decent to write the script (instead of burning their money on fight-scenes filmed from three angles), then maybe this could be entertainment rather than just a bland and boring waste of money and time.
The characters are just repeating themselves and talking about what to do instead of actually doing it (but perhaps that's pretty accurate when it comes to portraying swedes?).
Perky aspiring actress Janet Gaynor (as Esther Blodgett) leaves her small town for Hollywood; instead of extra work, she finds work as a waitress.
There are some vaguely entertaining surreal parts, when the main character encounters the aliens (both of which look like cheap X-Com rejects), but the whole fun of the surreality is that a willing viewer can briefly pretend he is not watching "Communion" and is instead enjoying an ugly acid flashback.
It scared me so much that I actually almost screamed in one part but gasped instead, and twice I had to turn it off and stop watching it because it scared me that much.
She constantly has the final say during their conversations, she dominates and lectures Rochester instead of being lectured by him.
There were all the ingredients for a good thriller, just not enough of everything, so instead of a cake, you got a cupcake.
When Detective Tom Dewey (Daniel Benzali) becomes involved with the missing persons' case, Rusty gets an idea: instead of abducting the dog, they should agree with what the presses are addressing.
But, just when you think you are watching an unsung classic, just when you are scratching your head to come up with a resolution, you realize that the film makers do not have one and instead leave us with the ultimate cop-out ending.
He's a scumbag drug-dealing club owner who is at the very heart of the events Ricahrd is avenging, and who never shows any remorse, instead going on the war path to little avail.
Horable just horrible they tryed for a satire but instead they came out with crap.
The movie doesn't draw the viewer in, instead it psychologically irritates and alienates the viewer by butting unrelated scenes together (which one would think might have some overall meaning in the end, however this is not the case).
instead American audiences know almost nothing of this film.
The fact that most of the violence is inflicted on real human beings instead of zombies or aliens may have also contributed.
But, when they settle on the planet they decided to live their lives there instead.
This is strictly amateur hour in every single connotation of the word.For something similar, yet a billion times better, do yourself a favor and rent "the Toolbox Murders" instead (the original NOT the remake)   Eye Candy: Staci Gordon & Kit Mitchell get topless (Kit is also topless in the DVD outtakes); Shelly York shows tits & a bit of bush (word of caution: John Rudder shows his ass and penis)   My Grade: D-   Synapse DVD Extras: A 25 minute interview with Director Terry Loften; an 8 & a half minute outtake reel (with no film audio but with comments from the director) ; & Promotional trailer for this film
The song itself is just Jimi Hendrix's Voodoo Child, but cleverly disguised (it sounds the same but with keyboards instead of guitars).
If anyone if planning on watching this movie you should not watch this one and just watch the first in the series its more interesting then this one.Please don't waste your time watching this movie go on and make coffee instead.
Harking back to a time when the Brits made decent thrillers instead of clumsy middle class comedies, Dead Man's Shoes is a real breath of fresh air.
His vulnerability underneath all the bluster and anger kept you interested in what would happen instead of just dismissing him and wishing him a horrible fate.
Everybody and their momma know that Bruce should have been playing that role instead of that worthless Carradine.
Without the music, this version of The Student Prince went for characterization instead.
It seems as though the screenwriters didn't read the novel, but had instead heard a few things about it, and then went on to write the screenplay.
this is a Masterpiece ...god it almost made me cry..please vote good for this movie ..this movie deserve to be on the top instead of stupid movies like "This Is Spinal Tap" (1984) and lots of other not so deserving titles on top 250 films list on IMDB...Steve McQueen is at his best as Papillon...great story and overall an excellent picture..if you haven't seen it yet ,do not hesitate you owe that to yourself if you are a movie fan and don't forget to vote after you watched it we have to have this movie on Top 250 films list..Don't you agree with me?
It is similar to The Muppet Show, since it took place at the same theater, but all of the segments had to do with movies, there were two guest stars instead of one (only a small number of Muppet Show episodes had multiple guests, and those were either married celebrity couples or special groups of entertainers), and there didn't seem to be any backstage plot.
Why the hell did they run aimlessly through the woods instead of running down the road they obviously came in on?
While actually showing this act of apathetic drudgery might've seemed more funny, instead the story is relayed by Leslie himself with less than dramatic results.
This is just one of the many examples of failed attempts at achieving a punchline, and instead resorting to a fast quip... just not fast enough.
Seriously you never hear anyone talking about how annoying all those Law and Orders/ CSI.. they are all the same show but you never hear anyone downing those.There are obviously going to be similarities when watching TV shows so why not watch it for what it is instead of picking out the things that its not?
They "moo'ed" and called her names instead.
After the screening, director Gianni Ameilo, a wonderful man in love with his own film, gave an effusive talk about how it had been made: how he had wanted for years to make a film about his father's emigration from post-war Italy to America, but chose, at the time of the Albanian refugee crisis in Italy in the 1990s, to tell the tale allegorically instead; how he cast amateurs in almost all the roles; how he plucked the amazing Carmelo de Mazzarelli from a Scicilian street to play the role of Michele because he to liked his face; and how he directed him, never showing him the full script but merely telling him what was required from each individual scene.
If I want to watch a lot of dull folks from the Carolinas talking about the weather and chit-chatting, instead of watching this film I'll just go visit my wife's family!
Unfortunately for him he made a mockery of himself instead of actually getting to a point with this uninspired, unintentionally funny documentary.
His father Bernard, played revoltingly well by Jeff Daniels, has absolutely no concept of what's going on outside of his own world as he spews obscenities and dwells on his past as a respected writer; of course now no one wants anything to do with his writing so he teaches English instead (Gee, haven't we see that a few hundred times in films?
The majority of observations from Walt's mouth are direct quotes from his father, yet instead of revealing the depth of admiration Walt has for his father these comments simply show Walt as being shallow and pathetic.
This a wonderful film imbued with a fantastic sense of place and time and small details in which the viewer can find great delight (like the hilarious scene where Jeff Daniels takes his teenage son and the kid's new girlfriend to see David Lynch's "Blue Velvet" instead of the first choice "Short Circuit" or the closing shot of the actual squid fighting a whale at the NYC Musueum of Natural History).
instead of "man that's creepy".
No humor and no sense in having the lead woman playing a writer instead of a TV reporter being helped by a dead nun?
This is a Canadian-lensed quickie, and unlike the original, the "invisible man" scenes are laughable instead of scary.
The chemistry between Streisand and Segal is what makes this movie, and I liked the way the sex scenes were shot, almost as if we were watching reality TV instead of a film.
There's no plot to speak of Â instead, we follow the two stars on a logical pattern of location-hopping around New York throughout which their relationship blossoms: from his apartment when she's evicted because of his snitching (which leads to both of them being given the gate by the landlord), to them shacking up at the flat of Segal's pal (who drives them out because of their constant bickering), then going their separate ways till they meet again (after he has learned about her movie experience Â a hilarious scene Â and a 'colleague' of hers has gone to see him at his workplace) and go out together (where they're harassed by a band of thrill-seekers), after which they find themselves at the house of Segal's fiancÃ©e (a scene with an unexpectedly ironic punchline), to finally deciding to be completely honest with one another (beginning with their real names).
Belly-laugh funny throughout, this film succeeds in convincing the viewer to root for this couple to find love, instead of the fame and fortune they think they want.
Secrets of a Call Girl is a rather odd Italian crime film as instead of focusing on the usual areas - shootings, car chases, fist fights etc, we focus on the hard done to girlfriend of a mobster; Anna, played by Edwige Fenech.
However, there is something a bit 'off' with it: It seems to take place in the 1970's and there is some hint about the "Bicentenniel Room"....which makes you think its circa 1976......but instead, it's modern day L.A..
Here I was under the impression of owning a Tiger Shark horror movie, but instead there's just a copy of the X-rated Love Boat Chronicles in my DVD-collection!
The best of the film is the acting of the whole group of actors and actresses led by Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe, the latter as a generous FBI detective instead of being a villain as usual.
(And actually, I nearly typed 'people' instead of 'characters' because they are way too real.
Here we have a woman, who although she is super wealthy and can afford any type of food, instead chooses to deprieve herself of such a basic source of pleasure as eating appetizing food.
But Mattei apparently couldn't be bothered to go through the time consuming process of thinking up an idea and writing a script; so what we get instead is just a re-run of Predator.
Every single memorable sequence from "Predator" is copied here (from the skinned corpses hanging upside down from trees to the mistaken killing of a wild boar instead of the enemy) and even most of the dialogs are literally re-used.
It may be the best of the trilogy, downplaying the derivative slasher element that defined the first two films and instead taking an exuberant action-horror-comedy slant (the title, in case it wasn't obvious, is an obvious spoof of Die Hard).
When you have a character playing a Muslim- get some advice from a REAL Muslim, instead of showing your own ill-informed fantasies.
It would have been nice to see the Hawke brothers work together in the chopper, instead of how the 4th series turned out (a load of rubbish and a slap in the face to hardcore fans of the show).
The only way this film could have been worse would be to have had Elvis take the five little girls in his race car near the end - instead of their father.
Paddy Connor's character has similar issues but instead of going inward, Albert is a young boy who lives in the moment.
Katherine gives Albert some money to buy a gift for his mother, but he goes to an arcade instead.
had been ridiculously togged up thus instead of Dorsey?
Being less generous, it's easy to imagine instead that writer Peter Jones and writer/director Don Nardo continually didn't know where to go with their script, so every once in a while they used a variant of the old, "No, that was just a dream" tactic and basically started over.
Gibson gives this simple but personal story all the apparent realism of a National Geographic documentary and the largely amateur cast is so believable that you may want to spend your time watching them instead of what they say.
However, the movie largely ignores all of that after the first 20 or so minutes and instead focuses on the story of Nick Diaz (Jsu Garcia, whose first name appears to be missing at least one vowel).
The overall feeling is that if the makers had opted for an existing location instead of constructing one, some more money could have gone toward retakes and actor coaching.
I realize the backers want to see the money end up on the screen, but they should have focused on the acting instead of the "future" angle which really is incidental anyway.
Fairbanks spends the first 20 minutes scene-setting with plenty of stealing and acrobatics, then tries to steal from the Caliph of Bagdad but falls in love with his beautiful daughter instead.
While it could have been a very good fun little schlock fest instead it doesn't seem to quite know what it wants to be, and as such comes out as very uneven in tone, throwing the film off balance and not letting you just enjoy it for what it is (or should be), simple fun schlock horror.
Probably if Gale and Zemeckis wrote the script instead, this could have been a much enjoyable movie.
instead of ''Aa!
The only thing I got out of this was true/false test material for my British Literature students who think they can get away with watching the movie instead of reading our text.
As I was once a disadvantaged child myself, I know that what makes a good parent isn't always signalled by a cheerful disposition, but instead security comes from the knowledge that you have always been loved.
I actually tried to see Thelma and Louise at the cinema when Night on Earth came out, but as it was sold out, I saw this instead - what a lucky break!
Even though most of Beowulf's story line is answered here, it did make me pause and wonder:  Why didn't Robert Zemeckis just direct this thing in real life instead of virtual?
This isn't a flaw, but instead a part of the film that makes it that much better.
It did not add to it's authenticity -- instead it appeared to mimic a true foreign film.
He doesn't chew up the scenery; instead, he uses his voice like a knife.
And I couldn't help myself but think "My God, why didn't Peter Jackson make a movie with this material, instead of just a documentary?
I've always felt that when you fictionalize a story about war, you dishonor the memory of so many people who have a compelling story to tell by choosing to make something up instead *cough*privateryan*cough*.
The story feels real, instead of a clothesline for countless gratuitous action sequences.
However, instead of treating it with certain horror to it, the guy openly touches his wound and rather than show himself the blood, he holds it out for others to see, that too at full arms length.
It bears a lot of similarity to the great All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) in that the film is meant to warn against the horrors of war instead of glamorize it.
If you've watched Jay Leno instead of David Letterman, watch David Letterman.
Otherwise just enjoy the birdsong instead of the inmates inane wittering.

It is better if Bortko used it instead of music by Kornelyuk.
But like I said it does try to be a character study instead of a straight forward war movie and it does contain some effective moments

innovation, and the ability to complete and test their superior designs are often stopped by a multitude of obstacles instead of encouraged.
The audience is suddenly asked to feel bad for these rather idiotic characters (I'm using that term loosely), but instead we really feel nothing, and that is what makes this movie so disgusting.
do yourself a favor, resist the urge and watch "i've been twelve forever" (included on the discs) instead of watching the videos separately.
If you enjoy the acting of Michael Moriarty and the writing of Larry Cohen, you should check out Q (1982) instead.

It stands on its own two feet as a captivating and charming classic story that children can enjoy over and over again, made when animation was really animation, and all the cells were handpainted by artists, instead of slopped together on boring, cookie-cutter computer models.
"We're All Together Now", "All's Well", "It's A Hap Hap Happy Day", "Bluebirds In The Moonlight", and especially the haunting "Come Home Again, Sailor Man" are all perfect and flow into the action of the film, instead of being placed there with no relevance just to try and get a hit song.

The play is about a man who leaves his sister to a sad, lonely life and his own emotional confusion and regret about following his personal journey instead of caring for his mother and loving sister.
The plot and character interaction steadily improves throughout the show and Flash's allies on Mongo are portrayed as a lesser of two evils instead of being self righteous freedom fighters.
Flash's Father- having Flash be in search of his father gives him more of a reason to stop Ming instead of just deciding to save the world randomly, and it builds the drama.
Also instead of being big and ripped he looks more normal so the odds are a little against him.
also in the movie flash was a football hero, in the series he is a aging track athlete sponging off of his mom instead of being a man and earning his own living.
(see robot, later on) 3) why would Ming send a single robot through the portal to get the Imex instead of launching a full or semi-full scale invasion of Earth?
If more of you could just take it for what it is instead of comparing it with the Flash of their youth (with all the warm glowing nostalgia) you might even enjoy yourselves.
Maybe a dingo ate this movies real script, and producers were forced to go with this one instead.

Grab "Leatherface" or that cheesy-ass Chuck Norris movie instead.
A classic that need to come to AMC instead of those stupid boring movies they keep showing (Arnie movies, Stallone movies, Friday 13 movies, etc).

An Australian director working in France for the first time (in French language) with two American lead actors (one of whom apparently didn't speak any French when cast) and a script worked on by veteran scriptwriter Gerard Brach (Jean De Florette, The Name Of The Rose) could have been a mess but instead Samantha Lang has crafted a beautifully moving and delicate drama.

But I was impressed, instead.
I liked seeing ordinary people portrayed on screen instead of women that all look like the mainstream idea of beauty.
I was torn between laughing and screaming at the screen, especially when the creators talked about how wonderful their film is, instead of letting it stand on its own merits, which are all but absent.
And instead of giving in to the melodrama of confrontation, etc.
Deaden is instead an intelligent, well-made love letter to the revenge flicks of decades gone by.
Rane's murderous crew are equally convincing, breathing life into what could so easily have been two-dimensional cardboard characters, but who instead come across as realistic - very little of the stereotypical movie bad guy scenery chewing that we've come to expect from the likes of a Michael Bay flick goes on in Deaden.
Save yourself the 2 hours and do something else instead of watching this movie.

If every movie was like this, not only would the world be a much better place, but I would be going to the movie theater every day, instead of spending all my money at Best Buy!

We really could feel that we're in a real investigation instead of a fictitious story.

Every line seems forced and awkward, read or poorly memorized instead of being acted.
Claustrophobic in its execution, it turns into a ghost story instead of delving into whether the things happening or just illusions are just in her mind, but therein is the motivation of the script.
Most fatally, the film 'climaxes' with an argument, instead of a chase.

Selznick as the producer and William A. Wellman as the director.James H. Street behind the story and Ben Hecht behind the screenplay.Oscar Levant behind the original music Nothing Sacred (1937) is a fine example of a good old time comedy.This is very screwball.The lovely Carole Lombard shines in the lead.In real life she died way too early but she did make herself a screen legend during her time on Earth.Fredric March makes a great male lead opposite Carole.Just watch their funny fist fight in the movie.And this is a romantic comedy!
Anyway, I understand that many viewers enjoyed this immensely and don't want to discourage anyone from watching it, but I thought it was interminable instead of terminal.
There's one odd flaw in the film - about half-way through, I found that I had learned to "expect the unexpected" from the film, which meant that the rest of the film was predictable in a bizarre way - simply decide where the expected move would be, and then expect the unexpected move instead.
But the problem is he is being stopped instead of the crime out there.
In an attempt to develop a living organism that would potentially replace failing human organs as a viable substitute, he has instead created a highly contagious parasite, which infects its victims by means of almost any physical or sexual contact and turns them into deranged, sex-crazed zombies!
This goes without saying that the whole color scheme in general, whether applied by Werner himself as DP or in post, is annoying because it makes it obvious that he doesn't trust anything regarding the actual space being used, or maybe using some natural light or shadows to make atmosphere, instead of splashing on this crude red- often in a blurred vision (FOCUS!
In the flesh eating scenes,which there are very few, we see the cheapo looking rubber stuff instead of the real looking latex standing in for human flesh.In one scene a grenade goes off downstairs but in the shot outside we see the blast and smoke coming out an upstairs window.
I wonder how bigoted heterosexuals would feels if they woke up one morning on another planet and they were made to feel something was wrong with them for being straight instead of, let's say, bisexual!
These 8 minutes contain zero exposition, containing instead some stunning on-location montage from 2nd-unit guy Honda (who directed *Godzilla* later) that unabashedly turns into scathing social commentary, and this, in the final analysis, is far more interesting than the catch-as-catch-can plot about a rookie detective's stolen gun.
Director/co-writer Alejandro GonzÃ¡lez IÃ±Ã¡rritu departs from the pattern established by the previous 4 directors and makes the driver more of a background character, focusing instead on a war photographer who, after snapping a shocking series of photographs, is on the run and grievously injured.
BMW should be highly commended for allowing what could have been little more than overblown and expensive commercials to be short films in which the centerpiece vehicles sometimes took a back-seat to the characters and their stories instead.

Each book is about 700-800 pages long and it was wonderful to see them brought to the small screen instead of the theaters.
Any and all plot driven movies (movies that rely on plot instead of character to tell the story) must stay within that plot.

Maybe she should have spend a bigger part of that year auditioning better actors instead of clearing out the local retirement home at the last minute before everyone died.
As for the mystery, well, after the tale told by Atwill about what occurred in the Blue Room all those years ago, one expects an explanation by the film's end but this aspect is never properly resolved (nor is the business about the stranger who breaks into the mansion): instead, we get a 'twist' ending which had actually occurred to me as I lay watching the film but had subsequently dismissed as being too obvious!
There is a lot of action in the show and you'd expect loud brassy music or some BS techno music, but instead what we get is quite, peaceful smooth jazz music.

Some of the ideas in this film were brilliant, such as when they all sit down at the dining room except they are all toilets instead of normal chairs.

Can't Help should be an 8 minute number with the chorus joining in at the end instead of the barely noticed number in the movie.
When we try to grasp for the meaning, it is like a ghost, a phantom that "leaves us with a wisp of vapor in our hands" and disappears - very much like the liberty, the freedom the humans try to find but instead could only see its phantom disappearing.
This is not a film you become absorbed in but instead one that you're expected to watch with a nonchalant, half- sober feeling of sardonic lack of involvement.

Edith Wharton wrote in a brilliantly minor key, and it is a testament  to Martin Scorsese's genius as a filmmaker that he disciplined  himself to work within Wharton's parameters, instead of trying to  force his trademark kinetic style onto a story of tragic whispering.

I saw this movie over twenty years ago, back when CBS showed late night movies instead of Letterman et al.
This one is no different on that front, except this time; instead of merely focusing on a bunch of worms, or yet another troupe of deformed, deranged backwoods killers; Lieberman has the advantage of an intriguing mystery to base his film on.

Do yourself a favor, and rent Road Trip or Harold and Kumar instead, they were funny and entertaining, this was artsy stupid crap.
The reason I give it 2 stars instead of just 1 is due to a few aesthetically pleasing elements; the cinematography is gorgeous old-school black and white (not like today's occasional black and white efforts that look like crap); the outdoor shots of upstate New York are a nice relief from the largely bare-walled interior scenes (it's a nice touch having Olga's hide-out be an abandoned mine, although clearly the rooms seen aren't in a mine); there's a long (and blessedly dialog-free) sequence of one of the victims getting chased through the countryside that almost achieves a kind of pastoral quality, reminiscent of the silent era; most of the women are fairly easy on the eye, especially Olga (who by the way is clearly American despite her foreign-sounding name).

There's one ambient highlight, though, with hottie Maggie Q stepping in as starlet Gigi, an underutilized extra idling screen time chomping on entrees instead of enlightening Leo with her obvious allure.

Perhaps the film's greatest weakness, from my reasoning at least, is that it is so concerned with painting each character as an icon or ideal (few characters are afforded names, and are instead credited with indefinite articles; "a fugitive," "a lieutenant of police," "an Indian woman") that it's hard to sympathise with them.
With all traces of character removed from the role, leaving him with nothing to work with, it's not until the last couple of reels that he actually becomes a remotely credible character instead of a poorly drawn walking religious icon Â "Hey, look everybody, I'm suffering for your sins just like Christ!"
What should come across as icy, methodical menace (with maybe a bit of tongue-in-cheek irony) is instead sleepwalking boredom, proving that great actors cannot always salvage terrible scripts.

McGregor would have been perfect as Richard, but instead, it is Leonardo DiCaprio who got the role.

Since when has it been called Friday Night Smackdown instead of Smackdown.
thats about it ....................... zzzzzzzzzzz with the budget they have got you would have thought that they would have spent the money on proper sets instead of a car on a rolling track for example when the shots are inside a car the background is whizzing past at 200 miles an hour !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

As in "The Lady Vanishes," the heroine is a spunky brunette instead of a cool blonde; the hero (Detective Smith, played by Michael Wilding) is likable but not stereotypically "heroic" or dashing; and there are some good comic roles for British character actors.
Feast your eyes, instead (and try to figure out how cinematographer Wilkie Cooper shot it) on the sequence that begins outside Charlotte Inwood's residence, as Richard Todd gets out of his car, goes up the steps, opens the door, steps inside and .

The same glaucousness as in "Henry, portrait of a serial killer" or "Cannibal Man", but this time instead of adding something to the movie and its tone, it doesn't work and you just want it to stop more quickly.
If you want a good one, go for "Deadbeat at Dawn" by the excellent Jim Van Bebber instead.
Presenting it in the proper manner makes one marvel instead of blushing and turning away--that seems to be the attitude this director takes, and it causes the frequent nudity in the film to be not so much dirty, obscene, and debaucherous, as being instead a presentation of a thing of beauty.
But instead, it was just shown for the sake of shock value, as a cheap device to make the audience hate the villain.
But instead I got this...

For the first two thirds of the film I was waiting for some clever twist or original storyline that would bring together all the disjointed pieces of the film but instead it ended in the most anti-climactic and least original way - aliens!

having watched Jenifer Garner in P.S I Love you i expected a lot from her in this film, but instead of being a leading role as she was a vital part of the plot she felt a lot like an addition to the thin story line, most of the time she looked like she was tripping over her tongue when Connor Mead was mentioned.
I implore you to rent a movie or two instead of seeing this, or see something else at the movies - anything else.
If the producers actually had an idea of when to release the film they should have done it around Christmas because of the closeness to "A Christmas Carol" and people don't mind a corny film or a corny song because it's Christmas...instead it seems like everyone got it wrong with this one
:) and instead remains true to the original intent of the genre' - a true scifi.
Used to build his character, it just felt more like a cheap trick instead of honest emotion.

Ultimately though it is the performance of Diane Goldner, the real heroin of both this film and the TV show, that made this the first big hit of "Project Green Light" and I eagerly await her return... in the up coming "Feast 2: Sloppy Seconds" (still in production) as the Biker Queen this time instead of the Harley Mom in "Feast"(2005).
instead of taking a risk and making something that IS original.
Had they been brave and supported this movie, they might have ended up with a mega-million dollar theatrical franchise like Nightmare on Elm Street, instead of a straight-to-vid release.
Sidney and Fonda make a marvelous team, and it is nice to see Barton MacLane playing a nice guy for a change, instead of his usual growling bully.

Avoid losing two hours of your short lives on this deliberately low aiming piece of junk; go take a walk instead, you'll feel healthier and, above all, smarter...
I'd like to see how everyone would have reacted if it was Sarah Michelle Gellar, instead of Jack Black, that had a ring ripped out of her genitals on national television.
I think they could have done without Sarah Michelle Gellar, or at least they could have cast someone else in her place,... maybe a female comedian instead.
He instead sets up one unlikely premise (Martin suddenly having a gay encounter; Christina lamely seducing a truck driver; Julia going off her nut, et al) that serves no real pay off and loses interest in Tonya's plight (it is apparent that she lost one child, while her surviving off- spring are so disparate they may as well be strangers), which should have been the central focus.
Araki has Gen X irony/detachment down to a T. His characters are so apathetic that they say, "whatev", instead of "whatever."

Jodha-Akbar is a motley of exceptional love,Terrific Action,Soulful music and splendid cinematography.It is one of the most uncommon films and a must see one if you want to witness something special.The film got combative stunts and it has everything to please everyone.But on the other side,the film is slow and lengthy.The first half of the film lasts more than 2 hrs yet the twists and turns will glue the audience to the cinema.Hrithik was awesome as Akbar and Aishwarya was majestic as Jodha.Direction was at the best.Ashutosh proved yet another blockbuster which falls in the same line of Lagaan and Swades.May be he need to concentrate on the duration of the film by chopping off few scenes.Jodha Akbar is basically a love story instead of calling it as a War based film.The film lacks pace and slow narration of few scenes and the frequent usage of Urdu language made the audience ambiguous and also boring.But at the other end,even though the film lasts for more than 3.30 min,it is gripping enough and very much bearable.The Director need to edit the film and make it as a 3 hrs film so that the audience will like this film even more.The huge star-cast of Hrithik-Ash playing as Akbar and Jodha might have evoked a lot of curiosity among the audience before the release but i must admit the film almost lived up to the expectations.The love part was dealt exceptionally well and it is the forte for the film.The film depicted the Legacy of Akbar.The film also shown that Akbar did lot good for Hindus.

The only major difference is that instead of a Cold War setting on Earth, they used a corporate setting on a colony world.
As I had read previously, Ms. Ross didn't seek to imitate Billie Holiday's style, and instead created a distinct and appropriate - yet similar - jazz style of her own just for the movie (check out "Good Morning Heartache"), and I, being a fan, didn't mind the song interludes.
This movie could have gone wrong, but instead the movie was fun, with high energy and leaves you with a great moral lesson (especially to kids).

Making a follow-up for a classic like "Bambi" is not easy, but the fact that the writers (Director Brian Pimental and newcomer Alicia Kirk) decided to explore an entirely "missing chapter" in the life of the young deer instead of making a proper sequel, gave them enough freedom to create a story that not only is fresh and original on its own, it also gives continuity to the original without disrespecting it or blatantly copying it.
the soldier was afraid tried to hide and run away; wouldn't it be so much easier to TRY and love like he had before instead of facing his love face to face.
But about 1/3 of the way through this poor excuse for an action film, I was very happy that they had him wear a camouflage Army cover (hat for you non-military types) instead of a cornered Marine issue cover when he saluted that officer because neither he nor his character deserved to wear a Marine uniform.

Just because the cowboys are dirty and dusty instead of clean and in fancy shirts, doesn't make it realistic.
It's too bad that someone took such a good name for a movie...I mean the title alone gives anyone an idea or three about what this movie could have been...(almost famous, requiem for a dream...just to name two extremes...and extremely good, creative movies with similar resources)...It's like when a band takes a great name and shoulda' just named themselves 'another lame-ass band'... Well, the same thing holds true here...a great writer could have taken the same concept (forget the name) and driven this movie into a completely original direction with some real drama, real comedy and real emo-tion...instead, we get what we get...plus now this great title is attached to this run of the mill, halfass storyline with so-so performances...

The bottom line is that there are more entertaining love stories (An Officer and a Gentleman) and more realistic movies about military training (Navy SEALs: BUDS Class 234) - watch one of these instead.
See MICKYBO AND ME instead.
In the original, he was this father trying to steer his son into a path of academia instead of rap and parties, in the sequel, he plays a spirit who annoyingly hounds Kid throughout the film with flashbacks from the original.
If these minor characters had done more than just repeat their lines, than maybe I would have bought into the trick, but instead all I saw were cheap repetitive motions used by writers to fill time.
The most clichÃ© topics are touched on throughout the film, like being carded when buying liquor, playing video games instead of having sex, or being old enough to be his mother.
Had the couple been shown debating their issues rationally - instead of simply breaking up every time they hit a problem - the film might have given a helpful insight into the nature of relationships.

this animated offering from Nickelodeon features the Wild Thornberry family and The Rugrats together.now,i know i'm not the target audience,but this is as pretty slow,lame movie.plus,it's so negative.you'd think a movie with these two families together would be pretty decent,but it isn't.i'm pretty certain a lot of kids will find it the same way,at least the older ones.the younger kids might be entertained.anyway,i was very disappointed.for a really great,funny, entertaining animated movie that the whole family will enjoy,try Recess: Schools Out instead and leave this one alone.for me, The Rugrats go Wild is a 4/10

This isn't in itself too bad, but it fails to explain why the man didn't simply return to their base and speak to someone who knew about the experiment, but instead goes on the run across the country, getting involved with a really annoying woman and killing a few people along the way.
To do more with the characters, instead of showing his smugness.
Maybe he's just trying to hide his cute teeth, instead of baring and grinding them.

And in the climax scene Collette does nothing sensibly and instead panics and acts out in a manner that is really uncomfortable and embarrassing to watch.
For Collette's character to give in to his demands so easily after having said her piece about not going out there, and then to complain about what he did to them out there, and then not to explain why she even has this job and what it really means - might have been a much more interesting film if the Japanese guy had to find his own way around, and had met a strange woman in the desert with whom he plays, instead of having this geologist lead the way.

I expected to see some serious scary sci fi thriller, but instead this movie was extremely predictable... on what will happen next and blah blah blah.
I actually voted 10, instead of the well deserved 8 just to crank up the ridiculously low score (something I'm actually against, but this was an obvious emergency).

This last instalment leaves the Swedish focus, and makes it in to a European thriller instead.

Sure, there are the slight touches to the original, like in here there are two fraudsters instead of one....and also, holding to the Indian tradition of movies they must both be of different sexes and must inevitably fall in love and have a child...not to forget the extremely well choreographed dance sequences in between, which is probably the only thing original in the movie....  don't get me wrong, if you consider Bollywood alone, this is one of THE BEST MOVIES...unhappily, i'd already watched the Hollywood version...  if i ever watch a bollywood movie that's not a "remix" of a Hollywood one, i'll give it a ten no matter how crap it is.....

But when he chances to hear Hilda singing, and gets to meet her, he abandons his plan and, instead, decides to help her Â his ruse is uncovered, however, and he is forced to flee, and takes the unwilling girl with him.
I feel like this film was meant to enrage me, to give me a dose of the vague but palpable cultural oppression that makes the characters in it act so self destructively, but it instead made me shrug my shoulders with indifference.
The story's plot is simple enough- an Americanized Filipino American (Adam) whose life is in chaos returns to the Philippines to attend his fathers funeral, but instead, embarks on a horrific rescue mission to get his ransomed mother and sister back from the Abu Sayyaf, an extremist Muslim group.
My partner and I won tickets to see the Sydney sneak preview so off we went last night (Monday 16th October)   Let me begin by saying 'that is 88 minutes of my life that I will never get back"   I was set to see a great Aussie flick; instead I found it mind numbingly boring, predictable 'comedy' (and I use that term lightly)   It was more of a reflection on a horde of has been 'comedians' (and I use that term lightly also) who have unceremoniously used their names and positions on radio stations around Australia to tout the movie as being the best thing since sliced breadÂ   Suggest you spend 88 minutes watching the grass grow than see this movieÂ   I think I would have enjoyed having my fingernails ripped off one by one followed by an acid bath more than that ghastly piece of 'Australian Film making'

instead, i saw a chaotic film that hinted instead of revealed, an actor who imitated instead of captured.
But instead of trying to recreate the energy, the essence that Dean projects, he merely imitates and mimics his movements.

instead of wearing a wax mask they threw him in some overalls.
I would recommend this one instead of watching boring documentaries.

If you want to watch a movie that gives a more balanced portrayal of both sides, along with some important insights into the Vietnam conflict, and at the same time portrays the true horror of the Vietnam war without dishonoring the men who were forced to fight in it, then give Tunnel Rats a miss and watch We Were Soldiers instead.

In a film that seems to be dripping with subtexts and more profound social commentaries, I could not find any; instead, it was displaying such vile imagery simply for shock value.
The script by Richard Yalem, who has a cameo as Peter Sykes who is thrown into the Mississippi in the opening sequence, is a little talky and reveals too much too soon, it might have helped if all these sub plots remained mystery's and were tied up at the end but instead the script reveals all very early on.

The filmmaker frames Megghy's preternatural sexual development around a light-hearted farce in the sunny environs of los in Cyclades, an island off mainland Greece, and normalizes the potentially hairy situation(in the Larry Clarke film, the Chloe Sevigny character contracts the HIV-virus), by pairing the young girl up with a narcissistic aunt who gives her advice instead of admonishments.

I was hoping for this film to recreate the kind of claustrophobic terror that was the only reason to watch the first film, but instead, the entire film is an excuse for Jennifer Love Hewitt to show off her body.

Flicka becomes a mustang, not part of the family's herd, and Katie (instead of Ken) is not allowed to have her own horse as her father is stiff, strict, and - let's face it - sexist.
This movie is the typical childhood Black Stallion fantasy, to the point where they even made Flicka BLACK instead of sorrel.
other things that are just wrong: Galloping a horse in the rain, "talking" to the horse as if its a human instead of using riding cues, not wearing a helmet (Many Western riders do not, but on a green-broke horse this is just asking for trouble).
You have two great legit Martial Artist's in Chuck Norris and Dainel Bernhardt,why not give the fans a special fight,instead of giving us the crap they did.

Not because of the story per se, but because: 1. director Avnet of the B-variety, has problems to stick to the basics and instead tries, probably with an award in mind, to create a work of art, and 2. the script (which should have been used as 2-ply by Pacino in his powder room after reading).
SATISFACTION is not a great movie by any shakes, but taken for what it was meant to be - a slightly naive tale of a girls' band that has a summer of adventure, love and opportunity for the big time nut opts instead to become just a group of life-long friends - it is a well done bit of pastiche.

Fix is detained, McCoy does a wild impersonation of "Bailey"; with his obvious ability to memorize dialogue, and capture a character, "Braddock" should have been an actor instead of a minor.
), the most disagreeable couple of twin girls in movie history and a screenplay that, lacking any trace of logic and plausibility, manages instead to deliver some tragically funny (alas, unintentionally) dialogues  The only real frights come courtesy of the scary costumes (pure 1970's-style) the actors wear throughout the movie: a collection of the worst of the worst of fashion...  And the only real mystery is why Joseph Cotten is in this mess...

The dialogue is outrageous - especially the scene in the classroom when one of the male students talks about Christopher Columbus going to that "deep pool" of the Alantic Ocean with his "non-stop studs" - which now, out of context, sounds more like a line from a gay porno flick instead of a 1950s b-movie (!).

The rubber monster is corny and inspires giggles instead of fear.

I know the film has been maligned for anti-semitic content (perhaps because Jews make mistakes in the film and are seen as persecutors instead of victims?
The nerd, Kunkle, is actually more of a gracelessly and abruptly put-together composite of two two-dimensional characters instead of being one very three-dimensional character.
Clearly the choice was made to upset people enough to see the film instead of to just tell the story.
Screenwriter David Seltzer went on record as not really believing in the stuff when he wrote "The Omen," but this tale of the End of Days is truly lacking in conviction from Joseph Vitarelli's clichÃ©d choral theme onwards (whatever you might think of "The Passion of the Christ," you can't deny that Mel Gibson genuinely put his money where his mouth is); instead of being thought-provoking and chilling, the first four hours are nothing but build-up with nothing going anywhere, and when it's not teasing you it's being ridiculous (ominous supermodels dressed in black hanging around?

Sergio Garrone's "SS Experiment Camp" is a total failure on every possible level.This film was banned in Britain as a video nasty,but it surely isn't as outrageous as many people claim.In fact it's pretty tame even by today's standards.There is some torture and humiliation and lots of nudity and soft-core sex.Some scenes are pretty mean-spirited for example one woman who refuses to go through the experiments is put into the tank.The temperature is first put up to almost boiling point and then the dial is turned the other way making it icy cold.Still the film is extremely dull,so fans of Italian exploitation may be disappointed.Avoid this one like the plague-watch "Beast in Heat" or "Gestapo's Last Orgy" instead!

At the end of the film, Liu Kang fights with big masculine guy (er, Shao Kahn), and instead of actual wanted fisticuffs, we get to see the two of them feel their animality and turn into giant, god awful stupid computer-generated beasts who do combat with each other.

Please read them, instead of wasting time on this crap!
A few weeks ago I was watching a show about killers where the host suggested that murderers like Ted Bundy should kill themselves instead of wasting society's time.
In fact halfway through I wasnt really interested in this movie anymore and wanted to see what kind of film Joe Spinell's character could make instead.

This movie has virtually no plot, instead relying on Chris Tucker to carry the unfunny movie.
The space suits are pretty funny, and instead of ray guns the astronauts carry around plain ol' six-shooters.
It is unfortunate that Hollywood quickly lost interest in the complexity of producing good stereoscopic films (which are most often now featured in specialist theatres such as the IMAX), and instead has followed what I feel has been a largely disasterous attempt to explore the potential of anthropomorphic lenses even though in the majority of cases these have no conceivable artistic contribution to make to the final product.

This makes the film just that much more disturbing if you ask me because when you're looking at live and in motion footage and can see exactly what led up to that person's death, one has a tendency to want to play that terrible scene over and over in their head for days after; and for me it isn't always done intentionally, it's just that it get's in your head and doesn't want to leave until you are able to focus your thoughts on something more pleasant instead until it goes away...which is easier said than done I'm afraid!
Though, I very much doubt that he or any other members of this will be putting it on their CV...  Stay away....rent or watch the Mad Max films instead.
I started watching this after seeing footage of devastation in the film's first 25 minutes thinking there's going to more, even it if was CGI or old archive stuff there would be more chaos--BUT I got instead was boring by the numbers human dramaÂHey this is not the Hallmark Channel; I was baited and then the emphasis of the movie switched--and I am still livid over it!

I first saw and read the cover and it sounded promising.It was nothing like "Joy ride"(which is my favorite movie)or "I saw what you did last summer" like it implies.If i rented it instead of buying the bloody amateur movie i wouldn't be as mad.There was nothing interesting about it including the ending.If the movie had a bigger budget for better effects and better camera's and actors it might be OK.It did look promising up until they all got to the motel.After that it was lame and annoying.The characters were so aggravating that you wanted them to get killed off as quick as possible.The part I hated the most was when the 3 survivors had a man trapped at his home and tied up.They all screamed at him to shut up like a bunch of psycho's while he was pleading "you have it wrong it wasn't me".This Gawddamned scene made my blood boil it was so painfully annoying.

The directorial choices vary from very fine (mixing black and white grainy shots from war footage with stagy though competent settings in color) to questionable (allowing a musical score including steel guitar music and contemporary sounds to intrude into a time when such instrumentation was not even known) to mediocre (allowing the actors to be caricatures instead of players in a tense drama).

The hero jumps in after most of the movie is over and then finally does something heroic instead of notifying the police!
Geoffreys, a regular in '80s horror movies like 1985's "Fright Night," seems almost pitch-perfect as the shy kid who stood to gain some confidence with Satanic powers, but comes off instead as another rejected nerd-turned-braindead screen slasher who goes on a murderous rampage against his tormentors.
Watch the far superior original again instead, definitely not recommended.

This could have been a memorable song-and-dance rooted with historical symbolism-esquire film, but instead fell flat thanks mainly to the horrible nature of Liza Minnelli.
Highlander III, not exactly itself a great sequel, ignored this one completely as ironically it left no outlet for a third episode but it too was a cynical cash-in and could only continue the first film by ignoring its ending whereas the forth in the series simply didn't bother with the first film at all, opting instead to go with the spin-off T.V series.
Didn't laugh once, instead, I spent most of the time shaking my head in disgust of the stupidity that this show is absorbed in.

However, instead of it being that truly remarkable and unmistakable feeling of seeing something that genuinely affected you as a person, filmmaker, artist or moviegoer, it was the kind of feeling that triggered the violent, savage part of me that desired to do little else than find Michael Haneke and tear his insides out with a pitchfork.
Guest: instead of running around telling everyone how funny and talented I am, I would actually try to do something funny, or something that required talent.

A Vin Diesel movie always show great action at least you say ,well....Not this time who ever filmed most of the fights must have been on some form of medication since the cuts are so fast it made for painful watching, At times i felt motion sickness set in.To bad that this movie that could have gotten a solid 8 instead of a 4 was not better put together.
I would have added in maybe 5 minutes of somebody simply talking and explaining what was going on instead of having that last chase scene and then she gives birth to twins and then Vin adopts them and then the end???!!!!

Sterno says eat catnip instead.  
At Least Riget actually exists in real life (the Hospital in Copenhagen is Nicknamed "Riget" which Means "Kingdom", Due to it's Extreme size) And to round it all off, maybe Stephen could have continued the series instead of remaking it, since two actors died after making the second one (hence why there isn't gonna be a third).
Most offensive however, is the speech Vincent Price delivers, wherein he convinces a certain group of women to give up their independent lifestyle so they can "love" men and bear their children instead!

It uses shaky camera motions and cutaways instead of real technique or any inspired moves.

For example - Why did Bette Davis not end with "Whales of August" - her SECOND to last film - instead of the terrible "Wicked Stepmother"?

Michael Bay, can you please start using toilet paper instead of wiping your ass with film reels?
I suppose the attempt is to convey the pressure and fast pace of a newsroom: instead, it conveyed to me a headache (a good director would allow the actors to do some of the conveying emotion: the direction more or less screams look at me in every scene, to the extent the participant I was most aware of was the camera).
I recommend checking out a couple of YOU TUBE-comedians instead because that's all this movie is really, a bunch of YOU TUBISH clips wrapped around a not interesting love-story.
Overall I felt hurt I had wasted my time watching this film, the very least they could have done was edit it so it all stories were linked and thus gave somewhat correlated chronology of events, instead of mind wobbling mess of themes.
We get to see one side of the story with good emotional moments torn out to allow for more of Shepard trying to show us that this play is not about his life, but instead just a work of fiction.
Shepard was a pit of lies as he attempted to push the idea that this was not about his life, but instead a "father/son" themed performance, when in actuality there was documented proof that Henry Moss was a very close representation of his father.
I'm sure that had I had some clue as to what the play was about the scenes we see being worked on might have had some resonance, instead of just seeming to be random.Many people have compared this to Looking For Richard, Al Pacino's film about Richard the Third, while that film had what seemed like random scenes, the play is part of our cultural heritage and so the plot is known by most people.
I saw the promos i was interested especially the first promo but the last few promos gave away and i hoped the film won't be as bad but the film is worst  Abbas-Mustan tried to make a commercial potboiler instead just to appeal to the masses who like such nonsense films  The film starts off okay, 2 songs at the start itself and then slowly each characters are introduced but then the film gets boring because All characters are jerks  Paresh Rawal- Johny scenes are stupid and too loud and crass Shahid- Kareena scenes are worthless and boring They is little hope when Isha is murdered but the director is too involved with comedy, romance and nothing makes sense in the end  The Johny- Tanaaz finding a dead body in the briefcase is too childish and then the entire investigating scenes are not that great  But the end takes the cake, one of the worst climaxes ever Even the CID episodes have better culmination  Abbas-Mustan give their worst ever film Music is good  Shahid and Kareena who were a pair that time are truly wasted Shahid just keeps making big eyes trying to look funny and make weird noises while Kareena irritates Akshaye imitates his dad Vinod Khanna at places and is the only actor worth mentioning here Tanaaz and Johny overact Paresh Rawal overacts too while Payal Rohatgi and Isha are dismissal Upen Patel with a dubbed voice is painful rest are poor

When it attacks Lauren & Wes in the jeep instead of turning it over why doesn't it stick it's arms inside the clearly broken windows & slash them with it's claws?
Watch the original killer Grizzly Bear flick Grizzly (1976) instead.
Intelligence on the people, a tire iron is not going to do much against a adult bear, going off alone over and over when as a group they would stand a better chance, not trying to make weapons such as spears at nigh they sit around 2 flash lights instead of building a large a fire as they can for light to give warning of the bear but also to use as protection not to mention to maybe signal someone that at least they were in a no trespassing area to get rangers interested.
I'll instead close by writing everything that is good about this film........  Thankfully it didn't waste any more of our lives then 90 minutes.

It's OK if Richie encountered a werewolf instead of a giant statue.

Go try something different and watch Hard Candy or Stay instead.
Apart from this most obvious flaw in the movie, we're also expected to believe that these coronal mass ejections somehow keep satellites from burning up on re-entry, so they can take out streets full of people (for example, if the Soviet spy satellite which scattered itself all over the Yukon Territory back in the late 1970s had done so over downtown Detroit instead, the carnage could have been impressive).
He goes there and he thinks he has killed the guy only to find out that he murdered his retarded brother instead.

Save your time and money and rent the original "Dial M for Murder" instead.
I would encourage you read on, so you may save your money and go rent Hitchcock's original instead.

Being a member of a screenwriting team of three, one would think Schnabel would have been more insightful and entertaining, but instead he helps construct a film that examines areas of the writer's life that should have been left out, and does not achieve clarity on the issue of Arenas' poetic talent.

Naschy...er...Molina presumably intended these as a tribute to their Hollywood namesakes, but they came off as unintentionally amusing instead (as is the film's very opening scene in which a couple who are hard up for cash decide to have a go at grave-robbing, to their eternal chagrin!).
The DVD print I saw (part of a "Drive In Movie Classics 50 pack) was awful; it was a full screen "pan and scan", but managed to consistently leave out one or all of the actors in a given shot, instead giving us revealing shots of the middle of the set.And mixing for the sound was apparently done in the bottom of a steel barrel.
They try really hard, but I have to say I laboured through it instead of enjoying the film from start to finish.

We're in a perpetual state of not knowing what we're supposed to be concerned about until 80 minutes into the film, when instead of revealing the answers to the mystery by making connections in our mind for ourselves, we're dealt a five minute scene of the villain saying, "Let me explain my dastardly plan that's been going on for the last 80 minutes, that you as an audience were completely unaware of, while you watched random scenes that still don't make any sense or have any connection to the plot, even after I've explained it."

Please do not blow your money on this DVD, I should have just tuned into the science fiction channel instead of wasting my time on this low grade soap opera disguised as a science fiction movie.
This movie is kung fu crap.It's campy,corny,cheesy,and just appalling.Anyone who can enjoy the random,badly choreographed,slow paced,ridiculously amateur martial arts fight scenes is clearly off their rocker.The storyline screams bad and the plot barely progresses at all.The unbelievable cheesy storyline involves a martial arts student receiving a video game from his grampa in which he and his father get sucked into they then realize that in order to escape they need to beat all of the fighters in the game.Wasn't this on an episode of something like Kim Possible.Hard to believe but the film actually started out OK but after 15 minutes the film becomes a steaming pile of crap.The dialogue is like taking the dialogue from the Mortal Kombat Films,Power Rangers,3 Ninja's,and the English dubbed version of Japanese anime Naruto and creating a hybrid of them all.Don The Dragon Wilson sucks at acting just like the entire cast of this brutally corny film.Stay as far away as you possibly can from this direct to DVD piece of garbage rent something better instead don't waste your time.
The snobbery is also present in the extraordinary character of Michael's 'unsuitable' girlfriend Veronica, a middle class woman who drinks martini instead of sherry and thinks that letting a horse run around the kitchen is "unhygenic" (she's got a point).
My verdict Â Don't watch this film, instead go out, find a ginger person a rocking horse and some mums, borrow your dads handy cam and make your own version, it'll be a fun way to spend a couple of hours
I suggest, instead of seeing this star killer, to read all the 'hated it' reviews here on IMDb.
The heat shield is composed of thousands of mechanical louvers with no imaginable function, instead of a simple solid piece.
If an object is thrust parallel with the spin of the Sun, gravity should pull them towards it in a curve but instead they travel in a totally straight line.
Furthermore, for someone who knows he turns into a werewolf every full moon, you'd think he would have learned to lock himself up--or at least warned his lovely female houseguests to please lock their doors at night instead of wandering around the castle in a nightgown with a lit candelabra.
But nothing congeals and the film's 2-3 minute inert shots and circular banter is reduced to mere gimmicks instead of underscoring (almost non-existent) themes of a stagnated post-communist economy and wishful democratic nostalgia.
The crowd is enraptured by a man preaching hate speech, satirical or not, and you know that the predominantly white, male crowd is the kind of people who are given all the chances in the world, but fail because they're idiots, and instead choose to blame every minority they can think of: women, the handicapped, women, the Japanese, women, the sick, women, midgets, and of course, women.
But where songs like "Kill You" are akin to Andrew Dice Clay, he makes it very clear that he's putting out his frustrations in song instead of in person, and where he is cartoonishly extreme (for instance, "As the World Turns" begins with him attempting to assault a woman at a laundromat, and ends with her eating his leg and his "go-go gadget...").
Andrew Dice Clay, thankfully, has also been blackballed in the industry, but instead of one random moment of anger, he built an entire career out of it, and by the 20-minute mark, I felt uncomfortable, like I had accidentally tapped into a white power forum.
More attention should have been paid to the more important characters instead of dwelling on the minor ones.
This is too raw a nerve to be touched upon by this director, instead, Mitsuko is objectified to little more than an icon; we do not hear her thoughts, we do not bear true witness to the bleakness of her soul.
Bastard Boys should have been about how this whole incident could have been avoided if everyone just worked together, instead of turning into another preachy bit of political revisionism and selective history which only shows one side of the debate.
Avoid, but not like the plague, and instead 'When Harry Met Sally' or 'The Break Up' are much better films that do something similar to this film, but better.
The dialogue, apart from being in English instead of German, is likewise almost identical.
"Dan Candy's Law" should have been a rumination on revenge,  and a comment about how the United States does not have a  monopoly on mistreating its native peoples, but instead this film  went for the cheap action thrill without an action thrill to exploit.
I suggest you watch Thunderheart instead.
It's always a good thing when movies use real Indians instead of actors that are painted up to look like Indians.
The cheap fight against Sylar, and the first few images of the teaser of the second season don't reassure me with the potential disappearance of Sylar's body in the sewage (how the Hell could anyone let him move even an inch) or Hiro in Medieval ClichÃ© type Japan....  Watch it when you really don't have anything better to do and watch Battlestar Galactica instead if you look for the best TV series ever (who said I'm subjective)
And so to conclude, unless you are a immature or a kid, don't watch or stop watching this circus on TV and chose other TV shows instead.
It instead, informs the viewer five-ten episodes in advance what the finale is going to include, and then it plays out exactly as you expect it to.
It's tuneless and seems to interrupt the scene instead of accompany it.
The producers decided to show more of Claire, and more... and more... until her story was... dried up... HRG or Noah Bennet, her adoptive father was no longer malevolent and instead became a total sap that only wanted to protect Claire.
"When A Stranger Calls" would have worked better as a short, independent film strongly emphasizing its bravura opening instead of plunging into the sprawling mess we get here.
And I give them credit for handing out pamphlets that promote love instead of trying to scare people with images of burning hellfire (like the group outside of the porn expo).
Jonathan Lipnicki's character is annoying and should be kidnapped instead of adopted.
It's much easier to cut up the movie on an ad hoc basis to gloss over the unimaginative character interactions in combat, instead of mapping out fight scenes and brainstorming over fresh combinations of moves and maneuvers.
The hero was a real human being, instead of being a reckless soldier, a suave spy or a martial-arts expert.
At least have it so the bear needed physical help, instead of the instructional video on bear mating.
Why do the suspects continue to entertain the detective instead of telling him to 'go to hell and leave them alone'?
They might be seen in one of those late night infomercials instead.
I rarely see really bad movies... because no matter how bad a movie is, I always try to overlook the flaws and focus on the merits instead, then it becomes a not so bad movie.
instead of running like hell.
I won`t mention the stunts or the tightly written set pieces or how compelling they are because everyone else has beat me to it , except to say that big explosions and gun fights often overwhelm an action movie ( Bond movies are a good example ) but here they occur from the narrative instead of someone cramming them into the script in a vain attempt to thrill the audience .
The father can't throw it, so the Giant comes along and does instead, but ends up throwing him over the cliff as well, but after tumbling, it seems it worked.
Imagine if Monty had said " Oh Bugger Alamein, I'll attack Cairo instead...
Let people deal with it instead of remember them how much does they suffer!!!
I'm really so sure that the cops and her female friends were really anxious to see Laci's husband on trial for murder instead of the who did this.

Not only is this lazy, but if I wanted to sit there watching endless scenes of autopsies, I would have, well, rented a video that consisted of actual autopsies  instead (yes, you can rent those now).
Terrible continuity, too-in one scene, a guy bites into a small corner of a guards earlobe while fighting, then we cut (they always cut away instead of going to the trouble of showing any sort of effect) to a shot of the guy with a huge chunk of flesh in his mouth.
Their subplots actually add to the story instead of overcomplicating it, especially one featuring good cop Sgt.
Ryder is found unconscious, after being thrown from horseback, by a boarding school student (Haas) who takes her to his room (yeah, right), instead of the obvious choice, the hospital.
(The fact that McClane often relies on his brains instead of his bullets to get out of his predicaments is also a big plus.)
The fact that Willis plays McClane as a man often in disbelief of his own situation, and who struggles in his fight against bad guys instead of just killing bad guys with ease, like most stereotypical action heroes -- well, not only does it make the character much more believable, it's darn brilliant.
Gruber, as played by Rickman, is cold and calculating, and actually acts smart, instead of merely claiming to be smart and then being thoroughly outwitted by the hero.
Or if the king actually had a court and palace, as was indeed the case in ancient Mali, instead of sitting under a tree?
Note this people I wasn't expecting much when I started watching this "film" and I use the term loosely, I just expected at least a history channel esq documentary at best, but instead I got a Pirates of the Caribbean rip off.
I gave this movie a 3, instead of a 1, but only because they got this movie made and released with practically no budget, which I respect.
Here's what I think happened: Every time one of the actors made an attempt at acting, that actor was beaten until they learned to stand there remembering lines instead of actually acting.
Rent Slumber Party Massacre instead.
Naschy...er...Molina presumably intended these as a tribute to their Hollywood namesakes, but they came off as unintentionally amusing instead (as is the film's very opening scene in which a couple who are hard up for cash decide to have a go at grave-robbing, to their eternal chagrin!).
Choosing the mayor, symbolically siding with the higher class instead of the poor, Yukio will swallow a bitter pill when his brother takes him away from the comforts of living, placing him in a horrifying situation of confinement, hunger, and filth..there seems to be no escape as he looks up at his brother, who teases about ruining his practice and making love to his wife.
The DVD print I saw (part of a "Drive In Movie Classics 50 pack) was awful; it was a full screen "pan and scan", but managed to consistently leave out one or all of the actors in a given shot, instead giving us revealing shots of the middle of the set.And mixing for the sound was apparently done in the bottom of a steel barrel.
He may not quite be the worst Holmes in the way that he was definitely the worst Dracula (in Van Helsing), but he's certainly the dullest and blandest despite his overstated distance and eccentricities, while the attempt to make him more of an action hero simply ends up making him a very ordinary figure instead.
With all displays of Holmes' deductive reasoning dropped (even the famous scene with Dr Mortimer's walking stick is gone), his disguises omitted (he just appears on the moor as if he were still dressed for Baker Street) and his drug use wildly overdone (rather than resorting to narcotics when bored, he even jacks up in a public toilet while working on the case in this version), he's such a blunt bull in a China shop here that rather than pay the cabby for information, he beats him up instead as if he were a 19th century Popeye Doyle.
He describes himself as a private detective but he didn't do much of that in the film--instead making his money through gambling and "fixing things".
Overall, instead of being a movie to frankly talk about STDs, it was cheap and in many ways exploitational.
I wanted to love Vacation, I truly did.Seeing as how everyone thought it was a magnificent movie, I wanted to think it was a magnificent movie as well, but instead it turned out that I thought Vacation is pure crap.Nothing was funny.I laughed at maybe one thing.Also, it couldn't keep my interest, and it was "REALLY" boring.I was pausing the movie continuously, because I wanted to get up and do something, for I was about to fall asleep.The acting was good, and the script is somewhat original, but there was a lot of unnecessary material as well, and overall I found this to be a pretty terrible movie.Don't waste your time on it.

Try 'The Ring' or 'The Eye' instead.
The make-up job on Tiny was so outrageous that he looked like he dumped a jar of spaghetti sauce over his head instead of having it burned to a crisp.

For works playing successfully playing with the thriller genre, try some of Paul Austers'books or Wim Wenders'earlier films instead.
Go and have a root-canal procedure instead - it will be a pleasant experience in comparison.

I would have given it a PG-13, instead of an R.  Stay on the main road, people.
When i was watching it at one point i though i was watching, wrong turn, then i star thinking about the Texas chainsaw massacre, then hills have eyes and finally i know what you did last summer, the movie it's basically a mix of all these other movies but unsuccessfully did what those other movies did, it's just so predictable, the scrip it's so weak and far beyond scary, instead of that it's so lame, with this thousands of clichÃ©s like "don't go in there" "what it's this place" "he's gonna kill us all" you basically know who's gonna die first and why called it "the butcher" there is no butcher in the film and there is not even a good slaughter, they should have call it "i know what the Texas hills wrong turned last summer" or something, honestly i don't know what a company spend money into making this crappy films.

The director also felt that some sequences could be cut entirely, replaced instead by the all-knowing Voice-over from God.
The science is only hinted at and is explained away in a cursory fashion, it would have been more interesting to expand on the strange science theme instead of going for typical cheap scares which is what the movie devolves to in the conclusion.
I was hoping to see something scary, or suspenseful, instead, I was wishing for the movie to end.
Except that instead of a comedy this one is a mean and boring excuse for a thriller where everybody is weird and bad-ass, so the whole thing reeks of Tarantino or any of those awful El Mariachi sequels.

I would have given the movie a ZERO instead of a one, but there wasn't that option.
The cinematography wasn't all that bad (except the part where I could actually see the rig they used to lift people off the ground) and it showed what the future of Independent Film will look like (sharp, clear, and almost as good as the studios) but the people behind the camera must've blown their camera budget on that awful looking Kevlar vest thing because instead of buying a red lens filter to simulate night time they just turned the contrast on the camera WAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYY down.

The camp factor needle hits "HIGH" as soon as we are introduced to Mercedes McCambridge appearing in a warden's uniform, barking orders in a faux-German accent (even though her name is Thelma Diaz) and giving Marie a backhand across the face for using her name instead of her number, "99".

In this comic book style gangster flick Jack Palance gives a good but sometimes dreamy performance.He was definitely a great performer and by the end of the movie you do find his character admirable.The film suffers from the fact that the director instead of making a full scale dramatic gangster epic(The Godfather,Part-II etc.

for a white man to sing mammy in black face go down to a black neighborhood and tell the people that.As a non-black that lived in black districts I can tell you it upsets them.When this movie came out on TV in the 1960's it made me cringe because I knew a lot of people around me were going to be upset.Yes,the good old 1960's when the riots started,showing a movie like this didn't help prevent them.The people that support and broadcast-ed this movie go around oblivious to realty.While their safe in a sheltered world during the riots I'm on the funky streets trying to be on time for the graveyard shift.Some persons now believe Leif Erickson discovered America instead Of Columbus.A change is needed in movie history too.In the best interest of a happier society I'd like for this movie not to be given any claim to fame,sweep it under the rug.May a technicality give the fame to a more decent film.

Another reason why Phantasm's atmosphere works so well is the use of white and brightness instead darkness Phantasm's surreal mortuary is a nightmarish treat of white marble walls lined with drawers of the dead, gaping large hallways and The Tall Man's shoes trudging along the tiles that make you feel he's going to jump out of the television screen.

I don't think Ghost Lake makes itself particularly clear & that has to be down to the script & Woelfel, I don't think Ghost Lake comes across as a straight horror film as instead of going for scares & gore it tries to develop a complex mystery which just isn't that interesting or engaging, imagine a low rent The X-Files (1992 - 2002) episode.

Script felicities are many and varied, though none is more rewarding than the scene where Fonda is told that the mine -- upon whose fortunes the town depends -- has just closed, after which he immediately begs his adopted son to settle down in this selfsame place of doom and earn himself an education instead of playing around with guns.
What follows from here has to be SEEN TO BE BELIEVED: Oates, the town's sheriff, tells the "bad man" to step out of the saloon, but the saloon owner steps out instead and gets shot by Oates!
The boy wants to shoot at him to protect the woman but kills her instead!
But instead what we get out of it is XANADU, a really bad script (blame Richard Christian Danus and Marc Reid Rubel for this one, folks) that somehow got Olivia Newton-John and Gene Kelly attached to it.
I liked how they gave all the engines different voices, they had about 5 of them instead of one doing the voices for everybody.
It skirts right around some interesting and important social & economic issues, preferring instead to attempt to create an illusion of hip-hop, street-gang cool - which it fails miserably to succeed with.
Someone commented earlier about they would have liked to see a black girl try to be white instead.
Do yourself a favor and watch Unbreakable instead.
As for the main proceedings, the writers just didn't know how to create the suitable guilty-or-innocent tension for Kinski's character -- instead they gave us confusion, contradiction and, by the finale, downright let's-hope-the-viewers-don't-notice claptrap.
Give me the Pryor from "BiCentennial ******" instead; THAT character belongs in a Superman film.
Superman is supposed to be a good guy, but here he gets some "kryptonite" that instead of weakening him makes a villain of him.
By the way, I highly recommend you people rent "Drive" instead.
I was in the video store the other day and figured on renting it,since I'd just finished the 1st,but something told me not to waste my precious money,and just view it online instead.
Keep your fantasies of these teen actors alive and go watch their 1999 movies instead.
I wish I had seen GalaxyQuest instead.
How about a movie about these people, instead of the cookie-cutter romcom leads (yawn).
If your after a good, fun & entertaining killer toy film then check out the Puppet Master (1989 - 2003) & it's sequels, Dolls or the Child's Play (1988 - 2004) films instead.
he actually looks really bored and seems as though he would prefer a quiet night in with a video instead of attempting to kick arse), and his physical fitness really needs to be questioned.
The only thing I hated was the movie was more about homophobia and gay bashing.Not that I support Nazi skinheads but I don't understand why they were so threatened by gays instead of the groups of black and Asian gangs in the neighborhood.There was an interesting remark made in the DVD extra features that mentions that there is more violence within their own ranks then there is violence towards others.I loved the scene in the movie when a huge group of gay men got together and bashed the skinheads back.I have never seen that before in a movie and they deserved the beating.It was nice to see a bit of payback from the gay community.Ironically the most vicious gay hating skinhead David Lee played by David Lee Willson has come out as a gay man in real life.I read a really cool article about this actor and how hard it was for him to play such an evil hateful role.
I'd give this a skip and try watching the TV series instead; whatever its faults, at least it has a bit more heart than this mess.
One of the worst films I've ever seen at the Toronto Film Festival; this was compared by the program book to Robert Altman's The Player, but plays instead like a rejected TV pilot for a third-rate network.
Sometimes it seems intended as a black comedy, but it's not remotely funny; it's gimmicky instead of parodic, banal instead of ironic.
However, a great role was also wasted, David Schwimmer could have done so much with his role as a gun crazed homosexual, but instead he was boring and useless.
I found the film weird, but not in an intellectually good way; it's as if the writer/director just wanted to creep us out a little bit, but instead of succeeding at this, just made one boring dud.
Not even Meg Foster could stop this space ship from sinking, avoid at all cost, go see Starship Troopers instead.
But instead of keeping her in character, she becomes sappy and simpering, because she's destined to destroy the Earth.
But instead it's supposed to be a sequel to film that is no masterpiece, but is damn sure far more interesting and entertaining than this.
The "directors" need to learn about "establishing shots" so the audience can have an idea what is going on, instead of these annoying constant close shots.
Lighting should have been used to enhance the movie instead of helping kill it.
He finally gets the opportunity to execute his wife's killer, only to inexplicably back down and instead allow a Maori soldier working for the "pakeha" (non-Maori, mostly for white man) to do the deed, apparently mesmerized by Maori chanting and suddenly becoming sympathetic to a culture and cause that is not his own.
One comes away from this film wondering why these monsters weren't simply wiped out, instead of being coddled and treated as pets.
So I think I'll go do that now instead of lingering any longer on it.
"The Amazing Transplant" basically features the exact same plot, but of course we're dealing with a raping penis here instead of a murdering pair of hands.
NAturally,the two clean lads will find love instead of instant sex(though they'll find THAT too;remember,this IS the '80s)in the arms of hot-yet-sympathetic lasses played by Corinne Wahl and JAyne Modean.
Oh sure, we could have watched such gems as "Highway To Heaven" or "Riptide" on broadcast TV instead, but then what the hell were our parents paying $6.50 a month on cable for?
They don't go back to the knives which they know are there instead they run inside the boat, find a hatch and climb back outside again.
The director is obviously very talented, and even the acting is above average compared to this type of fare (I'm looking at you My Bloody Valentine 3D with your silent movie-type overacting) but the plot is such a bore and there is a distinct lack of suspense throughout that instead of generating thrills it almost put me to sleep.
I though I would never say this, but I'd rather watch a Uwe Boll movies instead of this.
I'll just watch the U.S. shows now instead.
A disappointment; go watch Ring instead for truly creepy television antics.
rating: -*(minus should be allowed.. as I would like my money back and some, for the torture doled out to me)  Run far away or watch Glitter/Gigli instead, unless you are an Ash fan or an Abhishek B fan (god have mercy on your sense of preference)
If want to watch a romantic comedy, watch Chupke Se instead.
It's certainly one of John Garfield's best roles, finally getting into the ring: the play Golden Boy had been written for him only for the producers to cast him in a supporting role instead, so there's an element of unfinished business here, though Abraham Polonsky's script is much better that Odets' rather patronising fairytale.
"Why is the girl running up the stairs instead of out the front door to get away from the killer?"
I watched it for 15 minutes, went back to the movie select menu, chose "Norbit" instead, finished "Norbit" and fell asleep.
On several occasions, Brooks failed to use obvious plots and instead, put nothing.
This could have been it, however the director went for a 3 Stooges approach instead of a much grittier and darker 48 Hours.
If you have a chance to see this movie, watch something else instead or just go to bed.
Or better yet, make a dentist's appointment instead of watching it.
Perhaps it was her reaction to a camera instead of an actor that made Audrey Totter seem chilled in their "scenes" together rather than Claire Trevor's cold hearted user and Lauren Bacall's cool cynic in the earlier Marlowe incantations.
I rather enjoy watching Dolph Lundgren making an ass of himself instead watch this movie again.
Of course he gives in and tries to shoot the villain instead.
If only the production of this film, and others like it, would JUST TELL THE STORY with good acting and let the message be intuitively realized by the viewers instead of being rammed down their throats with soap operatic soliloquies and didactic preaching.
All Russell trademarks are there: excessive closeups of actors in dramatic distress, swirling activity to cover up script weaknesses, and disjointed highlights instead of sequence continuity.
Thankfully, although most of them are practically extended cameos, the supporting cast Â of whom, I thought, John Hurt comes off best Â does keep one watchingÂbut, again, the utterly predictable double surprise ending closes the film with a whimper instead of a bang.
When the animal nearly kills him instead of vice versa, MacGregor feels like a loser and offended in his manhood.
See instead 'Amores perros' or 'Ratas, ratones, rateros' or read Fernando Vallejo's book.
In my opinion they could have made the courtship a bit more interesting with some romantic interludes included, instead what we see are a few minutes of the bottom half of legs shoveling through hallways; very unimaginative and cheaply done, but I suppose the priority might have been to get them in a hurry out into the rural country side for all the silly slapstick action.
This is close to the worst movie I have ever seen, but it is beaten out by Protocol and The Man who Fell to Earth, so it gets a 2 from me instead of a 1.
(Gave it 2* instead of 1* because I laughed accidentally once.)
"Failure to Launch" could have been a really fun and offbeat romantic comedy, but it is instead a sub-par and obnoxious one.
The scenes drag far, far too long and instead of cutting on a joke or trimming needless scenes (maybe because there are a lot that don't go anywhere), they linger.
I actually would have been happier to see more physical comedy which would have lightened the tone instead of everyone being so serious.
Oh yes, why would nobody on the crew leave instead of risk their lives?
That's why there porn stars, if a women as beautiful as Jenna could act, then she would have tried to go into mainstream movies instead of porn.
I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 rating just because Jenna is so hot, but there are better movies she has made then "Dream Quest".
The ending of the movie makes you think that your watching a war movie about the D-Day invasion of France, with an armada of ships planes and thousands of allied troops storming the beaches, instead of a film about three commandos trying to get just one man out of Norway under the cover of darkness.
That said, with say a better actor, such as Clint Eastwood in the role, instead or Arnie, then maybe a 6 or 7 out of 10 for this movie.
Unfortunately the film can't even be relied on for classic one liners; the closest we get is after Arnie's wife throws a cake against the wall to which he replies   "NEVER DRINK AND BAKE..."  Go watch Total Recall, or Predator again instead!
His wife (Blanche Baker) hates him because he resigned instead of fighting for his job, she's bored in small-town America, prompting her to ice a cake with an expletive frosted on the top.
I don't object to bloody scenes being shown in a film, provided that they serve some purpose in the plot, and they do not constitute the film's purpose instead (as it happens here).
Martial arts fans pick something decent instead.
The problem is that if one treats himself to shallow, uninspired, unoriginal, uninventive films, who are shot chiefly for the purpose of using some glitzy special effects and for solvin someone's money problems for the rest of his life, you may find such a film creative or inspired, instead of just the trick it is.
Instead of running over a couple of zombies in a car, this idiot decides to crash the car instead, knocking out a girl in the process.
Now, instead of dragging her along (the zombies still wouldn't catch up) or closing the doors to keep her safe, they leave her there, only to stop 10 ft away to film her dying.
Watch George A. Romero's zombie flick Diary of the Dead (2007) instead since it's much, much better.
What happened to the good old days when people shot homemade porno when they got some camera equipment instead of their own horror movie?
The heavy hand of Howard Hughes had a good deal to do with ruining what slight chance this movie had of being good, as it was originally supposed to be about Nazis, and he decided, as studio chief, that he knew better, so he ordered much of the film re-shot to make the villains Russian agents instead.
They should have left Garfield dead instead of resurrecting and renaming him.
Yet, History Boys opts instead to treat its pedophiliac tendencies like an 800 pound gorilla in the classroom.
You could have spent the evening telling them, but no - instead you are here, in a cinematic prison of abject misery.
I thought it must be the original version as broadcast in 1986, as it was in 6 parts instead of 3.
This film bravely ignores this and instead parades its terrible monster for about half the film.
The movie instead of concentrating on the reincarnation angle goes all over the place with the somewhat unstable carnival hypnotist and mind reader, as well as prognosticator, Dr. Carlo Lombari, Chester Morris, who's completely obsessed with his beautiful assistant Andrea Talbott, Marla English.
Finishing off the crazed Dr. Lombardi who wanted it to instead finish off Dr. Erickson the bumbling and hardly able to walk She Creature stumbles back to the ocean with the cops, who are unable to see it, being directed by Dr. Erickson, who can, to shoot at it as it finally disappears under the waves.
Can you imagine, Lombardi's benefactor Chappel (Tom Conway) turns him into a money machine with books and a lecture tour to cash in on the she-beast; you would think it was the year 2007 instead of 1956!
I would love to see this adaptation redone again on film instead of video so as to make it more lifelike (able to lose yourself in it without remembering you are watching a movie)and allow a new generation of children to try their hand at making Sarah Crew's story come alive.
If you're going to see Jawbreaker, I recommend seeing Jackie Brown instead.
Now if this had quality instead of an excuse to rush sex appeal to the market, "Jawbreaker" would've been a better movie than it was.
I don't hate this movie...it could've been a little funnier and satirical instead of just a bunch of beautiful people backstabbing each other sans modus operandi.
There were some obvious small things like editing mistakes that made it clear that not a lot work was put into finishing this but instead it was just put on the movie shelves as soon as it could.
it is people like these who instead of offering a solution to the corporate ills of the world actually contribute towards them.
May be it was because I hadn't seen "9 Queens," but I really wish they had explained why the twist had occurred by throwing in some more background at the end or something instead of just abruptly ending it with me feeling like I stepped out during the part of the movie that would have a) let me see this coming at all and b) me care enough that it did any more than just the feeling that I had been taken for a confused ride.
If you haven't seen 9 Queens then watch that instead because it is better.
If you want to be noticed, why not be noticed for doing a good job instead of hamming up the role.
Filmed using 70's vintage video instead of film , obviously not quality digital when witnessing the colour bleeds, faded backgrounds and motion blur.
My advice...skip "Murder at the Presidio" and watch a "Law & Order" rerun instead.
His beret had a unit crest instead of his rank and in general, his demeanor was unbecoming of an officer.
I like Victoria Pratt a lot, but on the cover of the DVD she has the flash on her beret over her right eye instead of her left eye.
Frankly, the movie is melodramatic enough to constitute somewhat of a genre anachronism; it would have made much more sense coming out in 1949 instead of 1959.
There's no reason for the prostitute to throw rocks at Kaji instead of the real culprits.
A few pseudo-comic scenes, several references to old spanish TV programs and music hits (if you want to feel nostalgic with all that stuff you can watch a spanish TV documentary instead and that'll be surely better), and a surreal plot only understood by the people who made the film.
Other than that, the background music will put you to sleep, the house is nice, but they could have added some colours to it instead of just making the entire decorations made out of wood.
Rent 'Beyond the Poseidon Adventure' instead.
Well, what about Runaway, with its lyrics like "I want to know the truth instead of wondering why..." and With You, which proclaims "The sound of your voice brings up all my memories, even if you're not with me I'm with you..."?
mark), and Ben Matlock, are granted some leeway in cavorting around the courtroom, instead of being boringly confined to a lectern.
What happens is you get bored, and instead you pick up all the flaws of the film, and this really happened to me.
Watching them on tour is nice, i just wish we could of seen full length songs live instead of just clips, like from their ozzfest days.
If you're after an entertaining horror flick it would be best to skip Hell Night and watch something like American Gothic or Scalps instead.
Alright, so in reality banks do fund wars, but instead of teasing out who was behind everything and letting us and the character work out what they're up to, less than half an hour in, Calivini explains absolutely everything we need to know.
Admittedly, neither actor is helped by the clunky script, which forces the leads to deliver exposition instead of realistic dialogue and which includes such philosophical gems as "sometimes you find your destiny on the road you took to avoid it".
Everything was so simplistic, it appeared as if it was written for an infant chimpanzee instead of even a teenage human audience.
Though I wasn't held at gunpoint to see this movie, but I was persuaded by my friends instead.
And finally, with only a little time left to collect their cash winning prizes, the guests decide to make up their own quest by attempting to escape the house instead.
If you haven't seen any of Val Lewton's tiny masterpieces -- "The Cat People" or "I Walked With a Zombie" -- or, say, "The Haunting" or "Carnival of Souls," try them instead.
Chris Kattan from Saturday Night Live makes an appearance, and this brought my hopes up thinking he would provide some sound comic relief, but instead he spends the whole movie ranting about how "the house is alive," something we have known since the first five minutes.
I gave it two stars instead of one because of one somewhat exciting scene at the beginning.
Because that is the ONLY conceivable reason than this series focused so entirely on her character instead of Blade who had absolutely no airtime by comparison.
I'm very happy this show was axed, maybe if this happened more often instead of people just accepting crap Hollywood would get the message and put out some decent stuff.
Why, then, do I give this film a 4 out of 10 instead of a 1 or 2?
You won't believe this plot, yet again there is no oil and the chaotic future is desert like, but at least Mel Gibson rides a car, instead Michael Beck rides a (much cheaper I guess) motorbike.
Or, how about a hand grenade that, when detonated, erupts as a fireball instead of a shower of fragmented metal.
It is painfully obvious that the car that's blown up is another model, a much older 4 doors saloon instead of the 2 doors convertible.
This movie leaves us the impression that the actors have been hired to appear at a rich kid's party instead of playing a part in a movie.
If that's not bad enough, instead of Jodie Foster battling her inner demons while chasing Hannibal Lechter, we get the always beaten-down Diane Lane and her cohort played by the lifeless Billy Burke (who, by the way, seems to be this generation's Jeff Fahey).
And not from fans of the actual movies, but rather from the series instead, which was mildly entertaining but had no real story to it.
I recommend Hatchet and Feast instead...!!
I wish Natassia Malthe (who plays Kristy's assistant in this film) had the leading role instead.
The plot changes are ridiculous: Larry drives an ambulance instead of flying a plane; he goes with Gray rather than by himself; Sophie and her husband are married at the beginning rather than later; Larry and Isabel sleep with each other; Sophie's a prostitute instead of a whoreÂ and she falls truly in love with Larry rather than dutifully, as she does in the novelÂthe only way that her leaving him makes sense.
Gray, rather than being the commonplace everyman, is instead some spidery sort supposedly war-mates with LarryÂa foolish depth to a relationship better left at its tenuous state, as the book does.
Not as bad as movies like this get, but not good either, watch Rambo:First Blood Part II instead.
Rating: forget this one - watch Rambo instead.
I wish he would have followed the goofy beginning to it's logical next step (A spoof movie of Asian horror would be great if done right) but Oikawa instead elects to follow paths already forged out in J-Horror.
The normally reliable John Krasinski (familiar to viewers of TV's "The Office") aims at endearing, but instead comes across as uncomfortable sour, saddled with a weak rehash of the typical Ben Stiller "uncomfortable boyfriend" role.
Obviously again noting since that this Camera "captures the death of a moment" that would make sense because the children should have a life instead of slowly dying like the old man.
I gave this two stars instead of one as it was visually interesting for about 5 minutes and the music was great.
I would actually prefer to watch the movie without Mike, Tom and Crow and make my own jokes instead of having the show tell me what's funny about the movie.
Like most young women who make the same mistake at this age, Panabaker looks to her mother (played by a loving but intense Mercedes Ruhl) for advice and in response she promptly pulls her out of school, picks up and moves as quickly as possible to another town where no one will know who they are, warns Panabaker to never contact the child's father and tell him about the situation and ultimately decides that instead of having to explain her grandchild's origins and the whole messy problem itself to a new set of people she just pretends the infant is hers...one of those late-in-life babies born to a middle-aged woman shortly before her divorce through what seems like some sort-of miracle and without the hassle of the whole in-vitro process.
Of course, that plan backfires in the mother and daughter's faces shortly after their new adjustment due mostly to the racked-up guilt that the young woman has for not being a real mother to her child, and instead having her own mother build up a facade around the actual truth of the situation just to save face of both her mother's and her own, also for not telling the baby's birth father her reasons for running out on him was that she was pregnant and scared and finally because of the interest a childless sex-education/sociology teacher (played by Jane Krackowski), herself trying desperately to become a mother with little luck, takes in her seemingly odd situation eventually forcing Panabaker to reveal the truth behind it leaving her character wondering if putting her baby up for adoption wouldn't be the best answer to her and her family's pressing problems.
There needs to be more family friendly movies instead of this kind of garbage that actually perpetuates damaged families and their lack of importance to each other.
If you want to see this as a double feature with The Grapes of Wrath, rent the Milagro Beanfield War instead.
I'm gonna tell the story without exaggerating anything...This movie was released and it took me a couple of weeks to go see it cause I wanted to see other things instead...Critics were not too kind but not too mean with this one, and being a Fito Paez film (who despites being a very pretentious musician could have a chance of being a good filmmaker), starring the always terrific Cecilia Roth and the hottest actor around, Gael GarcÃ­a Bernal, I gave it a shot...
Why doesn't hollywood let us take our own sides instead of pushing us to a situation where there are no longer any options?).
The director (Jean Jacques Annaud) got himself into a confused mess when trying to make this good versus evil movie - he's comfortable depicting all Nazis as bad but he can't depict all Soviets as good and tries instead to portray a complex grey area.
Give me a hat pin in the hand of a beautiful woman any day instead of an enhanced comic book hero flying through mile-high explosions.
It's a happy ending though because the guy who finally sits on the throne is a doctor and an idealist, and we are compelled to hope he remains that way instead of discovering that, hey, it's good to be the king.
If you wanna see more of Berenger, get At Play in the Fields of the Lord instead.)
I would never wave goodbye to a fifty foot lizard that had just ripped up a monster, I would instead wave goodbye to whatever it is marching towards.
You get to sort of interact with the movie instead of just sitting and watching paying close attention to the plot.
The guy playing the villain seems to have modeled himself after the Tall Man from "Phantasm" (not a bad choice, really), but instead of having the Tall Man's menacing rasp, he seems to be choking on a throatful of phlegm.
Naturally, this movie is prime MST3K fodder so best watch that version instead if I were you.
If this movie was made in 2008, it would star the same kid, but it would be about a cult started in World of Warcraft instead of some lost civilization.
There's good stuff involving some demented rat-catching, too, and Argento injects some variation into the Phantom myth: instead of being disfigured, he is normal-looking, and has simply been raised by rats.
Sleazy little movie looks like it was filmed in one or two days on the streets of L.A. and in back alleys and in old apartment buildings - maybe the crew just decided it would be cheaper to film this at their houses instead of on an actual set?
Read "Cuckoo's Egg" instead.
This has to be one of the one of the worst comedies to walk on the face of the Earth,the acting is dreadful,the plot sucked and Eddie Murphy put on a bad performance.I've seen Eddie Murphy in the Shrek movies and he put on great performances.It's about to lads who call themselves losers and put up a daddy day care center and they soon find out that they can't control the kids and an inspector comes and says they need more staff or else he will shut daddy day care down but fear not...the two boneheads have a plan that doesn't seem to work and daddy day care gets shut down.The only way to reopen it is to find a bigger place,more staff and try to get the kids back from some school for kids aged 2-4 or something like that.This movie is a real joke that can't make you laugh instead it makes you sleepy.The story isn't that bad but nothing is funny except the part when a kid comes out of the bathroom and says "I missed"and Eddie Murphy looks in the bathroom and the music from "Psycho" comes on.
Perhaps that's the best explanation; I fell asleep early and had a very strange nightmare instead of watching the actual movie.
Martin Scorsese finds himself well and truly outside of his usual territory here and instead of the stunning personal storytelling we're used to from him, we are bogged down with all sorts of ridiculous mumbo-jumbo and a somewhat confined take on the history of China and Tibet.
In conclusion: If I were you i'd leave this "direct to video production" right down there on the videostore's shelves and rent Jackie Chan's "Who Am I" instead.
What ever happened to making movies that made you FEEL the film instead just watching it.
Here's a newsflash-if you're going to do a film, and want to make it 'gritty'-why not just film it in black and white, instead of blue w/ one object in the screen in color?
It's supposed to be a coming of age tale but instead comes off as very fake.
I think the story would have worked better if Moises had been a shyer introverted kid instead of a semi street smart hooker-hiring Ferris Bueler's day off type making dance moves.
I guess using the Kingston Trio song as a script instead of writing one from scratch was a lot cheaper.
But, his subject never seems to cooperate and instead, enjoys toying with the couple one evening aboard a yacht when a bloodied woman appears to have fallen overboard (film which conveniently goes missing) and then later, during a weekend in the producer's penthouse high rise.
Conclusion: read the book instead.
The gags are primitive, unfunny, badly directed or written, and the movie has to be endured instead of enjoyed.
The Urgals instead of being a different race they are just barbaric men with tattoos.
The producers changed the whole plot and facts including: 1 the egg that Eragon finds looks more like a pill than an egg and when he touches it, it gives him a fat spiral on his hand instead of the shining palm.
5 Brom gets killed by Durza instead of the Razac.
17 Durza conjures up a strange creature instead of just fighting Eragon with a sword.
As a result, instead of complexed, unpredictable fantasy plot you get simple, one-way heading fairy tale.
And he seems to be the kind of guy that believes the best way to make you leave a city would be to make everyone else disappear so you feel unwelcome, then block all the rivers and burn all the food so you'll have to leave after a while instead of say throwing you out directly... and while that might have some sort of style it's illogical and this movie is riddled with similar stuff.
The film is exploitation in the tradition of Wes Craven's infamous shocker, only instead of being fun and memorable, it's just dull.
It moves on to present some fantastic scenery, having something to do with Japanese animÃ©, a kind of Miyazaki filmed with live sets instead of animated ones.
But it fails deeply in trying to produce intense drama environment, in order to pass the environmental global message; instead we get a non pretended comedic portion of film (at a certain time laughs were the most heard sounds in the room).
instead of Chicken Little and HIS accomplishments.
Watch the cartoon instead.
It felt like someone copying American sci-fi, instead of coming up with an original idea of their own.
Maggie finds strength and a new, authentic life in refusing to accompany her son and grandson to Australia, and instead returns to the sex club and kisses (and presumably falls in love with) the sex club owner, who, in response to Maggie's declaration that she likes his smile, affirming their budding closeness, says "I like the way you work."
Oh look the devil is rising tonight, oh wait no he's not, oh well let's have a bit of a wrestle instead.

1) Vega is an ugly looking Japanese guy instead of a handsome Spainard.

So instead of properly making a Street Fighter movie, the filmmakers behind this opted to make a prequel to what the audience would care about.
I gave two stars instead of one for guts.
Ms. Barrington should have played the lead instead of playing the belly dancing stripper.
What I found instead (in repeat episodes that focused on a serial mangler and a deranged racist) was a puerile, unrelenting torrent of violence and sadism.
Do yourself a favour, instead of watching this movie, do something a lot more entertaining than watching this horrendous piece of junk movie, such as gnawing of each of your digits one by one, or, say, slamming your head as hard as you can into a the frame of a car door and then subsequently closing the door on your head as hard as you can over and over.
I consider this merely because the only audience this film seems aimed at are fans of graphically displayed and unabashedly lewd sex acts, yet since this film doesn't quite go the XXX distance, it seems silly that anyone in that demographic would seek this out instead of opting for a purely pornographic offering.
At one point, she does something that told me "This is a character that was written for Jennifer Aniston, but there was a schedule conflict, so they asked RenÃ© Zellweger instead."
The conflict is introduced in the beginning of the second act, instead of at the start the picture.
Go buy Ninja Terminator instead.
Suddenly she just appears, wearing a mournful-yet-put-together looking black dress instead of her usual MC hammer style washed out jeans (in the late 90's?
This film is way better than Batman & Robin and should have been in theaters instead of B&R.
This shows that a direct to video film can be better than a theatrical release if the people working on the film care about the characters and plot instead of selling toys and being over obsessed with making the film kid friendly.
I was expecting an action/disaster movie, instead I got an overlong and often boring human drama played out between a husband and wife.
What I am commenting on however is how Gorak seems to drag out the film to make the conclusion all the more effective, and instead of causing surprise as a twist should all the ending does is leave the viewer thinking, 'Is that it?'
Unfortunately, things may not go as smoothly as Clare & Julie want and they might be the zombies' prey instead.
They cant find a moose in the city so they go to the Zoo--and decide to shoot an elephant instead.
These were good, reputable actors, relegated to a movie that relied on stunts and special effects instead of telling a story.
-This is a great movie and what Warner brothers should have made instead of that dog crap called "Batman and Robin".
Harry Cohn must have bellowed orders at someone to re make every Marilyn Monroe dance number so far on film at Fox but 'blondly' hire Betty Grable instead.

The role played by Vince Vaughn was a shallow, waste of time and the role played by Jennifer Aniston started to reciprocate in kind... it was nothing but nasty conflict... my wife and I couldn't watch the whole thing it was so snide and petty... we put in Elizabethtown instead and LOVED that... don't bother with "The Breakup"... not worth the rental fee... or time.
Vince Vaughn's a huge disappointment (he was great in 'Thumbsucker', so if you're not familiar with that film, go rent it instead).

My guess is that the director tried to please everyone with this film instead of following his vision of what the film should be.

what's weirder than that though, is how readily the building tenants accept all this nonsense, and how much they try to help instead of calling the Loony Police on Giamatti and Howard's characters.
The book had some scenes that would have made wonderful cinema such as the interogation of a murder suspect who gleefully confesses to the committing the crime but claims to have used a rifle instead of a knife, the surprise reception for Chee at his first session as a healer, the discovery of the true identity of the shotgun artist, Leaphorn's rescue of Chee that unintentionally delivers him into the hands of the real murderer, and the ironic circumstances that rescue Chee for the second time.

"Hit Me" is a show of mediocre style instead of things that most people like in movies: good characters, exciting plot, witty dialogue, things like that.
Supporting characters rage about for no apparent reason, constantly entering and exiting the plot with no apparent motivation; and we are supposed to believe (and the plot hinges) on the concept that the entire village would be outraged that a man would use trained monkeys to pick olives for a harvest that last but three days a year instead of hiring locals is a stretch even by Disney standards (and this is the studio that convinced us a boy could turn into a dog and a car could have a mind of its own).
Given the cheesy blue screen work (a montage P-Town scenes behind an actor as he marches/struts in place instead of actual film of the actor walking down a street), I should not have expected much, but this disappointed even my limited hope.

Thought the characters and the dialogue were fantastic...very clever...left the theater wondering why Hollywood continues to feed us junk these days instead of creative writing like this!
I think this is also a film that clearly had no art direction and it offends the chronological senses even worse than Hercules and Xena to the point at which you began to think the entire thing took place in a world of cheesey movie sets instead of some time in our distant past.
At one point a character falls off a cliff and instead of trying to help him the girl he is with runs miles back to the camp to tell the others that he has fallen off a cliff.

I really liked how she changed the lyrics to make the song more appropriate for someone her age: instead of singing "you're the best man I've ever known," she changed it to "you're the best friend", which I thought was very classy and smart, making her rendition more than just a young kid trying to sing about things she couldn't possibly know about.

It's perfectly cast, and instead of concentrating on every minute detail that made the book a joy to read, it concentrates solely on the boy- meets-girl-out-of-time concept, and plays out a love story over an evening-sized slice of time.

The subjects could easily have been seen as victims, but instead they were empowered to tell their own stories within the framework of the filmmaker's profound storytelling vision.
It pays off but in the negotiations Amiel is all but dropped from the project, instead opting for a better known and more experienced Director.
I liked the way this film merely touched upon characters in Hollywood at the time instead of pointing them out so blatantly and giving them cameo appearances as 'Sunset Blvd' did.
Amiel hoped to direct it, but it is directed instead by Von Ellstein (Ivan Triesaut - a kind of clone of Josef Von Sternberg).

Sure, some of the fun of watching bad movies derives from the horrible acting, but eventually the lack of any remote skill becomes tiresome instead of amusing.
Much fun has been made of the numerous permutations that Dracula vs. Frankenstein and other Independent International pictures went through before reaching the big screen; instead, Sherman and Adamson should be applauded for their dedication and persistence in sticking with these films and working on them until they got them right.
You can't really judge Dracula Vs. Frankenstein by standard film criteria, instead you just need to sit back & enjoy the ride because I personally think this film is great fun to watch.
My opinion: the movie has got a very solid potential to be one of the most powerful sci-fi drama, but instead, it turns into a nasty piece of cinema.
The film however...I'm not one to compare a book to it's film because they are two different mediums and are not meant for comparison, however for any of you who desire to see this film I suggest you step back with your hands out and get the book instead.
The film serves as a battleground for philosophical arguments making comments without forcing an opinion instead preferring that we ourselves decide what to make of the satire... Exposing themes to think about, significant prediction, liberalism of society, sexual acts gaining acceptance, violent films in higher degree, alcohol-currently legal, accounts for many acts of violence, crime out of control, violence in schools, television, illustrating the inconstant nature of public opinion, raising questions, themes and ideas that many people would prefer not to confront...
That's the question Haggis tries to answer, but instead of criticizing the armed forces per se, he follows the gradual downfall of Hank's beliefs: early in the film, he chastises a man for hanging the American flag upside down (a gesture that reflects the movie's message: the situation is worse than imagined), only to question his blind trust in society as his investigation comes closer to its harrowing solution.
We wanted to believe Iraq was somehow linked to the terrible crime inflicted on us, but our early hoped for retribution has instead come up against a completely different reality: no weapons of mass destruction, and a lengthening war no one wants.

Try a nice orange soufflÃ© instead, or just get some sleep.
If you never watched Prince&I,you really should do whatever you can think of instead of watching this.
(She would be my reason for giving this movie a 2 instead of 1) She was the best person of the movie, she at least had a bit of personality.

Edvard, trying to "do what's right for the people," continues wedding preparations to marry Kirstin instead of Paige.
Perhaps the reason this film works so well is that instead of dealing with the usual tropes, De Villa restricts his story to three individuals who are suffering isolation in the noise and autonomy of New York City and are thus 'adrift' in a life that seems flat and without a beacon of hope.
Commendably, the subtitles were black-outlined for legibility, so one could focus on reading those instead of looking at boring full frontal nudity and sexual acts.
Joe plays a jingle writer who dreams of being a serious musician, even though all of his "serious" songs still sound like extended jingles, and the classical piece he composes to show off his true talent would be better suited for a group of musical saw players instead of an orchestra.
i can't watch this movie without becoming totally entranced and still think about my lost love often...the music is just beautiful and so moving and joe brooks is funny and charming...shelley hack is very lovely and does a great job with her winning smile and poignant tears as she says goodbye instead of goodnight in LA...  well, i'm going back East in March and we'll see if maybe one can go back again...i may even move there, since i can't seem to get him out of my heart...it's been a part of me since i was 16 and the strangest thing is the movie came out a few months after i met him in Disneyland and i flew back to Boston to see him shortly thereafter...we've been trying ever since off and on...
It looks like they forgot to pick one, instead they ended up with a disjointed mash up of one-liners mixed into stupid plot devices.

i mean if he wanted to be this pollen/honey collector, the story could have evolved to something more meaningful instead of this.

(And by the way, if you love the production design and atmosphere of the film, and wouldn't mind seeing something with a similar mood, but serious instead of a surrealistic "black comedy" like Delicatessen, check out David Cronenberg's Spider (2002)).

Viewers are probably supposed to see this as shrouded in mystery but instead, the sentiment is that the writers failed to flesh out these things.
(colin welland, who plays willie,in an interview at the time said that the play challenged the actors as well).it could have foundered instead it draws you in until you only see children.children who are by turns nasty,nice,scared,brave,stupid, clever,bloodthirsty and imaginative.one of the best scenes remains when three of the children play mums and dads-adults playing children playing adults-pure genius.
I strongly recommend that anyone considering seeing this movie should NOT see it instead.
Main character girl instead of traditional male: nice twist.
She is a former lover of Roderick, instead of a childhood friend.
First, they thought they were arrested for shoplifting, instead the clerk was shot to death.

This is a quiet, thoughtful movie and it took me a while to get into it, perhaps simply because I approach French movies with a certain amount of suspicion, which is why I gave it a 7 instead of an 8.
Because he has so much love for her, Dracula cannot bring himself to drink her blood, and instead fathers her child, named Janus.
Some of Dracula's enemies try to kill him, but, accidentally kill the newborn Janus instead.
As Bloom, Brody is a fine match for Weisz, doing a gentle comedic take on the soulful characters he does so well as he finds himself falling in love with Penelope, longing for an "unscripted life" instead of living just to populate the elaborate, "Russian-novel"-like con games created by older, craftier brother Stephen (Mark Ruffalo, an endearingly scruffy rogue).
I would also like to comment that the DVD has the best behind- the-scenes featurette of any DVD I've seen; instead of a hodgepodge of scenes from the movie you just watched, it's sincere, fun fly-on-the- wall hand-held footage of the actors and crew hard at work.

Ioana Moldovan is an attractive woman, and perform well as Isabelle Benny, the prince's love interest while wondering as a young man in Paris, however, she looks more like a tramp, instead of the supposedly poor and simply dressed French girl.
This movie is made for people who use their brains, and is seeking some answers to the world main questions.If you are wild about action, guns, sf or horror i assure you that you won't find these elements in it but instead it is a great psychological trip in a personal view.And I could say that the movie is more than a personal introspection into the character's body, is made to satisfy all categories of ages and is trying to measure what is worthing to do in life.It is a great gift that has been given by a great mind, Sergiu Nicolaescu.
The game play is easy to pick up since their isn't any combos instead you press one button to punch and another for a different attack, Story mode has you playing as the Marvel heroes doing a number of missions.
But, instead Nancy begins to seduce them, while also turning Gianna and Marco against each other through cunning manipulation..but, while quite drawn to Nancy, neither actually ever trusts her.
Oh but wait, she slashes her wrists instead!
It reads, 'Trust No One' instead of 'The Truth Is Out There'.
All in all the songs are nice including "Drink to me only with thine eyes" it looked like she was singing that to herself instead of her loving husband if you ask me.

I liked how the heroine actually investigates quite a bit throughout the movie instead of just getting the conclusions laid out for her in front of her eyes.
Baddies often walk away from you instead of engaging in combat.
You would be hard pressed to find any better looking native girls going around topless and mostly bottomless anywhere( and they actually *hate* wearing western style clothes!-great scene there)  This movie is mostly a "Tarzan" adventure about a boy lost in the Amazon(no plug intended) rain forest that was brought up by natives instead of apes.
It sounds like they are trying so hard to create the perfect accent, but end up sounding cold and mechanical instead.
I think the rating should have been R instead of NC-17.I have seen R rated movies much worse than this picture.Rent this movie right away!
From what I've been told it had enough trouble being shown in it's country of origin thanks mainly to mainstream cinemas continually refusing to show mature movies with substance instead preferring to pander to one particular and constant demographic.
And why not just go for an Aussie or an American, instead of trying to make one of them into another?
Finally- a true independent film that believes that well developed characters, realistic dialogue, and a true to life story make a good film instead of explosions and potty humor.
Avoid this one, and if you're a big Misty Mundae fan see SpiderBabe or Lust for Dracula instead.
It just has nuances  This might be seen as total contrast to many Hollywood action movies, who instead indulge themselves in personal feelings of the protagonists, and even heighten them technically, in order to manipulate the audience to co-feeling.
I guess the director intended to make his characters mysterious but instead they came out to be unnatural.
It's a charming albeit pretty frank theme expertly handled by Lubitsch, slyly toying with his audience as usual, though I suppose if he could come back today and re-make it that any charm would be lost in graphic scenes of sex and violence Â back then it was discipline that was required instead.
I've started viewing more and more drama instead of just lame Hollywood blockbuster action flicks, but this movie was extremely boring and slow.
One of the only cannibal flicks to come out of Italy in the late 70's, early 80's which was not set in the jungle, but instead in some American city!
(aka: Cannibal Apocalypse)  Finally an uncut version instead of the bastardized VHS tape that Vestron put out so many years ago.
This is a movie that follows a lot of the conventions of a zombie movie, the main difference being that instead of being dead, these flesh-eaters are alive, just taken over by a virus that turns them into deranged cannibals.
So if you're tired of all those "half naked cannibals eating human flesh and slaughtering animals in the jungle"-flicks, and if Umberto Lenzi's "Nightmare City" (1980) just made you laugh instead of anything else, then go watch Antonio Margheriti's "Cannibal Apocalypse" (aka "Invasion of the Flesh Hunters").
There is no undertone of despair as there is in so many forties noirs, there is instead the whiff of corrupt wealth and fame, which was so fifties.
Poor editing, and transitions from old to new footage (and vice-versa), horribly redone gags, Moe treating diaper Joe like a delicate 2 year old instead of cracking his skull like he did with Shemp & Curly.
Essentially a revved-up sci-fi version of High Plains Drifter with 80s teens and the cute young spirit of vengeance driving the Mad Max Interceptor instead of riding into town on a horse, The Wraith is one I've remembered fondly since first seeing it on Monstervision with Joe Bob Briggs in the 90s.
- Why couldn't I get the car instead of his brother?
What instead happens is the viewer gets attacked by flaming egos not seen since "Brown Bunny," I can only assume the script writing process involved asking a depressed 15 year old to recant what he would of done in his moments of social failure, whilst mixing in lines rejected from "Mall Rats".
No, instead of using logic, he simply drops his pants and proceeds to hump the zombie.
Bottom Line: Don't Rent, Don't Buy, If it's on cable late at night watch an infomercial instead.
That would've at least made for some sort of enjoyment instead of the utter torture of this (high school) student film.
Malena has grown hatred for his father, for he served under Anti-Communist Dictatorship of the Argentinian army to quench the communist movement torturing thousands of innocents, instead of looking after his family.
She was so stiff, and something about her grin instead of a smile, just seemed unrealistic, and it just rubbed me the wrong way.
The reason I gave this awful film a 4 instead of a 1 is the wonderful cinematography.
Historically it's complete rubbish, of course (and why is *D'Artagnan* always the one who ends up with a daughter instead of a son?
Should have been rated PG-13 instead.
But instead of coming alone, she shows up with her husband (Eddie Murphy) and her children.
Films like these really bother me because they have such potential for greatness, but then take a left turn somewhere instead of staying on the right track.
In that case, the subtleties are important: the richnesses of character aren't there to define a person, instead to indicate a world, many worlds as candidates for the one world that is true.
So, instead of a dry detective story the thrill of international race car driving, romance of cloak and dagger, and comedy of human nature is put into one story, Speed Racer.
But Dog Wonder's malfunctions always hindered Big Citys hero instead of helping him.
It's good to see other people commenting about the film's interesting qualities instead of reading comments that they felt ripped off that it wasn't about cannibals or full of tense scary scenes.
Anyway, Mulder is called in to help talk to Duane because of his "special" background and instead Mulder ends up buying into Duane's "delusion" which we will later find out was true.
Almost every major character in here is so well done that you think they had 20 attempts to get it perfect instead of the 3 or 4 that the budget would allow.
Amy succumbs so easily to the coach's advances that her character should have been made to be six years old instead of thirteen, and even then, a 6 yr old would've run like crazy.
They should make you watch Witness and that Jennifer Connelly movie with the double ended dildo and The Ice Storm before you hit puberty instead of crap like this.
The action also seems more realistic than most films, a no point do our heroes go in all guns blazing instead they negotiate with the criminals until they are ready to go in stealthily.
This film is full of gun humor without being overtly violent, and yet when it does pull the violence trigger, usually gets laughs instead of blood.
What could have been a decent homage to Hitch, is instead, a direct descendant of John Hughes.
It's generally difficult to create such suspense under the restrictions of a PG-13 rating (do not watch this at the theater between 7-9 PM to avoid the loud middle school crowd), but instead of just trying to shock, the film conveys paranoia and fright through the use of mood and mere suggestions of menace.
It leads me to wonder why Hollywood continues to pump out absolute garbage like the Saw trilogy, Hostel, and Dead Silence when they could be making movies like this instead.
Renee Humphrey as Trish was good, they almost cast Jennifer Love Hewitt instead, but she seems too cute and innocent to play that part.
The bushland could have become key element in this story but instead it's relegated to running time material.
While France rolled over and most Europeans were left to define themselves as humans instead of citizens, the English really turned to film as a nation.
i was so looking forward to this film... methought the title held much interesting promise... i was cozy to it at first, however, as the film progressed, I couldn't understand why the director chose to propagandize rather than tell a story depicting the human condition... all the material was there to tell a great story of two peoples, but instead the director prostituted himself to covert politics instead of the art of storytelling... too bad.... the content turned me off as i was never given a chance to make my own mind up, but rather I was constantly told how to 'feel and think' about the story's dilemma... the director missed a great artistic opportunity... that's why i'm giving it a score of 1(awful)...but I did like the score!
This series was rich with spin-offs, potential movies - a never-ending cash cow, and yet it ended abruptly after wasting an entire season devoping Ezri instead of tying up the loose ends.
instead of attempting to escape from the pigs on his bike, the scene with the guv, his brother and the other drivers would be a great opening instead we get a boring ass bit that introduces hell as a soldier instead of an outlaw so now he's just a slacker jarhead an insult to the book i hope someday someone makes a new version that's actually true to the story cuz that would be a great movie
No, this is not the novel's violent last-of-the-Hell's-Angels anti-hero, but instead a pretty mild military boy who's, well, kind of cocky I guess, and, uh, likes to ride a dirt bike... (cue faux expectant look).
What we get instead is mostly some people riding around the country and encountering dangerous situations that could be successfully transplanted to any time period.
But I have to say that if you insist on watching a movie where the main characters venture out from one of the remaining safe pockets of humanity in a dangerous post-apocalyptic world in their heavily armored, missile-firing truck, and occasionally drive dirt bikes out of the back of it, you would do much better to watch George Romero's "Land of the Dead" instead.
Then suppose Hook decided not to kill Peter but to steal his son's affections instead ?
An executive decision to put the film on the silver screen instead of straight-to-video or leave it for the time slot on television shows how good this really is.
The right thing for WB to have done was to have these amazingly talented people work on the live action version of the Batman movies after Burton left but instead they got Schumacher and we all know what happened after that.
We have well established bad guys instead of just having a guy escape from prison, we have strong inner-conflict dilemmas and very well drawn action scenes.
Hollywood may be comprehending that the movies with political and war subjects saturated the taste and they left the unhappiness from North American people satisfied.The ones who are already convinced do not need any more; and the ones which match with the aggressive foreign policy from the United States will not stop supporting the "pro-America" practices.However, that has not stopped many filmmakers from looking for new material; in other words, they are more interested to focus on the peripheral aspects of war, instead than focusing on the war itself.
Such ventures into the often complex and extremely conflicted area of politics, war and current social prejudices are subsequently left alone by those the film ostensibly tries to draw in (those looking for intelligent, insightful political drama) and instead adopted and loved by people riveted by your average Michael Bay movie.
But it all comes down to a boring script that just drags along instead of someone editing half the movie out..and moving forward past the Paris contest.. which is sad because this story could have been so much more but as they always say.. it's the script, script, script... and this one sticks with no connection to the characters it is so flat.
But this film is more drama/realistic and made me actually think about life instead of tuning it out.
To be fair to the latter, her character was a walking clichÃ© who, instead of developing a relationship with the Freddie Rodriguez role, which might have been interesting, falls inevitably into the arms of Mr. Pine.
This time, Coens' usual collaborator, Roger Deakins was not director of photography, instead, Emmanuel Lubezki, four times Oscar Nominee (for Children of Men, The New World, Sleepy Hollow, and A Little Princess) took care of camera-work.
If I had a chance to think, instead of enjoying "Burn," I would have contemplated MoliÃ¨re and Evelyn Waugh, their comedies of manners, psychological insight, and unbridled great humor.
But instead, it is small things.
Somehow the beauty of hand-drawn animation manages to capture a humanity in characters and landscapes that you simply can't get with a computer - it turns the film into a work of art instead of just a movie.
So in Twist, they have built on the second one instead of ignoring it, as I had expected them to do.
The Prince, instead of being a personality-free, rhino-hating, long-eyelashed nobody like he was in II, is now a really nice, humble, long-eyelashed main character with a really modern and less formal attitude.
This story builds Cinderella into a determined young woman instead of a poor house maid and gives Anastasia a chance to do what is right.
Unlike the animators from the original film the amazing animators at DisneyToon Australia worked from their own imaginations instead of relying on live-action "reference" film.
I was expecting some cheesy romantic line here, but instead he goes, "Well, I still want to f*ck you...I sure as h*ll don't wanna f*ck Thelma anymore though!"
Here, instead, some of the Romans have (very modern) beards, they would not have had in that period.
Middle Eastern or early medieval type tunes may have been similar, or at least would have fitted into a proper historical film, instead of some weird new age pseudo Native American wailings.
But instead of staying with the auction all the time, we flash back to the creation of the violin in 17th century Italy and then follow it as it makes its way through an 18th century Austrian monastery/orphanage, a violinist in 19th century Oxford and China during Mao's Cultural Revolution... Each time it brings the person who owns it a lot of fame, but also bad luck and despair, often resulting in the death of the owner or someone the owner really loves...  What I appreciated in this movie is that it wasn't just an ordinary drama or thriller.
Another thing that I also really liked was the fact that not every detail of the movie was clear until the end (for instance why the fortune teller's predictions come true, but not for the woman, but for the violin instead.).
The mother spurns Lim, sending her home when she visits the town, but The-en instead takes her to his apartment, where she stays, happily, until her father comes to take her home to her mother's deathbed.
Makes us want to become the hero instead of the villain or the loser who gets dumped in the end.
Another good thing about it is that instead of fighting and finishing one campaign at a time, you switch off between missions between factions.
But finding a real martial art, instead of a saccharine watered down version that is a total waste of time and money, is not easy!
It's a pity John Guilgud wasn't used instead of Ms Hannah.
In closing, let me just debunk a review here which commented on the other users' comments instead of commenting on the movie (and I'm committing the same crime now), but The Echo is at the very least a decent ghost movie...to call it "half-decent" is already being silly.
For me, what soured it was the fact that i could predict what was going to happen and instead of being immersed in the story, i found myself recognizing every camera trick and cut that was used in the filming!
When, after watching an episode, you find yourself discussing what could have been instead of discussing what just happened, you know what the fate of the show is going to be, and that's what happened!
Some element of sexual violence can't make this film sexy like "Cat People" (in this case, we get middle-aged Bell instead of sexy Simone Simone), and the exotic locale isn't up to "Zombie" par either.
With sounds and shadows instead of special effects and really packs a wallop by doing it.
I could see the sub-text of 'pity this poor deluded girl' but I instead chose to ignore it and applaud the young woman's decision to work her way through all those men.
I think they tried way too hard to make the film artsy and give it an indy vibe, but instead it came across as very amateurish.
I did have a few ideas for a sequel, though: the disease is spread by kittens and victims transform into big, cuddly kittens that like to play and frolic instead of eating human flesh.
It was very Indie-looking from the beginning, with gritty film stock and no-name actors, but after worrying for the first few minutes that this could mean "cheesy", I realized that the film felt authentic instead.
The characters are not idiots, and what a pleasure it was to see people react to danger in a way that you would like to think you would too - instead of the usual imbeciles.
Also notable is his defiant decision to, rather than cut his film according to MPAA standards to give it an R rating instead of NC-17, create a ridiculously large red box to mask the sex scene in "Fiction".
Luckily, 'City of Ember' falls in closer with the former instead of the latter.
Or instead.
Watch the far superior rock music-infused crapfest Blood Tracks instead.
This also explains why the scenario for Bugs was so odd - to be the tormented instead of the tormentor.
(SPOILER)Let's face it, blackmailing Belle with the threat of her father's institutionalization is not really enough justification for Belle to call him call him a monster, and there is no reason why he could not be redeemed just like the equally selfish Beast was instead falling to his death like many Disney villains.
Only instead of a seizure.
Belle persuades the Beast to take her instead of her father, and thus the story begins.
As her father is imprisoned and sick to the bone, Belle makes a deal with the Beast to take his place instead.
She begs the Beast to set him free and take her instead, and he accepts this offer, so Belle is now his prisoner.
The girl that falls for the dumb jock instead of the guy she SHOULD have fell for, and Noah Taylor is a genius portrayal of the "boy next door."
Taking on not just an awkward role, he needed to show his anger, his teenage frustration, as well as his headiness for brains instead of brawn.
if El Duende wanted to kill his boos why not just grab a gun and shoot him, instead of putting together such a complicated and uncertain plan.
More of that kind of stuff would have made for an interesting film, but instead it's all music and not much else.
What director Michael Lindsay Hogg got instead was a documentary about a band who's best days were (unfortunately)behind them & were obviously tired of it all and each other.
If you really pay attention, this film instead shows The Beatles at their essence, brilliance with the genius touch of the renegade.
If Your Kid is getting into punk, show him 'Dogs In Space' instead.
The Anarchist's Cookbook seems doesn't seem terribly concerned about making one big statement, instead, after establishing the characters, pushes them into a situation and tests their reaction.
And how it's shaped us now, instead of hippies were anarchist.
This guy probably wouldn't be at the bottom of the pile if 1.he wasn't so hateful and 2.if he'd just admit his bias instead of unsuccessfully hiding it.
Could have been better however if it was written as a story instead of trying to make it like a Sunday Paper story.
I would have much preferred to see some rugged ruffian in the role instead (such as Ernest Borgnine or Victor Mature).
Sure, there were a few nice attempted murders here and there (cool) but not enough to make the film seem "actiony"--instead, it was much too much like a stuffy costume drama much of the time.
Mr. Harold Foster's excellent draftsmanship, combined with the use of printed text of story and dialog printed under the illustrations, instead of the use of "Word Balloons" gave the strip an appearance of a History Book that's come to life.
When Bert offers her his paper clip collection, she doesn't laugh, but instead she recognizes that it's one of his favorite possessions and she is honored that he would offer it to her.
This is why it is genuinely moving, instead of tacky, when Goldblum resigns to Davis with a regretful and yet matter-of-fact air that "(he is) an insect who dreamt (he) was a man, and loved it.
There's something present here that is totally lacking in nearly every horror movie of the 1970s and 80s and that's pathos , we feel sorry for Brundle as he has his genes spliced and starts to mutate into Brundlefly and in many ways the movie feels more like an update of James Whale's FRANKENSTIEN or a remake of THE WOLF MAN featuring an insect mutation instead of lycanthropy .
It is really underrated because mostly people gave it an 8 instead of 10 out of 10 and it should be on the IMDb top 250.
The bottom line is that the stars of this film made much better films and you should see them instead.
Whereas most western movies have the hero triumph over evil, giving him the kingdom and the girl in the process as a reward, here there is a twist; the hero defeats the villain, but chooses not to take the kingdom OR the girl, choosing instead to maintain his honor.
If you want to see a movie about swindlers, watch "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" instead.
The film SHOULD have ended with Gable's final scene but instead has an ending that immediately follows it that just seems tacked on and unsatisfying.
And please, everyone read the book instead of seeing the movie.
An unconvincing time distortion (for want of better words) works it's way into the story that I felt took away from the plot instead of adding depth to it.
Question number two: why does he watch her behind the two-way mirror instead of taking her himself?
Director Bill Melendez and Phil Roman, working from a very warm and witty script by Charles M. Schulz, expertly craft a sensationally breezy and snappy 25-minute cartoon romp that brims over with engaging characters (Linus in particular really shines as he explains the historical significance of Thanksgiving in fascinatingly thorough detail), deliciously dry humor, and a spot-on relevant message about the true meaning of Thanksgiving (it's all about friends and family instead of food).
As Peppermint Patty and friends arrive, she's disappointed at getting popcorn, toast, pretzels, and jellybeans instead of turkey, mashed potatoes, and pumpkin pie.
This crazy unreal colour scheme should alienate but instead like some drug pulls you in.
Instead of going into much detail about why the film works, I'll instead try to explain what it meant to me personally.
Featuring the glacial blonde Ann Todd(then Mrs. David Lean) as the real-life accused murderess Madeleine Smith, the film skillfully portrays the travail a foolish and willful young woman goes through when she follows her heart instead of her head and gets ensnared in a sticky situation.
L'Anglier was planning on marrying into the upper class lifestyle and insists instead that she tell her father (Leslie Banks) about their relationship.
I'd rather follow an antÂ´s trail straight to their home instead of watching this crap again or any similar attempt to kill the most insignificant sense of film appreciation in a moviegoer.
now in the age of 65, he's living a lonely life only to enjoy himself with women and girls of different types, finally he found the true love with Bothayna (Hend Sabry) and suffering from the annoying of his half mad sister Dawlat (Essad Youniss) ..  - Haj Azzam (Nour El Seriff): An old tycoon started from zero, wanted to play a politic role but was lost and surrendered in the middle of corruption that rules the game of politics ..  - Taha (Mohamed Emam): a low level young man failed to achieve his dream to become a police officer, instead he joined a radical cell who doesn't really understood the true meaning of the great religion of Islam and became a terrorist and finally died while trying to kill the police officer who once tortured him when he was captured and jailed ..  - Bothayna (Hend Sabry): a poor girl who was forced to become a whore serving the ugliest kinds of people to have the money to live and finally found Zaki El Dissouki who gave her the power and the true meaning of love and finally married him - Hatem Rasheed (Khaled El Sawy): A great chief editor in the journal d'Egypt magazine who is living his life as a desperate homosexual and trying to find a guy to satisfy his sick needs and tends ..  A strange mix of characters which were perfectly managed by a strong story and a great and promising director (Marawan Hamed) Really a worthy movie to be seen as it reflects a hard criticism to some corrupted situations of politics, sexual lives and terrorism *** Lo'ay
But instead it's a somewhat sprawling 172 minutes and feels at times like a smashed-together telenovela.
The one obvious opportunity to display any kind of emotion was when she discovered that she had been conned by a trusted friend, but no, an expression of anger seemed to be too difficult, so instead we get nothing.
The original blind dead also drank their victims' blood in order to gain eternal life, whereas these guys are fans of gang-rape instead.
At least these movies still had a bit of style over them and got shot at location instead of in a studio or in the garden of one of the cast-members.
And search for the answers (if you need them) among the walls and halls of the block - instead of inside hardly transparent mind of a man.
The whole thing with Royd's "mother" was badly handled - in the book, she was sinister and creepy, terrifying and powerful, here she's kinda creepy and somehow pathetic, instead of tragic and still sympathetic as she is in the book.
Definitely a rare and wonderful find for a movie which includes a cast of REAL (instead of hired hearing-actor-pretending-as-a-deaf-person actors that you see sometimes in films!)
And if you think you could do better-- move out to LA and make your movie instead of working at the Grab and Gulp.
After the zillionth empty threat instead of thinking he's risking losing a good girl (like the script would want us to believe), I got the idea she was JUST as unprincipled and manipulative as the rest as she definitely STAYS to the end.
There was real scope here for a wittier script, instead it all got rather tedious, 30 minutes could easily have been lopped off the running time.
But, March and the rest try to show him understanding instead of turning the brat over to the FBI!!
The writer, Stephen Sustarsic, has done a great job of summarising it without including spoilers, so I will try to give you a feel for the movie instead of a synopsis.
For me, it made the ending fuzzy and gray instead of a bold clear contrast which made the rest of the movie gripping and powerful.
They should have the scale be a zero on this movie, because I would rather put that instead of a one (because it doesn't even amount to a one).
All in all, Tangents falls in the same general category of MST3Ked films as Overdrawn at the Memory Bank; a small budget film that is ridiculous enough on its own merits to make it a decent watch for lovers of pure cheese (though, as always, I recommend watching the MST3K version instead).
