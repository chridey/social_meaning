So I was apprehensive about this one, and humor is often difficult to appreciate (uh, enjoy) decades later.
Cowboy movie actor, Cameron Mitchell, turns in an equally strong performance as piano player, Johnny Alderman, who leaves Etting, out of disgust for the way she is being dominated, only to encounter her years later, when the two of them are working on a movie.
She won a few years later for I WANT TO LIVE...also, someone said her voice was dubbed for I'LL CRY..not so.
Two cops kill a guy, and put in some framing guns, though later they just shoot people for fun.
It wasn't until I saw it many, many years later and had gone through a lot of living that I comprehended the true magnitude of his performance.
A few moments later, Goldie gets up and walks about with a huge hole in her body--so big you can see right through her!!
Years later...
Seven years later, Helen is now an obese, depressed woman, and is arrested and placed in a mental institution.
Madeline's career on Broadway ends, and 14 years later she is still struggling with her fading looks and bygone acting career.
Years later she becomes a bloated whale - a shell of her former self - living in total abandon, watching Madeline's movies obsessively, seething in hatred, until she is evicted from her apartment and has a brilliant idea while in a mental facility: she must eliminate Madeline.
A marvelous setup that until this point in the story works, but one which later takes a left turn to be overcome by silly fight scenes and cartoonish special effects that recall Tim Burton circa 1987.
And, when he later kills, you really understand with and could possibly condone why he did this.
In the beginning, they count 191 steps to the bottom of the shaft to the lab, but later, it's just a homemade ladder about 12 feet long.
Actually, this is an excellent, character driven horror movie made by the creators of Hill Street Blues, which aired 2 years later.
This had been shown on late-night Italian TV some years back and, later, I recall it being mentioned favorably online; hence, given its theme of an updated version of Jack The Ripper and the fact that it starred Euro-Cult icon Paul Naschy, I decided to check it out this time around.
Young's acting tends to be underrated because of her later work as a television hostess but even her film work as a teenager was extraordinary.
She was an especially good casting choice because the repressed Rachel needs to subtly convey a depth and dimensionality early in the film to make her later transformation plausible.
Bill Holden called this his "smiling jim" period which ended with Sunset Boulevard a year later.
Bluteau does a great job with his character as a Jesuit Priest and I believe that watching this will boost my knowledge of the Jesuits and will help me later on with the AP History test.
The F&I War was pretty dang big, cost enough money to cause the American Revolution a few years later, and ended in a gargantuan battle where the British won because the kill ratio was 3 dead French/allies for every 2 British/allies.
Brian Moore grew up in Northern Ireland and considered joining the priesthood before he moved to Canada and abandoned his Catholic religion later in life.
If you like Paul Verhoeven's later work (Robocop, Total Recall, Black Book), you should take the time to delve into his Dutch language work.
Days later imagery is still flooding back to you -- feelings -- ideas -- and of course questions...
He has journeyed away from the "pleasures of the flesh," lingering on the sight of a couple making love in the communal tipi and later admitting to Daniel that he, LaForgue, lusts after the young Alogonquin woman,Annuka, with whom Daniel had already struck up a sexual relationship.
It is so side splittingly funny, even 10 years & countless repeats later, that you hurt laughing while watching it.
Moments later, the scene segues into the poppy-reddened fields of their epitaph.
Years later he refuses to vote guilty while a member of the jury in murder trial, and this story explains why.
Laura feels the presence of other persons in the house and months later, the desperate Laura invites a team of parapsychologists to try to unravel the mystery.
Unsurprisingly, the film faced censorship problems with its seduction (and later sex) scenes involving a nun and an under-aged shepherd boy!
About a month later, they returned, during the day, and robbed me at gunpoint in front of literally dozens of witnesses.
He accepted this challenge by co-writing and directing another very successful film 'Two Moon Junction', released two years later.
(They were married soon afterwards, and background publicity fostering an unlikely rumour that this scene was not simulated probably helped this) Two years later came 'Wild Orchid 2 - Two Shades of Blue', released in 1989.
Unlike these later short productions, Wild Orchid 2 succeeds in involving the viewer in a story that is sufficiently disturbing to provide genuine emotional impact.
First, when Sister Maria seduces and later stabs Marcelo to death.
The scene is weird because it makes you wonder how would it be if a nun "like that" would seduce you, and later, it grosses you out.
Fearing the little buggers, he washes it down the drain but later it appears but at a slightly larger size.
Today, 40 years later I still think about it and check to see if the spot is still there.
The movie "Then Came Bronson" later landed Parks a popular TV show of the same name in the 60's.
Although he later went on to play this roguish character to perfection in films like Red Dust and Gone with the Wind, here it has a nasty quality that brings out a new side to his acting.
Well, Lora meets a handsome, injured bootlegger while working in emergency, who plays in this film later as she gets involved working duty caring for two sick little girls (who actually looked quite healthy to me!)
Capping it all off, Barbara exits the film with her new boyfriend, an unrepentant & unpunished crook involved in everything from thievery to murder, a situation certainly not allowed just a few years later.
There are a few cast members in it who went on to bigger and better things, notably Meg Foster and Bruce Dern; also the director Quentin Masters would later score a sexploitation hit with the Joan Collins movie The Stud.
They're picked up by road-racers Smitty (Bruce Dern) and Simp (Larry Hankin) who threatens them with a switchblade; later they hitch a lift from an embittered woman (Joyce Van Patten) who has hated hippies since her daughter ran away to become one; another time Chay finds herself being ogled by a middle-aged trucker (Mike Conrad); and in their final "thumb trip", they find themselves travelling with dysfunctional husband-and-wife alcoholics (Mariana Hill and Burke Burns).
A later sequence has this odd threesome repeated as Jean observes her and Vincent making love from a distance.
Now, 12 years later, I have gotten the DVD (after a lot of struggle...) and re-watched it.
Months later, while Jean is never found, we see Marie reacting as though he still exists.
That, the initial meeting of the two leads, their first skirmish with the Iron Boat gang, and much later, the remote inn that they 'rent' for a month to set up an elaborate ambush, and lastly, the lair of the gang, where SUN builds up to and sustains a lengthy climax, demonstrates a lot of imagination.
(PS: Consider a quarter century later the Japanese were making films along the same line, ie.
One of my favorite scenes is about the reason for taking off shoes before going into the house - it's basically so you leave the world and it's chaos outside your sanctuary and not to avoid getting dirt that can be vacuumed up later.
20 years later the devil returns to claim retribution.
Delaney's performance is quite bad, but Oscar material compared with the work of her supportive colleagues, including Matthew Lillard; who would reach somewhat of a star-status later with the utterly retarded "Scooby-Doo" movies.
Though, even then it would have probably gotten dull sooner rather than later due to its one-joke premise.
She leaves, along with Weller's extremely dimwitted kid to stay at a hotel (only to pop up later in the movie scantily-clad back in her hotel or in a dream sequence in order to meet some strange 80s boob quota I suppose).
Its hard to gauge just how big this thing is supposed to be until it decides to crawl up under the covers in Weller's bed later, apparently he's the size of a tomcat.
10 minutes later I am screaming like a wild woman being attacked by the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
Fast forward 4 years later, after seeing this film, and looking for work in the music business, I got the chance to co-direct a show for the school, and for all the hard work I put into that, was (methaphorically) thrown under the bus by the institution.
but especially later in the film, his confidence stumbles and he turns into the flip-side of the typical Arnold Schwarzenegger action hero.
He goes to a South American country to participate in a mission that would supposedly rescue a Cabinet Minister and a few other hostages, but later on he finds out that he's been set up and it was actually a mission to destroy a rebel base that would've invaded sooner or later.
What Predator does do, very effectively, I think, is that it has the guys fighting some very human enemies, which allows the movie to later take its sweet time in having them realize that the new enemy is not human at all.
The first deaths suggest vengeance if not some sort of ritual, but later ones suggest that the alien may be feeding off of his (or her) victims.
The one thing that still astonishes me to this day, 16 years later, is indeed the Predator.
He does, however, make an interesting visit to the hospital, as a sort of premonition to his later hits "The Kingdom 1 + 2".
Last month, I went back for my second visit, 7 years later.
As an old rock&roll road dog who played for years and later went into production and management of younger rock bands, I think this movie has a lot to say on many levels.
Much later as the tone of the film completely changes from gripping thriller to downright terror he meets Ernest Thesiger who in a remarkable performance completely dominates the last 25 minutes of the film as a very eccentric chap indeed.It is a tragedy that the director Arthur B.
Don't confuse the British "They Drive by Night" with the later US version starring Humphrey Bogart.
Here, we are told that the time-travel window to the past is just ten minutes long - something to do, we find out later, with not having enough power.
The later was one of the first attempts to rethink and reevaluate the past involvements of all layers of society in Stalin terror.
)**Why isn't this on the bottom 100 with the rest of the cr*p?I mean this was so bad,it caused my brain to hurt and bleed.Here is how it began.It picks up where the first left off.Duwayne(spelling correction)and Belial have taken a steep fall from the hotel,and the paramedics pick them up; and place them on the ambulance.They arrive at the hospital to be treated,but they don't stay for long.A person disguised as a hospital worker kidnaps them both,and puts them in a van.She turns out to be Granny Ruth,and both she and her Granddaughter,run a boarding house for freaks.They're introduced first to a three armed gargoyle,with a really bizarre laugh.They are soon introduced to other creatures who are disabled in the "looks" department.One of them looks like it had an xylophone crammed up its mouth.Why does another one look like the symbol for "The Morton Downey Jr.Show"?Its basically a really large mouth that can sing opera,as Granny Ruth demonstrates.One looks like a giant maggot with glasses,another one looks almost like Swamp Thing.There's another one that was really hairraising,and one has to ask questions.What exactly did they do to Mac Tonight?He was a half moon man, that used to be shown on older McDonalds commercials back in the late 80's and early 90's.Was this supposed to be funny?Did they have something against him?It looks like they washed his face with a cheese grater,or an SOS pad.How rude!Then Belial is introduced to a female,reptilian freak named Eve who's an invalid.They later fall in LURVE with each other.Granny says she found her lying beside the road one day.I dunno,but I think she accidently backed over Eve with a Van,while she was crossing the street.Never mind.Duwayne develops a crush on Ruth's granddaughter,Susan,but she refuses his advances.We later see three other freaks,not introduced earlier.Two of them show up in a scene,where Duwayne is examining his scars.The male freak looks like a mouse,and his wife looks like something ripped off from "Troll".Another freak that really takes the cake is the frog one.This crossed eyed thing,is seen secretly looking at the reporter.Enough about the freaks,here's what I detest about the movie SO much.First, the freaks and monstrositys look down right stupid and poorly designed.Maybe it was intentional to be funny,or maybe the costume designer has the creativity and skill of a broom handle.Second,one has to question how some of the human freaks came to be;especially the ones like the mouse and frog.The story is weak with some plot holes,and scenes don't make any sense.The mouse freak says "Uh Oh!"
Each resident takes on their own personality and even though they later turn murderous the viewer finds themselves not only sympathizing with Duane, his brother and the rest of the freaks, but you will actually find yourself rooting them on as they seek revenge against several reporters from a sleazy tabloid who threaten to expose the Bradleys as well as a sleazy old man who runs a 'freak show' and falsely claims to have captured Belail.
Not in the least of course due to the later success and cult following the first movie received.
The direction is right Â spot on; tight, befitting the excellent playing out of the dialogues and demanding great skill with the camera and later the person with the scissors.
I've read a lot of reviews and this is all that I've read as the complaints for his later stuff.
My wife and I have loved this film for years, having first seen it on the hard-to-find VHS tape, and later on the even harder-to-find LaserDisc.
So, it seems perfectly logical that later she accepts LoÃ¯c's advances.
It's impossible - for me at least - to know whether or not Ann Fontaine was familiar with Joe Orton's sixties play Entertaining Mister Sloane (subsequently filmed)before writing and directing Nettoyage a sec some thirty years later but it is reasonable to assume that the central premise - bi-sexual catalyst male enters and ultimately disrupts household via sexual encounters with both male and female - is very similar with, in the case of the latter, a Gallic twist.
There are, of course, other substantial differences, where Mr Sloane came, as it were, out of nowhere, Loic (Stanislas Merhar) is first encountered by Nicole (Miou-Miou) and Jean-Marie (Charles Berning) Kunstler in a club where he is performing a cross-dressing act with his sister Marilyn (Mathilde Seigner)and only goes to live with the Kunstlers some time later when Marilyn leaves both him and the act in favour of life with her boy friend.
What we have here is a fine, tightly written and directed script acted to perfection by the three principals and arguably the finest of Fontaines early films - Berning would later appear in her How I Killed My Father.
13 years later I had the privilege of having Sid Ceasar in my car (I was hired to take him to his hotel) and I asked him about the film.
A decent film that is head and shoulders above other Chaplin films of the time, though awfully crude when compared to his films just a few years later.
There are plenty of amusing sections: Chase fighting back fear and hysteria when he is with the kidnapping bank robbers (when he compliments the wording of the bank robbing note, the robber who wrote it thanks him); Hawn's fighting for the underdog legal practice, which results in her having a growing number of clients she is helping to get honest employment for - even in her own household; Gould's judge trying to get to the point of the ridiculous arguments and fact patterns that first Hawn and later Grodin put into his court; Grizzard's governor looking forward to dinner with his future attorney general, and his favorite dish, only to find the state's number one criminal is serving it to him.
After the very good, wacky comedy 'Foul Play (1978)', two years later Goldie Hawn and Chevy Chase would pair up again in this pleasant, light-headed farcical comedy 'Seems like Old Times'.
He was great in both "Wayne's World" movies, he was one of the reasons "Saturday Night Live" became funny again, he's always been hilarious when he's guest hosted SNL in later years, and his stand-up comedy, most especially his 1995 HBO special that aired frequently on Comedy Central, is uproariously funny.
After everyone goes home, they sit back as the tow truck gets scared out of his gas line later that night by the "Ghost Light," which is rigged up by the others to scare him.
It didn't come, and hadn't come when I walked out almost an hour later.
From there we flash forward years later to find out that one of the guys killed had a wife and son who are now being taken care of by one of the guys on the hunt.
Seven years later, his teenage nephew Derek Cowley (Trevor Duke) steals the key of his stepfather's cabin in the isolated Fire Road 13 and travels with four classmates and his friend Sam (Kimberly J.
Seven years later we witness a group of friends getting ready to spend a weekend at a remote cabin in the mountains.
I guess for me, the true sign of a good game is one that you are looking forward to continuing on with and maybe playing again at a later date.
Peter turns up in Chicago sometime later, searching for his son and staying a step ahead from the government agents that want him out of the way.
***possible minor spoiler ahead***like many people i thought Scanners(which came out 3 years later) was revolutionary.but the Fury paved the way for that film.
Losing the direct Hitchcockian references, De Palma applies a harder, leaner style to the storytelling and creates a powerful work that is less fun than his later films, but no less compelling.
Decades later a channel decides to air the show.
Watching Dirty Dancing twenty years later gives you that same feeling.
I enjoyed it in 1984 when it came out and I enjoyed it 24 years later, watching it on DVD.
This movie is up there with 80's `classics' like `Flashdance' where we find that while most of us loved the movie as kids, we see it through adult eyes twenty years later and realize what our parents probably thought: `What a crap movie.'
Kevin Bacon actually manages to make the clichÃ©d concept seem kinda cool, here showcasing an easy charm that was to become the hallmark of much of his later work.
Neither bad dubbing nor shoddy split-screen special effects can sabotage the inspired antics in "Twin Dragons," a nimbly done action farce featuring martial arts sensation Jackie Chan as identical twin brothers separated at birth but reunited year later when evil Triad mobsters try to murder one of them.
With no star names to support him, such as Rod Steiger or Martin Landau (though Raul Julia did become a star later in life), Sidney stands way above his peers.
This movie is just plain FUN--Chan as twin brothers separated at birth who reunite many years later in Hong Kong, just in time to get crossed up in a nasty mess with vicious gangsters...how can you not love this?
Many years later, when the rich and privileged Jackie returns to Hong Kong, he accidentally is mixed up for the poor one--the one that the local mob wants to kill!
The dual-based plot, (survival and escape, and later a pursuit of romance), rolls steadily through ever-changing backgrounds.
G2 has a pretty good idea (albeit though original one) with Daniel Bernhardt as a Macedonian warrior who is reincarnated 200 years later to do battle with a sinister Mongolian clan led by James Hong.
He resists, but later decides it'll take less energy to just let her have her way with him.
In the time of George McGovern's presidential bid against President Nixon, who would later resign in disgrace (lest he be impeached and thrown out of office), we had a choice.
There are other problems later in the story involving the buried wife that are also troubling.
Now, 107 years later, we can - on film or video.
Well written, and acted by a stellar cast (more on that later), it only suffers from a few minor problems that are mostly cinematic issues.
He had the opportunity to point out how lucky he was, being dropped in the early 80s, and now enjoying a hugely successful career more than 20 years later.
In the ensuing confrontation one of the men holds the big guy from behind while the other (Ariel Neel Auguste, played by Emir Kusturica) knocks the knife from his hand, picks it up, and in a kind of madness cuts the man open to see--as they later testify at the trial--whether he is really fat or just big.
Finally the captain, under the strong influence of his wife, decided not to allow this 'crime', he was arrested and later judged and killed.
The later series...
Especially well done are his sequences in Magadha with his brothers and father and his later scenes in war and the Kalinga battlefield with the remorse and repentance.I have certainly not seen anything in Indian cinema to compare with this.
However, the story flaws because Asoka's story has been made for a movie which is the only problem I have with the movie (More on this later).
Asoka's journey later continues when he is asked to leave the Kingdom of Magadha by his mother Dharma (Subhasini Ali) and for him to go in his own path.
London to Brighton forms an exciting passage of film-making out of a relatively routine idea, with guided attention toward mostly all of the characters, Stuart of which goes through his own series of frightening changes later on; awareness of how the film should 'look' at very specific points and gets the best out of a low-key cast.
The man came to grief and his cold-eyed son Stuart (Sam Spruell) comes to exact revenge; but we find this out later.
(For all you other non-Hindi speakers, "Baadshah" means King, like the one in a deck of cards) The opening dance number, Main Te Hoon Pagal, is clearly inspired by the "Cuban Pete" song from "The Mask", and later on whole scenes are copied nearly frame for frame from a couple of Jackie Chan movies: Mr. Nice Guy and Rush Hour.
Scott on a mission over Japanese held Hong Kong, where he downed Tokyo Joe, loses control of his plane and crashes and is given up for dead only to show up later alive and rescued by the local Chinese peasants.
Here he gets to show it off, and a few years later, he made his mark in television.
So apparently were women, and in the '40s, they lost the career battle, only to pick it up again a couple of decades later.
Spying on them until they get into various stages of undress then whisking them away to his secret cave for later use.
It is so poorly filmed that it makes an Ed Wood, Jr. movie or one of Oscar Micheaux's later films that are plagued by continuity problems seem masterpieces of craft in comparison.
There are two scenes I liked...early on in the bar when the "I'm an Oriental" line gets carried a bit too far and later when Bruce imagines himself as the real Bruce--Bruce Lee.
Of note is that the story is recounted in flashback much later in a sort of trial of Nobile in his home in Rome, as characters living and dead appear to confront or defend him.
In fact, the czar abdicated after World War I proved a disaster for the country, and a provisional government tried to rule as a pseudo-democracy until the Leninists took power nine months later, mainly because they promised to immediately withdraw Russia from the war.
Nancy Carroll is his faithful servant and, later on in the film, wife.
They should have examined more the relationship between Block and the killer who he arrested years before for 2 rapes as stated in the later part of the movie.
We will eagerly look forward to the DVD (US version) when it comes out later this year.
And admittedly in the later part of the almost three hour film I was fidgeting.
They said it was too soon, and thus, 16 years later, GrÃ¶ning received a call: they were ready.
This collection definitely showcases her at her best, during her later years, and the visual effects are superceded only by the music.
It's sense of humor, for those that never had the opportunity to see it, reminded me of a show that came out several years later and was quite successful, Moonlighting.
Before he died Feroze had a heart attack, and Indira and he were re-united till his death a short time later.
Many years later they meet again when she is already a big political leader.
Though Martin and Lewis had beaten them out of the top ten box office in the later years, the are still considered the best.
Nat Pendleton serves as comic foil, first as a cop on the beat and later as the hapless sergeant who can't control Costello's antics.
The "Buck Privates" theme worked so well that Abbott and Costello eventually found their way into other branches of the military, their next film was "In the Navy", followed by "Keep 'Em Flying" and "Buck Privates Come Home" a few years later.
My uncle who later served in France during the second World War was one of those whose lives was interrupted by the peace time draft before the USA entered World War II.
Their routines remain very funny more than six decades later.
Who knew that six years later Lansbury would get her turn at sloving crimes on TV's "Murder She Wrote".
Over 20 years later, I STILL love it.
I watched it twice on the Video, later I bought the DVD and have watched again a couple of times.
The banter between Johnaton Mardukas and Jack Walsh is genius and watch for Joe Pantoliano playing basically the same part he would play later on in Bad Boys.
AND a few years later, it took Quentin Tarantino to rescue Travolta's career from forever doing talking baby movies.
While the opening scenes are fairly inconsequential, there is a single close-up of Blanche Sweet's baby Â which not only elicits an emotional response, but also helps us remember the child later on.
Now nearly 30 years later, I have not seen any TV series that can top this one.
So here I am, a couple days later, writing a review in hopes of getting the word of this movie out there.
Now, almost a day later, I still feel its messages and themes rushing through me.
The thin thread that "A Crude Awakening" seems to hang its optimism on is the assumption that if enough people become fully aware of this totally unavoidable event sooner, rather than later, then human ingenuity, combined with a level of human cooperation the world has never before seen, might possibly attenuate the consequences for at least some of those who awaken.
I was perfectly content with the plot (althought it *is* a little odd, more on that later).
This may seem a small step forward in Hollywood film history, but think of the influence it may have had on directors such as Robert Altman who was praised for this type of work with "M*A*S*H", thirty years later.
Third, this film seems to have possibly been the inspiration for the later Hitchcock film, MR. AND MRS. SMITH.
In fact, they rashly decide to divorce, and a custody battle ensues over their pet terrier, Mr. Smith, the same dog who played Asta in the Thin Man series and later the bone-stealing George in Bringing Up Baby.
Grant and Irene Dunne have been married for awhile (we later learn in court that they met when both fell in love with a puppy in a pet shop), but both jump to the conclusion that the other has been having extra-marital affairs (Grant, in particular, is funny growing disgusted and angrier at Dunne's fairly blameless voice teacher Alex D'Arcy).
Much later, I had the good fortune to see it myself, at an oldies-goldies TV re-run, and it amused me like nuts.
In corresponding scenes later, Irene Dunne brilliantly plays a dumb floozie, pretending to be the husband's sister and demolishing in one evening his reputation and his prospects for marriage in respectable society.
In these later scenes, in another of the movie's nice compositional touches, she does a reprise of a hoochie musical number performed earlier by a girlfriend of her husband's, and then falls into her husband's arms, apparently drunk.
I enjoyed it so much, in fact, that I watched it again a few days later.
Some months later, back at home, Missy's old owner shows up and says everything is fine and Regina get's nothing.
Twenty years later, the scientist Anne de Carlo (Kim Delaney) is carrying out a research under the command of Miller, and the body of the dead agent is delivered for the experiment.
Barry Bostwick manages to take down and put the cocky werewolf guy in deep freeze until 20 years later when technology has advanced enough to resume the project.
20 years later at the "U.S. Secret Operations Center," a group of doctors experimenting with synthetic, metallic skin are given the frozen cadaver as a test subject, resulting in a red-eyed creature that looks like a cross between PREDATOR, Sonic the Hedgehog and the ALIEN monster.
This movie shows that love really conquers all in life.People may try to feel that they are only sexually attracted to one another but they later on realize that this attraction is much more emotional rather than physical.Also,it also make us realize that people may find someone not only who can make them happy in bed but also in real life.
But then later both the fight and the bag appear.
The tricks involved are great, in theory, but it seems that the filmmakers needed a lot of padding for the short script and decided hiding information and/or cutting away when the truth is apparent in order to show it later would be a more fun way to tell the tale.
Matthew Fox is a lot of fun especially later on when he lets loose a bit and has some fun.
Due to his background with puppets, Shanks proves to be very adept at controlling the movement of his first animals (a dead frog, and later a rooster).
and was later killed by Sinbad.
They face plenty of dangers on the way including several giant creatures, some of them prehistoric (more on those later).
The couple married later and had a baby.
Because the two directors were talented (as their later films would confirm), they managed to create a crazed, outrageous little parody of low-budget movie-making.
A good start, but you can see the Director side of Lee Chang-Dong really start to pick up with his later films.
Bae is impressed by Makdong's willingness to fight and later in the film, after Makdong clubs one of Bae's men on the head with a wooden post, the former soldier becomes a member of Bae's "family."
Either way steer clear because you'll be disappointed no later than halfway through the film.
It is later revealed that the aliens have some plan which involves interbreeding with the humans, I forget why.
Five minutes later, a nuclear strike warning in my town couldn't have torn me away from the screen, and it's been watched a dozen times since.
It doesn't get any better, either a little later as we discover it is A-xing's goal is to become a member of the notorious Axe Gang, the fiercest, cruelest and most widespread gang of the city.
He is also stabbed by three flying daggers which were supposedly aimed at his enemy and is later bitten in the face by two poisonous snakes.
A group of teenagers go to a party outside city and are later on chased by satan worshippers.
A short time later, we see a long camel that can seat 10 people.
We saw him briefly in WITNESS, but I do not remember seeing him again until CRIMSON TIDE which was 10 years later.
When Jay demands his money and refuses later to stick on as Max's partner, Max puts three bullets in his back.
The interval between the time that they leave Del Ray and reach Monterey is a pre-journey of hardship in the tradition of Sergio Leone's later "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."
This otherwise disposable 69-minute western earns some points for its scenes along the Monterey beach that anticipated similar scenes in Marlon Brando's later revenge western "One-Eyed Jacks."
Reno is furious when he hears the real plan later --Turner is taking him back to Monterey to die--for the murder of his partner!
That night, Reno tries to kill him with a rock; Turner sends him into the desert and picks him up later.
Despite the fact that Reno shot Turner in the back and later made several more attempts to have him killed, Maria thinks it wrong to have Reno tried for a murder that didn't take place.
Also if you look at the production credits you`ll notice that the producer , screenwriter and director would almost 10 years later go on to make DR NO * a movie that changed the face of British cinema .
It's when both Andre and Wally begin to exchange opinions later in the movie, Andre did most of the talking during the first half, that the two make contact with each other and draw the audience into their conversation.
But then later he reverses himself and says that everything he has done is horrific and he is dubious about how he has lived his life for the past few years, feeling that he has squandered his life.
The conversation is NOT random either, all ideas explored here get re-integrated into the film later on, what begins with the "director" telling the details of his breakdown and bizarre attempts at spiritual and artistic fulfillment, in a cross between the most pretentious theater professor you have ever seen and the most interesting man in the world from those "Dos Euis"commercials.
The play-write....don't know why I keep calling them by these titles, the characters names are their names in real life Andre Gregory and Wallace Shawn (who it's nice to see in a serious role after his mad scientist Southland Tales bit)...anyway Shawn mostly listens to Andre who obviously loves attention and hearing himself speak, but later interrogates, contradicts, and adds much needed balance to Andre's new age excesses and paranoia.
Only one redeeming feature in this, the slowest moving film I have ever suffered through: Served as comic material for the later "Waiting for Guffman" as the credits rolled, the film memorabilia shop owner showed off his "My Dinner with Andre action figures."
Then, years later, I rented it for my nephew to experience.
And sooner or later they begin falling in love.
Two hours later however you won't quite understand anymore what exactly it was you liked so much about this great Hollywood-movie that suddenly seems to be so shallow, so void of real issues and characters ...
I can, however, say that this is incredible, and has gotten me to look at the ones that came later in the franchise.
A few weeks later I bought the game and played like a mad man.
During the later performance, GREEN PASTURES most memorable time-tested message comes across very simply.
Years later, in college, while on a date, I was telling my date about it and we stopped by the school library so I could find a copy of the play to show her...she loved it, too.
and runs away with her husband, to be discovered sixteen years later, bitter and at each other's throats, facing a week long blizzard in another hovel.)
Coming as it did halfway in his career, it does not show any promise for a man who would later achieve great artistry.
We later learn that, like Hugo's Jean Valjean, he stole only to feed his starving family, later escaped from confinement, and has been persecuted ever since.
And before Jesse had gone to a leather bar and had been literally kidnapped by the gay sports teacher and it is then later in the showers that Freddy again will kill this openly gay character from within the body of Jesse.
A little bit of analysis told me that I had seen all that in Bas Ek Pal which came out 3 years later.
But also has a rebellious nature which we get to see during the later half of the movie.
If they left later, then the attack force would have reached Pearl Harbor in time and messed up history.
Anyone who has ever heard the word "foreshadow," knows that this scene will have some effect by the film's end, that Mr. Tideman's not being shown on-screen at this point is significant, and that the fact Sheen has not ever seen his boss face-to-face also portends something significant later, and is likely essential to the development of the plot.
All these years later this is still one of my favorite movies, and I will drop everything I'm doing at the moment just to watch it whenever it is on.
A couple of years later, I talked with a Navy fighter pilot and brought this up.
I was so impressed with "Animal that weeks later I searched to buy a VHS version for at least one hour at a local movie rental house.
I think it may have been broadcast at a later date that year as a special.
Then it comes back seconds later (In near perfect running condition) only to drive off again, this time into a box of explosives.
This film by existentialist director Monte Hellman who later helped produce Quentin Tarantino's seminal "Reservoir Dogs" is an important one.
The others are two recording artists, James Taylor of "Fire and Rain" fame, and Dennis Wilson from The Beach Boys and a flower child Laurie Bird who tragically committed suicide in Art Garfunkel's apartment a few years later (ironically Garfunkel had helped Paul Simon sing the hit "I've gone to look for America").
Those who love films such as Easy Rider, and later Vanishing Point, will chalk this up, not only as one of the greatest "road" movies of all time, but as one of the lasts attempts at true"American" freedom.
And don't be surprised if you're still thinking about it days later.
OK, I know that this movie is based on a play, but still, does the main idea expressed by Peter Gallagher need to directly reflect a line said by John Cage on Ally McBeal 3 years later?
The last stand of Cook and Moore.This seminal work from aussie director and music video legend Mulcahy is a fitting epitaph to the disintegrating comedy partnership of Pete and Dud during the recording sessions for what would later become the ad naeseum album.The film is by and large a torrent of swearing, drunken verbal abuse,and generally obnoxious behaviour documented for public consumption.If you are a christian,a woman or a person of high moral value look away now.
When I watched it the first time, I had to stop it and come back to it later in the day because it was so intense.
In fact, I can only assume it was later used to line a box of kitty litter.
Then, a few years later, when technology's improved and many other movies can do the same thing but make it look more realistic, that first movie will be forgotten if there isn't a great movie behind all the effects.
Apparently Flynn later in life wanted to be considered a talented actor rather than simply a ladies' man or "matinee idol".
much later known for Young Philadephians with Paul Newman in 1959!
His "Discutiamo, discutiamo" (Let's Talk; We're Talking; or maybe Talk and Talk, if you're inclined to be bored) is a dramatic imitation by students of the university movements of the late 1960s, and includes real differences of opinion (it starts with a lecture on Croce's aesthetics; later there's an attempt to set a Croce paperback on fire), and opinions worth remembering once existed.
This,the fourth and last of the Matt Helm movies has a lot to recommend it and has serious credentials to be one of the most interesting films of the 60s and that is for a variety of reasons.One of these is the appearance of the late Sharon Tate who gives a very appealing comic performance in her final movie.The attractive 60s star Dahlia Lavi makes a good villainess and is a fine foil for Nigel Greene a respected English actor (who was later to die tragically) as the evil Count Contini.He had played a similar role in the earlier British spy thriller DEADLIER THAN THE MALE.Nancy Kwan also appears and so does Chuck Norris in a "blink and you'll miss him"screen debut.The reason Norris was in it at all was because of the movies' fight choreographer,none other than the legendary Bruce Lee himself and he does sterling work giving the many hand to hand combat scenes in THE WRECKING CREW a zest that was rare in action movies of the period that featured martial arts.
While he conquers one woman after another, he also manages to rescue a few tons of gold from the grip of the above mentioned villain (the later is usually considered to be the main plot - what a preposterous notion).
And this is even more the case in one-reel comedies than in two-reelers: the single-reel works of Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, Stan Laurel, and Charley Chase feature crazy, crude stuff they didn't dare put in their later, longer movies, things that often appear to have been improvised while the cameras were rolling.
Charley Chase made this one-reel comedy back when his screen character was still known as "Jimmie Jump," and it's not as polished as some of his later work.
Notice that the kid was completely vaporized by the landmine, yet seconds later Dolph scoops up Johnny, who has only a bloody lip.
Starts off slow... so you think it's just taking its time, introducing you to the characters so you care when they (presumably) start to die horribly later on.
Anthony Hopes's classic tale turned into a classic adventure film with Ronald Coleman as the King and his commoner cousin who must masquerade as the king when he's first drugged into unconsciousness so he can't be crowned and later when the king is kidnapped.
The next shot is later and much more intimate where Raymond Massey and Fairbanks are in a dark room only lit by a fireplace and they sit in two large chairs with their backs to the camera.
The stunning blonde beauty Madeline Carroll (she would later say this was her favorite role) was the most successful actress in England at the time.
Every member of the supporting cast of the later version is superb, but can't quite beat Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Raymond Massey, Mary Astor, and David Niven.
A tale of a reluctant hero and a bittersweet romance with lots of action and witty dialog, it compares favorably with another, slightly later tale of a reluctant hero and a bittersweet romance, "Casablanca."
This film was one of the more popular films of its day, Even today these many years later it comes across as a wonderful exciting film.
Wells' SF masterpiece, 'Things to Come' (and, 3 years later, the quintessential Abraham Lincoln on stage and in film!
It's a historical film, and over the years hasn't really aged, so it remains fantastic 62 years later.
With such an outstanding, marquee cast that lives up to its advanced billing and then some, it is not difficult to understand why this film was such a rousing success when it premiered in 1937; so successful, in fact, that it was copied verbatim by MGM 15 years later after it purchased the rights from Selznick.
He by the way is a serious playwright and i remember seeing him say on the later show (1:35 am after conan on nbc) that the only reason he does films like this is to have financing for his plays.
But you'll regret later :)
Memorable moments include Simon and Liz's first encounter with the time barrier ( which makes an eerie buzzing sound ), the naval base overrun by Nazis out to steal a top secret laser, Liz finding her dead father preserved in ice, Dr.Edith Joynton ( Peggy-Thorpe-Bates ) aging to death in mere minutes, the room where people are held in suspended animation while dressed in Elisabethan clothes, the aged Traynor emerging from a secret room to sabotage The Master Plan, and the sight of planets in the night sky ( later copied by the 'Dr.Who' episode 'The Stolen Earth' ).
Though nothing in the credits mentions it, this production is obviously based on the Tony-winning 1980 Joseph Papp Shakespeare in the Park production, which starred Kevin Kline and Linda Rondstadt and was a massive hit on Broadway and later in the West End in London.
Days later they were still singing away.
Now upset e-gad for her Topper did not even have the decency to return her wave as he rode past with a young lady on his lap Mrs. Topper remarks later in scorn!
The opening scene of the movie is of Big Bear Lake and the later scenes around the small lake where they fished is at a small man-made lake that was formed for the movie.
Roland Young is for many viewers the definitive Topper but the later TV Topper, Leo G. Carroll, did a fine job too.
Plus the later TV series added a ghost St. Bernard named Neil who just happened to be an alcoholic.
The pair that later directed her in "So Long at the Fair" must have known of "Uncle Silas" when they opened their film with a similar wondrous closeup to our first encounter with her here.
Uncle Silas then forces Dudley to leave the house only to sneak him back later in the wee hours of the morning.
A few heartbeats later as Eklavya comes running to her aid we begin to connect the dots.
The sequence of chopping off the bells tied to a flying dove's feet is at first seems little cheesy but sometime later helps you understand how unique his talent is.
The best scene of the whole film was when Eklavya was blindfolded and threw his knife at a flying dove with a bell tied to its foot and managed to cut off the bell without hurting the dove, later he caught the bell before it fell into the water.
Long years later, the thrill has not worn off.
That was 1971...   Three decades later, while it's definitely dated, it's still an entertaining movie to watch.
At night, the crazed zombies attack his home again and again, but since Heston would later become the president of the NRA, it wasn't surprising that he proceeded to blow the crap out of the intruders--and do it with great gusto and style.
In addition, later in the film some hope for the redemption of mankind appears--thought you'll have to see the film for yourself to find out exactly what occurred.
Years later when we learned more about Chuck's far-right politics, did the scene give off a different vibe.
and bit later, we learn that "Jonathan Matthias" was once a news commentator as things went to Hell, as the plague takes full effect with scenes of overcrowded hospitals, people dropping on the street, and him on TV talking to dead viewers about "Judgement day".
The abundance of man-ass is hilarious, but if you're homophobic, this might at first turn you off, but later we get to see Tina CotÃ©'s nipples, so there's something for both men and women in this movie, cyborgs or not.
The weird part was years later when I'd try to explain the plot to someone.
predates most of our great spectacular films of the 1950s by many yrs (Ok, we had silent films King of Kings & 10 Commandments & some other De Mille Films, Sign of the Cross etc) but this mythological setting was unusual for the times... Cant wait to see again.. Massimo Girotti whose work I know from Senso & later Medea is excellent... rest of cast were not known to me & also not aware of director, Blassetti.... now I am !Will look forward to viewing The Iron Crown again,.and other films by Blassetti..Thanks again TCM !
and Luisa Ferida (as Tundra, a sort of blood-thirsty Jungle Girl who is eventually reformed by her love for Girotti); it's worth noting here that the three leads each have dual roles playing the parent of the character they portray later on in the film.
It must have been tough for the dashing Flynn to play such an overly restrained type of character and it was one of the best roles of the later half of his career.
However, this means that we will miss authentic dramatizations of these later additions to the Sharpe canon (cannon, geddit?
Many of these shows go David Lynch/Twin Peaks on us, setting us up with the promise of great stuff to come, and then disappointing us in a big way later.
Ben buys and heals the horse and Cale later adopts the horse and races it (I'm saying no more!)
It's particularly hilarious when the German driver gets blown up, and five minutes later someone is reading a newspaper with his death as the headline.
Hal Nedham ripped the guts out of Cannonball for his Cannonball Run made five years later.
A little while later, the Stooges are dirty and ragged, and standing at a window begging for food at a restaurant.
who fall foul of their sergeant; years later, we find them as tramps willing to do any work.
And where are more of it later on.
We then pick up a few years later and Henry is a schoolboy, befallen by an extreme case of acne that leads to him being rejected by the opposite sex and ridiculed by his peers.
The real story is that a rebel against the army is on the run, to make a long story short he is protected by the ten well-known fighters whom later becomes considered as the Kwangtung Ten Tigers.
But after the head officer of the Ching Army is killed, years later his son and sworn brother plot to kill off the students of the famous Ten Tigers.
IZO then comes back to life (though years later in the movie) and starts killing everyone.
In the beginning Izo looks like an ordinary person ,cool, but later on he becomes more fierce, he even kills children and innocent people, civilian people are those who suffer the most in a war.
With other words the war from the Japanese side didn't look like bad thing, but later on they saw the cruelty of the war.
In the end Izo do look like a monster, with a mask, evolution... changes of war how it changes in a negative way, mask is an accessory, just like the army used armored weapon in later wars.
Years later, the unfaithful JosÃ© (Juan Antonio JimÃ©nez) marries Candela (Cristina Hoyos) but while defending his lover LucÃ­a (Laura del Sol) in a brawl, he is stabbed to death.
Four years later he is released and declares his love for Candela.
Those scenes were still compelling, half a century later.
With "Bitter Rice" (and later with "Anna"), Mangano paved the way to the new, uninhibited, earthy, irrepressible sex divas of the 50s like Sophia, Gina, Ava and Brigitte.
One could argue that he was simply remembering more detail as time went on, but the fact remains that when you look at the reports and evidence collected in 1947 it sounds a lot less sexy than what was being remembered thirty, forty, and fifty years later.
The story of "The Incident at Roswell" begins some thirty years later at the 30 year reunion of members of the famed 509th Bomb Wing of the 8th USAAF the only group of bombers who were armed with atomic bombs in the world at that time back in the late 1940's.
In the end he dies in peace, Jesse died some nine years later in 1986, feeling that hopefully in the near future the truth would come out and prove, once in for all, that he was right about what happened at Roswell back in 1947.
Forrestal later fell or jumped out of his 16th floor hospital room window to his death in the early morning hours of May 22, 1949.
While Jesse Marcel did exist and everything that the movie said that happened to him really did happen to him, the scenario of him talking to all this people 30+ years later was created to tell the story of the crash).
The director later interviewed the boy, now a grown man living in California, and he said the accident happened on a Tuesday and he woke up late Thursday.
On 1 July 1934, later known as "The Night of Long Knives," the Nazi party conducted a bloody purge of their ranks.
It might be the only opportunity to do so, unless it is later distributed in video or DVD.
Sensitively narrated by British actor Rupert Everett, Paragraph 175 is all about the German penal code, which was originally enacted in 1871, and later used by the Nazis, to outlaw homosexuality.
The interviews are interspersed with a general historical summary of events and their effect on the gay community in Germany during the years between the two great wars, and later on.
Rita and Tommy are lost in the woods with another one of their idiot guides, and their "good" guide and Tommy meet up later.
Madison has her own agenda later on as she finds a dolphin she knows from her past, named Salti, captured by another crazy scientist for study.
Much of the movie's humor derives from Allen's brother Freddie's (John Candy) goof-ball antics - namely when he drops coins and later speaks Swedish - and nerdy scientist Walter Kornbluth's (Eugene Levy) chronic bad luck.
Years later as an adult, he and his brother Freddie (John Candy) reside and work in New York City as product shipping men by a pier.
Lost, confused, mute and nude, he takes her in as a guest in his apartment and later as a lover.
Flash years later and he is all grown up and he ends up having an accident at sea and ends up unconscious underwater only to be rescued by a very beautiful lady who later turns up in New York and the two of them hit it off swimmingly.
They would later make a sequel that was a made for television sequel, but I have no urge to see that one.
Then later, he's up against a marine-biologist with a fascist turn, attempting to expose Ms Hannah's fishy secret, of which he - Hanks - is as yet unaware (she's a mermaid, you see).
Years later, now a man (and played by Tom Hanks), another trip to Cape Cod brings dejavu: Hanks falls off of a tour boat and is rescued by an all grown mermaid (played by Daryl Hannah).
He'd get to show his comic flair later on in Gilligan's Island.
This is the story of a young professional vertical skateboarder named Mark Rogowski - who went on to earn the nickname "Gator" after inventing a skate-style move all his own - the "Gaite - Aire" And then , later still dropping his last name Rogowski - which he was quoted as saying that the name itself belonged to his father , who was not present in his life.
Here in his first movie the flow is at the forefront, in later movies it achieves a balance with the plot, finally taking second place in his later works.
Starting Peter Weir's central theme of "closed" or alienated sections of society ( see later "Witness","Mosquito Coast", "Dead Poets Society", "The Truman Show"), the Parisiens resorting to darkly humourous lengths in protecting their perceived ideal pioneer township is handled in typical Weir dreamlike fashion.
I always had a soft spot for it and later recognised elements from such video treats as, 2000 Maniacs.
It simply happens, and a few minutes later the movie ends.
Not five minutes later, she walks past a TV with A Tale of Two Cities on.
Then just in case, they would show us the same imagery a few minutes later.
I later read an interview about the movie and the creators' account of some of the imagery and the design of the movie, but such explicit detailing has taken away some of the charm I had felt for what I had believed were natural/innocent things, rather than improve my opinion of the movie.
Much later, around age 200, he has had further "modifications" which now results in his aging, and wearing out, along with Portia.
I thoroughly enjoyed this film in its entirety,as for death scenes well all i can say its a part of life that everyone must endure in their lives sooner or later.
When I first saw it a few years back I admit that I didn't like it much, it seemed rather stupid to think that a robot could 'become' human, but on viewing it again years later, I can safely say that I missed the whole point of this film.
Indeed I did not know it had been made until several years later when I saw the video of Celine Dion's "Then You Look at Me", and recognized the scenes as being from the short story by Isaac Asimov.
When I first saw it a few years later when there was nothing else on I was completely blown away by it.
She later matured into a fine actress.
I was 7 when Charlie's Angels first aired, little did I think that 30 years later, I would still be talking about the Angels.
I was glad when it came to the later seasons that they played down this aspect of his character.
John Forsythe' was never on the set - his voice was recorded, and dubbed in later.
Jill (and later Kris) drove a Cobra, Kelly drove a Mustang, and Sabrina drove a Pinto.
I guarantee you will still be singing the theme tune a week later!
Many Pre-Code films were pretty indistinguishable with later films, but some dared to show nudity, extreme violence, foul language and very "adult" topics--such as adultery or promiscuity.
But, only a short time later, she shoots Bellamy when he learns the truth about the baby and Menjou (who is now the governor).
As for Menjou, he later did THE GOLDWYN FOLLIES, which proves that he WAS perfectly suited to acting in FORBIDDEN!
The truth in the end would have saved both their lives, and ironically even Bob's wife Helen, from the destruction that was to later engulf them by keeping it a secret.
To see her speak her lines, to hear the delicate phrasing of not only her Polish, but her German with a Polish accent, then later, her English with a Polish accent, an altogether brutally difficult accomplishment, leaves me breathless.
We realize later that a handful of early certain scenes which feel initially like sappy Americana are emotional red herrings.
I was recently surprised at how strange the story in Manhattan seemed 26 years later.
This was a very engaging film about a guy who murders his cheating wife and then is released from prison 8 years later.
It's certainly interesting to speculate on what motivated the changes in his later work, though... !
And the poor Cristina is the innocent victim of this nasty game with her initial pure and later broken heart.
It starts with the simple premise of a song, "Strange Fruit", which Bronx-born school teacher-Abel Merepol wrote the lyrics for and jazz diva Billie Holliday later made famous.
8 years later he is trying to begin a new life, with his prison pal, an eel, as company.
Based upon an early single act play by Corrente, later expanded to a full-length piece, "Ledge Street", this production displays a strong motif dealing with the difficulty of overcoming class distinctions.
Another patch-em-up job with abandoned footage being taken up years later and edited together with new footage in a sadly misguided attempt at making a saleable project out of leftover film scraps.
Bobby Van does pretty good low-key comedy relief and (later on) modest heroics.
Years later after Hughes has died Melvin learns he is in Hughes' will.
The man says that he is Howard Hughes, and, years later, when Hughes dies, Melvin finds a will that has been left on his filling station desk that names him as one of the heirs to the Hughes fortune.
It would be interesting to know what the artists involved really thought of this film as they were making it and how they regarded it, later.
Half a century later, Walker's irony has another register to it, that of an urban (and urbane) homosexual parrying the thrusts of parochial snoops.
(This identification has an even closer source, of which more later.)
Moments later, Jagger makes him repeat the same oath but won't accept it, on the grounds that the Bible means nothing to dialectical materialists.
There were memorable performances from Peter Palmer in the title role, Leslie Parrish as Daisy Mae, Billie Hayes (who later went on to play Witcheepoo on H.R.
As I said in my review of the earlier and lesser straight 1940 version, the plot is much more elaborate this time around â not only do we get an attempt to evacuate the community to make way for A-Bomb tests (a nice touch of topicality) but Abner, Marryinâ Sam (Stubby Kaye) and later many of the people of Dogpatch go to Washington to present the Government with an essential homegrown product (the town had been deemed âthe most useless in the U.S.A.â) and then to save the naÃ¯ve Abner from the clutches of megalomaniac General Bullmoose (Howard St. John).
All right, so Al Capp's satire is dated half a century later.
I liked the production and the surreal sets, very much like Warren Beatty's production of Dick Tracy later on, another cartoon character.
The later scenes with the robbery gang, which should be the sparkling highlight of the movie, come off instead as irritating and quarrelsome.
Her beauty hasn't hardened into the horrible Kabuki mask of later years.
Meanwhile, Frank Morgan (later the Wizard of Oz) plays a character that's a prototype for Mr. Matuschek in the wonderful Lubitsch/Raphaelson "Shop Around The Corner."
This film was such a success that it went on to fare well in the U.K. and the States, which is always an achievement for a subtitled film, was later remade in Hollywood as Point of No Return and then finally as a TV series.
He was dealing with a big mouth bragger and unintentionally creating a rival that would later challenge him for Faline.
Twenty years later I have long since stopped making my living as a plumber and my eleven year old sister in law hasn't been my sister-in-law for a decade.
Cut to later shots of Max the plumber in the bathroom and we see sinks coming off of walls and, most absurdly of all, a full set of scaffolding covering the entire bathroom!
The attention to detail is immense, and contrasts sharply with the later, better known "Sink The Bismark".
It should be added that the heavily damaged Exeter was a star crossed ship, later sunk by the Japanese in the Java Sea.
The picture is a splendid British film concerning about historic deeds in WWII,the naval battle in the South Atlantic between British cruiser squadron of three ships and the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee, Dic 1939 ;the protagonists and secondaries are incarnated by a magnificent plethora English actors.The film is based on true events ,these are the following: Though the British cruisers were no match for the battleship,Admiral Sir Henry Harwood(Anthony Quayle) launched an attack to Graf Spee(with 6 cannons,280 mm).German fire seriously damaged HMS Exeter(John Cregson,captain Bell)with cannons 203mm,put half of HMS Ajax(captain Woodhouse, Ian Hunter)'s guns out of action,and then damaged Achilles(cannons 152 mm),but the cruisers did sufficient damage to the German ship to make its captain break off and run for shelter in Montevideo,Uruguay.The British followed,and waited in international waters outside the neutral port.The Uruguay government ordered the Germans to leave after 72 hours.The British cruisers named Royal and Renown were near from Montevideo and Langsdorff(Peter Finch) didn't wait possibilities to vanquish.Hitler,reluctant to risk the Graf Spee being sunk by heavier British warship which were sailing for the River Plate ,ordered the captain to scuttle the vessel.He did so 17 Dec 1939 and three days later shot himself.The film contains a colorful and glimmer cinematography by Christopher Challis.The movie is well produced(with the Archers production)and directed by Emeric Pressburger and Michael Powell.The motion picture will like to warlike genre fans and classic British cinema.
In any event the Uruguayans operated correctly under the assumption that they would be at war sooner or later with the Germans as indeed were all the Latin American countries except Argentina after Pearl Harbor.
I really admired their honesty in showing the battle and what happened later as objectively as it could be, whilst still (always) remaining good entertainment.
It's a scene that still packs a wallop and, in its own way, lends Lugosi's later flaying alive of Karloff a sense of wrongs being righted.
More than a year and 2 Hong Sang-Soo films later it remains among my favorite films.
Howard Stern back then unleashed his adult brand of radio and TV humor that would be recognized later from E and Howard TV OnDemand.
Hart's films were the first westerns which explored adult themes (not to be confused with the later formulaic Saturday matinÃ©e fare) and are certainly worth a look.
Ten years later a comment like that would NEVER appear in a Hollywood film, and movies wouldn't be comfortable criticizing war again until the 1970s.
Plus, it takes a strong and unflinching tone that NEVER would have been possible under the stricter guidelines of the Hays Office only a few short years later.
Cagney's scenes with his Ma smack of the 'mother-fixation' later explored in his 1949 film WHITE HEAT.
Ms. Harlow was, like Cagney, on her way to major stardom; but, unlike Cagney, she shows relatively little of her later charms.
The two later killed him in his own pad, yet.
Seventy five years later they could still be putting the same captions into their films, as each generation finds a way to deal with it's own brand of criminal enterprise.
Years later, an unforgiving Tom wreaks his revenge on the pathetic Puttynose.
The older kid who is later played by Donald Cook has more the benefit of the two family home and both influences.
In "The Public Enemy" we find probably the first instances of the beautiful stylish cinematography and clever camera-work that will become the trade-mark of later gangster and noir movies.
This lost video must represent something of a holy grail to the cannibal community so the idea that an outsider can simply stick a request for it on a forum and be sent a copy free of charge a few days later is ridiculous.
It's later when Jenny learns through her beer drinking mom Mrs. Stewart, Marjorie Rambeau, the truth about Tye from and old scrapbook that she had about her daughters road to success that the truth finally came out to what was behind Tye's conduct towards her!
We're asked to believe that because Tye saw Jenny in a musical right before he left for the war (which even she admits she wasn't that good in) and reviewed it for a newspaper, that, somehow, seven years later, she will find it in her big charcoal black heart to "love" him.
He walks out and five seconds later you can hear the party stop instantly as she sits in cold stone silence on her bed.
Who else can order "Lobster Newberg and Coffee" for lunch at the studio cafeteria with a straight face other than Crawford... For die hard fans of Joan's more camp later years this one will keep you in stitches.
James Garner displays a knack for comedy, which he will later refine in his "Support Your Local Sheriff/Gunfighter" movies.
The scariest thing about the real main character of the movie, US-made supercomputer Colossus, later known as "World Control" after its fusion with its soviet counterpart, Guardian, is it acts the way you would act if you resigned all your human feelings, keeping your intelligence.
A special mention to Eric Braeden, who precisely played a POTA universe crucial character a little time later.
Gene Polito, who later shot WESTWORLD [1973]), imaginative settings (by the veteran Alexander Golitzen), often disorienting editing (the expert work of Folmar Blangsted) and an appropriately weird score (by Michel Colombier) Â the film truly can't be faulted, but it also benefits from a largely anonymous cast.
Braeden, who later would become a major TV soap opera character Victor Newman, is outstanding in this role.
To his usual array of dissolves and camera tricks, MÃ©liÃ¨s added the effects of drawing over the celluloid (an effect made famous years later by the "Godzilla" films of the 60s), using the hand-coloring technique not only to make the film look nicer, but to make an effect in itself.
I will get to that later.
Then later... Barbara and Ben finds out that they are not alone in the house.
Although the execution wasn't as good as I would have liked (more on that later), it was the right decision.
Maj. Grau runs into the killer some two years later in Paris who commits the very same kind of crime and has his aid Lance Cpl.
The search for the killer, led by Major (later Lt. Col.) Grau (Omar Sharif), gets lost for a time and Valkyrie is inserted rather late in the film.
Gripping, it covers a lot of territory in a HIGH-BUDGET setting (If this had been made a year later, instead of being pre-BONNIE & CLYDE, THE GRADUATE< IN COLD BLOOD, etc.)
Major Grau, played by Omar Sharif, is brilliant as the tracker of the 3 Generals who are suspects in the murder of a Warsaw prostitute and then, years later, of a Parisian prostitute, who is brutally mutilated in the same manner.
I was vaguely waiting for a tedious pudding, full of villains and with some redeeming heroes, in a run-of-the-mill denunciations of Nazi craziness, 25 years later.
I'd certainly recommend this to anybody who likes action films, especially to people who liked Luc Besson's later film Leon, the main character of which is based on Victor, the cleaner, in Nikita.
Kudos to Omar Sharif for his portrayal of Major (later Lt.
A few minutes later he hears footsteps coming down the stairs and he peers through the crack in the lavatory door and is shocked to see the uniform of a German general coming down the stairs.
Two years later in July 1944, another prostitute is murdered and Major Grau establishes that once again all 3 generals - Tanz, Kahlenberge and Gabler are all in Paris on the night of the murder.
The point I wanted also to make is that, unlike your "factual errors" there were in fact several Regular German Army units and soldiers who were later brought into the Waffen SS.
There were foreign volunteer units that were in the Leningrad area in 1941-42 and later became Waffen SS in whole or in part.
As a longtime admirer of the 2001 film "Moulin Rouge" and a more recent admirer of Jean Renoir's film-making, I knew that I'd inevitably watch his "French Cancan" sooner or later.
Another great thing were the sets that were wonderful and even now 70 years later they still look very modern.
It was a shame, he was killed later... Of course, the question of existence of this character in the movie remains a puzzle to me, for the book never featured such a person...
And hardly arrest Petju Yablokov later: in the encryption sent by him instead of a word "Plevna" the word "Nikopol" has appeared.
The movie is quite intense in the later parts.
I'll get to that later.
While not quite as accomplished as the later movies, he develops a very simple story of a young married couple, the subsequent kidnapping of the husband and the wife's attempts to persuade the authorities to help free him into a well-rounded movie that works on almost all levels that it encompasses:  The love relationship between the two main characters is credible and well-handled; the struggle of the individual citizen vs. government authorities and individual desires vs. the larger scale of politics is dealt with intensely (the scene where the Colonel tells Roja that "everyone is happy" is simply chilling), and even the interplay of the kidnapped and the terrorists works out really well, even if it seems sometimes that Rishi Kumar was lucky ending up with these rather than more ruthless people.
The incredibly audacious later pictures, especially the insanely plotted but gorgeous "The Naked Kiss," and the riveting "Underworld U.S.A." were wildly impressive, but it was clear that Fuller had something very special right from the beginning: "I Shot Jesse James" used to great advantage (for once) the disturbingly brutal and sexy talent of John Ireland, and "Park Row" (actually his fifth picture) was a fascinating inside story of the turn of the century newspaper milieu in New York.
While he presents himself as a hardline nazi believer at first, we later see that the horrors of war affect him deeply in an unexpected moment and the final scenes of the movie have a very bitter lesson in store for him.
Price's conviction and Fuller's straightforward direction somehow make this preposterous tale ring true (many of the basics are correct, though Fuller certainly over-dramatizes the later confrontations between Reavis and the government with its allies the homesteaders that the Baron is trying to steal from).
But then a federal investigator noticed a discrepancy in one of the documents...  Vincent Price, not yet the ham actor he would be later, gives a riveting performance as Reavis.
Years later, he emerges from prison -- broken, broke and disgraced -- and stumbles out into the rain, only to find Sofia and their son waiting for him in a carriage.
There are certainly some typically subversive little Preminger / Hecht touches, I detect, of voyeurism and fetishism, running the film close, I would imagine, to the prevailing moral code of the day, which the former was to take on further in "The Moon Is Blue" and to some kind of apogee in "Anatomy Of A Murder" 10 years later.
This BRASS EYE special PAEDO-GEDDON was swamped by complaints ( More on that later ) when it was broadcast in 2001 following a national debate around a possible " Sarah`s law " following the abduction and murder of school girl Sarah Payne .
Here we have the death of a chess expert and assorted other goings on that make this one of the better later Chan films.
Six years later, I am still saying that but with newer animated efforts.
The plot is a little outlandish, but if you don't take it literally (good-for-nothing artist meets waitress and a couple of hours later asks to be shot so that she can take a trip to France) but more figuratively (disillusioned man is willing to sacrifice everything so that someone he loves can fulfill her dreams) it is more poignant.
The film works chiefly because its characters are so well defined, and this pays dividends later in the film when their insecurities and motives begin to surface.
The tourist makes his own way back to the cafÃ© and the crooks are not far behind and then they go into the cafÃ© and hold everyone hostage in there to be joined by the group of three later on.
Humphrey Bogart, in his first good movie role, is appropriately menacing; he looks remarkably like John Dillinger, and shows even at this stage of his career much of the charm and charisma that later propelled him to superstardom.
Mayo's career drifted downward in the late thirties and forties, and of his later work the less said the better.
Bogey never forgot this favor and years later named his daughter Leslie after Howard.
For Davis, Gabrielle Maple is a unique part and not one she'd play later on as her features hardened.
But by 1936, the period of the romantic outlaw was drawing to a close if it wasn't already over (a point made five years later in "High Sierra").
She shares Squier's love of beauty and poetry and dreams of fleeing her repressing entrapment at the restaurant and traveling to FranceÂ   Into their world of fanciful idealism enters Humphrey BogartÂthe reality, the brute force which threatens not only the dreamers but all of societyÂ It is a finely truthful portrait of ultimate evil, magnificently played by Bogart with all the uncompromising ferocity the role demandedÂ It was one of Bogart's finest portrayals and it was the model, although considerably restrained, he would follow for the next years of his careerÂ  Final note: Duke Mantee was a killer on the runÂ He was not a big-shot businessmanÂ The assumption put into the audience's mind was that this mobster was a bank robber, a hold-up artist, an escaped convict... but never a wealthy criminal controlling an empire of corruption from plush offices on the 18th floorÂ  Approximately twenty years later, Bogart recreated his original role in a television production of "The Petrified Forest."
And when, at the start of their meeting with the other couple, she tries to win them over with a performance of a sweet mother-to-be, she's equally convincing; and likewise when she later on in the movie is under heavy attack and has to fear for her life, so to me it proves that she's a great actress too.
It's a welcome departure from the formulaic series that the Warner Bros. cartoon factory from this era did so well, but the recipe from this one was to be tried out again with great success in later Daffy Duck shorts (Duck Dodgers, Stupor Duck).  
Even though the order of several scenes change, or are altered a bit, and there are a few segments unique to the 1978 version, the editing on the later version is generally superior.
It was generally scorned upon the initial release, so Cassavetes decided to re-edit the film drastically and attempt to give it another go two years later.
The fact that it was unlikely for him to complete the task is an interesting notion which later dawns on the viewer, as the very people who enlisted him to do it, thought it could never have been done.
Ironically, he gives a speech later about choosing who we are and being comfortable, two things that he has failed at miserably.
And talk about it later.
2 hours later the mother is brutally dead & of coarse the young man is convicted & sent to prison for trial   all along he keeps sayin he had an alibi by a scientist doctor who gave him a lift by his car that particular night   but that witness was no where to be found & after a while the son was hanged the flash backs are over  back to reality where miss marple & the family of 5 children , their father & his fiancÃ©e ( miss marple's friend ) are happily spending the evening doing sharades & hanging around so Merrily  when a scientist doctor spots an old newspaper & reads that a young man was hanged due to killing his mom 2 years ago he comes in a rainy night to this family's night to reveal a dark secret   appearing like a ghost out of the windows where they all gathered & telling them that their long dead brother was with him around 8,30 which is the same time of the murder of their dead mother taking place , so there is no way he was the murderer & they all discover that if their dead brother isn't the one , so it's one of them  & the mystery goes on & on & gets more thrilling & full of surprises i love reading , i would support novels brought to movies , novels are harder than a 90 minutes screen adapted novel to some people ,though novels are more deep full of details & depth that no way a movie can deliver  but on the other hand a movie is easier to understand for young people, easier to watch especially for a whole new generation of Agatha Cristie's young fans  back to the movie ... i think it's done very well , miss Geraldine's acting is always awesome i love the way she does it .. the acting , her custom's ,the way she always repeat the word '' dear'' in many lines in the script makes u feel like she 's ur own granny lol  the casting of the family was wonderful & very suitable , the 2 sisters Kirsten & Hester are wonderful actors especially the younger one kirsten , she is a very sensible actress , the brothers jacko ( the thought to be murderer of his mother is wonderful ), the other brothers were so right in their own places , the lake where a suicide takes place was original ,the house & the stormy weather helped much in the belief of the realism   i don't think the movie is crap on the contrary i think if u r free for the weekend & it's on TV try catchin it or rent it if available , u'll enjoy
Two years later his ex- husband decides to marry another woman, this woman happens to know Miss Marple and invites her over for the wedding.
Seven years later, the company's tyrranical founder has died and the remaining staff recruit the former trio to premier the work which broke their dancing careers.
The show hasn't even been on for years, I just signed up for IMDb so I can check out movies etc and yet still here I am, years later, coming to this page, one of the first ten pages I visited after I signed up for this service just to complain about how awful this show was.
If it wasn't for other shows that came later like Girls Will Be Girls and Punched Up this show would be a slam dunk for worst Comedy Network show ever.
I remember watching this television movie when it first came out back in '79 starring sexy Rexy (Rex Smith)and Denise Miller (later of "Archie Bunker's Place").
Or at least made me feel better, I am still to this day believing that Rex was so much better than even he knew, I know he has gone on to do so much in Broadway and I have heard real estate, but "you take my breath away " was our wedding song, I would have liked to see a "Sooner or later 2"  Dam I miss those days
So much so that many years later I named my second son REX!!!!
Denise Miller who played essentially minor parts both in Fish and Archies'place later in her career is excellent as a conflicted 13 year old who does not know whether she should play with dolls or boys.
In fact it's probably the end that has caused so many women to return to viewing the movie in their later years.
But I did catch the movie when it appeared on network TV a few years later.
Im guessing that the later movies are probably even weaker, because the later specials would suffer, especially following Guaraldis death.
For whatever reason, this is rerun less than the later two Peanuts movies, so seek it out on DVD - you won't be disappointed.
Snoopy goes to Lila and while leaving his Doghouse with the "For sale or to let" sign on it Woodstock runs after him crying while we can hear this really sad song in the background which later Charlie Brown is singing in his deep depression.
There is a delightful song sung by Shelby Flint in the film....she would later sing another in the first rate animated film, The Rescuers.
The family initially agrees to have their lives filmed and turned into a telly show but later back out of the deal.
This introductory footage was superb in that it related directly to the later concepts of bees, and so I cannot really understand why it was left off of the later DVD release.
A director instructs actors to wear costumes, go on a set, and act their roles, which is recorded on film, edited, and later played in theaters.
3h20 minutes later, the mystery is solved, fully, and it is plain that he was in control all the time... not like other directors who can't make a clean film with a linear time line.
I learned much later that director Roger Corman had directed some films.
Written, directed, shot, scored and edited with an appalling lack of flair and finesse by the singularly talentless Rick Sloane (who later disgraced celluloid some more with the absolutely atrocious "Hobgoblins"), this horrendously ham-fisted attempt at a slasher spoof strikes out something rotten in every conceivable way: the excruciatingly lethargic pacing, the painfully static, grainy cinematography (there's a stinky surplus of drab master shots featured throughout), an annoyingly droning and redundant hum'n'shiver synthesizer score, the flat (non)direction, a tediously talky and uneventful script, the groan-inducing sophomoric sense of lowbrow humor, the bloodless murder set pieces, a pitifully unscary killer (he's just some wrinkled-up old guy in pasty make-up), the uniformly obnoxious and unappealing characters, a dissatisfyingly abrupt ending, and lifeless performances from a noticeably uninspired cast all ensure that watching this schlocky swill is about as fun and rewarding as eating rancid raw eels drenched with sour vinegar.
When it works well, Milligan's dialogue works as well as some of the later, less symbolic, more explicit Tennessee Williams plays.
There are even bigger howlers in the series, and I know what happens later, but this is the one that made me want to throw something at the TV.
This 1989 French film was justifiably so popular that an American re-make followed later and then a cable television series followed after that.
It's also interesting to see Reno in a familiar role as a "cleaner," a role he made famous four years later in "Leon: The Professional."
The school set has an architectural style of "retro-dilapidated", and there are unusual touches such as the "desk nest" which blocks the hall during later, pivotal scenes.
It seems as if Soisson and Segonzac couldn't take the premise quite seriously, so in lieu of the intense, high-action dingy glum of Mimic, they went the tongue-in-cheek route and gave us something not that far removed from, say, a later Frank Henenlotter film.
Without any lead, he meets Bobby and calls Ash; later, Ash calls Dean and when they arrive in the Roadhouse, they find the place burned to the ground, Ash and other hunters dead and Ellen missing.
Zooni's world is destroyed, and she returns home, where she later delivers a baby boy, who she names Rehan Jr, in memory of her love.
Seven years later she gets a desperate knock on the door, by a wounded army officer in need of urgent medical attention.
Years later, a Major Ranjeev, bearing a disturbing resemblance to the dead Rehan, shows up.
A few years later, a portable lab is positioned close to the module, which we later find out triggered a signal into space.
There are a few cute food-related sight gags, but the short is a bit flatter and less energetic than you would expect, though, to be fair, if you look at it without comparing it to later work by Jones, it comes off looking a good deal better.
This isn't a bad short, it just pales in comparison to the work which would come later, though it does make clear that Jones was interested in the cute and sentimental from the beginning.
This was probably the genesis of the Sniffles shorts done a bit later.
The captivating black-and-white Italian scenery, especially in Rome and Capri (check out the awesome sequence in the cave at Capri) is worth watching just by itself - much of the same would be captured later in Technicolor (but not as effectively) in the film Rome Adventure.
Yvette Mimieux is a tough, terrific actress, and she cuts an assertive, sexy presence on the screen(especially in these, her later post-"Time Machine" years)but "Jackson County Jail" is just a slapdash effort that managed to catch on with cable audiences in the 1980's.
The two stars are ably supported by Robert Carradine as a seemingly benign hitchhiker who reveals his true colors later, Howard Hesseman as Dinahs' unfaithful husband, Severn Darden as the local sheriff, and Mary Woronov as a loyal friend of Coleys'.
Nicely directed by Michael Miller (who remade this for TV just two years later as 'Outside Chance') and written by Donald Stewart, the film itself does have a downbeat, cynical, fatalistic vibe, and really comes to life for a stirring, breathless conclusion.
This is a romantic travelogue in which the action is set, much like some movies that were shot in that country later on.
Wister was a careful chronicler of what he saw and what he saw set the standard for later writers like Zane Grey, Louis L'Amour, Luke Short, etc.
$425,000 later, it proved a decision he was glad he had made.
Released in 1929 and starring Gary Cooper who later became one of the great heroes of the western genre, this movie contains all of the archetypal elements of classic western films.
This movie is considered to be one of the very first westerns to represent the classic elements of the western genre, and its influence on later westerns is quite clear.
(Note: very interesting comparisons can be made to later westerns, particularly "Shane" and another Cooper film, "High Noon")
11 years later she comes back to the village because her dance instructor is dying and wants her to save the local theater, which is going to be demolished and a mall built in its place.
Besides the fact that Divine is killed in the end, it seems to be a prequel to a young Divine's life that is later portrayed in "PINK FLAMINGOS".
Some of his later work is cute but never as engaging and fresh as Maniacs and Flamingos.
And the film is still unique and original 30+ years later, so I give it credit for that.
But more on that later.
Waters will finally perfect his film-making a few years later with the back to back to back releases of Pink Flamingos, Female Trouble and Desperate Living.
Shahrukh Khan later find out in the movie that he has a heart disease and would not be able to live for long.
So he never tells Naina that he loves her instead of that he hooked Naina with her best friend Said Ali Khan whose a total flirt but later on fells in love with Naina too..
If KKHH was a usual college romance developed into an adult romance later and K3G was all about "loving your parents" , KHNH talks of loving life itself .
She misses her father who committed suicide for reasons explained later in the movie .
Even when Nick later expresses his guilt over the little boy's death, I wonder if we are meant to feel sorry for him or the boy.
Many of the criticisms leveled against it are of scenes that were *meant* to evoke that response, and which are addressed later in the movie.
While "The Matrix," released a year later, would overshadow its influence on the science fiction world and pop-culture in general, it's worth noting that the film still stands as one of the best genre films of the 90's and begs to be seen by anyone with a love for sci-fi in need of some refreshment.
Similar in philosophy to the later released 'The Matrix', the film is centered around a man (Rufus Sewell) who becomes suddenly and unwittingly aware that his world is not what it seems.
Three weeks later in Moscow, President Marshall stipulates that the U.S. refuses to negotiate with terrorists.
A disgruntled Secret Service agent, Gibbs (Xander Berkeley of "L.A. Takedown"), as we later learn, helped these guys obtain their security clearance.
The obvious uses are the digitally filmed closeup shots in low-light of skin in Roman church art masterpieces leading up to the parallel shots of skin when the actors touch ... but note in particular the clenched hand on the sheet at the end of that scene, to be followed later by a montage of clenched hands on ancient statuary (interspersed with an angel) and the almost penultimate shot of a hand at the denouement ....
Interesting because plenty of years later I became a minister and my teacher is a married gay woman.
So, I'm not really making fun of the premise but it just looks and sounds so dated 40 years later, especially the San Francisco hippie scenes.
One criticism I have of the later movies is that I would like to have seen Herbie stay with his original owner Jim Douglas, and follow his adventures with that family rather than see him owned by lots of different people - partly because Jim, Tennessee and Carol are great owners for Herbie, but also because how does the poor little car feel being passed from owner to owner?!
This movie and especially on the BONUS part...the making of Un Dimanche a Kigali, JUST THIS PART IS WORTH IT, where the producers, directors and actors talk about the condition 10 years later after the genocide.
This Hitchcock film, made soon after he burst into prominence in America with films like "Rebecca" and "Suspicion," is a lot of fun, but it's ultimately more of a technical experiment than it is a satisfying narrative film, much like "Rope" would be 4 years later.
What about later, after Willy (Walter Slezak) is exposed as a scheming Nazi captain deftly maneuvering the boat to his own country's supply ship?
He would return later in his career to the concept of single set stories, for movies such as Rope, Dial M For Murder and Rear Window.
I'm still laughing about it a few days later and am picking up a DVD tonight.
Hardin takes solace in the arms of "saloon girl" Rosie (Julia Adams) whom he later marries.
It blends together elements of various crime subgenres: it takes the criminal-turns-detective idea from Get Carter and marries it to the sickly, sleazy decadence that Scarface would portray so unflinchingly three years later, while the outlandish, ostentatious tactics Shand employs to intimidate his enemies come straight from The Godfather.
From a British perspective, part of the fun of watching this is seeing people who later became famous for other roles.
While the footage is incorporated at a later date.
Gangland boss Harold Shand (Bob Hoskins) is on the verge of something big in his native London's docklands;replacing the declining port-side areas with vast new modern developments and buildings,even with a view to holding a future Olympic Games there.There is however a considerable fly in the ointment;would-be mafia backers are concerned as Harold's manor and underlings are subjected to a campaign of murder and bombings,later revealed to be the work of the IRA,who think Shand was responsible for the deaths of several of their members (when in fact he wasn't).An enraged Harold plans his revenge,but should he go ahead and do so?
We hear nothing of these events until much later in the film, keeping it at the back of our minds and creating a certain shock element when we eventually realise everything that's come together.
One of the most memorable of the support cast is Derek Thompson, who would later go on to play Charlie Fairhead in BBC's long running 'Casualty' drama, who takes the 'Introducing' credit.
A Kathleen Turner (later brilliant in Martin's sci-fi spoof "The Man With Two Brains") or Jessica Lange (not long out of a noir remake "The Postman Always Rings Twice") would I think have worked better.
The combination of old film and new was later taken up by Woody Allen in "Zelig" and was further elaborated on in subsequent Hollywood films like "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" and the overrated "Forrest Gump", but I'll take Messrs Martin & Reiner's stylish rib-tickling homage any day of the week.
Look at this film and a later comedy "Kung Pow" and the things they made such a big deal of the fact they placed Tom Hanks with dead people is just not that big a deal.
when i've watched "Barda" i was expecting' a quality tension movie but i was disappointed when i saw it.instead of tension i just felt boredom.the story of the movie goes like this  a group of armed bank robbers entered to a bar after the robbery.few minutes later they took few customers in the bar as hostages and after that they begun torturing them until the night's over and cops bust in and arrest all of them  That wasn't the film which makers promised in it's trailers.Film completely filled with torture,beating,rape and murder.i still wonder how could they charge people to see a humans in the movie getting tortured,humiliated and so on.
Cancelled after 12 episodes in 1999-2000, some years later James Poniewozik of Time magazine named it as one of the 100 greatest TV shows of all time.
The implication was that she'd decided there were no rewards for being a good person after witnessing her grandmother dying, but clearly she was not comfortable being a Freak, at least not until later episodes when the Freaks seemed to develop some genuine affection for her.
Almost 10 years later I am dealing with the same things in high school and it is conveyed in the most upfront way.
Then a few episodes later, they kill off Dr. Weir.
Much later I received a phone call from my girlfriend telling me that she wanted to discuss a rumour that she heard about a 'gentleman's only' weekend in Amsterdam, which I thought I'd got away with a few months earlier.
Nicholas Cage does an incredible job here, much more so than the overblown, self-conscious acting he acquires later.
Twenty-two years later, the neighborhood has become a ghetto and his home a gothic ruin.
Here, he plays Jimmy Bones, a gangster who is killed in 1979 and then years later is awakened and out for revenge against the ones who killed him.
The comic relief in the later half also reminds us (after some darker parts) that this film is not to be taken seriously at all.
In the late 70's Mr Bones does not want to be a dealer, gets killed and goes get revenge 20 years later (for reasons still unknown to men).
Basically your standard man gets killed and sometime later comes back to life to get his revenge on his killers.
The victim is approached by a young man who arrives on the scene and does what he can to comfort the victim first by wiping the blood from the boy's face, giving him his jeans, and later his letterman's jacket.
Although the boy who rescues the victim at first tells him that he left the scene before the attack began, he later admits that he stood and watched while the attackers stripped the boy naked from the waist down and allegedly violates him with a stick.
From the viewpoint of a more environmentally conscious time some sixty years later, the benevolent portrayal of the oil industry seems a bit quaint, but that a young boy should be fascinated by the process seems genuine, in any era.
She is pretty good at playing disturbed people as she showed later in "Single White Female."
), some 'over-the-top' performances (Massey's hiss-able villain, Lynne Overman's crusty sailor), a 'star-in-the-making' turn by young Susan Hayward (who, 14 years later, would again work with Wayne, in the infamous "The Conqueror"), and the unforgettable (if not quite realistic) climactic confrontation with the squid (which DeMille plays to the hilt, not letting audiences know WHO sacrificed his life until the last moment).
He demurs, only to be visited later by an old man who fills him in on the whole situation.
The students instead seek Fang Gang for advice, and after some soul searching, our hero takes on the mantle that will later be carried by the likes of Louis Gosset Jr. in the Iron Eagle series, and helps the youngsters in their quest.
Another exciting aspect of the film (which would later become a Wang Yu staple) is the use of unorthodox weapons by the heavies.
Its a good piece that mostly works and shows the seeds of the later Eraserhead.
Fans of this director should try and catch his debut, as it casts its shadow over much of his later work.
Now, about 14 years later I still love it and am looking forward to it coming out on DVD so I can own it.
She would later meet Harry(John Cusack), who tags along with her.
If you think about it then it's a real life story and that's the real ending... well not quite actually Al got out of the prison few years later because of a disease and lived happily ever after.
brian de palma later uses a similar scene - stairway in the station in his other classic movie carlito's way quite effectively as well.
The real Frank Nitti died 12 years later in 1943 at the hands of fellow gangsters on Chicago's west side.
The real Elliot Ness was a fine law enforcement man who later became Chief of Police in Cleveland, Ohio and he never murdered anyone in cold blood.
I understand that they had limits because it was an account of a true story, but they still could have told us certain things and saved some things for later.
Yet a decade later, when it was re-released, they got top billing over the actual stars Milland and Goddard.
And then later, he tells her about Atlantis or the sirens, something incredible, and she has the same reaction.
Those all set up stories that would be fleshed out later, and they were all good.
After seeing the Smallville episode 'Aqua', and later hearing about a pilot being developed, I was very excited.
Arthur later attempts to persuade Eva to believe him that the dolphins were some how 'calling' to him.
The show will be much better in the later episodes when the characters history and importance is gone more in depth.
There's so much that could be explored in later episodes... the actual extent of his powers, if he is able to find his mom, is Lt. Torres from Atlantis, and how A.C. is able to save both the world and the sea.
Only thing missing from the formula is a wicked manipulator like Dan in One Tree Hill but that would have come later.
Also, the vulgar humor associated with the genre only makes itself felt in the scenes taking place on the set of an erotic movie and, later, in a hippie commune; in fact, the film's tone is generally quite serious - but this doesn't mean that the hard-boiled dialogue, which so characterizes the poliziotteschi, has been downplayed (thus raising the occasional chuckle, especially among those fluent in Italian).
Emergency Squad does not really add anything new to the genre, and director Stelvio Massi did do better four years later with the Maurizio Merli vehicle 'Convoy Busters'.
He later forsakes the police force, leaving him free to get the crooks by any means necessary...  One of the reasons why this isn't Milian's best work is down to the role he is playing.
The first season is far more immune to this flaw, yet the later ones are the one I'm referring to right now.
I will write a longer article at some later date explaining why I state this.
Some critics say she's wasted here and maybe she is, but one of her better later roles is as Mrs. Gonzo, the Maltese mother in Alec Guinness's The Malta Story.
George Raft helped Bogey in his career by shortly turning down High Sierra, The Maltese Falcon and later Casablanca.
The large cast of characters is nicely handled and it doesn't have the round and round feeling that later Zorro serials engendered.
From 1492, when Columbus sailed the wide ocean and found what he thought was India, up to the death of Teresa de JesÃºs 90 years later, Spain went through rather traumatic experiences.
This film takes up from her early twenties and goes through to her death, following her life around the high lands of Ãvila, the EncarnaciÃ³n Monastery, and her later travels around most of central Spain, reaching as far afield as AragÃ³n and Sevilla.
The film is accompanied by music from JosÃ© Nieto, though on some occasions I detected certain other sources, most notably a piece which sounded like `tafelmusik' by Georg Philippe Telemann - more than a hundred years later.
It gave rise to my hopes of hearing something by TomÃ¡s Luis de Victoria, also from Ãvila and coinciding in time with Mother Teresa, one of the great examples of early polyphony later taken up by the Italians.
Mother Teresa herself wrote a lot, including poetry which later became categorized as `mystic', a leaning also taken up by Juan de Yepes y Ãlvarez - San Juan de la Cruz/St.
Initially, it is restricted to a history lecture inspired by sites visited along the Mediterranean coast, while later it goes on and on about philosophical/political/whatever issues.
The cruise departs from Lisbon and is to arrive in Bombay, sometime later.
In it, Hatton plays a former college BMOC who became disfigured after a lab accident and who, years later, begins a murder spree against all his former pals and teachers that he blames for his current condition.
These scenes, with big Rondo and the blind woman, will likely cause most viewers to recall Frankenstein and the blind hermit in "Bride of Frankenstein" (1935), just as his later sacrifices on her behalf are reminiscent of Chaplin's for his blind flower girl in "City Lights" (1931).
As a result of an experiment going wrong at university, Hal Moffat becomes disfigured and some years later, starts killing people.
It's still one of my all-time faves & whenever I catch it on TV, I still have to watch it, all these years later.
She moved away 2 years later and I never saw her again.
Well, as of 2008, 21 years later, it's happened to five US citizens, as far as anyone knows, since 2007 alone.
When still at the top of his game Mortmain and his then wife (who later dies, no foul play here) and his two little girls stumbled upon a rodent infested castle which he leased.
She later killed seven men in cold blood (she may have been defending herself from attack in some cases, but that remains unclear).
We're later shown someone claiming being gay is a very modern invention :   " Where were the gays years ago ? "
It also has it's funny moments but isn't as humorous as Hill & Spencer's later spaghetti western; THEY CALL ME TRINITY (1971).
The first kill is a cracker and sadly the later ones aren't as good, but they still just about work in the context.
Other familiar faces include Perry Lopez,(Cowhand Pete Ramirez in THE LONE RANGER movie and a crewman in MR. ROBERTS) and Ross Bagdasarian who, aided by his chipmunks Alvin, Simon & Theodore, would later gain recording and TV fame as David Seville.
Young Jacob Reinert attempts to confront him, but the most moving story in the film concerned Mary Ann Wallner who listened to Dobson's advice about rejecting her lesbian daughter who later kills herself.
The credits scroll over moonlit moss-covered trees, and bear a similarity to those used two years later in the Wyler/Davis masterpiece, The Letter.
Release it later if the director or an actor/actress makes it big later on.
at first i thought that it can't be that bad, just that the start is just lame, and later on the movie will be funny,,,, but hey, my mistake...it even got worse !!
The man that owns the Fortune Cookie company having a stereotypically Jewish name and later Ronald Mack(Maurice Patton) asking Mr. Lee(Pat Morita) if there's any Chinese Jews that bit was great and would have received huge laughs if it would have been slipped into an episode of Family Guy.
20 minutes later, I deleted the stupid thing.
The story is classic (man goes to war and returns later to find his wife re-married)but there are twists and turns leaving you to discuss later what you might have done or wanted.
A mortified Fonda toughs it out in one of the most memorable scenes as the universally white - frocked female dancers vacate the floor, too affronted to share space with Davis, with the aftermath seeing Fonda move away and bring back a year later a Yankee wife.
Davis's reaction to this and her ultimate sacrifice as redemption, when she later tends to fever - infected Fonda at the movie's climax encompass the main plot to this grand old piece of Hollywood costume drama.
Fonda leaves her, and comes back a year later with a Northerner wife (Margaret Lindsay).
A big movie in every way that would, sadly, be eclipsed barely a year later by GONE WITH THE WIND.
I first saw this excellent and powerful story on television sometime in the late 50's or early 60's, and had not seen it since until I caught it on television more than 40 years later.
Never allowing her Adrian costumes to out-wear her, her rendition of Marie-Antoinette is moving, convincing as a girl about to be married, who evolves into a woman aware of her position as Queen of France but is a little out-of-touch, and who later becomes one of the many victims who lost their heads under the guillotine's deadly blade.
Just as the character he plays caught on with the media in the film, Bronson's star rose significantly after this film, which was a runaway hit (whose prestige was diminished a tad by a later quartet of horrendous sequels.)
(He shares some screen time with Dukakis, as a policewoman, who would later play his wife in "Moonstruck" and take home an Oscar!)
One year later, when a violent outbreak of Yellow Fever plagues the south for the first time in 22 years, Fonda returns home again; but it will be an unpleasant shock for the headstrong and vengeful Davis.
The wife is beaten into unconsciousness before later dying in hospital, and the daughter is sexually assaulted and goes into a catatonic state as a result of the shock.
In light of the later, inferior sequels, it is fascinating to see how the character came to be, how he made the transition from law-abiding man to cold-blooded vigilante.
And he does, one year later, with his new Northern wife in tow.
Rather than Bronson's performance Death Wish has its significant themes and screenplay components which were used at almost every action/crime movie later on, thus became clichÃ©s of their genre.
Bronson as well as director Michael Winner and writer Brian Garfield touched a raw nerve in "Death Wish" with the American people in big cities under siege like no other movie ever did before and, now some 30 years later, after.
Some time later going to Arizona to do his job as a land developer for his firm in NYC he's given a .32 handgun as a gift by the person that he worked for Ames Janichill, Stuart Margolis, for the great job that he did for him.
At first he just stumbles into traps set up by muggers or happens on a crime taking place; later on the other hand it's clear that he's actually inviting attacks by making himself a target.
He meets a very sexy girl and she invite him to her home......well this is a good start .....but later he feels fear about the girl and her friend and he goes out.
He was back two years later with After Hours, which is an intense, hellish, nightmarish odyssey through New York City's Soho late at night, and into the morning.
Paul meets a girl after a hard day at work (Rosanna Arquette) and they arrange to meet later that evening.
Many techniques would be used five years later in GoodFellas.
It's also funny to think that five years later, he and O'Hara would play the most loving parents to a boy who would be the biggest box office draw in the early part of the 90's.
The first time I watched it, I'd never heard of the thing but was quite willing to gamble 10 minutes of my valuable time..an hour later I was hooked!
Scorsese later confessed that working on After Hours gave him back his love for making movies.
It wasn't till years later he realized it was a Scorsese movie.
When Preston returns to New Orleans one year later, Julie believes that he misses her and organizes a dinner party to welcome him and ask for his forgiveness.
The site of the good doctor's work is seemingly in a country estate, but later we hear from two policeman, not unlike members of the mob, that murders have been happening in the nearby vicinity.
Why this same woman had one hairdo in the lab and a completely different one two seconds later outside of the lab?
One of the first things you'll notice on the DVD is that the print is really, really bad--though it does get a bit better later.
A year later, Fonda returns and Davis is ready to apologize and pick up where they had left off--only to find out that Fonda is now married.
So, a short time later when Fonda is stricken with Yellow Fever, she tries to redeem herself by volunteering to follow him into quarantine to nurse him back to health--at which time the movie ends.
Ira who really got on the case to find who murdered Harry Regan finding Winston was only secondary for him and gets a lot more then he bargained for including a brutal beating by Lamar ,who he later pays back with interest.
Then, MOTHRA 3, released later that year, bombed at the box office.
He leaves for the north without her, and comes back a year later with a surprise, and sees that Yellow Fever has gripped New Orleans, a peril that threatens everyone.
This wonderful movie co-stars Gregory Harrison, whom she would also act with in the AIDS-drama "It's My Party," and also marks the acting debut of her daughter, Chloe Rose Lattanzi, whom, much later, would become an international singing sensation in her own right.
This is a fun little spoof of the crappy 80's style horror flicks we grew up with... the twist (the same kinda hook that Scream used about five years later) is that the hero is a guy who's seen so many of said crappy horror flicks that he realizes that he might actually be IN a crappy horror flick, then uses it to his advantage.
Twenty years later he is responsible (albeit with a co-author, the much praised playwright Joe Penhall) for this lazily-written film.
Andre de Toth directed this 1954 noir, Crime Wave, starring Sterling Hayden, Gene Nelson, Phyllis Kirk, and Charles Buchinsky, who later became Charles Bronson.
I mean when they follow the "satanic" couple is really bizarre but later they just forget about them in less than a minute and they stop in a restaurant, and it's even more bizarre.
One week ago, when I was re-watching this movie with some friends who had never seen it, we commented on how miserable Josh is - and how sad it was to hear about Renfro's premature death a few days later.
Now, years later, I find myself remembering the oddest parts of this show, mostly the outfits and vehicles.
He gives off a much younger energy (which also made the much later time frame seem odd), but definitely captures the aloofness & arrogance of Holmes.
How absurd can that be -- to save the life of someone who will sooner rather than later be murdered by the Nazis anyway?!
Many years later, Daffy Duck and Donald Duck played it in "Who Framed Roger Rabbit".
While never released to theaters here in the U.S., it made the theaters, perhaps ironically, overseas and, as a result, built the bridge for the bigger-budgeted, more-serious Marvel Superhero movies that came years later and are still to come.
Captain America doesn't even finish one mission before he's frozen in ice, only to be thawed out 50 years later.
It was only later when in college film school that I recogized his true genius.
A year later, Gray is engineering his train, the General, which is then stolen by Northern spies and used to halt supplies to the South.
Dad's favorite part was also mine, the part where Keaton sits down in the conductor's seat to find an obstructing rail car that he just disposed of has miraculously reappeared, and then a moment later he sits down to find that the car has vanished once again.
On the other hand a truly great film will suffer comparison with the best of later eras and so it is here.
These scenes are not only the highlight of the movie but a peak in the history of *moving* pictures, and they put to shame all later back-projection and process shots, models and computer-generated effects.
At one point, the car, which Johnnie thought he had switched to another track, reappears in front of the baffled engineer, only to disappear later just as mysteriously.
Decades later, they've put it out on DVD and I've found it to be almost as good as I remembered thinking it was back then.
In fact I thought their whole set was a major disappointment that I couldn't believe the positive feed back they got in the press later and there was no one more surprised than the band themselves !
Major disappointment aside I still stayed in to watch the rest of the concert most of which I watched on my sister's portable black and white TV and it wasn't until a few days later that I started digesting what a monumental event it was where Queen stole the show with their medley , where Bob Geldof swore live on air ( In those days bad language on television was still very rare ) , the dominance of British music that saw every act at Wembly hail from the British Isles and where a third of the acts at the American concert were also British , and the strange fact within a couple of years many of the acts at Wembly had disappeared from the charts altogether .
Queen was amazing; three friends & I saw their very last show as a group a year later at Knebworth House, 120,000 people were also there too!
The only thing that I wish they'd have done was an up-to-date documentary with some of the acts talking about the event and what it means almost twenty years later.
's entry in the CinemaScope Bible race...  Lana was cast as Samarra, the lightly-clad temptress who incited history's first juvenile delinquent to leave homeÂ   The film was based on the Biblical story of the prodigal son as told by St. Luke in Chapter XV of his gospelsÂ There, in fewer than 300 words is the bare suggestion of a youth who "wasted his substance in riotous living," later to return, repentant to farm and fatherÂ   The screenplay portrayed the prodigal as Micah (Edmond Purdom), the model son of a Hebrew patriarch named Eli (Walter Hampden).
Is that going to be important later on?"
And now fifteen years later, I still believe it.
And now fifteen years later, I still believe it.
USELESS FACTS: Look for Sheri Moon Zombie as Daisy Rain, the first victim; The writers of Toolbox Murders, Jace Anderson and Adam Gierash (who played handyman Ned), were later chosen by none other than Dario Argento to write the screenplay for the long-awaited third installment in the three Mothers trilogy, the recently announced Mater Lachrymarum.
Five years of blissful family life later, and an expedition turns up at the escarpment searching for the plane and any possible survivors.
(we later learn the parents fates).
Five years later an expedition comes into the jungle looking for the plane and some sign of the people on board.
He is later picked up by chimpanzee's before Cheetah takes the infant, offers it to Tarzan (Johnny Weissmuller), who in turn vine swings himself back to the tree house where he presents the child to Jane (Maureen O'Sullivan).
It later shifted over to Turner Classic Movies where its premiered June 4, 2004, Bob Dorian, former AMC host, once profiled this chapter as being the one in which Maureen O'Sullivan, who wanted out of the series, to have her Jane character killed off, but preview audiences objected and a new ending was substituted.
A few years later and he's a boy grown into the guise of Tarzan...complete with Tarzan's abilities to swing vines and talk to jungle animals.
Some weeks later, the donators were invited for dinner, and a showing of Mr.
later, when they think (not talk) about the American car which has been driving on dusty American desert roads since the fifties, and it is a mid-sixty car!
The love these two people shared is so brilliantly displayed by these two leads as is the conflict in the later years of the Fab Four.
The movie sounded interesting when it first came out but somehow I missed seeing it when it came out and, years later when it came to television was really looking forward to seeing it.
Scott isn't nearly as enjoyable as he was in the later "Follow the Fleet," let alone straight comedies like, "The Awful Truth."
It's amazing that Martin's character is based on the same man as Ray Liotta would later immortalize in Martin Scorsese's most brilliant film.
They're both young, full of energy, in very playful moods and seem to have a great time working together (unlike later movies).
I saw "bringing down the house" a week later and the un-natural, rubbish humour Is miles away from this highly entertaining turn.
Diane Keaton, who plays Linda Christie, shows an affinity for what would follow later as she became an invaluable collaborator of Mr. Allen.
Dick later confides in him about the heartbreak he's having over Linda's infidelities and how by neglecting her in favor of his constant business pursuits may very well have had been responsible for them.
Speaking of which, even if flawed with some flat jokes and one-liners, the screenplay has a very natural energy that Woody seriously lacks in his later efforts, an energy that places this movie alongside Sleeper and Take the Money and Run.
The ending is neat without being satisfying, the dream sequences aren't used to their full potential, and some of the rape jokes sound really bad all these years later.
While the film obviously lacks the emotional depth and improvisational style of Allen's later films (the obvious comparison being 1977's "Annie Hall" starring the same three leads), it still has a quaint charm to go with its romantic comedy conventionality.
What eventually happens, along with the Manhattan story line, suggests the Woodman's later real-life escapades.
Just one year later in 'Follow the Fleet (1936)' Â after 'Top Hat (1935)' had made box-office gold of Fred and Ginger Â Scott is similarly relegated to a romantic supporting role, having to settle for Ginger's nondescript sister (Harriet Hilliard).
I'm still thinking about this movie, 15 years later, after seeing it at a local art film movie house in Ann Arbor.
Not all that gimmicky stuff he does in his later shows.
After this show got canned from Fox, it went on to Adult Swim and couple years later I just happened to be watching this show that I used to despise and soon fell in love with it.
To be honest, I find it funnier than The Simpsons at times, because it really plays on how society isn't much improved 1,000 years later.
I base this review upon the five or so seasons that aired before this was cancelled, not on anything that may have come later, including the feature-length releases, which I have no intention of watching.
(we later find out she is in fact a mutant and her parents live underground) Fry runs from Leela after being assigned work as a delivery boy (for he wished for a fresh start) and meets Bender the robot, who is programmed to bend, and has a selfish and indulgent persona, enjoying cigars and alcohol (incidentally the fuel of all robots).
It's hard to believe, looking at this film, that Jean Harlow would be dead a year later.
But later, when they come to the devastated Earth, everything changes.
The music consists of some familiar tunes, including the haunting "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes," sung by Irene Dunne and later danced by Astaire and Rogers, "Lovely to Look At," sung by Dunne and then danced by Astaire and Rogers, "Yesterdays," sung by Irene Dunne, and, of course, "I Won't Dance" - but they do.
Or something...end up being in space while nuclear war happens on earth, only to crash-land on earth sometime later...not MUCH later, but society seems to have changed rather quickly and gotten that dirty Mad Max Punk Rocker type look to it.
As such one can see it as a kind of continuation of George Arliss' DR. SYN (later remade with Patrick MacGoohan as THE SCARECROW OF ROMNEY MARSH).
Newton (here young, vigorous, and not the slave to alcohol he became a decade later) learns that the key is at Jamaica Inn, a desolate, ill-famed hostelry, run by Leslie Banks (this would be Banks' second film with Hitchcock - he'd been in the original THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH).
30 years later I can watch it on tape on TV and still get the same overwhelming emotional bliss knowing what it is doing to me.
Irene Dunne reminds me of Greer Garson in having a certain soulfulness combined with innate gentility and enormous warmth - Dunne also happens to have had a world-class operatic singing voice (that in later movies, as operettas ceased to be appealing, was seldom heard).
But he did this one for Daphne Du Maurier because he wanted to film Du Maurier's Rebecca later on.
It was also after being dumped by his girlfriend, who would later marry his best friend Bob, Elsie Reyonolds-Doe Avedow- and his brother Tim suddenly dropping dead, after having a violent argument with him, that changed Brady's way of thinking.
The character of Joe Flynn, later Captain Binghamton on McHale's Navy is Harry Truman who was a county judge (commissioner) for Jackson County, Missouri and later United States Senator.
Lime invites Martins to join his racket but Martins refuses and later goes on to assist Calloway in capturing his old friend.
It's the One Moment in the film when it seems that time (in a country that makes clocks, something that Lime makes a joking reference to later on) stops dead in its tracks.
Michael Douglas as Steven Taylor is absolutely brilliant and sinister, and the best aspect of this story is that you don't find out why he wants really wants his wife murdered until later in the movie.
As one who served as an MACV adviser (1965) and later in the infantry in Vietnam (1966), I can only echo those that say this is the best Vietnam film ever made.
Platoon is set in the time a few years later when the USA was fully militarily committed in Vietnam.
This film came out the year before 'Apocalypse Now', and possibly that's one reason why it's not so well known today, having been pushed out of the limelight by Coppola's monstrosity which set a disappointing trend for later Vietnam films.
When the final (later) version of the film was released, I realized it's a one-of-a-kind film.
My advice is to stick with Woo's later material such as "Face/Off" or his earlier Hong Kong career such as the gritty cop film "Lashou Shentan" ("Hard Boiled").
She was later in that Brendan Fraser film STILL BREATHING, playing the babe Fraser's character pursued.
I won't be a hypocrite who enjoyed watching attractive Danielle DeLuca run for her life in the nude and then criticize her later for doing a nude role in a B thriller movie.
The crusty, cantankerous and wealthy old man is played deliciously by Charley Grapewin who later turned up in The Wizard of Oz.
Christy Cabanne, the director, would use Wallace or Wally Ford again in his later movie, The Mummy's Hand, in which Wallace Ford gave a wonderful comedic performance in what was also a much better movie.
Grant, whom I found arrogant and repellant later in his career Â not to mention redundant Â is at his suave-and-smooth best here as Walter Burns, newspaper editor,, with the perfect foil in Rosiland Russell.
They are both delightful in this stylish slapstick farce that had previously been filmed as *The Front Page* (and later, again as *The Front Page* in 1974, and as *Switching Channels*).
Unfortunately, I missed a few minutes of the beginning of the film, but I was too hooked into the story to worry about that until later.
As if creating one comedic masterpiece with 1938's BRINGING UP BABY was not enough, director Howard Hawks returned to the same genre a scant two years later - and he somehow managed to rival even his own previous masterwork.
"Salvation" is to "The Crow" what "Batman Forever" is to "Batman", it's like the ugly step sister, you don't wanna see her, but sooner or later ....it's gonna happen.
No doubt that later incarnations of the boys with Parker Stevenson and Shaun Cassidy in the Seventies and later for Canadian television Paul Popowich and Colin K. Gray in the Nineties were good in their day, but Tommy Kirk and Tim Considine will be the quintessential Hardy Boys for this former devoted Mouskaviewer.
He makes friends with 3 girls, Rena, Mion (and later her twin sister Shion), Satoko and Rika.
We later learn that the repeating stories aren't merely showing how things could be different if different choices are made but time is repeating like a macabre version of "Groundhog Day", except that more than a day is repeated.
We later learn that one of the girls is aware of this and is trying to change fate to prevent it from reoccurring, occasionally one or more of the others will remember something too but tends to write it off as a half remembered dream or dÃ©jÃ  vu.
The theme in question appears again in dialogue later in the film.
We see at the start of the movie Tony going into a camera store and buying a pair of binoculars that he later uses to spy, from the safety of a high-rise buildings rooftop, on young women sunbathing in the nude.
Some time later, I see this film by internationally acclaimed human rights director, Rithy Panh.
The sub-plots are genuinely funny, and in some ways this actually reminds me of two later movies rolled into one.
This meant that while he would later draw on Ben Hur for the Star Wars saga, he first achieved success here drawing on his earlier childhood.
The brief introduction of Suzanne Summers & Harrison Ford in this movie were not noticed until years later.
A follow-up film was made showing many of the characters years later.
But even today--decades later--the movie has an incredible tone that has universal appeal.
My favourite moment of the film is when Dreyfuss's character sees an attractive, young blond early on - he later tries frantically to contact her - she eventually does, but just says her dues and leaves him - the boy, instead of being heartbroken or dissatisfied is happy and upbeat - at least he gave it a chance, at least he lived, as my father put it 'the teenage dream'.
Harrison Ford was fine as a young actor, although his acting skills did develop considerably in later years.
Not the burgeoning hippie counter-culture lifestyle that would make headlines later on, but the frenzied materialist, frantically silly and boldly consumerist lifestyle of the 50's, with all its artefacts: fast food and drag racing, high school prom nights and acne remedies.
He wants to break up so they can see other people; but later when they are named King and Queen at the homecoming dance, they are together again where he tries to have sex with her.
Equally poignant were the appearances by the people who weren't performers: at the end of the series, there's a brief meeting with the real individuals who were portrayed in the six episodes, along with a "five years later" update on what actually happened to other characters whose real-life counterparts didn't live long enough (or live free long enough) to participate in the on-camera reunion.
after viewing just the trailer, my sister and i looked at each other and said, "we have to see that..." so, when i found it at blockbuster a few months later, i jumped to rent it.
This was the first film written and directed by M. Night Shyalaman, who would go on to make a film called "The Sixth Sense" a few years later.
Further, even if there was information in the box about the prior marriage, it would never have reached the detail that the boy later disclosed to the widow, and since the boy confronted the widow very shortly after the box was buried, he would not have had time to have read and memorized all the information contained therein.
Years before Jack Higgins would turn the concept into his bestseller (and later still a fine film) called The Eagle Has Landed writers John Dighton, Angus MacPhail and Diana Morgan would take a short story by famed writer Graham Greene (The Third Man, Our Man In Hanvana etc.)
The credits roll with a drive down one of England's 'country lanes' (of which we are later reminded in song during a radio broadcast) as a reaffirmation of the homely way of life that stands in peril.
Indeed, the idea was reprised in a later movie 'The Eagle Has Landed'.
Prequels are always anti-climatic since you know what happens to the main characters later.
The deformed baby is dumped in a garbage container and found by a beggar later, who brings him home.
Easy to see that Disney was doing experimental procedures for PINOCCHIO before its release two years later.
There are movies that I hated at first, but later came to think were quite good, e.g.
Rather they like to concentrate on the couple of brief scenes in which the boy climbs into the bath with Anna, and later kisses her on the lips, both handled with taste, discretion, and restraint.
No where in the league of later works such as Scent of a Women and Glenn Gary Glenn Ross.
"Basic Instinct" got away with copying a lot of this a couple years later, but I prefer "Sea of Love."
A few days later Det.
The inclusion of this scene and the later 'kiss' scene simply add to this feeling of confusion and raw emotion that Anna is experiencing.
You'll be watching a girl finding a corpse still hanging from the knot in one scene and then literally 10 seconds later seeing her again at some place apparently unaffected, smiling and going about.
The premise of the death of a prominent scientist coinciding with the birth of a child and the two "souls" merging ten years later was an intriguing one.
None of the plot makes any sense, characters come and go without rhyme nor reason (in fact Roundtree is killed at one point and then appears again a few scenes later - and he isn't playing Jesus!).
When he made the movie, it was over ten years later where he looked older so the story was less believable.
Murphy was too mature to play himself a decade later.
Many of those actors became recognizable faces from television years later.
Few know that this film was the studio's biggest "blockbuster" until "Jaws" was released 20 years later.
Nothing happens for our heroes in North Africa, but they get their taste of combat in Sicily and later the Italian campaign.
along with Jack Kelly who later attained fame on the "Maverick" television series with James Garner.
A more bitter and savage tone, tempered with American optimism, the kind of attitude that I understand Mr. Murphy actually had later in life, would have worked.
In 1937, a young Audie Murphy (played by Gordon Gebert as a boy, by Murphy himself later) is forced to become the head of a family with an ailing mother and an absent father...
But a few years later, when Final Fantasy VIII came to American shores and I piked it up, I was blown away.
Unfortunately, Fellini in his later years, totally forgot about that significant truth.
Their teacher, Instructor Quistis Trepe, is later relieved of her teaching duties and becomes a SeeD, along with Selphie, Squall, and Zell.
Many people don't like La cittÃ  delle donne, but like 8Â½ and most Fellini movies of the later period it has an extraordinary, instinctive grasp of the rhythm and symbolic power of dreams.
I guess the fact that things are rarely LITERALLY represented in his later movies (post-La Dolce Vita), also contributes towards this, making everything more symbolic and hence, universal.
Perhaps Italy began these a decade or two later than, for instance, Northern European nations, but it got there eventually and in its own special, culturally individual way that can be compared to no other, since Italian men and women are not German or British or Swedish.
The events in Cuba are shown alongside the later events when Che travelled to New York to address the UN, and through this we see Che beginning to emerge both as a tough jungle/street fighter and political orator with intelligence and feeling, finally transforming himself from a doctor with political leanings to a fully fledged revolutionary.
Although it mainly concerns the years between 1955-1962, he splices in events happening later on as Che visits the UN.
The flash forward scenes where Che is interviewed and later addresses the United Nations, help to give the story, and Che, more depth and background, whilst giving us insights into his personality and ideology.
First is The Argentine, depicting Che's leadership in jungle and town fighting that led up to the fall of Havana in the late 50's, and the second is Guerrilla, and concerns Che's failed effort nearly a decade later in Bolivia to spearhead a revolution, a fruitful mission that led to Guevara's capture and execution in 1967.
At that point, Corbucci and his multitude of writersÂamong them Franco Solinas of "A Bullet for the General" and VincenzoniÂflash back to the first meeting between our heroes who later become fast friends.
The Morricone piece which accompanies this stand off Â a triumphant Mexican march which would later be plundered by Quentin Tarantino for Kill Bill Â is also comparable to that composer's work with Leone.
However, while certainly lighthearted in comparison with Corbucci's DJANGO (1966; which I should revisit again in a couple of days) and especially THE GREAT SILENCE (1968), it's a more balanced proposition than COMPANEROS (particularly with respect to Palance's performance - quietly menacing here as opposed to the campiness of the later film) and, thus, superior to it in practically every way.
The graphics are understandably better, being a later installment, but the level of difference between FF7's cartoony, exaggerated characters and FF8's more realistic look is astounding.
Lead Philippe Lemaire is appropriately debonair as the celebrated painter whose life and career take a nose-dive once his wife is no longer able to act as his muse; the actor later worked for Jess Franco and Walerian Borowczyk but, sadly, ended his own life in 2004.
The actress eventually broke into the mainstream with PARDON MON AFFAIRE (1977), a successful comedy later Americanized as THE WOMAN IN RED (1984).
Unsurprisingly, Mulot (who tragically drowned in 1986) later dabbled in porn cinema Â though the obscure crime film THE CONTRACT (1971) is considered as his best work.
In later roles, he would always be the short guy in the group.
I don't know how many times later in life when meeting someone and they heard my last name, they would ask "Did your dad coach little league?
When the championship game is over and the Yankees win, I picture that huge trophy sitting in an apartment years later, collecting dust and being just about as worthless as the wood and plastic it's made of.
When she later meets Murray at the "Bubble Up" Club, she is shown around and realises it is a brothel and the girls were the applicants for the manicurist jobs.
I always have wondered why they never brought that aspect back to any of the later FF games.
Gone are the polygon characters of the 7th game as well, replaced by the more realistic looking characters that will dominate the later episodes of this series.
The documentary "Alien: Evolution" follows the history and production of the wildly successful (well, in the 70's and 80's, anyway) "Alien" franchise, and offers quite a bit of amusing and interesting information about the making of the first film, and, to a lesser extent, the sequels made in later years.
Granted, all of the participants in the Aliens interviews have nothing but glowing praise for the film, but when you get down to the later entries, people have some surprisingly interesting things to say, including H.R.
Herein lies one of a few major flaws in the plot (why would any of the hoods believe Mr. Big and just accept that he's getting his share later, when none of them even knows who Mr. Big is or what he looks like?)
I actually think this film although very overlooked where on the the great noir flicks that launched the entire crime genre cause the mood, the style and the plot can be found in later movies, even the ones made today.
With KCC, these seem _pastiched or quite borrowed (yet they are still functional and did not get the _movieish character of later pastiches that are merely laboratory abstract products)Âbut then again, such the things were the good of a whole era in cinema Â.
The noir is a huge umbrella, encompassing, covering many and various things ,from the bleak, grizzly fatalism to the adventurous, suspenseful thriller to comic books approaches and to the mere police procedural; it refers to a historical cultural phenomenon that began before it is generally acknowledged that it did, and ended later than it is generally admitted.
There are echoes from this movie in such later caper films as The Killing, Plunder Road, and Mark Steven's underrated Timetable.
They succeed in the heist of 1.2 million dollars and escape in a van of the Western Florists, and the mentor of the robbery gives tickets to them to travel abroad, promising to share the money later.
Squaresoft's (now Square-Enix) highly anticipated "Final Fantasy VIII" released in February of 1999 in Japan, and later in September 1999 for the United States and Europe.
Donald is, if anything, more obnoxious and disagreeable here than he was later.
Attempts to locate Peter Pig have been unsuccessful, although there are rumors that he lives in semi-retirement in Encino, having wisely bought stock in Disney and, later, in IBM.
One shocking scene has Farrah getting slapped round by her husband in their bedroom, he throws her on the bed and then unzips his pants practically in her face,(hinting at forced oral sex) She later develops a relationship with a private investigater whom she hires.
Decades later, Martin (under an assumed name) leads a team of private investigators and is hired by government agents to steal a "code-breaking" box from a Bay Area scientist.
The story is way out there, the technical equipment is interesting and lots of it probably still holds up 16 years later, and the cast is great.
It is years later and Bishop (Robert Redford) is a legitimate security consultant who is kidnapped because he has stolen a 'Black Box' which can hack into the most secure and sensitive centers of the world.
This film is superb and extremely forward-thinking... today, eight years later, all of the technology, themes, and allusions still make sense.
Additionally, had it appeared a few years later, after the sci-fi craze began following STAR WARS, it probably would have fared better.
What should have been the second episode - 'Black Sun' - unfortunately went out later in the original run, meaning viewers missed an important plot point - the Moon had passed into a region of space where the normal laws of physics did not apply, hence Dr.Asimov and all those sticklers for scientific accuracy were misinformed in their harsh criticism.
And I still do, as I observed when I saw it again more than 20 years later.
Years later, when I finally got my hands on the box sets of both series, I was destined to be.... disappointed?
Hours later she's shot dead, while caught in the act with the first of her conquests.
Twenty years later in the unfolding story it becomes indeed a razor's edge on which to tread when former wife Elizabeth again encounters John, who is now known as Erik Kessler, middle aged, graying, and has difficulty getting around.
A few day's later, Mrs. Brown gets lost and she turns up with Percy, who brings her back to Herman.
One slight difference is that the footage is coming in via a live satellite feed instead of someone finding film cannisters and viewing them later.
Much better than the split screen versions in later remakes of the 60s and 70s.
Don't expect to see top-billed Errol Flynn (as Miles Hendon) until later in the film, as a supporting player.
In point of fact Edward Tudor ascended the English throne in 1547, the son of Henry VIII and died six years later, not even reaching his maturity.
I'll get to that later.
I think it may come off a tame when compared to the later excesses in Japanese animation, such as post-apocalyptic slug-fest filled with showering viscera, city- leveling psychic children and titanic robots, female ninjas with poisonous naughty bits, and the ever-popular spectacle of sailor-suited schoolgirls having their every orifice explored by the tentacles and other bits of demonic rapists just before they explode in a torrent of offal and demonic DNA, but Golgo 13 has all of them beat for sheer quality entertainment that even your parents might dig.
After mentioning this film in a completely different review, it pops up on the BBC less than a day later.
I saw it at the theater in the early 90's and it still seems fresh 13 years later.
He later turns up dead at the bottom of the penguin pool.
Miss Withers was one of the first screen characters to build on "the little old lady" detectives first introduced by Mary Roberts Rinehart and later to be highly polished - though with fewer comic overtones - in Agatha Christie's Miss Marple tales.
California at that time was totally isolated, and would get the news from the government many months later, thus many people would be for secession, because they did not believe they could be governed like that.
James Butler Hickok, later nicknamed Wild Bill, was in his early twenties.
According to an FBI report several years later, the whole "Satanic child abuse" hysteria was groundless, including reports by women claiming they'd been raised to be "breeders for Satan".
Screenwriter Mark Patrick Carducci, who presumably wrote the senseless dead simple script in about two hours (probably with magic markers, no less), later penned the glorious "Pumpkinhead," which only goes to show that one can really get up from off the floor.
The ravishing Nathalie (Sarelle - she'll later star alongside Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct) is the sole survivor of one of the maniacs' nightly attacks and now they're after her.
This quintessential eighties style is carried over to the sequel, made three years later, and although part two; like many sequels, never quite manages that same verve as the original film - it still offers a good time, and anyone that enjoyed the first instalment (and who didn't?)
The introduction of Superman/Clark Kent as an adult "Superman" is almost word-for-word the same one they used a decade later in the famous television series (i.e.
Years later they teamed up with Carrey again to film "Me Myself and Irene," which was a great movie, but even though the movie was nastier, even though it contained a chicken up a filthy pig's ass, it still couldn't match the wonderful grossness Peter, Bobby, Jim & Jeff provided in one of the funniest films in cinema history.
The script is the most well-written comedy I think ever, because every thing that they do in the movie, leads to something new and funny that ends up happening to them later on.
Compared to Jodorowsky's later films "La Cravate" - the original title refers to the tie worn by Jodorowsky's character - is very harmless and innocent, which also makes it a nice contrast to his other films.
But - as a 12 years old - he tackles very difficult piece by Franz List only to practice (much later in the movie) a very basic,the very beginners drill by Carl Cherny...Worse of all...
When we meet Vitus later on, he decides to rebel by jumping off the balcony of his parents' apartment and survives miraculously.
But as a small child he has a down-to-earth babysitter, Isabel (played by Kristina Lykawa, later by Tamara Scarpellini), and they enjoy hanging out together.
Moments later, another German tank appears and he dispatches that one as well!
The opening scene shows the villain holding a modern fragmentation grenade and two minutes later it turns into a WWII vintage "Pineapple".
When Czechoslovakia was loosening up ten years later, a number of quality movies were produced before the Soviet crackdown, and now that China is, if not being internally liberated, at least sliding sideways into the global village, we're beginning to see some admirably done Chinese films.
A moment later, there is a plume of black smoke.
I can, 25 years later (ouch!)
Look for Talia Coppola (later Shire) as one of the victims.
The film will focus on Alyosha's travels in a minute and careful manner, observing one such instance in which the failure to identify the moment when it is apparently necessary to bribe someone, almost getting caught out and rectifying the situation before applying the said learning later on under different conditions.
This wore out its welcome about 40 minutes into the movie and after the halfway point, about 10 minutes later, I totally didn't care if our girl here was innocent or guilty.
This movie was filmed in 2003 but not released until this year - four years later!
It's now 35 years later and Neeley now a retired L.A police chief is found murdered in his home with it made to look like it was some kind of mob hit.
Okay, George C Scott is the kind of actor that never works on my nerves and he also was the only reason why I kept watching as this movie sucks... You can write thrillers and spionagescenarios but please don't forget that an average watcher cant follow thousand plots in 100 minutes, director John G Avildsen doesn't even give us the time to let us discover who is who as from the moment a new personage appears he ends up being shot three minutes later plus you are wondering what the hell it's all about....
20 years later the romance en nostalgia rapidly wears of.
Still today, I can watch the series premiere (which was also variously released as a TV movie, and even in theaters in Canada, Europe, and later the USA) over and over again.
* quite a lot of cheesy cringe-inducing dialogue  * the little kid Boxie and his robot dog  * some of the episodes had really horrible plot lines, especially later in the series  ---> the Lost Warrior where the kids attack the Ceylon outpost  ---> why did Baltar return to the human fleet again?
Twenty years later, actor Richard Hatch, series creator Glen A. Larson and the Sci Fi Channel are all working on separate Galactica proposals.
Thus 50 years later, the movie remains a timeless humanist classic.
It was the "bluenoses" to the rescue who saved them and the U.S. Navy from themselves, just as they would save the nation from "drink" a few years later.
It seems to be a twisted way to love (more on that later).
Murray Slaughter(Gavin MacLeod)was the married man,who loved Mary without any sinister meaning,Ted Baxter(Ted Knight)was the stupid vain anchor man as the seasons went on,he got funnier and funnier and his character got some depth later with the introduction of a girlfriend,later wife,Georgette,played by the hilarious Georgia Engel.
This was her springboard for Golden Girls later.
30+ years later you still have to reference this show when discussing the Great American Sitcom.
In other episodes we also see Alex so romantic in love with Elen and later hurt because she leaves him for dancing scholarship to France and then he falls in love with Lauren (Courtney Cox).
In later years some nice additions were Scott Valentine as Bateman's weirdo boyfriend, and making numerous appearances over the years was Marc Price as the nerdy next door neighbor, Skippy.
Along the way, Alex develops love interests, first in the form of Ellen (played by the actor's future wife, Tracy Pollan) and later, Lauren, a psychology major.
Full marks for a really solid script on which none other than leading novelist W. Somerset Maugham worked with Lee Strasberg (later to gain fame with his Actors Studio).
Mankiewicz was to do much better, later on.
It weakly conveys that the main character (a boy named Evan Taylor) believes he has some kind of control over the field, but it falls short of the intended correlation to his sensation of "music everywhere" which is better illustrated later in the film.
Throughout the movie characters which seemingly played a big part in the heroine's life just pop up out of nowhere (like the lady who trained Lady Snowblood to be a thief) and are as easily dismissed seconds later.
The sweet-looking "good girl" of the story meets a guy on the roof of a building, sleeps with 20 minutes later.
Nine months later the baby arrives right when the mother has a car accident.
Well, the kid learns about sheet music one day and two hours later he's written compositions that would make Beethoven proud.
I met her many years later in New York City when I was in my early twenties.
It's very poignant to see her dainty little fingers helping Welles unbutton his vest, knowing that her life would later end so tragically.
Working alongside Welles no doubt helped prep her for her famed role opposite Edmund Gwenn in "Miracle of 34th Street" one year later.
Twenty-two years later (and as many years more seasoned) when I pulled out the tapes to view again of the series I had almost taped over several times, I was overjoyed that I had the miniseries intact.
Being away from my own home, I can relate to the importance of letters which later became phone calls and now emails.
Show it at a later time but don't hack up good movies, especially a classic just for someones Puritanical nonsense!
So, moments later, Red Riding Hood is a living pin-up girl and the wolf is a sex-crazed "wolf" on the prowl for such a tasty dish!
And interesting that both Avery and Hill have been targeted in later years for supposedly being "politically incorrect."
Twenty years later, Yuki, the baby girl born in prison, has become a skilled swords-woman, born and raised for the sole purpose to take revenge for the fate of her parents: Shura Yuki Hime - Lady Snowblood... Meiko Kaji is once again wonderful, and it is unthinkable for any other actress to fit in the role even nearly as perfectly as she does.
But years later it dawned on me, (duh!)
He kills one victim and two seconds later he's on top of another and another.
Twenty years and an endless series of devastating fighting lessons later, she's ready to violently slay the three remaining bastards that ruined her life before it even started.
It turned out that Scuzzi letting the boy off without being booked didn't end his problems with him getting shot and killed later in the movie.
It was the 1962 Kurosawa movie "Sanjuro," I believe, that first introduced the "geyser blood" special effect to the world, but 11 years later, Toshiya Fujita's "Lady Snowblood" developed this image to a fine art.
And it gets sillier as it goes on-after the fireman's wife is attacked and left for dead she later makes a complete recovery in the hospital!
Disney created their own animated version of the famous hero years later, but this is much more hilarious fun.
Like many of you, Id never heard the title Lady Snowblood before Kill Bill came out, so when I watched Kill Bill and saw Tarantino mention this film as one of his biggest influences, well I knew I would have to check it out sooner or later.
On the beginning you have a man with great enthusiasm, then he gets more serious because of his job and his middle ages, an then later...
It follows two brothers, who both take different paths, following the progression of Italy through the later half of the 20th centuary.
I later searched for info and realized that the people involved in making the film are not your standard TV movie makers.
Despite the transvestite, I don't think he's gay (all I saw in the episode was self-loathing, and nowadays they would have simply told us so; the day he first flirts with Mirella, despite his holding back, he seems no less enthralled than Nicola will be later).
Franco Basaglia, the revolutionary psychiatrist whose humane and futuristic ideas ultimately shut down Italian asylums in 1979, is mentioned later on as Nicola's role-model but the movie is never preachy or self-righteous about this.
Oh, and don't confuse "A Quiet Place to Kill" with Lenzi's later film "An Ideal Place to Kill" which stars Ornella Muti, Ray Lovelock, and Irene Pappas in a role Lenzi later stated he wished Carroll Baker had played.
It truly IS a thought-provoking film and I love when I can watch a film and still be affected by it, and still be thinking about it, days later.
You can usually tell the "sound stage sound" as opposed to studio sound added later.
But more about those incidents later.
Vowing revenge, Harry and his new partner, not brilliant Human Resources department officer Kate Moore (Tyne Daly) try to catch these suspects, and she later proves resourceful.
Harry having trouble with the top police brass about his unorthodox methods in law enforcement, shooting first and asking question's later,is hardly amused with Kate.
Harry who at first had little respect for his new partner woman cop Kate Moore later was almost in tears when she was gunned down saving his life, for the second time in the movie, by taking a bullet that was meant for him.
"The Enforcer" also included an uncredited cameo of Joe Spano who few years later got an excellent part of Henry Goldblume in the magnificent television series "Hill Street Blues".
She finally does really cover his back later on, but I won't say how or when (no spoiling!).
It is 1) unrealistic that Irene Dunn, missing at sea for seven years, should reappear on the very day that husband, Cary Grant, has succeeded in having her declared dead and then, moments later, remarried in the same courtroom and 2) that Grant's mother would not have attended the wedding; presumably the writers needed Dunne's mother-in-law to be in when Dunne (who naturally would not have known about the new wedding so would have no reason to attend and try to stop it) resurfaced though a little thought could have solved this.
We didn't have a divorced president until Reagan, 16 years later.
His chest is always puffed out, his voice loud and resonant, his gestures flamboyant, everything that was deliberately dropped from his later roles in the Boetticher Westerns.
His eyes light up and even later, in his office, he cannot get the image of Scott out of his mind.
Although the later film does have identical dialogue in parts and James Garner and Doris Day are great in the roles, they just do not to it as good as Cary Grant and Irene Dunne done...er did.
7 long years later, he remarries (to Gail Patrick) - just as Ellen has finally been rescued.
It has Grant almost swoon at the sight of a topless Scott taking a dive, and later has Grant sitting in his office, reliving the moment in his mind.
As the R rated version stands it fails as a gross out flick and then later goes on to fail even completely at the loftier goal of actually being scary.
Lupino's father is played by Henry Hull, who is chiefly remembered for appearing in 'The Fountainhead' (1949), two years later.
If only Negulesco had stayed with this kind of intense dramatic films instead of wasting his time with such later things as the appalling and revolting cream-puff, 'Daddy Long Legs' (1955).
Only later, when a young policeman (Redford) is shot does she struggle between her fears and her desire to aid this poor dying man.
"Lot in Sodom" starts out with a palindrome involving an imagination of Sodom that premeditates both of Kenneth Anger's later works "Inaugeration of the Pleasure Dome" and "Fireworks".
Herbert is in for one the biggest surprises of his life later in the movie when his friend and fellow Hollywood Ten, and fellow prisoner, film director Edward Dmytryk, Sean Chapman, became a friendly witness to the HUAC Committee and ratted out six fellow travelers, members or former members of the Communist party, with him being one of them.This just about sealed Herbert's coffin with no way from him to redeemed himself from his past activities and being branded a "Dirty Commie Rat" for the rest of his life.
Baseicaly a movie within a movie "One of the Hollywood Ten" zeros in on the efforts it took to film and later release the ground-breaking "Salt of the Earth" and how the FBI together with a bunch of paid-off local goons tried to prevent that film from ever seeing the light of day.
For example, later in the production, as Rooney and Kibbee shine each other's shoes, a singular paperboy is added to the background.
Scene I: He is seen modifying his hammer  Scene II: Some time later, he is sharpening a sickle or something (I don't know, maybe he was a commie)  I mean these two scenes would not be included if he had a minor role to play, right?
Sometime later a group of tourists come to the town only to discover the horror of what has happened.
Then a later scene he gains the power to remove a womens head with his own hands making it look pretty easy.
30 years later, two couples end up exploring into Hellgate to find out about the mystery and get more than they bargained for.
One would think, with Cushing's presence and director John Gilling at the helm, that this might be a Hammer film (Gilling later went on to give us such extraordinary Hammer fare as "The Plague of the Zombies" and "The Reptile"), but in truth it was shot at Shepperton, and its creators have done a good job at pastiching the Hammer style.
Years later, in 1960, another variation of the William Burke and William Hare story came to the theaters, but this one (starring Peter Cushing) was not based on the Stevenson novel but the actual crimes.
The film makes a fine, though essentially unpleasant, companion piece to the more literate and subtle THE BODY SNATCHER (1945); the theme was again handled (by another horror veteran, Freddie Francis) a quarter of a century later in THE DOCTOR AND THE DEVILS (1985) - while Gilling himself had contributed to the script of an earlier variation, THE GREED OF WILLIAM HART (1948), starring Tod Slaughter!
Eventually Burke and Hare are captured for their crimes, the latter testifying against his accomplice to save his skin (though he is later pursued and blinded by a hateful mob), while - most disturbing of all - the cruel and calculating Dr. Knox is ultimately pardoned for his own part in the affair.
It was a bad ship, and it ended in a one-way ticket back to Sweden, paid by the Swedish embassy, but, however, there were some Mexican hookers visiting our ship every day during our stay, very friendly and "speakable", but one day when they came aboard one of them shouted "I'm a movie star", and she explained that she had a part in a film called "Crossroads" (later I found out that it was called Back Roads), featuring Sally Field.
What I cannot understand is that by 1984 when this film was made (it was so bad it was quietly released three years later), why did NL not give this film to a reliable director such as Harold Ramis, John Landis, Amy Heckerling, or John Hughes?
In addition, like his later CECIL B. DEMENTED, it's an interesting satire that is a way over the top look at America's fascination with celebrity and how we admire and are fascinated with anyone if they are famous--even the vile and horrific.
NOTE--Like many of John Waters' later films, this one features a cameo by Patty Hearst.
The two plot lines seem completely separate at first and they are nicely tied together later in the film.
This is still a Classic film made in 1958 and ten years later, Boris Karloff passed away to the Higher Stage in the real Spiritual World.
But several months and several 100 movies later, a second viewing(why I wasted my time I don't know) warrants a lower rating.
The next morning Joe is accused by Jennifer of raping and abusing her and is later indited by a grand jury to stand trial.
Unfortunately, the color of the Whitehouse 30 years later is still...well mostly white.
This led to interesting parts for him later on, and he made a great transition to character actor later in life.
Overall I say this movie was a schizophrenic laughingstock seething with the brand of random existential comedy that would be used much later in movies in more recent teen escapades like American Pie.
It certainly is the play that people remember above all his work, even such later classics as THE CRUCIBLE and A VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE.
Although a source of much embarrassment (and biographical revisionism) to Paul Robeson in later years, by the standards of its day Sanders of the River isn't quite as obnoxiously racist as you might think.
Of his later pictures, perhaps only "The Gaucho" tops this one for sheer excellence in filmmaking.
He got his start in the movies in 1908 with the Biograph Company and appeared on screen for the last time 55 years later as Grandpa Spencer in the 1963 film SPENCER'S MOUNTAIN that starred Henry Fonda.
this is a movie i saw with the 5th floor back in the day when it came out at the drive in .... some of the scenes in the movie stuck in my head some 30 years later until i tracked down a 15.00 copy off ebay... re-watched it and now I'm not taunted to find it anymore but do not regret getting this nostalgic scary cult classic... worth the watch BUT you must keep in mind that you have to put yourself in the year it came out to watch it not the year were in... that way you can fully appreciate the special effects that were 'from' the day not today.. because they obviously don't compare... well its definitely worth finding... pay for the copy not original that can run you 200+ dollars from places that actually still have a few... thats all... enjoy...
seeing the film years later it's a really odd and weird film.
Though Rico dies in a fall while trying to escape from testifying, we later see him in a flashback scene recounting how he was present at Mendoza's first "hit" of a cafÃ© owner.
Even Turkus' old boss, William O'Dwyer, who rode Turkus' good work into election as the city's mayor, was later forced to resign among charges of massive corruption and mob connections.
The historical context loosely linking the plot to Murder, Inc. hardly diminishes the ability of the film to hold up as an edgy crime suspense drama some 55 years later.
Steiger's performance is at once theatrical (while contained enough not to descend into the ham of later roles) yet convincing - and the existence of similar fraudsters like Robert Maxwell only adds to the credibility.
It's a ramshackle comedy from Universal, megged by Robert Z. Leonard (later a fixture @ M-G-M), starring his soon-to-be wife, the largely forgotten Mae Murray.
"Emergency Landing" (inappropriately re-titled "Robot Pilot") is an unimpressive vehicle for Mr. Tucker, who would find later success in television's "F Troop".
But, whereas Pirahna was created as a fun, tongue in cheek, little thriller that knew to cleverly mock its source material all the while winking at the audience, the good folks at the Asylum only wish to cash in and worry about product quality later...much later.
This guy who is horn-dogging on the arguably good looking photographer notices it (he later gets killed by a giant scorpion in a cave when the scorpion puts it's stinger through his chest cavity).
While this film isn't quite as good as a few of his later films (such as City Lights), this is still a good film and very lovely to watch--with a real artistic touch by writer/director/director/musical score creator and actor Chaplin is truly outstanding!!
HARRY CROCKER is good as the romantic foil for Merna Kennedy, a tightrope walker whose act is later performed with even more daring results by Chaplin in one of his best acts.
The singing was added to the film by Chaplin some 40 years later.
I will not see The Circus until many years later when I saw it again on television.
At that point he readily confesses to the crime and later signs a confession.
If this were true everyone who had ever put someone in a coma and then the victim died some years later could be retried.
Before he shoots his wife, who has just returned home from a weekend's assignation with her lover (who later turns up as the policeman dispatched to the house as a hostage negotiator), Hopkins' character tells her he loves her.
Her policeman/lover is cheating on his own wife and kids, responds unprofessionally at the scene of the crime and by taking Hopkins' confession despite blatant conflict of interest, and later plants fake evidence.
I think that Nikki's purpose in the movie was to introduce Willy to her father, a judge, whose help he would desperately need in one of the later scenes.
In his later movies, the characters he plays are complex and real--so much so, that there's a blur between the character and the actor.
There's a fine action sequence involving pursuit on the Chicago Metro and later in a parking lot with McQueen trying to apprehend Thomas Rosales, Jr. who is one real psycho.
However, he fails to kill her: she falls into the sea surrounding the facility, and is later found washed up on the beach by two cousins.
When an assassin and later another being of her kind are sent to destroy her, we witness the murderous Lucy emerging once more, only to transform back into Nyuu once the violence is over.
It's naturally quite fitting for a tale that is later marketed as one of tragic romance and a representation of the level of cruelty which humanity is capable of.
I didn't know what to expect from Elfen Lied, just by chance I came across the first episode, countless hours later I had watched the entire 13 episodes and the OVA and knew I had just seen something special.
Yes, the show is quite violent, but this violence underscores these themes well and as we later learn, is not merely just a product of instinctual brutality.
A must see to see how the magic of Rajesh Khanna, Kishore Kumar and Rahul Dev Burman worked in the early 1970s to be later spoiled by Amitabh Bachchan and his trend of action movies.
In her later years she takes care of her dying husband.
Sebastian (Aaron Patrick Freeman) along with his girlfriend Talia (Danielle Hartnett) & an idiot named Cousin Ted (Robert Berson) also turn up later on to join the party.
ok maybe not really but it sure felt like it the first 60 or 70 times i saw it as a kid on cable i loved this movie cause it was so freakin funny i watched it over and over and over again laughing myself hysterical every time and then when i saw it like 15 years later i laughed so hard i broke a rib laughing ok maybe not really but it sure felt like it ya know what i'm sayin
Back in April of this year I heard that The Worlds Greatest Lover was going to be on AMC and I was like yes I'm finally going to get to see this movie, I'm a big Gene Wilder fan so.....yeah, anyway the only problem was that it was going to come on at 3 in the morning on a Monday which was a school night for me so I asked my mom to record it for me, so when I came home from school I saw it and thought it was awesome, two or three months later I ordered the DVD off of Barnes and Nobles and I now have it on DVD what I had heard from this movie was that Gene not only stars in this movie but writes, directs, produces, and surprisingly wrote a song for the film as well, I think Gene's take on Rudolph Valentino was pretty cool and I think he came up with some clever ideas like "histerical laryngitis" and sticking your tongue out or twisting your words around whenever his character is nervous.
This movie is an exceptional slice of paranoia and mood undeniably influenced later films The Shining and The Thing.
But at least the second movie didn't come out like, 10 years later out of the blue, with different actors, and a lame plot with main characters not even related to the originals at least.
The music is great and was later used as backdrop for short films.
Also, we get to see Sidney Toler(who later became Charlie Chan) playing a Chan-like policeman; J. Carrol Naish, who starred as a gangster in many later films; Mary Astor, a star of "The Maltese Falcon", who showed some of the great facials she did in that film; and of course, and early Ginger Rogers.
It's also a set-up for a later payoff.
Forty, fifty years later, these films remain gritty, fun, exciting and entertaining as they ever were.
Her despicable stepfather Lucas Cross (Arthur Kennedy, who at this stage in his career masterfully portrayed drunken lowlifes), rapes her (which results in a pregnancy which Selena later miscarries), and her mother Nelly (Betty Field), who also happens to be the MacKenzie's maid, discovers this and commits suicide.
Lana's testimony at Cheryl's trial was seen as a direct parallel to her performance as Constance in the courtroom scene in the movie, and in later years, Crane revealed that her mother's husband prior to her involvement with Stompanato, Lex Barker, was molesting her, another coincidence that did not go unnoticed by Crane when she first saw the movie.
The cast is headed by fine character actor, Lloyd Nolan, newcomers Diane Varsi, Hope Lange and Lee Phillips (who later became a reliable director of television films), the underrated but highly talented Russ Tamblyn, perhaps Lana Turner's best performance, and the always engrossing Arthur Kennedy.
In fact, heated passion can be sensed underneath her aloof, icy-cold exterior - a chill factor even more effective 2 years later in "Imitation of Life".
Selena is raped by Lucas and later she aborts the child while escaping from Lucas.
Now, almost 50 years later, it's considered a great literary novel and taught in colleges!
By chance, I worked with the director, Jerrold Freedman, many years later.
Some years later, he returns as Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio), gets closer to Bill, becomes his protÃ©gÃ©e and meets Jenny Everdeane (Cameron Diaz), who becomes his mate.
From that point onwards we know that the story will end years later with a confrontation between the two protagonists so there's no more dramatic twists for the story to take .
Maybe I'll change my rating later on if I see the film again.
After seeing it several more times years later I fell in love with the film and it is in my top 20 film list.
It's one of those films that you think is funny, but when you recall it at a later date, its even funnier.
One uncooperative child opposes the Dr. early on and later demonstrates peculiarly and emphatically what, exactly, in Dr. Kellogg he found repulsive.
With its clean interior ship design, crew neck uniforms all round, glide doors, shiny deck flooring as well as a 15-year mission to seek out new life, Ikarie may have given later pause for thought for a certain Gene Roddenberry.
A flash-forward to when (infected by the same source, as we learn later), one of the crew is wandering, bewildered and aggressive, through the ship.
But viewers who are interested in a story will be more than rewarded with a complex drama about a group of humans off in search of a brave new world to populate, with an ending sequence that is perhaps the most provocative element of the entire film -- and would later find form again in Mario Bava's PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES, albeit in a different manner.
the actors act like there acting in quicksand also it remind me of Home Alone 15 years later... All in all it o.k to watch if you have nothing to do and I do mean nothing.. One more thing if you're Brandon Lee fan, the main actor could pass for his long lost brother bad-actor-Lee... Bruce Lee be glad this guy isn't your son.....
This feature accomplishes perfectly what GREEN GRASS OF WYOMING failed to do four years later - both deal with similar subjects: adolescents training to bring horses to trotting race success.
The two had only performed together on film on one prior occasion, dancing to George Gershwin's 'Babbitt and the Bromide' in the penultimate act of Zeigfeld Follies in 1946 and now thirty years later these two screen dancers were set to have the time of their lives.
This was Fred's last ever dancing on film of which he said later, "that wasn't dancing, that was just moving around"  I especially liked the finale when they reel off a long list of the movie stars who have featured in the compilation all done to music and all done in rhyme.
It would have been funnier if the Oscar buzz was a complete construct WITHIN the set of "Purim", and then later, the realization there was no Oscar buzz at all.
Sooner or later, it was bound to happen.
The plot, for what it's worth, concerns a film within a film: the making of a new movie, the ethnically freighted "Home for Purim," which is later rewritten and retitled "Home for Thanksgiving" to broaden its commercial box office appeal.
The Isle of Wight has long been notable for being the last performances of both Jim Morrison (he would be gone within a year) and Jimi Hendrix, who died less than three weeks later.
Because later it gets just a bit annoying.
Probably this movie will have a later US remake.
Writer-director Robert Harling, working from another novel by Larry McMurtry, probably bears most of the blame, but were audiences even eager to embrace a follow-up to "Terms" 13 years later?
This is 13 years after the first and the storyline is pretty much that amount of time later, maybe a little more because Melanie is pretty much grown up as well.
So when some of the cast came back 13 years later, it can lose some of its box office draw.
By the way, director Milestone and Louis Walheim would team up just a few years later for another WWI picture, the great ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT--a film that is definitely NOT a comedy.
I thought this movie was surprisingly good and came closer to capturing the flavor of Burroughs' later Tarzan novels than anything else I have seen.
The puppet-animation, which looks remarkably similar to the later puppet-animation of Rankin/Bass, is exquisitely detailed and beautiful.
While skinny-dipping in the river nearby, they are met by a couple of nutty backwoods hoodlums, Levon(James Keach, Mr. Jane Seymore;"Moving Violations" and "Wildcats") and Danker(David Pritchard)who later proceed to attack them into the night.
Every once in a while the plot screeches to a halt while a young woman sings (fairly well) and then two or three minutes later the plot gets back in gear.
They are seen skinny dipping by two backwoods idiots (one played by James Keach in an early role)who later return to rape the female.
(Jenny sees Robert as a friend, and sooner or later Robert would have figured that out.)
Strange Peter Hooten, then later getting (sort of) raped by James Keach.
Later, back at Englund's cabin (no, he's still not home), Baumann and Hooten finally get it on - and are awakened later by Keach and his buddy who've dropped by for some forced copulation.
The videotape dates from 1986, and since Robert Englund (who later played Freddy Kreuger) appears in it (albeit briefly, towards the end), the title is probably meant to suggest A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984).
The plot though, is hacky and takes nonsensical twists and turns (we see the main character fooling around with the blonde bimbo in the hot tub, then later she tells the girlfriend nothing happened, its just silly).
The story is OK with an aging Coop showing he's not yet over-the-hill and a young Richard Webb, later TV's Captain Midnight.
They are so popular that years later they are called back to do a reunion, in which they are being honored, to perform for a new generation.
Jack opposes Locke's stance for a long time in later seasons, but eventually Jack realizes that this conversation was where he should've started listening to Locke.
All in all, good period fun, even this many years later.
Ma Bell would not receive such a lampooning again until the equally brilliant Lily Tomlin appeared as Ernestine, the telephone operator, nearly thirty years later.
champion of food contests that eats kilos of food in few minutes to throw up it all a bit later in order to eat some more kilos again!
You might have guessed it already (as I had): our anti-hero is sexually drawn towards all of that freshly slaughtered bloody dripping flesh, so later that evening he decides to lie on what's left of the porker and - but what else?
Cut to around 20 years later; the second story begins.
His empty head gets lopped off, the right arm is severed, and some time later he is discovered by one of his customers who then proceeds to display this "work of art" in some trendy museum.
I was pleasantly surprised by how much cultural roots still show up in Black American culture hundreds of years later.
I found the beginning of this Harold Lloyd vehicle a bit weak (the first person to watch the tape, not a silent film regular, later told me he had given up after ten minutes, and I can understand why), and compared to later films it seems very heavy on the intertitles.
In the meantime a publisher whom he sends the book to rejects it, but later changes his mind when he finds his staff roaring with laughter over Harold's described romantic technique.
This film is so good, that years later Harold Lloyd was hired in the 1960's as a consultant for another film which borrows from this one & goes on to win Best Picture.
A little later, a very sweet and unspoiled rich girl, by chance, meets Harold and they are both smitten.
Well, Harold finds out later that his book WILL be published and that she is to web this scoundrel, so with no time to lose, he races to stop the wedding.
Only the chases in two later Lloyd silent comedies would duplicate it - but not beat it as the best of the three.
His acting range was the broadest and his characters were never quite as vaudevillian--Harold Lloyd's everyman persona still rings true 80 years later.
One episode is so good it was copied decades later in THE GRADUATE.
Because of this I await anything she might now be doing, twenty years later.
The Ninja Squad is another Godfrey Ho Ninja flick that's so bad it's entertaining like the previous ones and the ones that came later.
), years later Billy returns home to his family.
Even as we move to the later films, there is also the Marx's brilliant sense of surrealism and absurdity, far beyond the capabilities of anyone else.
THE BIG STORE starts out with setting up a sort of precursing of that which would come later: like, Chico's being a poor, but honest and lovable piano teacher; in cahoots with one young Singer/Song Writer/Good Guy, Tommy Rogers (Tony Martin); who just happens to be inheriting half interest in a big, major downtown type Department Store.
Groucho, especially, did well on the Old Time Radio and later on the new medium of Television.
Tony Martin has a song early on in the film that's okay, but doesn't exactly fit the tone of the film, and later, he does another "big musical production number", called "The Tenement Symphony", that is bizarre, to say the least, but not particularly funny.
And the later scene with their girlfriends (well ... blow-up dolls, actually) gets me laughing just thinking about it.
As a result, the film had a few adult themes (such as adultery and violent murders) that you just wouldn't have seen a few years later--or they would have been severely censored--lessening their impact.
Ironically, upon killing this friend, Robinson inherited the man's fortune AND custody of his young daughter--with the intention that Robinson later marry the girl!
While everything seems just fine after they marry 20 years later, eventually this lady (Young) is seduced away from Robinson--not a smart move considering Robinson is a skilled assassin with a hatchet!!
I later discovered (from reading about it on the internet) that many hard-core porno movies would also shoot an alternate soft-core version for cable TV, and these movies would be released with different titles.
In the original, Noin sounds like she's 18-20 (depending upon whether you watch the early episodes, the later episodes, or Endless Waltz), and Zechs doesn't sound much older than 22.
20 years later Liv and Emma find themselves engaged and hire Wedding Coordinator extraordinaire Marion St. Claire (classic Candice Bergen).
Years later, an unfortunate series of events ends in both the women - still BFF well into their twenties (like duh) - setting their wedding day on the exact same date.
We don't even get to see how the crime unfolds fully at the beginning but there is a good reason for this as later becomes obvious.
It certainly boasts the best later performance by Richard Boone as a washed-out detective and a knock-down performance by Michael Dunne as his side-kick.
Years later his two daughters use the device to become hired assassins and get away with all their crimes.
Logically, I wanted to see the sequel and therefore decided to rent it on DVD a few days later.
Anyway, as for the film, I think the makers of the film are so intent on steering the film away from the predictability of most sports films, ie player/team starts off badly, then ends up winning an hour and a half later (well you all know what happens) that it leaves out any real moments of drama or tension.
The atmosphere isn't as thick and foreboding as his later film, The Spiral Staircase, and the tone is typically Universal in that it's 'fun' - but the film is continually dark and sinister, which is nice.
In a later scene when Ben 'walks, runs' to her home late at night, the viewer learns there must be some distance between the two homes.
If I don't say much about the story, it's not because I want you to find out, but because it would be useless (you'll probably get what I mean, later).
However, towards the later seasons, it seemed that the show became too preachy with its public service tone.
Heck, after a while, you even grew to like Asten--especially since he mellowed and was less of a paper-pushing bureaucrat in later episodes.
Son of Dracula is different from the standard Horror flicks of the 40's and that is why it works and continues to stand out 64 years later.
There is even, especially in the later portion of the film, a heavy influence on the soundtrack by Bernard Herrman, who was the composer for most of Alfred Hitchcock's films, among many others.
Who can resist her otherworldly gaze, as, staring outside of the frame, she smoothly articulates her certainty in telepathy, eerily chiding Miss Ankers for scoffing at ESP, and later her asperity at local gossip: "What can they know of these occult matters?-blind fools!"
I mention Hitchcock because his Vertigo some four years later has striking resemblances to work in here, not copies of course, but certainly genre staples being noted me thinks.
You just imagined her with a backbone of steel, a perfect feminist heroine, most especially in her later roles.
He's unwilling to commit to a serious relationship with Joan at the beginning of the film, but later he sweeps a much younger lady (Joan's step-daughter) off her feet and when confronted admits that much of her appeal is her money!
They hate each other in the beginning, become friends later and are estranged again.
What is particularly shocking about this film is the way in which director, Curtis Bernhardt baits his audience with snippets of murderous intent that are played out for maximum effect and then, later exposed as merely the ravenously dangerous thoughts of the film's protagonist.
Note that this happens literally just moments later.
I was really very surprised to hear that his favorite things are, respectively ***SPOILER*** Philly Cheese Steaks (although we later learn that he likes those big New York pretzels) and purple ***END SPOILER*** His daughter Milla, played by Brynn Lucas, is a naive, young girl who wants to love her father, despite him not really knowing her.
Is this why the "news chopper/Russian gunship" they blew up later in the "film" with their "high tech visual effects" rocket launcher looked so strikingly similar.
This film, which re-creates the story, was produced commercially, initially for showing on Quebec TV, but later for release to cinemas, and eventually for sale in what appears to have been very limited quantities (possibly only in a French language version) as a VHS home video tape.
The heavy in the film is played by the young Humphrey Bogart, in what must have been one of his first significant roles, and he is menacing and intense, just as he would be a few years later in PETRIFIED FOREST.
in the first half of the movie there is an extended sequence about vito genovese's time in italy something that seems completely disconnected from the rest of the plot, no hints are given about his actual connection to luciano and his role in the Gene Giannini hit shown later in the movie.
We never see what they do to him but he emerges nearly three hours later, a pale white zombie scared rigid by what he has experienced.
Second theme is domed love   which in this movie is rather short, more of this later.
On the face of it seems just a simple farce with clichÃ©d characters but it does then start exploring the characters more deeply in the later part of the film.
His regret later in the film about not doing the deed himself just makes the whole situation sadder.
Then there's Gutierrez (Al Lettieiri), the Mexican Federale - you mean to tell me that he gets shot off his horse, does a forty foot swan dive over a cliff, and some time later manages to get up and walk away?
This film adaptation of said book followed two years later.
Director Tom Shadyac saw fit to put the Man with the Rubber Face, later The Man on the Moon, in his own starring vehicle with this comedy hit from 1994.
This is not the type of movie that is likely to win any awards, but you will remember the hilarious dialogue and Jim Carrey's immediately recognizable rubber-faced antics in this film that served as a spring board to his career, which later brought us many more excellent movies.
Iago escapes from the lamp, and Jafar later gets released by the TV series' best villain, Abis Mal.
Movies about the Depression that were actually made at the time of the Depression by people who knew of what they spoke by necessity feel so much more authentic than later movies that treat the Depression as a historical event.
Perhaps even more troubling, its sense of his humanity has much more to do with a feel good Californian in the later 20th century (refer to Dogma's "Buddy Jesus") than it has anything to do with a first century Middle-Easterner.
Stephen and his son later head out to Mohab to locate the real killer, who happens to be a schizophrenic who believes himself to be a new Noah, having built himself an Ark and have collected two of every living thing.
Rosa (Malisa Longo) joins him a moment later; Rosa was the girlfriend of Don Vito and she was cheating on him with one of his crime lieutenant because she wanted to have sex with young meat.
Two years later, his son returns to town from prison and plots to single-handedly avenge his father as well as to recover his girlfriend Rosa who got claimed by Don Vito.
I love this sordid little Columbia "B" which plays a key role in the evolution of the American Film Noir into the Italian Giallo cycle and helped (along with 1957's THE GIRL IN BLACK STOCKINGS) pave the way for Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO a few years later.
I didn't have long to wait, tho: PSYCHO (and later the giallo) were just around the corner!
Oswald, as many might recall, later went on to produce and direct many of the more stellar episodes of TV's "Outer Limits" in the early 60s.
THEN, later in the film he repeated this sequence AGAIN!!!!
Fortunately for the studio, this film was not released since they knew it was a bomb and it was later released on cable and video.
Years later that scenario is replayed again, but conducted by the late scientist's now grown son who has become an evil sorcerer.
It is 1) unrealistic that Irene Dunn, missing at sea for seven years, should reappear on the very day that husband, Cary Grant, has succeeded in having her declared dead and then, moments later, remarried in the same courtroom and 2) that Grant's mother would not have attended the wedding; presumably the writers needed Dunne's mother-in-law to be in when Dunne (who naturally would not have known about the new wedding so would have no reason to attend and try to stop it) resurfaced though a little thought could have solved this.
We didn't have a divorced president until Reagan, 16 years later.
His chest is always puffed out, his voice loud and resonant, his gestures flamboyant, everything that was deliberately dropped from his later roles in the Boetticher Westerns.
His eyes light up and even later, in his office, he cannot get the image of Scott out of his mind.
Although the later film does have identical dialogue in parts and James Garner and Doris Day are great in the roles, they just do not to it as good as Cary Grant and Irene Dunne done...er did.
7 long years later, he remarries (to Gail Patrick) - just as Ellen has finally been rescued.
It has Grant almost swoon at the sight of a topless Scott taking a dive, and later has Grant sitting in his office, reliving the moment in his mind.
Even in his drug addled later days he at least seemed to be connected to the action, here he seems to be in another film entirely.
Brady, who later won an Oscar as Mrs. O'Leary in "In Old Chicago" is the stereotypical temperamental diva who forms her own opera company and keeps changing the premier opera every five minutes.
So Bugs' personality is not as honed and developed as later outings and the design of the character is a bit off.
Aging star Joan Crawford took to stretching the years later in her career and this is a prime example.
"Queen Bee" is camp at its highest elevation, with a script full of nasty one-liners that would later become staples of catty nighttime soaps like Dynasty and Dallas.
The story reminded me a bit of the Lion King, the cartoon by Disney two years earlier .. also it was about a (sort of) king-to-be which goes away to another place, only to return to the hometown sometime later with a lot of vengeance towards a lot of people.
This movie stunned me when I first saw it, so I went and saw it again two days later.
And then couple of months later, you don't even remember if you watched the movie or not.
His soldiers are later dropped into the Columbian jungle where they begin their campaign with Dafoe running as their control officer from the city, reporting back to Bob Ritter, CIA's Deputy Director of Operations.
40 years later, after the mayor's death, Mordecai threatens a grand return.
In fact, the initial depiction of Egypt is so breathtaking, that it seriously hinders the film's later efforts to vilify it.
Two kids unwittingly release this evil & 40 years later it's ready to rampage over the earth.
I hoped that they just had to have taken some action and made a difference sooner or later before the movie ended!
Forty years later, as the locals prepare to mark the anniversary of Desbaria, the town that was built to replace Marienbad, a series of strange deaths occur which suggest that Salas, trapped deep beneath the water for so long, is about to surface.
Forty years later, in the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of Debaria Dam, the teenager Antonio (DamiÃ  Plensa) vanishes in the lake while swimming with his girlfriend Susana (Pilar Soto) and their friend Clara Borgia (Charlotte Salt).
even now, years later, i vividly remember how a gangster boss gets shot up: first, they cut the power and come in with infrared goggles and shower everything in bullets, then the bad guys catch on and put on their own nightvision gear - they are prepared, of course.
This movie tell us the history about a Man who was born in a small town in Mexico at 1880, He was left by his father when his mother died, 20 years later, he got to Santa Julia, another small town near to Mexico city, he went to find a better life, with few money and helped for her aunt, he join the Mexican army, but he discovered that they wasn't fighting against another army, they fought against people, people who disagree the government, an antidemocratic government.
I wish Chabrol would have figured out a way to combine this rawness with his usual suavity in later films.
Kurahashi Masami, as far as I've read, wasn't there when Ooishi Tomoko died, so I'm not sure what will happen later in the novel, and how Masami became so central in the second half.
This moment must be as pointedly misogynist as his later acts of violence; for here he equates his lover with sex, temptation, and whoredom --ostensibly to test his purity and his ideas of freedom, but, in effect, he is using her to provoke her own demise.
This short is a warning against rushing headlong into a marriage that may be sweet and nice in the beginning, but later on will make the lockhorns look good.
These days, however, it's marry now - divorce later.
Perhaps it's the extra touch of authenticity Crawford brings to her portrayal (Mary Tyler Moore played a later version of this upscale shrew in Ordinary People; then of course there's always Martha Stewart).
Inexplicably, just moments later, the ladies take a break and a couple of them take off their clothes to take a swim--including the one who couldn't swim in the previous scene!
This movie was one the first movies i watched and I loved it then and I love it 10 years later.
This wonderful girl, who I became fan later is really funny and totally different of the kind of characters she would became specialist later.
Twelve years and hundreds of movies later, I still think it's wonderful.
While the movie is written by Amos Powell (of Croman's "Tower of London" fame) and David Lee Fein (who later would write "Cheerleader Camp"), the film is obviously the brainchild of ZacarÃ­as himself, as he wrote the source story the script was based on.
(We later discover that she is pregnant from this encounter.)
Dame Kiri, a few moments later, sang the world premiere of his new song, "The Heart is Slow to Learn," intended for the sequel to his magnum opus, "The Phantom of the Opera."
The film suggests that this is where the historical myth of whites being victimized by Indians originated, later carrying over to dime novels and movies.
Nikki Cox was interesting and a lot "realer" than in her later teen sexpot role in that "Married With Children" ripoff.
At only 17 years of age, and from humble origins in Vicksburg, Mississippi, she composed one of the most moving poetic tributes you're ever likely to hear--to the legendary Paul Robeson--and she had the opportunity to read it to him when they met years later.
At only 17 years of age, and from humble origins in Vicksburg, Mississippi, she composed one of the most moving poetic tributes you're ever likely to hear--to the legendary Paul Robeson--and she had the opportunity to read it to him when they met years later.
This movie came out one year after Stagecoach, which made Wayne a star but he didn't become a big star until Red River eight years later.
A year later in Stagecoach he tried something similar but the action was much more focused on the Ringo-Dallas story.
Still a decade later Latina love goddess Keisha (THE SEDUCTION OF JENNIFER) would portray Peaches as merely inexperienced and therefore vulnerable to those predators around her in the wonderful PRETTY PEACHES III : THE QUEST.
Clearly, this is not the more controlled Mr. Spock we would see in later episodes like "The Doomsday Machine", but it's still a good performance and the script provides an interesting set of problems to watch the usually unflappable character try and overcome.
Magnum is, as his name suggests, the kind of guy who shoots first and asks questions later.
Some of the well written dialogue sticks and many of the scenes stay with you several days later.
The most likable of the characters is Thomas's classmate and later girlfriend, Jackie, played by Gemma Ward.
A ceremony to celebrate their bond and spiritual union goes wrong, but later they do it again.
are made up of relative unknowns (at least for that time),but one cast member is Bill Macy,who would become famous for being a regular in the television series,'Maude' some years later.
Quai de Brumes, made just one year later (in 1938) is a stand-out example and small wonder it is unforgettable even today.
The film was written by Jacques Prevert and directed by Marcel Carne, who later collaborated on two classics of cinema (not just French cinema), Quais des Brunes and Children of Paradise.
How bizarre..." The bishop decides to stay overnight, and later he calls Scotland Yard...   ...and causes more mistaken identities, more coincidences and more conflicting motives than you can shake your head head.
An absolutely wonderful Carne/Prevert jeu d'esprit that owes more to the modernist whimsy of a Rene Clair than the claustrophobic pessimism of their later works.
Much later I went and saw 3 or 4 plays that Sejavka had written or directed.
As a bonus, you won't find a much better soundtrack - Iggy Pop, The Boys Next Door (later the Birthday Party), Brian Eno, Gang of Four, Dogs In Space (Hutchence and other actors/musicians from the film) and Melbourne locals of the day.
It shows a dangerous irreverence to authority figures (Grenier screws his prof and later jumps out of an FBI window).
Even a quarter century later, I weep everytime I watch Mr. Hurt and Mr. Hopkins in their roles.
Just been TV screened and I'm blown away once more - 35 years later!!
A few racial epithets later and we realize the man is (a) black and (b) possibly innocent of the crime he is accused of.
But when he starts talking to a guy who he dosen't know he becomes interested in him and minutes later discovers that he is talking to his dad, who has been dead for thirty years.
A month later it was repeated and my wife and eldest child sat and watched it with me to see what all the fuss was about.
Jim Caviezel ("The Thin Red Line") plays his son, now a cop, thirty years later.
30 years later the same event happens on the same day in 1999.
Note that there is also a Japanese film named Rasen (aka Spiral, 1998) which was meant to be a "Ring 2", but that was later superseded with the 1999 Ringu 2.
Yet I found myself watching it a couple weeks later, what else am i gonna do at one on a Saturday night.
Shue portrays a lonely wife and, later, a seemingly heartless mother.
In the case of "One Way Passage", eight years later the film was remade with George Brent and Merle Oberon ("'Til We Meet Again (1940)").
However, nothing is mentioned in these comments about it being remade only 8 years later as Till We Meet Again, with Merle Oberon and a wonderful (but I think quite underrated) George Brent.
Both picture are excellent, but I feel the later one, in so many little ways (aside from the pivotal detective role) is just better.
His later movies, especially in the Busby Berkeley musicals of the 1930s, emphasized more silliness, but "One Way Passage" shows more of what McHugh can really do when given the opportunity.
And now, almost 75 years later, One Way Passage can still hold a viewer's attention with its story of some passengers on a last voyage before everything changes.
Where Powell and his later partner Myrna Loy exemplified sophisticated humor several years later at MGM, Powell and Francis were a romantic couple.
Her later films, "Dragon Seed" and "The Search", are perfect examples of what a gem she was as a performer.
The music score, later heard in the background of many a Warners "B" film, is classic.
Though later I became a fan of Fellini's previous and subsequent films, Satyricon remained my favorite and I regard it as THE high-point in Fellini's career.
Beginning with Button's friendship early on when he befriends a little female Daisy(wonderful performance from Cate Blanchett)and many years later as Benjamin starts to gain his youth he once again meets up with Daisy along the way after she's became a successful ballet dancer and the two will develop a passionate romance and love story that anyone would dream of it was just so true and simple.
I won't go that far into detail but you'll see much later into the film.
He gets abandoned by his father, who shows up later and gives Benjamin everything he owns.
He comes back later.
Unable to sleep, they meet each night for tea and good conversation (and later, sex).
Two hours later I was wide awake!
She would later play a small role with SINATRA in SOME CAME RUNNING.
There are two very important approaches in this film: the first, of course, is president Kennedy being shot some years later.
Another point is the idea of household trapped in their own home, very well explored in 'The Desperate Hours (1955)', therefore, one year later.
When the lead actress in the play dies, killed by a younger Sadako (who is more like the ghoul from the first two films - it's confusing, but things are explained later), Sadako is given her role, much to the distress and suspicion of her fellow actors.
Along with the athletic sequences in his later movie College, these scenes offer the most sustained focus on Buster's extraordinary physique and what he could do with it.
After seeing this movie, I've been thinking at "Fire and Loathing in Las Vegas" :) "Cocksucker Blues" was the title of a song Mick Jagger wrote to be the Stones' final single for Decca Records, as per their contract, but the track was refused by Decca and only released later on a West German compilation in 1983, although the compilation was discontinued and re-released without the song.
Why not let today's audiences, more than three decades later, take a view into the unfiltered time capsule?
It is a triumph of style over substance, though the substance comes damn near close to the style of Scorsese's direction that is later seen in his other triumphs (you get the feeling you've seen every type of shot before in this film if you've seen other Scorsese pictures).
So, overall this isn't a masterpiece, but Scorsese was definitely showing the sensibility that he brought to his later movies.
The greatness is apparent right out of the gate with his very first feature film; all the classic Scorsese elements are already firmly in place, even if the film is not quite as compelling as later works.
It wouldn't be long before Scorsese could spin a plot that was up to the par of his technical skills; Mean Streets (1973) is in the same league as later efforts like Taxi Driver and Goodfellas, and it's a great showcase for a much younger De Niro (who was on point right from the start of his relationship with ol' Marty).
The narrative structure reminded me a lot of Fellini's I VITELLONI, with a series of character-building vignettes that appear to step away from the central plot (not unlike MEAN STREETS in that regard), and I'm sure that many fans of Scorsese's later work will be annoyed by this.
It's hard to imagine any of the fans of Scorsece's later works, which rely so heavily on hyper-real camera-work and tightly-structured story lines, to have the patience for "Who's That Knocking."
Many of the same ideas scorsese will later work out in mean streets.
Subtexts aside, Suddenly remains a gripping film even this many years later.
35 years later, the signature songs still rings clearly in my mind.
Minutes later he chastises her for just "being a woman" when she is concerned about him electrocuting himself when fixing a TV.
I cant remember if I watched 5 or 6 seasons,but I do remember that I thought the series was very funny for a while,but then it became a little more confusing and darker (I liked the first computer best),I don't know if its just me but I felt it was almost depressing watching the later seasons.
3 million years later he is revived by Holly, the ships computer, and is left with a hologram of his bunk-mate and a creature who evolved from his pregnant cat for company.
And then, later on, she was replaced by ChloÃ« Annett, a completely different type.
The show's style changed throughout the years, changing from a traditional sitcom (albeit in space) to a drama series in the later years.
A few episodes later I was annoyed at school when everyone kept quoting it and saying it was really funny.
It convinced me that the show had changed for the better ( I later caught up with the ones I had missed, and found they were not bad either ).
In the beginning, the drab and ordinary nature of the sets allowed the focus to be more on character comedy, but in later years the more colourful design went hand-in-hand with ever more bizarre and interesting stories.
( 52 years later - better late than never - smiling) I enjoyed the director's excellent mix of character complexities, the early 1950s icons of cars, dress, and innocent patriotism, the references to post-traumatic syndrome of World War II G.I.
The first half of movie was fine, but the subtitle starts to appear about 5 seconds later than the actual dialog.
One evening she again disappears minus her eyeglasses, which Katie can't see a thing without,and is found a day later miles away in a deserted wheat-field unhurt and with 20/20 vision.
This movie covered Gleason's childhood years in a broken home, his stand-up comedy career, his marriage and his various infidelities, as well as his early days in television up until the time of "The Honeymooners"; but what the film didn't cover (but should have) was his later life beyond "The Honeymooners" and his major Hollywood works, from the tearjerker "Gigot" (one of my all-time favorite films) to the hilarious "Smokey and the Bandit" movies.
and what happened to him between 1956 (when the last non-interview scene supposedly takes place) and his death 30 years later (!).
(ill get to the other mtv shows later.)
She whined when she didn't get a star for her birthday (her parents later surprised her with Lil Frankie, or some such person).
Only cheering up when the even newer "Spider" sports-car arrives 10 minutes later with their diamond-encrusted Rolex.
You'll thank me later.
Years later, I've seen many, many such films, but SS still holds a very special place in my heart, simply because not only is the film truly demented, but it's also very well done, which is rare for an exploitation film.
Then later on for seemingly no reason, two ugly drug runners have sex with a very pretty drugged out girl, in another overlong scene.
I remeber my brother playing this nonstop on our Original Nintendo and then we sold it... 5 years later we got it on our computer and I played it for awhile.
As with "Lady Snowblood" (1973) which I put in my two cents recently, they might be at the vanguard of their respective genres at the time, but now, 30 odd years later, they haven't age well at all.
bamboo scene is NOT for pure thrill of spectacle so it's shorter than the "Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon" version; the "too dark" photography during ambush is setting up for "nerd's epiphany" later.)
I first saw 'A Touch of Zen' in the late 70s; it had such an effect on me that I looked for it on video for years and years, but to no avail - then to my relief it was shown on TV during a martial arts night twenty years later.
Three hours later I was exhilarated after stumbling across of the greatest films made in the 20th century - and it wasn't a moment too long.
In reality, Lorenzo is in a coma, and will come back to life later, as her "advantage" plays out.
It's a really difficult game in the later levels of each campaign.
A week later I said 'Give me your copy of StarCraft so we can play online'.
In my view, the early Kurosawa films showed him how to develop human relationships: a gift that later would be present in the samurai films, and would make them much more than action epics.
After dropping an illegal cigarette and running away from the police, thus starting a chain of events that culminates in a large explosion a few minutes later; Luchino Fujisaki, a seventeen year old telepathic schoolgirl who has recently been released from a mental institution in spite of her ongoing violent urges and/or delusions, enters one of these elevators.
Jakob, then carries on the lie,and later is forced to carry on the lie, that he has a radio, to keep the hope alive, in the end dies , but doesn;t let go , just so that people already close to death under the Nazis, don't lose whatever hope that is left.
A while later in the film, we see that Sadako is actually warring desperately with herself .
Contrast that with the sexually confident Justin, who has to deal with one of those "criers after sex" on a one-night-stand and contemplate alone in a car later just what he lost with his current girlfriend.
He has a one-night stand years later with his daughter's baby sitter, and simultaneously his daughter is killed.
Sooner or later they died, so one didn't have to wonder about them anymore.
He influenced Eddie Murphy as well as many other comedians that became huge successes later on.
You can thank me later while you pay homage to a comedy legend if there ever was one.
Ever since I was turned on to Mr. Bhansali's work with "Black" - and later watched"Devdas" - I have thought of him as the modern day, Hindi film industry's answer to Luchino Visconti.
I would have given this film a 10 if it hadn't been for the fact that the most pivotal scene is shot in an incredibly vague manner, which left me confused as to what had actually happened until much later in the movie, but it is a brilliant and heartfelt experience nonetheless.
After watching the film with a few close friends, days later we were still making comments to one another and having less-than-welcoming flashbacks of the images we witnessed.
After seeing the film several years later, I thought it had its flaws, and some dialogue and scenes were questionable to say the least for young viewers.
He actually did appear in one years later when he was much older and the bad guy in that one.
After visiting this movie at a later point in my life I realized how bad this really was.
Years later, he's found by this cute researcher who takes him, finds out his mother and brother are still alive and attempts to return him.
Its all about a baby boy, nicknamed Bobo, that has been banished by his older brotherinto the wilderness and then gets raised by wolves.28 years later a scientist goes into the woods to study a pack of wolves until she stumble upon the human wolf.
Twenty-eight years later, the brother, nicknamed Bobo, is discovered by an animal scientist among a pack of wolves, but he doesn't act as much like a wolf as the filmmakers want you to believe.
My sister and I recorded ourselves singing 'Sunshine' and 'Lady' for fun after seeing the movie only to discover just weeks later that she too had a terminal illness and died very soon after.
Sadly, several years later, a close friend of ours, Kathy, then lived the story, so similar it is haunting, she died in 1979.
I saw this movie when it first aired on television many years ago.I was around fourteen years old.My sister was sick with breast cancer,and it made a huge impact on me.I read the book later, after I had seen the movie.This movie was beautifully filmed, and I thought that it stayed close to the original book.The script was very intelligent, and the actors portrayed their roles perfectly.I love the sets.To see the beautiful countryside in some of the scenes was fantastic.The music in this movie was one of the wonderful attributes to the story.I find myself humming the songs all of the time, after all of these years.I found the soundtrack, and I listen to it all of the time.Cliff De Young, Christina Raines,Meg Foster,Billy Mumy and Brenda Vaccaro were excellent.The other cast members were great too.I always cry when I watch this movie.I recommend this movie highly to people that have never seen it,I have this movie.
The moment I arrived in Canada I tried to look for a tape, later on for a DVD.
A couple of years later when 'Schindler's List' was to premiere on network TV Spielberg pulled it from ABC and gave it to a different network.
Now, 40 + years later, we can clearly see that the Good Professor was right!
When this man is later found dead, Holmes announces that he was murderedÂthough the evidence seems to clearly indicate that he killed himself.
The camera likes him and he's an ok actor (he would later go on to be more effective in some B level westerns and crime stories) but he lacks depth and often comes across as plastic, doll-like.
Sooner or later, a person has to take the help offered and decide to change, or nothing is going to do any good.
He really had no interest in stardom and turned his attention to wives and photography later on.
Filmmakers like Otto Preminger and Sidney Lumet would later go on to prove that when it comes to courtroom dramas, it's better to relate to the killings through word of mouth rather than showing it either as a prologue or a flashback, for it just seems to get in the way and there is far more drama that can be generated by the actors relating to this event none of them have seen.
A pioneering movie blazes a trail later imitated but never bested.
A note of interest is that Dewey Martin (Nicky's friend Butch) would later play Bogart's brother in The Desperate Hours.
You may think that this early rape 'n' revenge movie stands diametrically opposed to his later couples friendly numbers.
Constantly reliable B-pic perennials Richard Jaeckel (who later had a fatal run-in with a killer bear in "Grizzly" and got offed by a pack of wild dogs in "Day of the Animals") and Alex Cord (the latter bears a passing resemblance to tough guy thesp extraordinaire William Smith here) make for properly stalwart heroes.
Fortunately, Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer redeemed themselves later with the enjoyable and stimulating Randall and Hopkirk(Deceased).
Well; for me it was a Friday night staple that they never really bettered even with their later and more extravagantly funded follow-ups.
It's not as refined as some of their later stuff, but I like the rawness about it.
I was 10 when I fell in love with Errol Flynn watching this film on TV; more than 30 years later, he's still a hottie [grin].
Basil Rathbone, later to play Sherlock Holmes in films of the 1940's, resplendent in a red and gold surcoat, plays Robin Hood's worthy adversary, & he was also adept at fencing in RL.
Many elements were reworked for CJ-none more obviously than the re-casting of Rathbone 18yrs later, again as the bad guy.
All this behavior is played out by an all-star cast of established young actors, three years later already among Spain's most memorable actors of the last 20 years, including Nancho Novo, Ingrid Rubio, Juan Diego Botto, Javier Bardem, and in even Penelope Cruz, in a cameo role.
Hawn is fun and is surrounded by a good cast which includes Swoosie Kurtz as her best friend; James Keach as her ex-husband; Jan Hooks as Keach's current wife; Nipsey Russell as the principal of the rough high school Hawn's assigned to; and (before becoming famous) Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes as football players (these two actors would later team up for "White Men Can't Jump" and "Money Train").
Certainly, in comparison with later Robin films it comes out well, and it didn't hurt to have Technicolor, and Michael Curtiz' master direction.
He makes a different sort of film than the easy to find shoot-Âem-down-and-blow-Âem-up product that, once seen, can barely be recalled a week later.
well to end this, stay away from this movie and thank me later.
that we later had Stacy autograph.
Dozens of films later, she did just that.
Years later, after seeing it countless times on video, I saw it on the big screen when it was shown locally, and it was a whole new experience of the film.
I later did some Wikipedia research on Tom Gorai and learnt that Mr. Gorai is an American.
This could have been mawkish but sets up a terrific reveal later that jump-starts the last act of the film.
It's even likely he inspired the later Disney animated version of Robin Hood in the 60's, in which the characters were animals.
She would later become far more than just Errol Flynn's leading lady and win two Oscars for strong dramatic performances in the 40's for "To Each His Own" and "The Heiress" and her acting career lasted over 30 years.
But it is Michael Curtiz who garnered fame and he would later direct Errol Flynn in other successful films such as the Elizabethan adventure "The Sea Hawk" and the pre-Civil War epic "Santa Fe Trail" in which Flynn was once again paired with Olivia De Havilland.
However, three years later, both Rooney and Whitey are more mature, and the characterization benefits.
It has been pointed out that later in its run it began to unravel, and this is non unusual for any series, but this affectionate homage to both the characters and the earlier series is a fun romp that still holds up fairly well 15 years later.
And now, ten years later (and 24 y/o), I'm doing it again.
When a fine script meets able talent in the Director's chair the two elements act to make the final product even better and better and better.............  * Errol Flynn was a member of the 1928 0r 1932 Australian Olympic Boxing team, a talent that no doubt, made him a candidate for the Lead in GENTLEMAN JIM four years later.
My own grandparents, who had been brought to the US by their parents, who escaped Russian revolution and Bolshevik rule in 1918, had later on become enamored of the communist propaganda and disillusioned due to the Great Depression, had them selves gone back to the Soviet Russia in 1930!
I was actually a bit surprised to see a French film that realistically depicted the Soviet Union--particularly in the later years of the Stalin regime.
Only later, watching some scant pictures at IMDb, did I realize that her nose, for instance, isn't exactly "nice".
While I did see some evolution when they were in Russia, it was later that I needed the follow-up.
There is an exuberance in seeing something done for the first time that is sorely lacking in later uses of the same editing effect.
And, compared to later luminaries such as D. W. Griffith, I think MÃ©liÃ¨s' films are much more watchable today.
If made just a few years later, the film would have surely merited a 3 or 4.
I took the plunge a fortnight later & added it to my collection... ...
How I enjoyed watching my wife view the same scenes a day or two later...she too was captivated.
Only later i realized it was mostly due to the music, which is in fact composed by Joe Hisaishi, who made the music for these Miyazaki movies too; once again, his work is superb.
When Dr. Parkson returns later to check up on Buckwheat, he finds Buckwheat in bed, covered in ice, shivering.
"Tale of a Dog," according to Maltin and Bann's revised 1992 "Little Rascals" book, came out on Saturday, April 15 (Tax Day), 1944, while "Dancing Romeo" was released exactly two weeks later, Saturday, April 29, 1944 (April 29, 1962 was my birthday!).
He later meets the boy's mother, a Bosnian refugee played by Juliette Binoche.
Yes, its not brilliant or even laugh out loud funny, but all these years later it does have some charm.
Besides, we find out later that he is a very small percent of Indian and is, in fact, just a jerk.
I'd like to see a sequel, but I think if they were going to make one, they'd have made it by now... Or, six years later, the psycho killer could have escaped and is hellbent (hehe) on tracking down Jake and Eddie (who are still together and in love of course... or maybe they've split up (over some trivial misunderstanding) and the new danger brings them back together for a bitter reunion... but in the end they realise they still love each other...
He's got the needs for a surly hottie he sees outside a tattoo parlor and later during a Halloween party.
About two hours later, a piece of myself died inside.
But after seeing the Ahmad guy tell his boss that he's finish doing deeds for him and then minutes later he tries to save his life, I just couldn't sit there anymore, I turned the damn thing off before my exhaustion drive me to aggravation and might just break the damn DVD which I didn't want to end up paying for.
Even after the sheriff is nearly swallowed alive by the creature, he's joking and laughing just seconds later.
Having revisited the film 30 years later I find that I have been able to follow the subtleties of the plot more easily.
I like this movie now because not only does it show something of New Zealand's past and the possibilities the film-makers foresaw (some of which later came to pass as part of NZ history) but because it is an early vehicle for several New Zealand film-maker's craft.
Vlad Tepes had the Saxons of Transilvania account for their transgressions against the conquered local Romanian population and it was because of the vengeful literate Germans who wrote exacerbated stories about him that he was later on remembered as the sadistic figure we now read of in the history books.
It seems fair to say that the title "Falling Angels" is plural so as to include not only the baby brother who somehow fell over Niagara Falls and whose picture is later given wings and enshrined behind wood paneling in the Field family's basement.
Willis O'Brien, who later became famous for this type of filming in 1933's KING KONG, was also the guy responsible for bringing to life the dinosaurs in this film.
The overall effect really isn't that much different than a decade later--as both films are wonderful for the time.
At least this version, unlike Irwin Allen's later disaster, didn't kill any lizards... although a couple of bears do tear each other up for our amusement.
With large outdoor sets and big monsters, this film feels more like King Kong or later films with effects by Ray Harryhausen than most of the contemporary silent films.
Once there, they capture one of the dinosaurs and return to London with it, with results that might remind one of a much later dinosaur film.
However Kong was released almost eight years later in 1933, which makes me curious as to how much an influence "The Lost World" might have been on one of my favorite movies of all time.
Somewhat later, one of the camp orderlies throws a flaming branch at an allosaur making a night time raid, catching it in his mouth to resemble it's smoking a cigar.
That job went to Special Effects Pioneer Willis H. O'Brien who would later gain world wide recognition with his ground breaking Stop-Motion Animation in The Classic "King Kong" (1933).
The brontosaurus, for instance, is first seen grazing sedately through a simple cut away from the live action, and is not shown in scale with the players until later, almost as an afterthought.
(Hmmm, sounds a lot like ANOTHER `Lost World made 72 years later!)
The Miracle, a film that got in a heap of controversy, and in the process changed a vital point of how films were allowed to be shown in American cinemas from the 50's onward (a little historical fact few know of today), is to me perhaps one of the most powerful 'fables' I've ever seen, at least from people like Rossellini and Fellini (the later made a great career out of fashioning them out of almost nothing).
It is also a very telling story about religion and faith, and to my way of thinking still holds a relevance just as meaningful today as back in the later 40's and early 50's.
Perhaps the reason so many commenters here rate this film low is that it seems to start out as a serious Western, and that it is really a comedy doesn't become apparent till later.
I was really lucky to have lived there in the early 90's - only a little later than the film's setting.
A short while later Nanon is treated and cured of her phobia.
Tod Browning directed this tragic romantic thriller and it shows a style very much like that of his later film "Freaks".
It was also strange to see the very young Joan Crawford before she was transformed into the sleek creature she later became, and frankly, I liked her better here.
The film bore thematic and "mood" resemblances to Browning's later "Freaks", also set in a circus milieu.
His bizarre and macabre attempts to win Nanon later on become even more grotesquely shocking and horrific.
It's difficult to describe her youthful attraction without bringing to mind the caricature she became later in life with her shoulder pads and thick eyebrows, but in this movie she is simply stunning.
The Unknown is fresh and horrifying almost 80 years later -- the only audiences who'll be thrown will the the ones who have gotten so used to "realistic" cinema that they don't appreciate a story whose very reason for being contains nothing conclusive.
The shots are filmed through a heavy gauze that gives the entire composition the look of an oil painting with visible brushwork; it adds a softness and an intimacy that's similar to the effect later directors desired when they used soft-focus closeups of smiling women's faces, but there's nothing silly about its use here.
Right at the end of the silent film era, THE UNKNOWN came around with its typical Twenties' setups and wild overacting, and it benefits from its time; if it had been made only a year or two later, it would have been unbelievable.
It's not surprising that films that initially repel are later re-discovered and even praised.
Except for the opening circus scene, most of the film takes place among only four characters, in only a handful of circus wagon (used later for both Freaks and Chaney's 1928 film Laugh, Clown, Laugh) and apartment locations, with the ending, set in a theater, symmetrically reflecting the opening of the film.
After one or two bad nights out - indistinguishable from his later title "dates" - he decides to go really self destructive and move back home to Cleveland (Ohio may not be New York or SanFransisco - and why is Josh suffering in L.A. and not one of THOSE places in the first place!?
(How well both of them acted is something I shall get into a little later!)
Here, 20 years later, we finally get a worthy successor.
When he was spending the night with a woman, she later had spheres for breast.
Mainly in the beginning they were mixing up drama and comedy really badly which was annoying me, and later I got confused with the story lines.
My rating is 8 because of the great intense scenes later in the movie, and because it just gets better and better.
But poor confused little Michael claims that everything felt so realÂ Ten years later, his dream is proved a reality because the Tall Man is back, desecrating every town he travels throughÂhe also kills Reggie's family.
Six years later I finally know.
The more I thought about it and a couple rentals later and I love this movie.
I felt a gap between the movie itself, and the closing credits in which later history about the Madam Sata character is narrated along with film clips of Rio Carnival.
We can understand why Francisco,later called "Madame SatÃ£" lived that way (even though we may not agree with it) , having in one hand the fascination for a fairy tale world of fantasy, with songs in French and taking care of a baby and in the other hand dealt with streetfights, robbery and eventual imprisonments in jail.
Another cute thing is when they return to the house later in the film, the shot-out windows are completely undamaged!
Had this film appeared just a few years later, I would not have been as charitable.
This is course the technique that would become standard in later years.
Policewoman Lacy Bond,played by small dynamic redhead Sondra Currie,is a "supercop" assigned to take down a band of female gangsters who are up to all sorts of fiendish criminal activities.She uses(pretty basic)martial arts skills against them,and is later joined by undercover agent Pam Harris,played by Jeanie Bell,to help her take down the bad girl mob.The guys are generally pretty unimportant in this movie.Tony Young,as Lacy's boss and partner is reduced to a hapless sidekick,muttering his disapproval when he thinks she is putting herself in danger(and at one point having to be rescued by our heroine from some murderous babes who are beating him to death!
One wonders whether Charles 'Lucky' Luciano ever saw this movie and used this element of it's plot as his blueprint for the 'syndicate' which he adopted after the murder of crime boss Salvatore Maranzano a year later.
It wasn't until a year later that these two problems were pretty much eliminated in American films and even better gangster films like PUBLIC ENEMY and LITTLE CAESAR debuted.
I confess I usually think of Mayo as a pretty journeyman director, but maybe I've only seen his later work and "talkies" spoiled him.
Yes, it's an early talkie but it's a good one - as good if not better than SMART MONEY and on its way to being PUBLIC ENEMY just a year later.
I think his own childhood, similar to mine a half a generation later, was all he needed and for any further influence, he must have listened as I did to the radio ramblings of Jean Shepherd on WOR Radio back in the day.
I remember him from Eagles Claw (Tai Seng released this and is also a fun kung fu film), and even thirty years later the man is still ripped!
Directed by Chinese-American Steve Wang this film was the first film to use film and fighting techniques later used by such films as The Matrix.
I was like "I hope they won't let this happen" and then a few seconds later it happened, bummer... for me, cuz some people seemed to enjoy themselves, which was even more annoying  Conclusion: don't waste your money on this movie or, if your going to see it anyway, have a lot of beer before entering the cinema, it might work....
Its format, or lack of it, was a perfect match for Steve Allen, and the later shows where he was the host are every bit as much fun as the Garry Moore shows, in my opinion.
I won't know until I see the original will I, but, presuming the story is pretty much the same I have trouble getting why the later was so infamous.
Mickey Rourke keeps alive the question of whether he is crazier on screen or off - Will he grow up & become Christopher Walken later in life?
Interesting film, partly because Cooper is cast so completely against the type he is later to be best known for from his Capra films - that is of the rural innocent encountering the corruption of the city.
There are narrative and cinematographic elements present here that appear in his later works in much more refined form.
A few nights later, Daisy and the Lodger are spooning on a bench by a lamppost when Joe comes along and assails the Lodger's impudence at moving in on his girl.
yeah its fun and the best Hitchcock i think.i hate that undertake is making it this is the one and only best no 1 i mean no one can change that good suspense and fun 1 for black and white While this wasn't Hitchcock's first feature film, he refers to it as the one that set the pace for his later films, the first to show his vision, style, and bravura.
A young Hitchcock (he was my age when he made the film, about 27 or 28) allowed himself to be swayed by popular and studio pressure much more than he would later in his career, since he allowed the entire ending of this film to be altered based on the popularity of it's handsome star, stage actor Ivor Novello.
I am convinced that his early, formative history in the silent version of the medium is one of the reasons why his later films were so visually dramatic and exhaustingly and meticulously photographed.
A young Malcolm Keen, who would make other films with Hitchcock later in his career, does yeoman's supporting work as the not-so-sympathetic police inspector.
This works better than the later sound version, although that is also pretty interesting.
Such a master of visuals as Hitchcock was not handicapped by the lack of sound, and one may argue that some of the great horror scenes in his later movies could be part of silent movies as well.
In the foggy atmosphere of many of the British films of Hitchcock a couple of characters well known in the later films of the master show-up - the man whose non-normative behavior makes of him the obvious suspect and the maid who falls for the man and trusts him despite all the logic of facts presented to the viewer and adopted by the rest of the characters.
At Age 27 after three films (two of which are lost, the other, witch was "The Pleasure Garden") Hitchcock Culminated his first seminal quintessential film ,it was raised in the schools or Berlin and Was hailed as the Greatest British Picture Ever Made at the time, Its A theme He would Return to many years later in Frenzy made outside the golden age of his successes in Hollywood.
Some admirers of Herr Hitchcock have told this Herr Von that themes common in later Hitchcock films can be noted in this one: blondes and fetishism, the sensual kiss between the lodger ( Herr Ivor Novello ) and Daisy ( Frau June ) and the scene in which the lodger wants to enter the bathroom where June is taking a bath.
These will be developed and improved later by Herr Hitchcock during his talkie career, but this is a completely different story for this German count.
Unfortunately, The Lodger is almost completely bereft of the fine craftsmanship that would come to be Hitchcock's calling card in his later films.
Alfred Hitchcock masterfully directs his first British thriller with hallmarks of the style that in later years would make his name a household word.
The steep stairways of the boarding house, a recurring black cat and Hitchcock's own understated presence were all to be repeated in later films, not to mention central characters in a tense game of identity crisis.
Detective Jack Mosely later on comes to know that this prisoner is suppose to testify against many of the policemen who had done many bad things in the past.
But this isn't really typical in that the later Hitchcock would have complicated the story, or juiced it up, by having the innocent eponymous "lodger" guilty of something or other -- maybe just having a closet full of ladies' garments.
The Lodger was the feature which Hitchcock himself described as his first true film (it was actually his third complete one), and film historians, particularly auteurists tend to focus upon it because it is it introduces themes of murder and suspense that Hitch's name would later be synonymous with.
He was develop it in his later silents.
The later Hitchcock would have focused upon the plight of the wrongly accused, and made a more suspenseful film in the process.
Based on the novel by Mrs. Belloc Lowndes and the tales of Jack the Ripper, Hitchcock was able to embroider upon the theme of mistaken identities and incorporate an intense chase sequence, both of which would become important elements in his later suspense films.
You can see the beginnings of his later work peeking through and there are some sequences so well directed that they're stunning (the one where Novello and Tripp kiss is just SO beautiful).
Well, you have to see the film, and to follow a plot that was to dominate and control several of Hitchcock's later films: the concept of suspicion, the essential point for suspenseÂ
A then-unknown Roberto Benigni (yup, that wacky Italian who, five years later, would beat Tom Hanks AND Edward Norton for the Best Actor Oscar and declare he wants to "kidnap you and make love to you") plays what many suspect to be Clouseau's offspring.
Too bad - the anger that folks seem to hold for directors as they work into their later years is rather frightening and rabid, it seems to me.
Candy ends up on an Air Force jet where she is once again seduced, this time by a mad air force officer (Walter Matthau); later she is taken advantage of by a brilliant surgeon (James Coburn) who performs a dangerous operation on her injured father.
Here she gets into yet more sexual situations, first being raped by a weird hunchback thief (Charles Aznavour) and later rather indecently frisked by a horny cop (Joey Forman).
The emotion that appears later in the film is yet another good addition to this motion picture, though it may very much upset others.
A few days later, Crusoe emerges from the loch as an adult and beckons Angus to follow him.
Soon thereafter, two comedic relief fishermen "catch" Crusoe on their line and later attempt to photograph him for profit.
The plot of the film is that an egg is laid in a tidal pool in loch Ness, where later the Brits set up Submarine defences.
The excellent supporting cast includes, among others, Ian Keith (as Saladin), Joseph Schildkarut (typically sneaky as one of the Christian rulers), C. Henry Gordon (as the French King, whose sister Katharine De Mille Â the director's adopted daughter Â Richard has deliberately spurned), Alan Hale (as Richard's minstrel/sidekick, a Little John type that would soon become his trademark), C. Aubrey Smith (as the old hermit who is challenged by the overly confident Saladin at the beginning of the picture to rally the Christian countries in a crusade against his forces and, later, made hostage and chained to a cross to bar passage to the advancing army, he asks Richard to proceed with the attack regardless!)
In fact in a later role in The Shop Around the Corner, Schildkraut practically patented unctuous for the screen.
This led another director to make a movie, 70 years later...
I don't know why but I used to be a huge fan of Creepshow and Tales from the crypt although the later series were rather lame.
Soon the scriptwriter disappears and the actor begins a love affair to find out years later that the girl is some kind of ghost/witch/vampire... honestly I couldn't care less because the episode is boring and makes no sense.
There's a fourth act and a bizarre epilogue as well, but I'll get to that later.
"Robot Chicken," much like the film "Team America," is a prime example of novelty comedy; but again, much like "Team America," "Robot Chicken's" novelty wears off quickly, and sooner or later, you realize that if it weren't a bunch of action figures, it would be utterly unwatchable.
Unfortunately, William Girdler at this point in his career has absolutely no idea how to pace a film or build tension (he slightly improved with his later work).
He later did "Grizzly" and "The Manitou".
Not a single nurse in 1942-1945 who served in the Philippines died during the Japanese invasion or later in Japanese prison camps.
you wont believe this...i was 16 when i saw so proudly we hail....thirty years later i resaw it and remembered everything about it...even the theme music of claudette and george.
He was probably more suited to this role than he was to others later on.
"So Proudly We Hail" was a timely film when it was made and 60+ years later its message is still relevant as an historical event.
Helping to prop *her* up is her persistent suitor George Reeves (later of the TV series, "Superman").
For example, one scene has Burkit's friend Witek going into a small office of a party boss and, when Burkit enters the office some time later there is no sign of Witek.
Now, over 20 years later, a young film maker has stumbled upon Birkut's name and some of the newsreel footage but she is really curious how he went from hero to nobody so quickly.
After watching these movies (among others) the directors/scriptwriters probably used some of the best scenes and built a story around it... which would later result in a totally crap-movie, with Treat Williams trying to come up with one-liners all the time.
Some scenes left us all shaking with laughter, like the one in which Arshad 'calculates' the velocity of his car and the angle of projection and then throws a stone to check it, or when Riteish falls right into a luxury coach, which as luck would have it, was being hijacked, or the one in which Vijay Raaz talks about patience and going slow and later learns a lesson.
If it had been produced a few years later, and came out on a cable channel, where the idea of a Perfect Assassin could be developed, then it might have had a chance.
This short story was part of "The Assassin's Handbook," later reissued as "Inside Sinanju."
Sonny Crockett (Don Johnson) is on the trail of finding Colombian drug-lord, Calderone, who killed his partner (Jimmy Smit, who would later get killed on NYPD Blue), when his runs into Rico Tubbs (Philip Thomas) who's out to avenger his brother's death at the same man's hands.Miami Vice affected pretty much every aspect of American culture in the '80's.
Here in Italy arrived some time later but it was recognized absolutely fantastic.
Only in a B-series do you expect a Terminator to survive rifle fire in one scene, die from it in the next, taking several grenade launcher hits standing up in one scene and getting blown 100 feet backwards from a single shot 5 seconds later.
I didn't have chance to see this show earlier so i'm watching it now 25 years later and it still doesn't seem old at all, it's even greater now as you look back at the mid 80's.
Then a bit later Spock informs the Captain that the pilot's son plays an important part in space travel history so they MUST return the pilot ASAP--especially since at this point, the pilot hasn't yet sired any kids.
Wow, those black holes can really do a number on our starships in the 23rd century: one rubber band effect later and Enterprise is being chased by a sixties Air Force pilot aiming to nuke a UFO (nice stock footage).
Not as good as the later "City on the Edge of Forever", but well made and interesting.
Lacking the tongue-in-cheek camp of the later Batman films and other recent comic books-turned movies, X-Men draws the audience into its world of mutants and superpowers, and prevents it from becoming tacky or absurd.
It's only later when Mrs Ashboro suffers a fatal stroke that things start to become strange and ghostly to everyone who knew her.
Boyd had been embezzling his clients at his job at the Ridgewood Savings and Loan by secretly putting their money into this very speculative stock Graydon Industries that later dropped 90% leaving him as much as $50,000.00 in the hole.
It was actually remade Â and considerably improved upon Â by THE SHOOTING OF DAN McGOO (1945), a Droopy 'vehicle'; while remarkably similar in many respects to the later classic, one of my favorite Averys, it is a minor (if still highly enjoyable) effort Â for one thing, because of an anonymous i.e.
In 1947, the Indian sub-continent was partitioned into Muslim West and East Pakistan (later Bangladesh ) divided by Hindu-dominated India .
The on screen transformations is particularly spectacular, in terms of the way Saleem looks when the film starts (a beautiful young man), to the way he looks when the fanaticism begins to swallow the love he has for his mother and lady love as well as for life as he knew it (a ghost of the boy he used to be) and finally, years later when a chanced glancing at a telly screen leads Zubeida to spot the man she once loved giving a religious speech on a political channel (a mostly unrecognisable Saleem).
Unfortunately, it only starts good to become really cheesy later on.
Five minutes and a crazy gun battle later, this lonely man (Mr. Smith, played by Clive Owen) is protecting a baby that is the target of a group of ruthless assassins headed by the deranged and merciless Hertz (Paul Giamatti).
Created by Merwin Gerard and Produced by Collier Young(whom would later on become one of the producers of "Ironside"),and John Newland,the series ran for three seasons on ABC-TV from January 20,1959 until July 4, 1961 and ran for a half-hour producing 96 episodes,all in classic black and white.
50 years later, the soul of the priestess returns to the forest, reborn in the body of Kagome, a girl from modern-day Tokyo who has fallen through time into the era of myth and legend.
Character development, too, slows down greatly and by the later seasons, the cast has become quite unchanging, resulting in increasingly stale jokes (particularly those concerning the monk, who's ironic traits start out as mildly humorous but grow tiresome when the jokes associated with them appear repeatedly).
Mainly, Inuyasha is a very good series up until the midway point, don't get me wrong, there are still several episodes that are good after episode 100 but later on in the series most of the characters you have come to love begin to have nothing to do except for stand on the sidelines while Inuyasha fights and they occasionally interfere.
Some things implied in the song are flatly contradicted here, but I will deal with that later.
Fifty eight years later (forgetting one disastrous television version with Orson Welles as Whiteside in 1972) PBS showed this production of the stage revival of the play with Nathan Lane in the Whiteside role.
I just gave him a blow job - this guy will later in the film describe that it was like sex between sister and brother - her father has a gallery filled with sexually explicit and obscene paintings,he salivates at the name of orgasm, cunnilingus and is ecstatic when saying: sex good - at the party the guy who sits next to the main male character starts stray away to speak about women pubic hair   Please, I am French, I know a lot of French people, I have been to lots of parties in Paris and know a lot of uninhibited people, but the description of French sex obsessed people in this film is grotesquely twisted and exaggerated.
Neil, a little later, will go to New York City and begin his tenure as a full time street prostitute.
Ten years later, their lives could not be more different - Neil (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has became a gay hustler, cynical, manipulative but charismatic, while Brian (Brady Corbet), nervous and shy believes that he was abducted by the aliens for some strange experiments.
Production values are still admirable for a later period Hammer title, and the decision to retain the period Gothic setting is admirable.
It is true that the gym teacher is under-developed as a character, but at least he isn't shown as a two-dimensional bad guy; children who are victims of abuse often like the abuser, and it is brave of the movie to suggest that Neil actually enjoyed it at the time, not knowing how it would affect him later in life, or what was being done to him.
Many years later, her mother Miriam Jennings (Barbara Stanwyck) takes her home to their gigantic mansion.
Her performance was as wooden then as in this though she made a couple of good films later.
The "Cult of Originality"--which valued the unprecedented over all else, and which really only came to the fore in the later 1800s--was a mistake in my opinion.
From these facts Justin Huntly McCarthy wrote a popular romantic play that premiered in 1901 and was later made into an operetta with score by Rudolf Friml and Brian Hooker.
That and the partnership of necessity they form and the later grudging respect they develop for each other.
I always felt Colman didn't pick up his lines fast enough (at least in his later years), but he's perfect playing the poet FranÃ§ois Villon.
This film is not yet out on VHS or DVD so if you get a chance to watch in on TV then I recommend you tape it to watch at a later date.
She took out her anger on Ellis, and later cheated on him and lied to him.
And later in the film Leigh out of nowhere announces that she is in love with Johnson.
She was obviously using him to make sure that she could control him later on.
It's a clever black comedy - almost a British Woody Allen picture (his later period!)
Pyotr, his best friend, has lots more of man as compared to Alexey, joins the couple later in the movie to take the day-long with them as they walk near the Isaak's Cathedral of the Russia's North capital .
Some of those involved in the making of this film, I believe, later were blacklisted in Hollywood during the Red-baiting McCarthy era that soon followed.
He codified the genre a year later in Blood and Black Lace.
It's interesting to see this movie for only two reasons: 1) the fun of spotting scenes directly ripped off in later movies like Friday the 13th Part 2; 2) the ending, which comes out of left field and manages to be both shocking and funny.
Moments later she is murdered, hanged from a door frame.
Possibly what is so off-putting about this film is that characters are introduced, and then killed off five minutes later.
It's a shame that the later copycats failed to realize the potential found here.
In fact, many of said murders would later be ripped off for the Friday the 13th films.
Despite some dodgy camera-work (rapid zooms and shots thrown in and out of focus), a few plodding moments and some dated looking scenes involving 'groovy' teenagers, Mario Bava's A Bay of Blood is still an entertaining slasher/giallo movie, made even more notable by the fact that it heavily influenced Sean S. Cunningham's 80s classic, Friday the 13th, made almost a decade later.
The film is packed with some memorably graphic mayhem; the sickle to the face will always be my personal favorite, although there's also a nifty decapitation, and a show-stopping, prime example of coitus interruptus that was ripped off later in "Friday the 13th, Part 2".
Carlo Rambaldi, later a creator of creature effects in such films as "King Kong" (1976), "Alien", "E.T.
We watch as a wheelchair-bound baroness is brutally strangled, only for the rug to be torn from under us moments later when her assailant is the next one to bite the bullet!
Lannie later pleasures herself to Jeff.
Traci Lords would later write that her first filmed scene was spontaneously done in a kitchen with Tom Byron.
So later when, Tom stumbles upon a stockpile of personal items and I.d.
Baron Felix who's only friend on earth up to that time is his cute and faithful Dachshund Adolphus, or Adolph for short, will later "make it" with that cold fish of a woman Grusinskaya while in the process of burglarizing her hotel suite!
It's later that the Baron after confessing his love for Grusinskaya, and returning her stolen pearl necklace, decides to use the naive Otto in a card game of baccarat he set up.
More than seven decades later, the film has somehow retained its initial energy, thanks to the movie's fascinating cast.
Other than that, "Grand Hotel" is not particularly concerned with social or political problems--it's strange to think that it takes place in Weimar Germany and just two years later, the Nazis would take over.
Garbo and the Barrymores, Crawford, Wallace Beery (compare if you can his performance with that of Gert FrÃ¶be in the later German version) may be seen as larger than life each in his or her own right.
Personally, I like Baum's later film "Hotel Berlin" much more.
MGM wouldn't wait long to try the formula again releasing another all star cast film Dinner At Eight two years later.
Preysling was originally played by Siegfried Ruman (later Sig Ruman) and the Baron by Albert Van Dekker (later Albert Dekker).
Neither ended up in the MGM production, though both had distinguished film careers later on.
Another fine early example that I can recall was a decade later with "Tales of Manhattan".
Realizing that she was a drama queen as a profession, I excused a lot of it, but it got to a point where I was really snickering to myself after awhile, because she was acting just like Gloria Swanson later would in "Sunset Boulevard".
Ms. Crawford does excellent work in a role she discarded later on in favor of more dramatic appearances.
I've seen GRAND HOTEL twice now, and I'll grant it that despite its soap-opera like story lines, there seems to be something a little deeper going on which is only alluded to in the sidelines: the delicate tightrope which Flammchen (Joan Crawford) walks on as she is courted by Presyling (Wallace Beery) and later on decides to stay by Otto Kringelein's (Lionel Barrymore) side.
They bimble across the desert looking for the Mexican border, finding en route a mummified body buried in a dry river bed with a gold medallion on it; when they later find a mysterious Indian (the always reliable, although poorly cast in this case Danny Trejo) who spots the medallion, he tells them the legend.
A few seconds later she hears something outside.
The failure of this film (and "Jason X" years later) shows that fans want a return to simpler times when horny teens in cabins were afraid to look out their windows.
There is no sense of humor here either, as Chan's later films have.
Overall, typical of its kind, not up to later Chan efforts.
It imbues them with a quality that I can't ascribe to many of Jackie's later films.
Though still fun to watch, these later films are better and more enjoyable.
And, finally, the plot is pretty good for a silent film--not the most complex when compared to later films, it's not nearly as simplistic as most other silents.
Unlike her later 1930s films, Crawford is wild and free here, sort of like a Trilby yet to find her Svengali.
She is so different from her later 50's and 60's roles.
Sharon is tough, bossy and one of the guys but she does have a girlie side too, Berg is witty but a bit childish, Pete is on the quest for true love, never really finding it and then later we get Johnny, lovable but tight.
Love the episodes later on, the one with no dialogue (Silent movie) the one which shows us the characters lives linking together throughout one day, the writers were original with material, the halloween episodes were fun and love Mr. Bower's tall tales (the ones from movies) Overall a decent four series which deserved more time on the air.
Adolphe Menjou who created the Charles Bickford studio executive part and, especially, Lionel Stander as the publicity agent later played by Jack Carson, shine in their subordinate but finely tuned roles, helping to counter-balance the banal tendencies of the script, while May Robson's spiky but wise, benevolent granny, Clara (Auntie Em) Blandick's acidulous aunt, Elizabeth Jenns' actress paramour, Andy Devine's true-blue friend, and Edgar Kennedy's pop get caught up soundly in the film's cliches.
This sluggish film was more entertaining in the beginning, as an action film, than later, when it became a poorly-executed tale of family redemption, ghosts and secrets from the past.
Some thirteen years later Wesley finally resurfaced with this snazzy direct-to-video terror shocker which centers on a dry, dusty, desolate patch of remote desert backroads haunted by the lethal, murderous, unrestful eyeless, zombie-like, asphalt-encrusted, crumple-faced spirits of four extremely vicious and dangerous chaingang convicts who were all killed in a brutal roadside massacre back in 1967.
At first, everything seems just peachy, but later these underground people turn out to be major jerks who keep incredibly ugly creatures as slaves.
Â which bear strong echoes of another fantasy stalwart, H. Rider Haggard's "She", prove incredibly disappointing; curiously enough, this would also turn out to be the case in such diverse, later sci-fi films as THE TIME MACHINE (1960), BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES (1970) and LOGAN'S RUN (1976).
Despite all these flaws, "Kekexili" has three powerful scenes which make watching it worthwhile - all coming in the later parts of the film.
The ''greys'' in the movie were scary but later on you only get funny looking orange versions of them.
Four years later he gives us this.
Having seen the two later versions of this tale, it was a surprise to find the original one, even if it doesn't compare with the 50s remake with Judy Garland.
I was moved by this film in a way that I never had been by the later remake.
There were some minor flaws to this epic show cast though, with the most obscene one being the fact that the character introductions are pretty much absent, seeing as everybody seemingly just pops up and goes away after a few scenes, to return later again.
Danny Dengzopa's directorial debut featuring the superstar Rajesh Khanna and Kim (whom he later married).
We are not aware of the true extent of things until much later but looking back at the events in the opening hour, the leisurely way in which the gang hang around and talk about nothing in particular considering what they have done is shocking.
I came across this version on DVD not having been previously aware of its existence; before this I favoured the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke version made ten years later as definitive.
One thing led to another, and ten years later there I was with a degree in English literature.
The BBC have released later and in my opinion inferior versions but apparently have no plans to release this one.
At first it almost seems as though the film follows a non-linear narrative; we find out later that this is not the case.
One will readily recognize actress Isobel Elsom from her later, excellent roles in "My Fair Lady" and "Love Is A Many Splendored Thing".
Then Tom's says "Maybe later."
There are scores of other contaminants out there, with the growing problem of e-waste something that will impact on everyone sooner or later.
First saw this made for TV film back in the 1970s when I was about the same age as the little girl in the movie.I wasn't able to understand it properly at the time,but the ghost theme captured my imagination.I found it very appealing and intriguing when I saw it again much later on as an adult.
When you watch a movie and you find yourself thinking about it days later...i believe thats a sign that the movie you have seen was a good one....and thats what happened when i saw this movie.
Writer Yareli Arizmendi plays Lila, a reporter hired for her Latin looks who later becomes the center of the attention as she becomes "the last Latin in California".
It came on again two days later and I watched it again.
The story of two coneheaded aliens who later triple knits together with a coherence lacking from most films belonging to the derided sub-genre of dysfunctional earth invaders.
The jokes are coming at a rapid pace, so even if some don't work, a minute later another one will come to make up for it.
They later give birth to a daughter named Connie(Michelle Burke).
Forced to enjoy human society they try to get used to their new surroundings but are soon on the run from immigration officers Seedling (Mckean) & Turnbull (Spade), months later Prymaat gives birth to a beautiful baby girl whom they name Connie .
18 years later Connie (Burke) is pretty young woman who is always at ends with her parental units she falls head over heels in love with Ronnie (Farley) a local mechanic and neighborhood boy who admits to never have dated a girl taller than him before.
Only seconds later, one of them is already severely punished for his naughty behavior by a dude completely dressed in black and operating the titular tool as a murder weapon.
All the way down from the killer's incredibly funny one-liners to a woman screaming non-stop for several minutes (this gag later being used in NUTBAG) to the sheriff's mysterious badge (which just happens to move from one side of his shirt to another between shots!)
The version shown, as well as the one to be released later this fall in the US, is different than what those in India saw at the theater.
One subtle observance is the relative shakiness of shots at the onset, perhaps analogous to the character's life, later balanced with images obtained from a sturdier camera as the lead role becomes more "grounded."
However, Patrick really gave the character of Max Bright a great deal of dimension, and I was impressed by his ability to convey subtler feelings later in the film.
Some years later I have finally been privileged as well as honoured to see the long lost footage from the final battle scenes in "Game of Death" and to see the master in action for one final time.
The scene with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (the last recorded piece) was better in the later part of the fight and even turned convincing.
Don't miss a later scene, when Novarro returns to his Old Heidelberg bedroom - especially, watch how Novarro briefly strokes his bed, obviously thinking of Shearer; it's a superb little bit of sexual suggestion.
We see the relationship with the very stern King played by Gustave Von Seyfertitz and later on when he's introduced to his tutor and closest friend, Jean Hersholt.
Then later Norrington pushes further repeating it with "when a man loves a woman".
This really isn't too surprising, though, as when the film was made back in 1911, outright plagiarism was common and pretty much condoned and many times the same production company would remake their films only a year or so later!
( black and white horrors ).If anyone can help me out it would be appreciated.I will pay money and costs of shipping or exchange for some items from Australia ie White pointers (Shark) tooth pendant.On vhs tape can be either ntsc or pal recordings.Just remember you can never replace the memories or scared feelings that these old hammer horrors gave us when we were young and impressionable.I gave this a 10 rating cos it was the first horror film i saw and the fond memories of how scared i was are still with me to this day 30 years later.
I have never heard of it but its one that I stumbled upon today on TV and can not get it out of my mind now almost 12 hours later.
Now, years later, I've just rewatched it (this time on DVD) and I still think it's a very good -- but not great -- movie.
McQueen starred in "An Enemy of the People" a few years later, supposedly to prove that he could act in a straight drama, but he didn't need to.
Claiming to have been framed in the murder of a pimp, Papillon seeks immediately to escape from his imprisonment, employing the services Â and later the friendship Â of the withdrawn and vulnerable, but nonetheless resourceful, Louis Dega (Dustin Hoffman).
Later on we see Hoffman in a different light as if completing the Birdman of Alcatraz analogy, Hoffman's role is similar to that of Telly Savalas who's a tough character when we first meet him in Birdman, but later becomes acclimated to prison life.
"Little Big Man" Hoffman's later roles such as as "Tootsie" just makes him a joke as in most famous Hollywood expression of them all: "There's ten dollars I'll never see again."
A fact that was confirmed few minutes later when I got home and played it.
Court records indicate that Henri Charriere (Steve McQueen) later called " Papillon " which is french for Butterfly, was indeed a minor burglar and safe cracker.
Usually, after reading a long book filled with many interesting adventures, watching a two-hour film later winds up being a big disappointment.
My first viewing of the film years ago made an indelible impression on me, but I must confess that later viewings convinced me that it is not exactly flawless in that the pacing is sometimes much too slow and the ending is somewhat unsatisfying.
Then the later advertising became annoying by using goofy reporters and very unreal Real World executives.
You'd have thought that after leaving the 12 year old home for the weekend, by accident, and having him give himself alcohol poisoning, that they would have made some reference to it later.
This girlfriend, in conjunction with Frank's tennis coach who later becomes Bernard's wife's lover, symbolize the frivolities of the trivial people who get in the way of Bernard's attempts at existential resolution.
At first, it seems that they just don't love each other anymore; later, new facts come to light in front of their sons' Walt (Jesse Eisenberg) and Frank (Owen Kline) eyes.
It is a badly conceived scene and done in bad taste, only to be touched upon again later in the film.
It felt like a rushed cash in on the original, yet came out six years later !
Some evening a few days after (or seconds, depending on who's time your on), Dawn is tucking in her daughter Lauren, who up until now wasn't the main focus whatsoever, and we zip up to five years later (1999).
when i started to watch it looked kinda interesting but later on...uh, this is the most boring shark flick ever!.
The influence that this film has had on later crime investigation films such as the magnificent 'LA Confidential' is evident throughout, and that adds yet more credibility to the proceedings.
They later realize how deep the police involvement in the killings were.
As she would go on to prove in later films, McDormand doesn't just 'play' a character - she IS that character.
To withhold a family infrastructure, fulfill his talent of dismembering bodies, and filming the murders for later satisfaction, Wayne affirms himself to be quite the bachelor of demented serial killers!
When i watched the film MY EYES were Hooked From Start to End  You Will Find it Very Brilliantly Directed Even though I'm writing about this 2 years later but it is Definitely Worth Buying  Go and Grab a Copy of the DVD out on EROS
Jane Curtin later co-stared with Susan St James in the TV Show Kate & Allie.
Years later I sought it out and found that it has been out of print on video for a number of years.
I was pleasantly surprised with how great this film was, and how it still, nearly forty years later, holds up well and is just as effective.
Two years later, Aldrich followed up with "Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte," with Davis, Agnes Moorehead and Olivia de Havilland engaged in similar nasty hijinks.
This later entry in the "horror hag" sweepstakes features absolutely wonderful performances from Geraldine Page, who has a high old time as the haughty, demented and thoroughly relentless Mrs. Marrable, and Ruth Gordon, as Alice Dimmock, her new housekeeper, who isn't quite what she seems to be.
So when Sarah goes to France, she stays a house that her boss owns, and later in the evening, his daughter comes in very unexpectedly.
This film first shook me with its great music, which I later realized as being a classic move by Ozon, then with its setting and ending.
When we first meet what we later find out to be a hugely successful author with many adoring fans and numerously successful books, there is a deliberately anti-climatic sense about the character.
Later on, when she makes love to one of a few random men she finds during her nights out, Sarah cannot hep but become interested and observes in the same composition before later still, there actually is a reaction shot from Sarah, during another sex act in the house's swimming pool from which the title derives.
awards are like hemorrhoids, sooner or later, every arse gets them" LMAO!
A few days later, she starts writing again, but her quiet rest is shaken with the unexpected arrival of Julie (Ludivine Sagnier), the sexy daughter of John.
But the teacher has changed, and when she later meets another man, she might find lasting love...
But she is saved by Pierre, who later asks her to become his partner for his comeback.
Equilibiium got the most acclaim, Kirk Douglas and Pier Angeli were given a film of their own, Act Of Love, later to do.
However this is needed to see how he changes later on.
Jan-Michael Vincent, the world at his knees shows his considerable acting abilities here before crumbling into himself in later days.
This scene is immensely disturbing in its own right, and even more disturbing in the light of Arbuckle's real-life tragedy a few years later.
The film seems too stagey at first and would be easy to just turn off, but given a good half an hour to develop, it kicks into gear later.
A year later in the June of 1968 history would be made when Elvis once again entered a stage for the first time in 7 years to record his TV special for NBC now affectionately known as 'the Comeback'.
All of her moments with Larry, that include: Getting tipsy, mimicking him, averting his disgusting passes, singing to him and later seducing him are all pure comedic genius.
In fact my husband tapes them for me to watch again later on in the week.
It has been rightly stated in other comments on this page that "The Prince and the Showgirl" is not the best Marilyn Monroe movie ever made, especially considering such later pictures as "Some Like It Hot" and "The Misfits."
Northbrook takes the Grand Duke to see a light musical comedy, and it is in the theater that Charles is introduced to the attractive American-born actress Elsie Marina (Monroe), who, as we later learn, is of German descent.
Perhaps Olivier himself was less than impressed by the film, as it was his first experience of directing other than his three famous Shakespeare adaptations, and it was to be his last until he directed a version of Chekhov's 'The Three Sisters' thirteen years later.
Stephanie seems most concerned with continually getting laid, and later with money, no matter what level of reality is revealed.
2.The Spaniards arrived 500 years later.
"The Spaniards arrived 500 years later" You really don't know when the movie takes place until the end when the conquistadors show up.Then we see, aha: the year is 1511 + something.Is this possible?Why not?The end of the great Mayan civilization was about 900 A.D. After that we have the post classic period until 1511 (the year of the arrival of Cortes).Gibson doesn't claim that the occurrence's in the film take place in the early Mayan history.To all the haters of the film who have a problem with not presenting the great achievements of that culture(mathematics, astrology an so on):That was BEFORE the happenings in the movie!And besides, that was not the story of the movie.Not showing the greatness of the culture doesn't mean that Gibson denies it!
Though Mexican influence (earlier Teotehuican and Mixtec, and later Aztec) was felt in Chichen Itza in the Classic and Post Classic Period, it is unlikely that sacrifice on the Aztec scale ever occurred on the Yucatan peninsula.
It depicts life in the 50's in Hollywood - Walt Disney's discovery of Annette, the making of the Mickey Mouse Club, a young Paul Anka, Frankie Avalon, and later Frankie Avalon & Shelly Fabares playing their adult selves.
We learn later that he sees death as a natural part of life; just as she has lived she must die.
(And it is far better than Visconti's later prissy adaptation of Mann's "Death in Venice.")
She pretends to be a man and, later, a man that Robert has known in the past.
She later meets him for a night out at the movies, and she and Robert have the kind of chat that happens when two women are sharing innermost secrets.
Of course, the anonymity of internet chat makes people talk more than they should, and a later conversation between Elaine and Robert reveals something crucial, possibly hinted all throughout her marriage, but there, in front of her, typed words on a monitor.
We later find out that his lover who died was the brother of his former wife, which carefully hints at Robert's shifty morals.
Meanwhile, Jeffery is coming on hard to Robert, and we find out later that Robert has given in.
She flits around the first 20 minutes of this movie in a bra and panties, toyingly svelt but with a panther-like quality you only realize later.
Unfortunately, the film drops the girl's journey at this point and focuses on a myriad of issues that it will drop later, leaving you asking "Why?"
The film invests in characters it throws to the wolves later, making you wonder why you even watched the life of this person.
Don't use the middle of the film to take me five other places and then later come back to this girl and expect me to care.
The story opens with the great "mead hall" where the early Scandinavians got drunk and swore oaths they later were held to.
Beowulf has to battle Grendel, then his mother, and then, later, a great dragon.
His biggest miss was Fortress, a futuristic prison breakout film that was also his biggest hit, proving so popular that a sequel came out half a decade later.
Christophe and Kurtwood are both capable of creating stylised characters, something they succeed in doing (shame that Kurtwood later lost the plot in That 70's Show).
It wasn't good how John was mind-wiped for not killing a man, because if he had done that, Prison Director Poe would of used that to keep him in prison for later on.
Anna May Wong plays an evil traitor but confidante to the Princess, a role she reprised 10 years later in Chu-Chin-Chow the first film version of which appeared the year before this, and which provided some of the story here too.
Walsh is now best remembered for the gritty action pictures he would later make at Warner Brothers, but perhaps the most important aspect he brought to his pictures was a romantic spirit of adventure.
I later acquired a tape.
Also definitely fun to see how much of this movie was later used again in Disney's "Aladdin".
I'd guess the audio, which is a mixture of live tapes and commercially available records, was dubbed on later when the film makers had cut their footage together.
I never saw "I love Lucy" (A few years later when I entered grade school and would come home for lunch, it would be on in repeats and that's where my interest for that show came in!)
It starts with a bit that comes into play later.
Rocky later meets Diana, a beautiful blind girl and romance blossoms.
The poem has been dechristianized: On the one hand, it does take out a glaring anachronism (the action of the poem takes place during the Migration Period of the AD 400s-500s, when they would still be following the traditions of the Aesir religion, but the poem was written down in a very Christianized context in England, and the anachronism does add a richness to the language) The only sop to the underpinnings of the source material come in a discussion between two urinating Danes over the relative merits of Christianity and Aesir-worship, and later when Unferth suggests praying to Christ as well as Odin, a suggestion that Hrothgar rejects out of hand (perhaps a reference to the opposite situation in the poem, where the Danes throw off Christianity for a time, hoping that the old gods will smite Grendel where the Christian ones had apparently failed).
My only taste of him before seeing this film was the slightly later 'Dead Man', and I found that to be a very worthwhile experience and one that set me up nicely for Night on Earth.
Night on Earth isn't quite as trippy as Jarmusch's later film; but it still oozes that odd sense of cool and while you're watching it you're constantly reminded that what you are seeing isn't just any film.
So what an absolute delight to say that Beowulf not only works because of it being in 3-D (more on that brilliant factor later) but also the movie is a genuinely brilliant movie anyway.
These steady opening set-ups would go on to become an important part of later cartoons in the series.
Only after the new king died did Beowulf become king of the Geats until his own death in later years.Also, why all the nudity in this film?
The Uncut version has raised controversy mainly because of two gruesome sequences including the cannibal eating a woman's fetus and the later being his demise when he tries to eat his own guts after being slaughtered.
We learn more of these two later.
Unfortunately for those two, Rita senses the killer later that night, and Danny is butchered.
He seems devoid of anything remotely civilized and there's a reason revealed later involving his son and wife in a raft isolated in the middle of the ocean.
He'll also bite a chunk of flesh from a throat later in the film when he pulls a victim's face through the hole of a mansion's ceiling.
The scene in which Tisa Farrow is hanging in the well and George Eastman (the cannibal monster) is reaching out to grab her is masterful suspense, and the scenes of Eastman eating the fetus and his own entrails remain shocking today, 25 years later.
The German tourist sees himself reflected in the cannibals knife, the first dead Italian confronts a mirror shortly before death and later the boat-hiker has to smash a huge mirror in which she is reflected in order to find her way into his lair and discover his secrets.
The cannibal, as in Sondheim's contemporaneous 1980 Broadway musical Sweeney Todd (later filmed by Tim Burton) is a ideal image of a Capitalistic society in which man devours man, a rampage of anthropophagy which ends here with the cannibal literally chewing on his own entrails, a self-devouring monster.
Maybe they could do that with a new DVD release with the thespians doing things in a 'Blue Screen' room, (they couldn't use the same setting, because apparently this was a story they created, that was wrapped around a brief availability of a mountain skiing lodge, and they may not be able to get the set again, although they could 'MacGyver' a virtual version of the same original sets in the CGI 'Blue Screen' room, to superimpose later) for an alternative or extended ending with more CGI special effects added to make the storyline stronger.
Five years later - the 3rd season finale - Mary Cherry buys Melrose Place, where the entire gang live, spoofing that series.
Beowulf (the man) could have been written as a cookie-cutter hero, but fortunately he's something else - fallible and not yet the hero he must become later in the movie.
Fortunately things settle down later in the movie and the makers stop trying to show off their new technology.
It appears that her part was filmed later and edited in, as she never interacts with the other actors and the "hacker" uses male pronouns when referring to her and her image.
Also, years later, this one man's stand and dire predictions for the future all proved true.
Gary Cooper plays the title role in "The Court Martial of Billy Mitchell," a 1955 film based on the real-life court martial of former Brigadier General William Mitchell, who was demoted in rank after violating orders and later court-martialed for criticizing the Armed Forces in the press.
Besides also starring Ralph Bellamy, Charles Bickford, and Rod Steiger, the film also features some later TV stars - Elizabeth Montgomery, Jack Lord, John Daly, Darren McGavin and Peter Graves.
Mitchell died in 1936, not in time to see his vindication five years later.
If you are a New Zealander and see this without knowing it is a hoax then you will be bitterly disappointed to find out later.
Stranger still with the picture is that Jackson and Botes almost have a kind of affection for the MacKenzie character- and as the former later displayed with his brawny popcorn epics- that even makes the material not too shallow in terms of approach for the viewer.
If nothing else, this is a spooky foreshadowing of Jackson's later career in one of his own films.
Almost 20 years and numerous investigations and commissions later still the whole truth has not come to see the light of day.
Director Bahman Ghobadi was an enthusiastic show-up for the 3rd screening and gave many interesting tidbits during his Q&A such as info on the banning of female singing and musicians in present day Iran for the past 28 years, that his self-censorship on the film did not help it to get past Irani censors so that he may re-cut the film for the later general international release now anyway (restoring more scenes of female singing & playing) and that the whole 7 months of seeking for travel permits subplot in this film was a nod to the struggles he had to get his earlier "Turtles Can Fly" film made.
Eventually it settles into a good groove though and towards the later part of the film the pace has adjusted itself comfortably.
Everyone is charming; Marge and Gower Champion are at their peak, Bob Fosse is just hitting his stride (amusing that his screen persona was so charmingly little-boyish, in contrast to the dark angular sexiness of his later stage choreographies), and Debbie Reynolds is pixie-ish as ever.
It's not until the later levels with the appearance of more lightsabre equipped enemies that it becomes more challenging again.
I know I was kind of unaffected to the early scenes of violence, however later once the film shifts to the tour and we revisit the battle and we have a sense of who these men are the effects are devastating.
Just as John Bradley finds it difficult to relive the atmosphere of Iwo Jima due to traumatic experiences, we have to question, what effect does war have on people many years later?
This is the type of part that you would not really see from him later in his career.
It shows what a versatile director he was, considering he made him his name later with romance / comedy type movies like Midnight.
"The Eagle and the Hawk" follows the World War One exploits of three American volunteer airmen who are members of Britain's Royal Flying Corps (which was later to be renamed the Royal Air Force).
The third airman, Henry Crocker (Grant), washes out and later becomes an aerial gunner.
If this and other programmes of it's ilk are allowed to continue,then we can well and truly say that the great days of British TV will be gone forever,and that if you have no talent whatsoever,rather than vice versa,you'll become famous thanks to the brain free writings in UK tabloid newspapers and magazines,describing the numbingly unexciting events in these "reality TV shows",the most unwelcome media development in history.A disturbing trend that has to stop sooner rather than later.
The whole concept of a dude being in the wrong place at the wrong time is good and till the end you'll just be waiting for it to hit you with another new situation that you haven't seen before, nor later.
Soon they're enjoying cocktails in a cozy bar and later at his place ("Suprise me," she tells him) while waiting for her auto to be delivered from an all-night shop.
I later learned during the Q&A that all the kill scenes were practical and no computer effects were used.
The "lead" (we'll move onto her later) was like a cheap attempt at a lead, and all of the friends she had were just annoying and undeveloped.
The killer, in his calls to Malcolm, tells him that he's duplicating a number of killings that he did some time ago and got no recognition for.It's later found out by someone who knew him Albert O'Shaughnessy, William Smith, that his name is Alan Delour, Richard Jordan, and that those killings were in Chicago a number of years ago.
THE ADVENTURES OF BUCKAROO BANZAI is like a Chinese dinner: an hour later you're hungry for a more substantial film.
Considering the success of "Men in Black," Buckaroo should have at least been a moderate hit, in that it is no more or less strange and entertaining than that later sci-fi-alien-invading human cartoon.
They see some weird thing in the distance and go towards it then suddenly their cameras shut off and they're trapped in the Nexus, so they call for a group Marines and a scientist that has been in the Nexus to go the base, they arrive their and later on the gateway opens with one life-form detected.
In all the "Alien" ripoffs I've seen, (besides the later "Alien Lockdown", which is more of a PredAlien anyways) this by far had the best creature.
I was able to find a VHS of the movie in later years and was astonished to find how charming the picture is on the adult level as well.
Of course, director Wellman would make him a star later in 1931 with Public Enemy.
This film fascinated me for many reasons: Actors in rare starring roles, other actors who became major stars later, a setting very rare in films, and a story presented unlike anything else I've ever seen.
It was made in 1931, so they were able to get away with all sorts of lines that would not have been included had the movie been made a few years later, after the code was established.
Overall, Artemis '81 reminded me more than anything of Twin Peaks (which was made nearly a decade later, and, curiously, also featured Dan O'Herlihy) - the same sense of explanation hidden just around the corner, and another reality just half-glimpsed and poorly understood.
This helps the creation of an obscure, sinister mood, and the sense of a secret, controlling force, which, even if it is nowhere as achieved or designed in terms of ideas, look, or sound, is not a million miles from the thinking of Lynch in "Twin Peaks" more or less a decade later.
Around the same time Elephant Walk was done here and later on the acclaimed Bridge on the River Kwai.
i was afraid they'd think it was a tasteless, shoddily made, horrible movie (Which it is, but more on that later).
Patrick Stewart with a full head of hair plays the opportunistic Sejanus who reaches for power, taking advantage of the increasing hedonistic tendencies of Tiberius in his later years.
It was until nearly twenty years later that I saw the whole series in all its glory.
George Baker is excellent as the dark and brooding Tiberius who is slowly pushed into the evils which he committed later in life.
It wasn't intended to be literal, but the poor guys kept getting killed off and the women lived to play in later episodes, so I guess the casting people decided to go with making the older women look as young as possible rather than the other way around.
The animation is even more limited than the stuff Rankin Bass would turn out years later.
But by embracing the lurid, sensationalistic hyperbole heaped upon the founders of the Roman Empire by later writers (Suetonius and Tacitus in particular), Graves concocted the ultimate in dysfunctional families, weaving a tale of scandal and debauchery capable of shocking even the most jaded of modern audiences.
It would also be interesting to know why the movie was completed in 2001 but not released until 3 years later, and then only in Belgium and Holland.
Now over ten years later, Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon does the exact same thing that Scream did and everyone thinks it's oh-so-original because it copies the same formula.
But worst of all, having lost all of her footage, the remaining member of the documentary team at the end of the movie makes the bizarre and senseless decision to burn Vernon's body, I guess to destroy any remaining evidence of her crazy story, just in case she later had to explain any of this.
That it didn't is something of a surprise, even all these years later, given the enduring popularity of the films.
Only when I saw the movies years later did I realise how inferior the series was by comparison.
A few years later, he went on to direct the Superman cartoons, which are still held in high acclaim for their animation style and techniques of realistic movements and absorbing story lines.
The movie's main drawback is that none of the characters really have any 'heart' - they don't come alive on the screen in the way Jiminy Cricket would a year later in PINOCCHIO.
The script is rather trite, and the film is also rather oddly paced, as it starts off like any other silly zombie movie, only to mature into something much more interesting later on, which may annoy some viewers.
This show was definitely the basis for the better dramas that came later, and I am sure it convinced many people to become paramedics.
I have to say though that 10 years later as a manager and agent for musicians (not rock'n'roll and certainly not on the scale presented in the film) I had a whole new appreciation for people who possessed one undeniable talent yet made life hell for those who worked to help them make a living at it!
"The Rose" is certainly a movie that I recommend, and I believe the director later directed Bette Midler in the equally interesting "For the Boys".
So later,while casually browsing the web, it occurred to me that very title of Tennessee William's play probably had much to do with adding that item to our general vocabulary.
During the 1992 TV season, NBC seemed to like sci-fi groaners, as four months later they showed Journey to the Center of the Earth, a remake of another movie based on a Jules Verne story.
As a failed pilot, Danger Island laid out numerous loose ends meant to be tied up in later episodes.
POST-postscript, January 2006-- A year later and it looks even more like DANGER ISLAND was a parallel world counterpart to LOST.
Even though the direction is uneven (but gets better in the last half) it carries a powerful message which still has meaning 3 decades later.
Yet despite this, the lack of continuity between internal/external locations and lapses of plot logic (Chaplin's Tramp becomes a feared boxer because he has a horseshoe in his gloveÂ later he is able to perform the same feats of knock out artistry without the horseshoe, which makes no sense at all) do pall somewhat.
Now, fifteen years later, Flash is 25 and there's a hint that his father didn't die in a fire, that he was "lost" in one of his experiments gone haywire.
Apparently he's a pretty responsible youngster and has never lost anything...ever, because 15 years later Flash is STILL wearing the Timex watch that his father gave him... uh.. OK.  2) why would Ming send a flying probe though the portal?
(see robot, later on) 3) why would Ming send a single robot through the portal to get the Imex instead of launching a full or semi-full scale invasion of Earth?
Medals he hangs on his fathers grave, medals which are still there 2 years later (it was the 3rd annual marathon he won in a row)... Dumb on 2 counts, obviously the leaving the medals and having them stay there for years is dumb but it shows that even 13 years after his father died, Flash has yet to move on.
Watching Stir Crazy at this later point in time, some of the humor might seem a bit clichÃ©d to younger viewers.
I was eight years old at the time, and would watch and tape it every Saturday morning, and I wouldn't find out I was seeing all reruns until about a decade later anyway!
Other characters include: Bushwacker Bob, Taz's arrogant, selfish, lazy, short-tempered boss at the hotel where he works; Mum, Bob's mother, who runs the hotel with him; Digeri Dingo, a selfish, lazy, scheming dingo dog who loves to use Taz; Wendel T. Wolf, a Tasmanian wolf who believes he is the last of his species; the Platypus brothers, Timothy and Daniel, pseudo-handymen who think they are scientific geniuses; Constance Koala, a huge, strong koala bear who likes to dance and sing, and works at the hotel with Taz; Mister Thickley, another co-worker at the hotel, a wallaby who tries to be the most beloved character; Buddy Boar, Taz's deal making pal; the Bushrats, a tribe of rats who talk with subtitles; and Willie Wombat, who appears in several later episodes, a friendly wombat who struggles to try and get a better role in the show.
Here, there's a hilarious song at the outset, over the opening credits and a bit later, Tom does his best impersonation of a cross between Tex Ritter and Milli Vanilli.
This is nature verses man all the way, the likes of "Jaws", that'd come out a few years later.
Owing more to the British thrillers such as the Quatermass films and the stark black and white horror films of Hammer (X The Unknown) or things like the Day the Earth Caught Fire (which while released 2 years later has similar feel) or Corridors of Blood, this is for a good chunk of the film a dark detective story of sorts as the monster remains hidden and the scientists try to figure out whats going on.
One of the 'dwarfs' has a 'problem', later overcome, in that he **can't hit women**.
In the opening of the film, an American biologist, Steven Karnes (played by Gene Evans) is lecturing a group of scientists about the dangers of not only nuclear weapons testing, but the disposal of radioactive wastes- a warning still timely 45 years later!
A rare, perfect, and hilarious movie that uses every comic device; two of the funniest moments are when a young Broderick Crawford and later Edward G. get hit by a car.
Robinson makes funs of his bad guys role, like he will do a few years later in Brother Orchid.
But later there was "Big Deal on Madonna Street" and most recently Woody Allan's "Small Time Crooks," which duplicated some of the incidents as well as the general idea.
Watching EFNY again, I cannot believe how cool it is compared to later JC films (especially the God-awful EFLA).
Great plot with great character makes this one of John Carpenter's best films, it is a shame they had to cut out the start of the movie when it was put in theaters in 1981, where Snake Plissken and his partner do the robbery and later, Snake's partner gets killed, and Snake gets caught by the United States Police Force.
Conclusion: i highly recommend this cult classic and you must know that "Snake" is not dead, prove to that is that 26 years later he is still one of the best characters ever.
Nearly 25 years and an endless amount of viewings later, John Carpenter's "Escape from NY" still ranks high among the chosen few, quintessential cult films of the 80's.
After Christopher McDonald says "Yeah Right, and Grizzley Adams had a beard", after he walks away the screen goes to the green where all the people are and the car that hits Happy Gilmore later is already crashed even though the seen has not happened yet.
We later found out that my wife's boss had the exact same experience.
It has been interesting to see several of the actors and actresses from this movie come to life in later films.
In fact, days later it was still sinking in and affecting me.
I am still receiving emails and phone calls a week later.
They used the same format that Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu later used for his successful "Amores Perros" in 2000.
Second time I saw it was about a week later once the Ritz Theater's had picked it up.
It premiered in Melbourne on Boxing Day 1906, and was later shown across Australia, in New Zealand and in Britain.
However, when 'The Story of the Kelly Gang' was exhibited in its original form in Australia (and later in other countries), the projectionist had to maintain two sets of apparatus at the same go, so as to achieve a seamless transition between reels.
The wife finds evidence of him cheating,, confronts him,, and well the sparks do fly in this one, it's hard to say more without giving away what happens later, so i won't do that, but this is a very intriguing movie that delves deep into what can tear families apart, definitely worth a watch if you ask me.
Confidential, which was later turned into the Oscar winning film of the same name) Cop is a crime thriller that just lacks, well thrills and crime in large doses.
He is pushy and very confrontational and insists he gets his own way now rather than later, very much like Clint Eastwood's "Dirty" Harry Callahan character.
But it's the older Sister that gets taken to the basement and strung up by her wrists as other kids begin to torment her, stripping her, torturing her, even raping her later, while the foster Mother encourages them on.
18 minutes later.
Astro Boy is a robot boy, who initially has gone through an identity crisis, but later on, serves as more of a superhero who gets into various adventures and is consistently bent on promoting peace in his society wherein robots live side-by-side human beings.
Set in the future, a scientist(voiced by Nicolas Cage) is drowning in sadness, cause he lost his son(voiced by Freddie Highmore) in a laboratory accident, almost a year later he builds a robotic replica of his son(also Freddie Highmore).
Though she shows compassion in supporting an Iranian refugee who is desperately looking for work, she later calls the Immigration Department to arrest illegal workers who are living in housing provided by a competitor.
A year later she she has been closed off from the outside world, having only her friend Nikki to help her out.
But that was it, and it was quite early on, later in the movie there were other things to disappoint, bad make up and effects, along with some more pretty awful acting.
One year later she finds that her apartment is haunted.
Multiple times the ghost would do some ability, but would not repeat that ability at a later time.
Pitt is perfect as the cocky young detective Mills, mixing together the right amount of bravado and testosterone at the start of the film, and then later tempering that swagger with cynicism Â and fear Â as the movie progresses forward.
The acting is excellent and despite this being a loud and brash film at times, there are some very subtle moments that will result in you remembering moments from this film weeks later.
While watching the movie itself, I thought it a bit anti-climatic, but when mulling it over later, the images echo very strongly in my mind.
Also, if you are interested, this was later remade by Martin and Lewis as LIVING IT UP.
This report is Wally Cook, (Fredric March) who visits this town and gets a very cold reception from everyone in town and especially Margaret Hamilton, (Warsaw, Vermont Drug Store Lady) who two year later appeared in "The Wizard of Oz" in 1939.
How sad that she is in a film about dying young and would do so five years later at the age of 34.
Plays as well today as more than sixty years later which proves that while the people may have changed the media stays the same.
It's quite droll, with the narrator getting off such funny zingers as:   "Cook the stuffing for 15 minutes, for that perfect taste that you love to burp up later."
As a big fan of David Cronenberg's later films, I was eager to see this one.
This scene is later put into direct context by the rest of the movie but it's a stark, shocking opening to a stark shocking film.
It's not without its issues, the characters mostly aren't terribly interesting and neither are the actors, and the writing and direction are efficient and sometimes ace, but not as overall gripping as Cronenberg's later works.
Altogether, this is an influential, highly entertaining grisly sci fi horror classic, just a whisker away from the directors superlative later work.
Also, still beautiful Barbara Steele (as Betts) takes a bath; and, later, engages Susan Petrie (as Janine Tudor) in a seductive Lesbian kiss.
The result isn't as polished as his later films, with less considered direction and weak performances from some members of the cast, but the film still manages to impress thanks to Cronenberg's innovative story, some impressive make-up FX (by Joe Blasco) and a few very memorable scenes.
Although Shivers might not 'wow' today's audiences with dazzling special effects and technical brilliance, there are still plenty of unsettling scenes that make this movie worth a look, especially if you're a fan of the director's later work: an early death scene sees a man strangling a young woman, before cutting her open and pouring acid into her body cavity; Betts (Barbara Steele) gets a bath-time shock as one naughty, phallic parasite pops out of the plughole and nips up her cooch; Nicholas Tudor (Allan Kolman) wishes he hadn't been getting some on the sly when his stomach begins undulating in a rather uneasy fashion; and a brilliant, downbeat ending sees the horny islanders getting into their cars for a trip to the mainland.
The movie is a little different from his usual work in that as an early feature, he used some of the more regular tropes of horror film-making such as monster cam and chiaroscuro (later, he would find he didn't even need these devices as the plots and concepts of his ideas were enough, and most of the horror he'd show would be in a much more direct exposition with much more open and regular spaces).
Such a theme will continue through almost everything Cronenberg would later film, as he would become the master of body horror.
Shivers is an effectively disturbing movie, not unlike most of Cronenberg's later horror classics.
It's had a good hand in influencing later creature flicks.
Suffice it to say, this film might not quite pack the same punch as Cronenbergs' later horror films, such as "The Brood", "Scanners", "Videodrome", or "The Fly", but I think it's a solid debut with an offbeat premise and an effective delivery.
Cronenberg's direction is obviously not as polished as in later features, but we begin to see his signature style translated well into a full-length format.
The film is well worth your time though, and offers an early glimpse at the amazing technique that dominated Kurosawa's later films.
It's perhaps a little more of an obvious use of the weather than in his later pictures, but it established a crucial Kurosawa motif.
This may not be quite as accomplished as his later 'High and Low', but it is still a terrific thriller that puts the vast majority of modern movies to shame.
Compared to later entries in his filmography Stray Dog appears to be a minor entry, but it's still well worth the time to discover.
Off-the-wall narrator Pete Smith would produce a reworked version of this story - with Oscar winning results - four years later in PENNY WISDOM (1937).
There's a certain sense of time and structure that sets apart Stray Dog from the numerous 'film-noirs' of American cinema of the period- while it contains the kind of determined edge and wit of those films, it also relies on portraying the people in this world as honestly as possible, however downtrodden things are (like Kurosawa's later film High & Low, location adds to the mood greatly).
These 8 minutes contain zero exposition, containing instead some stunning on-location montage from 2nd-unit guy Honda (who directed *Godzilla* later) that unabashedly turns into scathing social commentary, and this, in the final analysis, is far more interesting than the catch-as-catch-can plot about a rookie detective's stolen gun.
Several scenes reminded me of Orson Welles' later film Touch of Evil, particularly an extended montage sequence with a similar feel to the famous opening shot of Welles' film showing a disguised Mifune walking the streets as he attempts to track down blackmarket arms dealers accompanied by a cacophony of street noise and Latin-jazz-big band music.
Impressive as some of the later films of Kurosawa are - "Kagemusha" and "Ran" for example, I have to confess that it is his early work, particularly those set in modern Japan as opposed to its feudal past, that I find myself returning to with greater pleasure.
The sailor later explains away the theory to the other singer, who seems friendlier to him, and then the whole murder theory is just dropped as if it were a mistake.
A true 'dive' nightclub, the "La Jolla Club" later known as the "Guys and Dolls" was used for a key scene.
We later learn the mother is blind.
The miniature work is not the greatest, but is much better than the later BATTLE OF THE EAGLES.
And 77 years later, the Guardsman still brings laughs to us.
Although the Lunts, when asked to do later film work, replied "We can be bought but we can't be bored!"
The budget for this film was fairly ambitious, more so than in later efforts.
(2) I recalled a critic's remark about a later legendary film (in an entirely different way), HEAVEN'S GATE -- to paraphrase: In Hollywood, the poor are more virtuous than the rich because they're more photogenic.
J. CARROLL NAISH and NORMAN LLOYD as hard-nosed neighbors make themselves utterly unlikeable (but believable) as Scott's uncooperative neighbors, unwilling to spare some milk for him when his son is ill. PERCY KILBRIDE comes to his rescue with a rented cow and later becomes his father-in-law, marrying BLANCHE YURKA.
Many young men later enlisted in the military to better their lives.
The second part starts when 20 years later Dane Corvin comes back to the area to visit his dying uncle (Hal Holbrook) whose last wish is to bring Dane and Hannah together again.
The love triangle that later develops does not end well, as so few do.
The small cast also includes Kenneth Griffith as Hawkins' eager-to-learn subordinate Â incidentally, the latter also appeared in two episodes of Patrick McGoohan's later cult TV series of the same name but which bore no relation to this movie!
Then a few years later here it is (I wasn't even aware they were filming it ... that would never happen today with the Internet, lol).
Several hours later he is neither tipsy nor showing any ill effects (or indeed effects of any kind) whatsoever.
And later on another nude scene with Lenny, his girlfriend and another takes place for about 4 minutes, which is really boring and annoying.
Not if there's a fire, not even if you hear the sound of a thud from my home and one week later there's a smell coming from there that can only be a decaying human body and you have to hold a hanky to your face because the stench is so thick that you think you're going to faint.
When the magician began causing such rampant sin and perversion as his granted freedom gave way to lascivious appetites, those religious townpeople, who haven't succumb to the lusts of the flesh decide to hang him on a wooden cross in the middle of a cornfield, later burning his bones & burying them in a tomb.
Just pour the liquid on his wound, worst-case scenario is you get red dye on his fur (I didn't know until later you're supposed to consume the potion, not apply it directly to the wound).
One might argue that they give the film emotional weight (or some such crock), but they really don't, especially since they don't really have any bearing later.
In my cynical opinion, they're an excuse to give Peter something to say (the aforementioned line to Edmund) that he will say later (though not in any meaningful way); a popular Hollywood convention, apparently.
I bought the VHS when it came out several years later and watched it faithfully, hoping that as an older and wiser person, maybe I would find things in Mr. Hoffman's performance that I missed in 1974.
That was probably on July, and some months later I thought that my theory was right, I mean, even I went to a store and saw like a DVD of Narnia (probably the novels or how they made the movie).
Lewis wanted his books to be enjoyed by young people who would later in their lives draw the spiritual meanings from the stories.
Everyone's an idiot in this movie, and those who aren't end up looking stupid sooner or later.
At least Baio and Aames worked well enough together here to star together in TV's "Charles in Charge" later on.
The film was PG and then they added some boobies to make it rated R. Today, Solaris was given an R just for showing George Clooney's liberal behind (it was later revoked to PG-13).
All the same there is something a little dry and disappointing in the film's structure: almost as if it could have used a more conventional, linear narrative, like Milos Forman's tribute to Andy Kauffman, 'Man on the Moon' would use to such great effect 25 years later.
The film covers how Chaplin formed his own stock company to make films with much in the way John Ford would do a couple decades later.
The third part showcases mostly scenes which were cut from Chaplin's final edit of his films influences some of his earlier silent pictures had on his later, more famous films.
Dustin Hoffman presents Lenny as an alternately despicable and heroic figure, and there is a spark in his eyes throughout the early scenes of the movie that eventually gives way to desperation later in the picture.
A more heartfelt biography of the performer perhaps would have restricted Fosse and screenwriter Julian Barry from divulging into Lenny's more seedy character traits Â such as when he coerces his unwilling wife into a threesome with another woman, later ridiculing her for doing so; or when he goes on stage completely drugged out of his mind and makes a fool of himself.
Moments later, Richard is in jail, the Judge having figured out where her niece has gone.
And the later scene in the nightclub is also a real winner.
So the patron evens the score a second later.
Most of the other reviews posted here have compared this movie unfavorably with Mank's A Letter To Three Wives and whilst there are similarities it is actually closer - as my summary indicates - to a much later movie, Buona Sera, Mrs Campbell, in which any one of three GIs could be the father of Gina Lollobrigida's now fully grown daughter.
5 years later, the child is involved in a plane crash that killed his parents.
Now, ten years later, Thomas, at twenty-eight, is little more than a professional punk whose job appears to be investing in shady real estate deals then using underhanded and sometimes even violent methods to evict those who cannot pay their rents or mortgages.
Emotions become tense when Leah discovers Vicente marking trails and, later, finds herself fighting off the crude advances of one of the three soldiers of fortune...
The film is also an early, uncommonly mature look at the challenges that arise with marriage and adoption, a precursor to later accomplished films like 1967's "Two for the Road".
A few years later, she falls ill suddenly and dies.
Grant surprised me with his family man role, quite different from the sophisticated characters he played later on in his career.
It's full of actors who later became famous for other roles.
View the movie again and see how many times the screenwriter and director took the trouble to set up a later event or comment with an earlier reference.
I didn't know what this film had that created an aura of mysteriousness and intrigue, but I remember seeing it again a few years later and looking everywhere to purchase a copy.
A year later, a girlfriend of mine at the time told me about the movie and how much she loved it, so I told her what had happened in that little town down south.
Two years later, back in New York, I came across the movie for sale in a video store and snatched it up thinking I had to see what all this was about.
Lazaro, after loosing his father--look out for big snakes--and later his mother, lives alone in the jungle for a short while.
Some years later, when Lazaro is about ten or so, he is then found and brought to the city where his father's mentor vows to care for him and make him civilised.
As another testament to the power of this movie, I decided to sponser a child through Compassion after watching it for the second time, 8 years later.
When I got home 3 days later I popped it in.
A few years later in the early 80's, Franco Zeffirelli's operatic movie with Chinese title as "Cha Fa Nui" was on show in one and only one movie house, "Palace" at Causeway Bay (demolished!).
And five years later, I learned some French and so, dared to touched the original "La Dame aux CamÃ©lias".
The same team got together a few years later and filmed "Othello".
One simply cannot compare, say, the "classical" version released two years later featuring Dame Joan Sutherland (possibly the greatest soprano ever, but at the end of her incredible career)and Luciano Pavorotti (to whom comparable comments also apply).
(He has obviously aged as consequent opera films were made, up to ten years later in fact.)
As viewers, we feel as though we are truly standing in front of "The Music Lesson," observing the intricately crafted world in the frame and contemplating how the work, so many years later, still connects us to its mysterious creator.
Strangler's handling of deadpan, grotesque cruelty and black humour is somewhat similar to the mixture Alex de la Iglesia would perfect in his movies a decade later.
The picture was shown at the San Francisco International Film Festival in the mid-'80s, and I was surprised to meet an American poet there who could recite memorable lines from Strangler a full twenty years later (some of them in Serbian!).
Edward Albert is a standout later in the film as the investigator of the mysterious goings on.
See you later space cowboy!
See you later, Space Cowboys...
Excellent story,characters,humor,drama etc.The show is basically about three(later four) bounty hunters and them doing their job.There was also a film adaptation of this, which I saw before watching the series.The movie is excellent as well.If you are an anime fan, check this one out.
In the very first episode, we see Spike in a violent gun battle against people unknown, and we really don't revisit that event till several episodes later.
Even if Ava Gardner is sexier than anyone intended Julie to be, she is still great and truly heartbreaking in the later sequences.
The script also features various lapses of logic, at the end I just couldn't stop thinking that it was a bit of a coincidence that a bunch of kids would just happen to hold a sÃ©ance & summon the exact same demon that their landlord & one of their Father's did years earlier, a fact which they only discover later on in the film.
This also brings a few faults into the film by more of them later.
The song later plays when she returns to her home and reads Lee's letter and goes through the flashbacks of New Years.
I liked the one year later thing because if they had gotten together at the end of what happen it would have been too cheesy.
By the way, director Cahn later made the similarly cheapskate IT!
The wit was rapier, the plots were funny and quite redeemable, and even over 10 years later, the show's material isn't dated.
Twelve years later, after finding some taped episodes, I am still in love with this wonderful show and glad to see there are lots of devoted fans out and about.
Mijail Kalatozov exhibits here very early why he could do I am Cuba more than thirty years later.
This movie is a perfect example of freedom all around, from the scene where a man shoots people randomly and later is sentenced to life in jail but walks out free of the courthouse, to BuÃ±uel himself who has the freedom of saying whatever he wants, however he wants it and in doing so, has given us a fresh perspective.
While I have not seen the other versions, plus 2 more done later in the 1950's, this one is stronger than your typical western because of the talented cast & the tremendous fist fight scene between Wayne & Scott which takes most of the last 10 minutes of the film.
McNamara is established immediately as Wayne's rival in love and a little later as a business obstacle.
Having preceded the film by the trio's subsequent (though lesser) teaming, PITTSBURGH (1942), it was interesting to see Wayne and Scott take turns playing the unsympathetic role (in the case of the latter here, he emerges to be an out-and-out villain Â if a charming one, and to which he would return for his swan-song two decades later in Sam Peckinpah's RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY [1962]).
In my humble opinion, the Spoilers should be considered as much of, or more of, an essential John Wayne classic performance and movie that must be seen by any fan or student of Wayne and his movies than other over-hyped films from later days, such as The Searchers and The Alamo.
John Wayne is a rather rakish ladies' man and played with much less bravado than typified his later roles.
Randolph Scott is turning the corner of his career into Westerns also; abandoning those light comedy or milquestoast leading roles and showing a glimpse of the hardnose tough guy & questionably moral cowboy that he came to be in later career moves.
There are lots of characters coming and going without any previous development or later appearance.
A role portrayed to perfection in "The Ringer" with Donald Wolfit, "the Golden Salamander" and later, "Northwest Passage" with Kenny More and Lauren Bacall.
In the end we have that this actually was the story of the son of Akira, who actually saw how both of his parents were killed, having in the end gratitude with the gunman and later finding his own way to Italy (a really memorable and even hilarious final detail of the film).
There are a few scenes and a large piece of the story that really comes into play later during the movie that grounds you.
For those of you who deem themselves Tarantino fans will have much to be happy about as Tarantino plays a bad-ass, poncho-wearing gunslinger named Ringo who introduces us to the Heike/Genji conflict and plays an important part later on.
What I would like to know, though, is how this lady not only knew what she and her boyfriend were doing (this mostly involved getting naked and her saying 'she wasn't THAT kind of girl' when he later wanted to have sex?!?)
Maybe this man's not an expert, but he apparently was an idiot--especially since this moron returns to the island later in the film!
The opening 20 minutes, before the expedition is underway, are the most striking, with colorful touches and a slightly wacky approach that the film later loses, though there is good smattering of creepy moments and everything mounts to a pretty fun finale.
This moody British horror film was made several years before the "stalk 'n' slash" genre kicked off, yet this atmospheric chiller possesses a number of elements that would later become popular in the modern horror genre.
But, that does not rule out the possibility of them finding one another again later on down the line.
Numerous gratuitous sex-sequences later, one of the girls coincidentally discovers the three are in fact fugitive criminals who needed a hideout place.
Then a week later your husband gets in an accident and dies.
He is non tolerant towards Indians, but his wife and daughter love India and it's people.The daughter makes best friends with the house hold servants son, and in later years this blossoms into love.Typical problems of pre independence India follow(Frowned upon by all parties concerned-The British, The Indian Royalty, The Families and the Villagers).
The song 'tu kisna hai' is the only one you might hum later.
from `Faust' by Charles Gounod did not appear in the Paris Opera in its final grand opera form until March 1869, making its dÃ©but in the Metropolitan a few years later; using the same recording as that used by Tony Richardson in `The Phantom of the Opera' three years earlier is not merely an unhappy coincidence; and some thirty seconds of Enya during a scene of hundreds of men hanging on to their bowler hats in the driving wind was a laughable misfit at best.
But watching it again 10 years later, this film is anything but common.
The family were so cheesy, "Love you mum" "Love you even more honey" Then after they were broken into for the second time, 10 mins later, they were at it again, "Love you mum" big cheesy smiles etc... She phones her husband, and tells him not to bother coming home.
He is often criticized by later film viewers and critics because his women, while strong, only could find true security in the world of men by adaptation to the males around them.
He was for this matter ahead of his time, more ahead even of Kurosawa years later, the latter always unable to present a compelling woman other than with over the top acting.
*****SPOILER ALERT*****  Flemming use to sell LSD while at school but this drug is called Blue Sunshine and everyone who took it then is now ten years later feeling the effects by having their hair fall out and becoming a homicidal maniac that kills anyone in their path.
A bunch of Stanford University students ate a batch of bad acid and 10 years later are like freakin'-out, man....They start losing their hair and gain super-human strength and go all psycho on anyone around them.
Taylor talks in a voice that was appropriate for "National Velvet" but certainly not 6 years later when she was older.
In post-war England, it followed a group of students at Cambridge, with their hopes, affairs, confrontations with life, and, later, disillusionments and achievements.
Oddly, the schemes and shenanigans remain illuminating of our own time some 80 years later, as other reviewers point out.
this film came out in 1950 & 57 years later the son still sounds sore.
I guessed the ending and later I found I was correct, all the 'laughs' I had seen and heard before and I sat there completely board as though I was staring at a blank screen.
One moment he's fiddling with the window, and a second later he's standing on the floor next to the bed.
Another funny example is when Ashton Kutcher's character teaches Bernie Mac's character the tango and later on Bernie Mac's character denies to his wife that he was taught the tango by Ashton Kutcher's character.
He hopes to make money & later return to his family.
& released to DVD 3 months later.
What a crew of hostages: A barfly willing to bed anyone who buys her a drink, an old married fool making arrangements for a weekend tryst with a sweet young thing, a young man whose wife is in delivery at the hospital, a zealous reporter whose newspaper editor thinks he's a joke, and Chuckles, the bartender, played by the dour William Conrad of radio's "Gunsmoke" and later TV's "Cannon" fame.
With this cartoon, Sylvester the Cat has a new obstacle in trying to catch the Tweety Bird: His owner, Granny, as originally voiced by Bea Benaderet (June Foray would later take over).
Now, thirty years later, it is a fairly stylish soft blue film, which is served beautifully by its soundtrack and somehow by photography, which remains charming and announces the David Hamilton style of Bilitis.
More bemused than shocked, Emmanuelle turns to precocious nymphet Marie-Ange (a youthfully glowing Christine Boisson, later to become a highly respected French actress) to whom she confides her first betrayal of her husband with a pair of handsome strangers on the flight over, a perfectly paced sequence of suspenseful anticipation which probably instigated the whole "Mile High Club" idea.
As time marched on, I sorta forgot about some of these but thanks to moving to Los Angeles and the "Z" channel 10 years later...
Some days later, the young Simon Bernstein (Jules Sitruk) escapes from the Germans and comes to his former home.
SPOILERS: He is forced to go on the run and later finds sanctuary, but is tracked down by a man he had come across before.
Perhaps expected to be a spiritual successor of Tom Joad, Fonda is badly miscast; his dour, pseudo-Hispanic performance is greatly reminiscent of the later The Wrong Man.
They have an aid at the site who acts like a semi business man semi control freak hence workers' union coming into play later in the film in vengeance of their workers' rights.
Helms requests to preside over the murder case to free up his later schedule in order that he be considered for the vacancy.
I don't even think it's tragic because the filming of their lives perhaps accelerated certain unpleasant events, leaving Lance to decry later, "Television ate my family."
35 years later, Americans are no better at communication and solving problems.
We get closure on that scene later in the movie.
Another major factor is the scenery, I will elaborate on that later on.
Another familiar face from Stillman's movies is Taylor Nichols, who plays Charlie Black, who when we first see him is stumbling through an explanation of why he believes in God and you do, too, even if you don't know it, and later on offers his own alternative definition of the preppie elite as the Urban Haute Bourgeoisie, i.e.
A bit later, a nice young man (Jack Pickford) joins the company and Beatrice is smitten.
She's even below the juvenile/character man (last billed featured player Franklin Pangborn, who's later lavender camp personality is still not locked in stone here, though his comic and dramatic talents are), but when she manages to get a handsome young drifter (little she knows!)
Anyone who loves Lillie's later work (all the way to her Mrs. Meers in 1967's THOROUGHILY MODERN MILLIE - a mere 41 years later but there are some surprising moments of foreshadowing for that role here!)
Her true depth is shone later when she quietly removes herself to care for her baby, without the assistance of its father, Sebastian, who has dropped out of her life.
Kay had not yet developed the sophisticated, edgy style she was so famous for later in her career.
In some spots of the film you can practically drop the songs that Irving Berlin was later to write for his hit show about Annie.
She was not as raucous as Ethel Merman on stage and later Betty Hutton on screen portrayed her.
Annie Oakley is a nice film, not as well known as the musical later derived from her life, but still easy to take with good players at their best.
The timing of When this What later Happened thus presented comparatively little incentive for my interest..
She is money-mad but he falls hopelessly in love with her and, later on, she with him.
Originally seen as a loser, the man who loses his girlfriend to Richard, Etienne later emerges as the community's voice of conscience, the one man who refuses to abandon the dying Christo.
I would say to myself "after this hour, I gotta go study" at 1 a.m. 5 episodes later, I would still be saying, "Ok ONE MORE hour, and THEN I will study".
I stopped watching it because Tuesday nights became bad for me, but later on in the season I saw the episode when Bauer and Palmer finally met.
Also in that season, the character Ahmed is saved by an American man only to betray him later, by taking him and his family hostage.
Alternatively, Esteban could have truly survived the attack and was later spit out by the shark near some island ... Let's go Wes!
The story is pulled off that well that i actually thought it was based on a true story until i found later it wasn't.
several years later i had the chance to revisit this film with the directors edition, what a difference it was.
The reason I bring this up again, after so many years, and so many more violent films later, is because Entertainment Weekly has published a list of The 25 Most Controversial Movies of All Time and Natural Born Killers is ranked as #8.
Ironically, Tarantino then copied several formal film techniques and innovations straight out of NBK for his later "Kill Bill" films.
She tries to hide her family from the new love of her life, who later, to her surprise, becomes the latest rap artist on her brother Damian's record label.
A year later, I knew about the past of LucasArts, I've read that LucasArts would bring back Monkey Island in a special edition version.
The same resistance tactics were used 25 years later by Gandhi, who liberated roughly the same number of people, and he is a household name.
We later learn that peter is really Edward, and he's married to the beautiful Sara.
Not only that, but a costume she aquires later is a very.
A real "wrong time/wrong place" movie, that MAY have been altered a little bit, a few years later, into a Molly Ringwald "Brat Pack" vehicle.
A few years later, I unfortunately sold both the soundtrack and video for some extra cash.
(Then again, many didn't realize the gay-themes that were so blatant in "A Nightmare On Elm Street 2" when it was first released five years later.)
(A dictum which he later expatiates at greater length: "He was the dumbest, stupidest dope I ever had the misfortune to shake hands with!")
I liked Randolph Scott's metaphor for the town, that it's like a wild animal that keeps getting kicked, and sooner or later it's going to do more than just snarl and growl miserably; it's going to bite back.
Scott makes a good, twinkle-eyed loner hero and Angela Lansbury is quite attractive as his leggy showgirl love interest, (though she would begin playing mothers of grown children just a few years later) but their romance is rather obligatory and uninspired.
The relation between that seems at first odd, but later kind of charming.
For me, Power's looks reached their full dazzle about two to three years later but if you only saw him in Cafe Metropole, you'd have a hard time believing there could be any improvement in that face.
We later learn the project is the remake of a cursed film that never wrapped production as its two stars were brutally murdered.
And on top of that, the later portion of the movie tends to have scenes right out of a mafia movie of older men sitting around tables talking about things that would otherwise be boring in a movie without the occasional offing of someone, like in any typical mobster movie.
There is the disreputable husband of the disreputable monologist, who joins a Baltic circus.There's a woman played by Julia Ormond, who's first seen in a sleazy backyard with a screwdriver in her stomach, and later reappears as Billy's wife.
Seventeen years and countless times reliving those moments later, they STILL make me laugh!!
Now 57 years later I can still do it.
As wild as he is when performing in this movie, he was much wilder on stage when he did his shows with Clayton and Jackson and later with Sonny Knight.
It is one of the few movies that Jimmy Durante ever appeared in where he was the main star (his work with Buster Keaton was as a comedy team; some later musicals like "Jumbo" give him leading parts, but not the starring role).
Now, six years later, I still cry when I watch this film.
While it was not eventually made into a series, you can see it sort of set the stage for Family Guy later on.
It's not hard to see who Steve later evolved into (a more famous cartoon by Seth Macfarlane) but unlike 'The Life of Larry', none of the jokes are reused in 'Family Guy'.
Any ways, a group of kids go off and get killed, one gets impregnated and later in the mortician's office gives birth (Apparently in addition to having a mortician's license, he's also qualified to deliver a baby) to a monster that looks like a cross between the Fiji Mermaid and a carrot.
this movie is horrible, and not even that, the guy stabbed some girl on her stomach, and she died 2 seconds later!
This movie is not worth anyones time, i don't even know why i am reviewing this p.o.s., well later...  Ps.The Movie Sucks
In a scene, two characters jump of a bridge into water, and later they are shown completely dry and the lady has her make-up intact.
There are scenes, glimmers and furrows which sometimes only later come through to haunt the mind; the whole stands as a brilliantly paced and sustained aesthetic reflection of decay and despondency.
This movie is a commendable attempt at telling the story of a simple, yet brave man and thus well-deservedly (50 years later!)
Interestingly, this happens only in a flashback which later turns out to be a lie.
This was apparently from Hitchcocks low period between Notorious 1946 and Strangers on a Train in 1951, that Rope has offcourse later become a classic, while Paradine Case and Under Capricorn haven't.
Eve has a crush on Jonathan that tells her that a couple of hours later, his mistress and actress Charlotte Inwood (Marlene Dietrich) had come to his apartment with her dress covered of gore and telling that she had killed her husband.
The shot was echoed years later in reverse, in "Frenzy," where the camera pulls back from a murder, goes down the stairs and out the door onto the street.
She actually looks younger seven years later in "Witness for the Prosecution."
The perversity of empathising with this great manipulator probably appealed to Hitchcock, who would later do the same with Robert Walker's Bruno Anthony and Anthony Perkins's Norman Bates, and I think it's possibly the one great scene in the film (if there's another, it would be Dietrich's self-choreographed rendition of 'The Laziest Gal in Town').
Possibly the most memorable and amusing performance in the film is that of Alastair Sim, most famous for playing Ebenezer Scrooge a year later.
Relax - it will all make sense later on (as characters dwindle in number).
I only hope the producers decide to release a second series covering later books of the manga
The story tells about 3 friends living in hamburg the night before one of them will go to a ship to Africa and later singapore.
Oliver, as the film would confirm later, is caught under a speeding car and it has everything to do with Petulia and her volatile, unpredictable, "quick-to-rush-into anger" husband David(Richard Chamberlain;he's unfortunately the unsung actor here because all the roles are so great that Chamberlain can be forgotten until his character changes Petulia's life through a horrible beating).
This is told in a most innovative way for its time, which makes it more regrettable that the film was handled as a pop extravaganza, when it was an innovative and puzzling product with a structure that demanded a more intellectual participation from the audience; and with an organic use of the flash-forward technique (proposed by its editor, Antony Gibbs), an anticipation device that would become common practice in later years (it is interesting to note that five years later the cinematographer of "Petulia", Nicolas Roeg, would direct Julie Christie in the horror drama "Don't Look Now", which contains a scene film editors often mention as an outstanding example of the flash-forward technique, a sex scene inter-cut with takes of the following scene, edited by Graeme Clifford).
40 years later, few movies have captured the spirit of contemporary life so well.
The film is also considered important as one of the first to use a vertical wipe, in this case creating a cartoon-like effect, as Mary Jane nudges the audience as she holds a can with 'PARAFFIN' written in huge letters (a joke borrowed by Beckett over fifty years later in his 'Act Without Words').
Plus, films like this eventually led to films like those of the later and much more famous slapstick comedians, so historically it's pretty important.
Even years later when I remember something he did I can't help but laugh.
None other than Kojak (Telly Savalas), portraying Captain Sam Surcher, with a thing for his cigarette (in training for his later lollipop placebo).
So I don't feel the filmmakers were being blasphemous by making this cheap, direct-to-TV sequel (the original also started out direct-to-TV, but later was released in theaters).
Dolph lundgren is a badaass in this and made me remember how much i love him sure he was never as big a star as most of the action hero's of the 80's but as he proves here, he's the one who's ruling the genre now cus he plays one mean mofo here, the story has Dolph's wife and kid murdered by the Russian mafia, he moves to los angelos and seven years later he is asked to go back to Russia to bring back somebody's daughter back, he refuses to do it at first until he realises it is the same gangster that killed his family seven years ago, so he goes to get his bloody revenge, the mechanik is violent and dark but its great entertainment and delivers the goods, sure the story has been done many times before but the way it is made and its style just make the mechanik an action classic, Dolph lundgren also directed it and does a brilliant job crafting one of the best action/thriller's for the past ten years.
and later on: "In addition no less than six companies are involved in the film's production, "presentation" and release.'
It would be much later that I recognized very famous and talented actors who were in the film, James Matson, Anthony Quinn, Christopher Lee, and Patricia Neal.
In terms of the amount of blood and gore on screen, it seems tame compared to movies made later.
[] 7 years later , Nick lives illegally in Los Angeles , as a Mechanik .
Realizing later (years later, more like 14 years later)that this movie has Absolutely NOTHING to do with the first Beyond the Door movie.
Nearing 15 years later and I CAN remember many of the skits and shorts.
First, I have to say that I am a big fan of Jean-Paul Belmondo, ever since I saw him in the french original "A Bout De Suffle" of the later remake "Breathless" (with Richard Gere).
The underperforming box office results of both "Zohan" and "The Love Guru" may help them realize this sooner rather than later.
Nick later hunts down Sasha and his men, wiping them out and leaving Sasha assumed dead, with a nasty bullet hole in the face.
Seven years later Nick is working in LA, illegally, as a mechanic when he is approached to do a job.
The film was of interest to me only for the fact that it's directed by the great Umberto Lenzi, although it came more towards the end of his career and as anyone who knows anything about Lenzi will tell you - his later films weren't his best!
20 years later, two college students hear a distress call coming from a short wave radio.
It opens with a portrayal of children at a Massachussetts elementary school planting a time capsule in 1959 that was to be opened 50 years later.
Now, fifty years later, John Koestler gets a hold of this list through his son and begins to see an alarming pattern emerge from the numbers.
I was half thinking it was of the DaVinciCode genre but humanoid aliens acting in a sinister manner who later turn out to be child abductors to an alien planet - well really!
The film starts off 50 years ago with an elementary school project where the students are asked to draw a picture to put in a time capsule that will be opened half a century later on the school's 50th anniversary.
Regardless of what I though of the movie overall, nearly 24 hrs later and the movie is still with me.
It was like the writer, and later the director, thought this was a good way to just end it as they were bored.
Because the three rules that were supposed to be followed are accidentally broken, and more fuzzy creatures pop up and then later turn into despicable and gruesome monsters.
Inside are drawings from students in 1959 predicting what things would be like in 2009 some 50 years later.
Soderbergh also held back a lot of the talking-to-himself passages and the hunting-for-the-daughter bus station sequence -- which are so grueling and disturbing -- until later, so we aren't too heavily hit too soon with Keane's severe mental problems.
Ten years later with two more films(one destroyed) under his belt the director has put together what on the surface seems an almost paper thin storyline but is in fact an intense and gripping film about a man coping with the loss of his daughter.
In discussing the movie with my friends later it was clear that we had all been deeply affected in different ways and had varying thoughts about the film.
The silence and quiet adds to the intimacy and tension, the lack of resolution leaves you lost in thought even days later.
Gotta love that scene where Sesshomaru is asked by his father whether he has someone to protect and year later sternly replies that he has no one to protect but later save Rin and Jaken.
The film focuses on the 'mysterious sword' later to be revealed as Sounga, the demon possessed soul looking to conquer the lands.
As gross and ridiculous as all that is, the worst is when some old woman is having a romantic dinner with a fake cat and later makes out with it.
And just for fun, see how many cast you can find who played in later Emmerich/Devlin films.
He opposes marriage on any grounds later to his childhood sweetheart Jenny Perotti (Jennifer Garner of "Juno") when they collide with each other again at the wedding rehearsal dinner for his kid brother Paul (Breckin Meyer of "Road Trip") and future wife Sandra (Lacey Chabert of "Black Christmas") in Newport.
A bespectacled Michael Douglas enters the action about 18 minutes later steals the show as Connor's recently deceased Uncle Wayne.
Years later Connor hooks up with Jenny and makes the mistake of not snuggling with her after sex.
Years later he is the best man and she is the maid of honor at his brothers wedding.
He was a real cow hand and would one day win the World Champion Steer Roper later.
They end up butting head's later on but I won't go there.
Also starring are Barton MacLane - who later played Gen. Peterson on "I Dream of Jeannie" - and Margaret Hamilton (aka The Wicked Witch of the West in "The Wizard of Oz").
But Sylvia is all forgiveness, and even takes it on the lam with him in her gravid condition, in one of Hollywood's earliest instances of criminal lovers on the lam...a genre that would later produce such classics as "They Live By Night" (1949), "Gun Crazy" (1949), "Badlands" (1973) and, of course, 1967's "Bonnie and Clyde."
This is one of the lesser known Fritz Lang flicks, and is a good representative of its era : it basically is about how blood-thirsty society misjudges and mistreats some of its members, "making them murderers" (my favorite one of that kind must be a little later "The Talk of the Town" with Cary Grant).
You can see why Lang is regarded as one of the masters of German Expresionism - some shots are really weird (check the shot of the courthouse somewhere in the beginning of the movie) and he uses strange camera angles, which will later be repeated in many film-noirs.
Six years later came the "Gremlins" sequel "Gremlins 2: The New Batch".
30 seconds later I realized it is not real, since the actors' names appeared during the end credits.
I remember films I saw at that age that really made an impression; watch them 20 years later and they're pretty poor.
It was years later that I realised it was a film not an actual record of events.
Because of budgetary restrictions, they shot the entire film without sound and the two comics dubbed everything later.
The apparent simplicity is used as a tool to conceal deeper issues in later installments, but here it's exactly what it looks like: a very basic script that allows any viewer to access the classic Star Trek universe without worrying about any complicated, underlying "mythology" (an element that has been mandatory in successful genre shows made after 1990).
"Escort Girl" is a chance to see former silent screen great Betty Compson in a later years role.
I would like to say the later, but you can judge for yourselves.
But still, It aired again a little while later and even though it was my second time seeing it, it was still very funny.
He was to die in a horrible fire only a few months later.
Dearly departed Special Agent Kate Todd (more later) and Special Agent Tim McGee (more later) have suffered the brunt of that in various occasions.
She is the only person in the team Gibbs actually shows affection for, and she is currently dating Special Agent Tim McGee (more later).
The whole concept of an architect of some buildings being responsible for how the people there act later was also very weak.
The honor student comes to visit; mom gives her some homemade cake; the daughter throws it away later.
THE ARCHITECT is a film based on a play by David Grieg that deals with social class dichotomy, lack of communication in families, gender confrontations in youths, and coming to grips with decisions of the past that later haunt.
An ambulance speeds him away and a few minutes later there is a raid by the army.
In the 80s, Chris Columbus penned a string of imaginative movies from Gremlins to The Goonies and later he directed the Home Alone films as well as Bicentennial Man (yes, I like it) and the first two Harry Potters.
I remembered many details from it and was amazed when I saw it years later.
They you'll be remembering it 40 years later!
Those that complain the mystery itself is unlinke Doyle's work must only be familiar with the later short stories.
It is a stretch to think his mathematical abilites were attainied later in life.
Years later he married a Rajput princess Jodhaa (Aiswarya Rai) who happens to be in a different religion.
The character of Hans appears initially as a lonely, rejected young German man, who after being rejected by Ilona, comes back years later a changed man, a Nazi colonel on charge of the rounding up of Jews in his area.
That's an old John Watson speaking in a narrative voice-over, and moments later at the Brompton School common we're going to see young Watson, played by Alan Cox at 15, meet Sherlock Holmes, played by Nicholas Rowe at 19.
Strange as it may seem the whole theme of the film revolves around a plaintive tune which first gained popularity in Budapest, later in Europe and then the whole world.
The love-triangle functions pretty well until the time a german customer, Hans, who comes regularly in the restaurant falls in love with Ilona, without success.A few years later the german army invades Hungary, Hans is back as a highly placed officer and the jewish condition of Lazlo is going to complicate the lives of the four protagonists.
This affectionate speculation on what might have happened has been made with respect and admiration, knowing references to Sherlock's later existence and in tribute to the author in his enduring works.
Charlie at first seems harmless enough but as things start to happen at the country house that border on insanity and later even cross over to murder the "fictictonal" Charlie is someone that's not at all to be ignored.
We at first have no idea just who Charlie is and like David and later Katherine we assume that he's only a make believe friend that Emily conjured up.
When the family cat and later one of the neighbors Elizabeth, Elisabeth Shue, end up dead and in the bathtub, the same place that David's dead wife was found, it becomes evident that this Charlie is a crazed lunatic on the loose in and around the Woodland Estates where David and Emily are straying at.
But later the two , especially Steven, come across as more then just grieving parents but very unstable and dangerous individuals.
Where he first met and got friendly and involved with the unsuspecting Emily and much later the rest of the unfortunate people that he came in contact with in the film "Hide and Seek".
Again, I was hopeful at 7pm this evening, and very angry two hours later.
She was already familiar to TV viewers as Louise Jefferson on "All in the Family" which would later spin her off into "The Jeffersons".
Ms. Hamilton would later that year or next become familiar as Fred Sandford's girlfriend Donna Harris on "Sandford and Son".
His actual place in her life was merely as one in a long list of men who'd contributed to the misery that was her later life.
Their paths did not cross again until many years later, when he wormed his way back into her life, and took charge of her affairs when she was most vulnerable.
This fact figures in prominently later on in the plot.
We shall see later, but for now, Ms. Harding just scored a 'bull's eye"!!!!
He became associated later on with Nick Charles and some wonderful comedies, but in this era, he's quite serious and as always, wonderful.
All very relevant today 70 plus years later.
I saw this on TCM a couple of nights ago, and stayed up late to see it a second time when it was screened again later in the evening.
While this WAS one of his movies, he was not exactly the same type of funny and sophisticated guy he later played in the Thin Man films or in LIBELED LADY.
Characters are full of charm, flesh and blood, and life... yes, Central European life after WWI (some visits to the area are still a good help in order to take better understanding... but be careful because later the understanding becomes LOVE forever, I can assure)   Just waiting the next one by Menzel, based on another classic by Bohumil Hrabal: I served the King of England.
This is the motivation for the sex scene that occurs later in the scene.
In the city he scratches a living from busking with the assistance of his son and grandson, but later his instrument offers consolation and catharsis to his fellow-villagers when they are uprooted from their homes by brutal Mexican soldiers in search of rebels harboured in the rural community.
Tavira looks like Charles Vanel in his later years.
Interestingly the strength of the film is that it does not show violence at later stages--something that Ken Loach could not restrain himself from.
Jennifer will play a major part later in the film to not only bring out what the motives of her murderer was but how they connected her to both Aubrey and what later turned out to be her identical twin Dakota Moss also played by Miss.
Attending a New Salem high school football game to see her boyfriend the teams star running back Jerrod Pointer, Brian Geraghty,in action Aubery is later kidnapped by this Man in Blue who holds her hostage for some two weeks.
The big surprise comes later when Aubrey regains conciseness and insists that she's not Aubrey Fleming at all!
She is found on the side of road weeks later, still alive, with her hand and leg viciously amputated by her captor.
It to me is more nostalgic of the 1970's and the actors who became the stars later on and the music that I heard when I was a kid.
Director Jackie Cooper, who reminds us he befriended the real Judy during their years together at M-G-M, lays the pathos at our feet right from the start, with Broadway's Andrea McArdle belting out a lonesome "I'm Always Chasing Rainbows", followed by a reprise of the song fifteen minutes later!
Some weeks later, my mother decided to turn pro, although double Olympic Champion Karl SchÃ¤fer implored her to go on skating for one more year.
The later Olympic Champion Jeanette Altwegg was not an excellent free skater but an outstanding school-figures skater.
My motherÂ´s lead role in both the ice skating and the frame story of a film featuring the Revue, ÂSpring on the Ice` (ÂFrÃ¼hling auf dem Eis`, 1950), was what inspired the later Olympic double champion, Ludmilla Belousova, to take up skating.
I loved the part where Frank ask's the neighbour to feed their cat when they were away, only to come back to the neighbour, moment's later, to tell her that they don't have a cat.
The chest business is so funny that it's resurrected a minute later.
VERY similar to the later "Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House" with one exception--this is funnier!
The second thing to remember is that Jack Benny did all of his scenes with Percy Kilbride (later known as Pa Kettle) on days in which he had gotten no sleep the night before.
Well, I must say that I really enjoyed the film for reasons I'll get to later Â which makes its absence on DVD more than a little baffling; incidentally, it was the tenth of Power's eleven collaborations with director King (the following effort, THE SUN ALSO RISES [1957], is perhaps the one I'd love to watch most of the star's remaining titles) as well as the second and last in which Power is co-starred with Susan Hayward (after the excellent suspense Western RAWHIDE [1951]).
And I only liked that show because at the start of the season its episodes were telling but it went downhill, all too willing to settle for melodramatic one shot story episodes in later seasons.
Very rich girl named A-LEX-is, who has a special interest in Superman, and later gets her whole head of hair burnt off (not permanently, mind).
You may not be satisfied at the beginning, but later...
Many years later, the sorceress informs He-Man that he is to go to the planet Etheria and give a special sword to someone.
Even later renditions include T.H.
I might be tempted if both films came out on one DVD or more special effects were added later.
I'm still thinking about the movie two days later.
To be honest, there's not many people whom I've met for only 15 minutes, if they died a few days later, I would weep for them.
Yes, Wallace Beery breaks Lily's heart (and ours) with his drunk scene played for laughs, but O'Neill knows whereof he's writing, and gives us a depth and subtext to these scenes which most comedies of the period or later "comedy drunk scenes" couldn't imagine, and lets us understand the deeper meaning even while we permit ourselves to smile at Beery & O'Neill's craft.
You could still see the technique that astounded audiences with "Sunset Boulevard" three decades later.
Once a movie thought as 'mind-blowing' can easily become a 'turkey' a decade later.
What's interesting is that now, so many years later, we're looking back at her looking back.
Just two years later, films began to crop up with the same tainted view of Hollywood, most with varying degrees of deception.
Just found out this was originally broadcast live, I watched a broadcast much later.
The show only came to life at the very end when she did all her songs from "Cabaret" (No "New York, New York"--that was 3 years later).
This highly anticipated match took to the action quickly but around 25 minutes later Goldberg hit 2 spears to pick up the win and his WWE debut match.
At one point, the scenes in Mordor get so far ahead of those in Gondor that they had to add narration at Mount Doom saying "Sam searched for Frodo for days..." when the subsequent events took place only seconds later.
In place of Tolkien's original songs, Maury Laws and Jules Bass save the day again (assisted partially by Bernard Hoffer, who would later write the score cues and theme songs for R/B's classic 80s series, Thundercats, Silverhawks and The Comic Strip).
It is pretty obvious he is playing a dangerous game and will get caught sooner or later.
When the husband of his lover unexpectedly dies and later his own wife, Tono becomes prime suspect and is arrested on two counts.
For example, the conflict of the young, light-skinned black girl (played by Fredi Washington in 1934, Susan Kohner in 1959) is much more fleshed out in the later version, and it just works better.
The movie skips ahead years later when Beavers' daughter (Fredi Washington) is trying to pass herself off as white...and things go out of control.
Most interesting, though, is that the daughter passing for white is played here by a black actress, whereas in the version almost three decades later the character is taken by a Caucasian.
And speaking of children, the opening scenes in which the daughter is an ostensibly adorable child and Colbert addressees her comments about her wanting her "quack-quack," it's hard not to think of the scene in "Midnight," a later and different but far better movie, in which Colbert speaks on the phone to her nonexistent little daughter's illness, with John Barrymore speaking in falsetto about a hangover at the other end.
Playing a tenderhearted maple syrup saleslady who first employs Miss Beavers, and later befriends her, Miss Colbert adds a distinct touch of class to the film.
Thirty years later, her career is revived after another divorce and health problems.
It is less cerebral and more starry than many of Allen's later movies (for a start it has Burt Reynolds who was hotter than hot in 1972).
You can also see how some of the skits inspired Saturday Night Live which was to come years later.
It looks as thought it was made much later than 72 but I guess Allen was ahead of his time.
I saw her live years later here on my hometown, she is still great, but I think that this is her best concert ever.
"Sodomy," though hilarious in its deadpan way, is not all that different in stilted tone or pretentious theme from Allen's later efforts like INTERIORS, ANOTHER WOMAN or HUSBANDS AND WIVES.
Maybe that is why he so ardently avoided any trace of humor in those later films, he realized just how easily they can lapse into self-parody.
And later: "We'd better hurry up.
Nobody expects it to be "Chip" but they don't realize it is until later...
One year later, the teachers and students who mocked him start dying, each one leaving a clue as to who will die next.
He was dealing with a big mouth bragger and unintentionally creating a rival that would later challenge him for Faline.
It is hard to figure out who Bob's wife was in the later show ("Newhart") because of this.
Keng gives Tong a Clash tape but later tells him that when he gave him the tape he forgot to give him his heart.
Keng asks Tong if he can lay in his lap and Tong says "no", then a minute later, he changes that to "no problem".
You might be surprised when I point out that Carter never fought Griffith for a world championship in 1963 though he did fight for the middlewight championship a year later against champion Joey Giardello who beat him on points with plenty to spare .
after 5 more explosions and much more crappy acting later, he beats him up and the whole place blows up with a huge explosion....he dives in for his wife....who is obviously dead at this point, brings her up, and saves her somehow....and in an ironic twist, john tritan says to his wife "shoulda gone to da beach" ohohohoh, hilarity ensued.
One presumes Robert Wagner has the same excuse for playing in this inanity that Lord Oliver gave for some of his later, trashy venues.
The lines were dumb especially when Ociee Nash met the president and fell down when nobody moved out of her way, then saying a little later to the president her opinion of "hurrying slowly" which the president and everybody there found to be a great idea.
The only part I liked was when Ociee Nash did something heroic and "unladylike" which also pleased people later in the film.
Some time later I accidentally caught a TV special about either the movie or J.M.Vincent (I think it was a about him, one of those Hollywood true story shows).
Maybe, just maybe his son will be crazy enough to make a sequel 30 years later???
And, later in the film, when one of the father's co-workers comes to the house and one of the girls' boyfriends pulls a knife and threatens the visitor, don't you think perhaps this MIGHT have clued somebody in to the fact that the girl and her friends were up to no good?!
Thirty years later he becomes into a deranged youth .
And there has ofcourse been some sabotage on the machine he is driving that occours later in the race.
I watched this movie on video last night and my stomach is still queasy 12 hours later.
But I guess the selling point to this movie is more to do with the music of The Beatles rather than character interaction but the music featured here is of the band`s early stuff and I much prefer their later material  As a strange footnote last year Paul McCartney`s daughter Stella was married on the island of Bute where I live .
Yet 2 minutes later we are expected to laugh at silly trivial material.
Luckily, 4 years later, first time writer-director Terry Loane's "MICKYBO AND ME" (2004) filled the gap with style and higher production values despite being made on a fraction of EVERLASTING PIECE's budget.
And although the tragic female ribbon dancer/swordfighter (far classier than her descendant, O-Ren Ishii) gets relatively little screen time, it's still more than the later additions to the group get in terms of character development or backstory, which is practically none.
Like "The Return of Josey Wales," "Iron Eagle 2," "Smoky and the Bandit 3," and "Jaws 3 & 4," the latest superficial sequel to show up, "Van Wilder 2: The Rise of Taj," substitutes a supporting character for the title protagonist and appears four years later.
Then, Mega Mountain was aired on HBO, years later since the last time, and saw it for whatever reason you could think of that included weed.
The movie's plot was probably stolen from a rejected script from Beverly Hills Cop 3, and later rewrote to achieve that disgusting kiddy tone.
This is later used by the guys in the final showdown with the baddies, which kind of brings their lesson back to them and creates kind of a purpose for their grandfather's teachings.
This was the responsibility of T. Guerra, a name that I have come to hate because, even if I agree that La Notte was a masterpiece and L'Aventura comes pretty close, I see them mostly as the result of Antonioni's vision, and Guerra's later projects convinced me he wasn't much of a screenwriter after all.
The fact that this movie surely inspired the Podrace (filmed 25 years later) in Starwars Episode I, should be proof enough for anyone that this is a movie ahead of its time.
A scene or two later, these soldiers begin charging a bunch of townsfolk who are simply standing in the middle of the road with something in hand, waiting to be mowed down.
Cut to a few minutes later after a cheeze chase scene that looked like a crowd had found something strange and was moving cautiously towards it.
To give a good example, later on in the "series" (who in their right mind calls a two-part show a "mini-series" anyway?
His desire to impress arises from his interactions with a witch's daughter, leading to his first summoning of the shadow (not to mention the fact that the daughter plays a key role later in the story).
90 minutes later I'd barely managed to stave off an aneurism it was that painful.
Then about 5 minutes later she makes out with a girl on who's experiencing her first trip on ecstasy for about 5 more minutes.
It's pretty much the same movie as 8MM (which came 20 years later).
The last episode of GIRL SHY was so good it was copied decades later in the GRADUATE, but there is nothing worth copying here.
once i saw that glenn salvage guy knock 2 guys down with a lousy hook kick that had NO sound effects i nearly spat my drink and turned the movie off which i did anyways 2 mins later.
Just from slightly different angles, but it was amusing when we first saw the exterior of the police station, and then later the cop is driving to the Natascha McElhone's apartment and WOW, it's the same building.
Being the idiot that i am, i rented it later from a different blockbuster and lost 2 hours of my life that i will never get back.
It wasn't like that, when a movie seems good at the start but goes downhill later; no.
Also, if you die of your worst fear, as the female lead later revealed, then getting hit by a subway train was this guy's worst fear???
Amazingly a director is also listed, but from what I can tell they pretty much turned on the camera, came back later, took the film to the editing room, forgot to turn on the lights and just started editing.
Vigil's greatest value may be as a study in Vincent Ward's development, which burst open to reveal his wonderful talent in the remarkable gem, The Navigator, two years later, the first of some first-class movies from New Zealand, such as The Piano, Whale Rider, and of course, The Lord of the Rings.
Want to see a brilliant Aussie movie with non stop action, feeling, and a sense of awe and wonder - watch "Gabriel" Made only four years later with much less money and a lot more soul - literally.
Sooner or later I will ask myself, what exactly are these two people, who are willing to put their life in danger again, doing in this no-man's land?
A few days later, the FBI agent, who told Charlie that the felons had not broken any Federal laws, arrives and looks into matters.
The photography is nothing special, I believe this is because Stimpson made no choices in preproduction so as to color correct it later.
Strange vibes exist from day one when not-so-friendly-neighbor/pig farmer Jonas Dodd (Mark Boone Junior) refuses to say hello to Guy, creating an uneasy tension?, later resulting in many weird unexplained scenes, including a bloody pigs head on a stick during a casual walk through the woods.
It's like the first five minutes of Chaplin's later Essanay short A WOMAN--but instead of then transitioning to a plot, this film just stays stuck in slapstick mode.
This shows little of Chaplin's later genius.
The Murdles are so overlooked in this telling, that one may wonder, when Mr Murdle shows up at Fanny and Sparkler's apartment to ask for a pen knife (with which he later commits suicide), who he is and where he came from at that point.
He later finds out the whole misfortune is to a certain extent linked to a vendetta for an act his father committed years back.
A few opening scenes were okay which sets the tone of the film but later when the characters goes out of character, narration turns lifeless.
He kidnaps Dunne and later forces a gunpoint addition for the real composer and it costs him his freedom.
The funniest thing happened next: a strange woman who didn't even know her own name or the dog's showed up a couple of minutes later and I just let her right in!
But this fake interview is so that Murphy's character can actually gain info about her boyfriend's exes so that she can find more out about him while also doing the background for a potential show about little black books, but then it turns out later she isn't going to do the story about the black books, but then we aren't really sure.
It seemed silly at first, but I later discovered that the print had been shown "double system," with separate hour-long reels of 35mm magnetic sound tracks.
i assumed later, his dead body would show up, or he would be the killer or something imaginative, but no, he just disappears from the movie, most likely getting out while he could to save his acting career.
3: After one of the female character's boyfriend dies she runs 10 feet away and sits down crying, cut back to here 10 minutes later still seating then decides to make a move.
It gets particularly silly in later seasons when the ship is seriously threatened by shuttlecraft (I kid you not).
all in all the show sucks, in star trek 4 Scotty comes across a way to re-crystalize dilithium, yet 100 years later voyager cannot do this so they need to enter dangerous nebula's to get more fuel... hmm.
The pokemon trainers come to a startling conclusion: Fighting is bad(Keep this in mind for later).
The immediate air support didn't turn up until later when everybody had gone home, had they flown all the way from America?
Death Touch later has sex with another prostitute, Jessie, but when he starts to hurt her (well, she is apparently supposed to be in pain even though she is smiling), the hotel manager comes running and Death Touch attacks him.
Director James P. Hogan maintains a pace every bit as leaden-footed as the zombie, and as for the script... well, it is probably this sort of script that Evelyn Ankers, the studio's "Scream Queen" of the 1940s, had in mind when she walked away from Universal a year later.
A couple of days later, she is bored and decides to return to Paris.
Two years later I saw Paul in St. Louis and the show was fantastic.
In the end, this film is not done to perfection, it's not faultless and diamond sharp as Bergmans later efforts.
David Butler, later to be a major director of musical comedies, has the second lead and Miss Moore never looked lovelier.
There is a particularly nuanced supporting roll performed with aplomb by a young upstart actress who never quite flew so high in her later years; Jennifer Lopez as Booker.
So if she's helping this basement monster out why does he later trap her in his basement and kill her?
Other than that, no scenes of further violence take place until at least an hour into the movie if you don't count the scene involving a decapitated mannequin as witnessed first-hand by Bob and later through an un-related flashback by Nancy (!!!).
If you want to see all the gory deaths later on you can choose to do so in the Deleted Scenes section.
.....Plus, later on, this creaky device is just dropped from the movie altogether!.....
Self-confidence is what I especially liked about this bald-headed character... Thirty years later, the kidnapped boy still roams the countryside in order to collect one hundred and three children.
As it is revealed later, a number of townspeople made a pact with the devil in exchange for a little favor.
When I saw the remake I was nauseated and upset because the later ending was completely changed.
It's mostly interesting for early glimpses of actors who would go on to do later, better work (especially John and Joan Cusack).
that was totally expected...anyway, the movie then skips to 7 years later.
Seven years later, the girls who took part in this event are individually invited to attend a gathering at a remote mansion.
This makes the scenes later on when a character lights up a cigarette down there even more harrowing.
Seven years later, the remaining sorority sisters receive invitations to attend a reunion at an isolated mountain estate.
Then the film cuts to seven years later where the remaining five sisters are called to a reunion in a house in the middle of the desert.
Seven years later, he sends anonymous invitations to the other girls to gather for a reunion.
There is no intelligence to these characters as in a scene when Lowe starts yelling at Moore because she won't throw her tampons away which 1 minute later results in Moore storming out of the apartment.
In the end when he is out,(this is, I presume, eight years later) he gets the money(so well hidden in 60 seconds eight years before that no one found it by accident in 8 years, including the police) and heads over to "his place".
This makes the film come across as indecisive and, as it will probably prove later, unmarketable.
We later find out that Flash is upset because he has been left behind twofold: by Hollywood (he was a former gaffer) and by his family.
Hours later, the cut is completely gone and the lady is back to being full of life and still beautiful as ever.
One year later, they're being stalked by a knife-wielding maniac (with the decidely unscary disguise of a hospital sterile mask and an orange jumpsuit).
This movie was the first zombie movie which i stopped watching because i was bored and resumed later on, just to see that the end sucks too.
The down side to having a creative mind when exposed to unexpected emotional and psychological horror of what humans can be capable of under the right circumstances is it leaves me upset and emotionally disturbed for days or weeks later.
Simon Pegg jilts his pregnant fiancÃ©e at the altar, but comes to regret it five years later when he meets the new man in his ex-girlfriend's life, a successful American hedge fund manager.
At the start of the film he's not fat, 5 years later he's not fat either.
It's never said exactly when the next scene takes place but Dennis is walking OK so I'd have to assume its at least 6 or more weeks later (thats how long a broken ankle would stay in plaster).
Years later, he's stuck in an unsatisfying job while she and their son are shacked up with successful business tycoon Whit (Hank Azaria) a charismatic American with lots to offer.
The film tells of how Dennis (Simon Pegg) runs away from his fiancÃ© Libby (Thandie Newton) and his unborn child only to have a sense of resolve five years later (now that he's grown up).
A bit later, a gypsy and his very buxom girlfriend are stranded in the rain.
A bit later, Dr. Janos Mikhelov and his wife arrive.
If this doesn't sound dumb enough, later you learn that the Mikhelovs are, in fact, vampire satanists!!!!
Ray and Hardy play off each other well, but really aren't a team; in each of these films, Ray has more footage and is clearly meant to be the hero, while Hardy bullies him in a manner very much unlike his later "Ollie" character's treatment of "Stanley".
However, in "Stick Around", Hardy sports a bowler hat that's identical to his later "Ollie" titfer (although with a fuller moustache), and he and Bobby -- after spending most of this movie as adversaries -- end up as drunken comrades.
A bit later, Bobby Ray -- whose brief acting career never firmly developed a screen persona -- performs an "impossible" gag that would have been inappropriate for Stan Laurel, when he pulls a long stepladder out of a much smaller toolkit.
There are even bigger howlers in the series, and I know what happens later, but this is the one that made me want to throw something at the TV.
In every company, marketers study the value customers place in their minds on every single product, and therefore this is how later on they are given a basis on giving products various prices.
So yesterday afternoon I was looking at a blog about faces that are begging to be punched, and while I didn't think too much of it at the time, I kept coming back to it later that night as I watched the latest (and my first) episode of TBS's sh*t factory otherwise known as "My Boys."
This prompt sequel to unforgettable STV action film Snake Eater has the same lead star, later Renegade star Lamas, and follows much the same formula as the first film, which is to say it delivers much the same results.
We also have to endure a close up of a human erection slipping in and out of a human front bottom later on so you have been warned   As for the rest of Kottering's hand at the helm I wonder if he's a native English speaker ?
Two years later and its Christmas time again.
Interesting for: 1) the stunt work of Yakima Cannutt-- riding a buckboard hitch with a boy on his back,and later diving through a window from a horse; 2) the child abuse theme that culminates in John Wayne's heartfelt hugging of young "Spud" at the end.
Pretty tame Lone Star fare, not up to later standards.
The other type ("Riders of Destiny" and "the Star Packer," for example) are still quite entertaining 75 years later.
As soon as he arrives at the castle he meets lovely ladies and later a scientist who explains the situation.
THEN they get thrown out again, and  are back four scenes later since that was the best set they had.
Let's not go any further with that, it just gets stupid later on.
The main character, Raymond Joshua, is an amateur poet and drug dealer who gets sent to prail(prison and jail, which I'll talk about later) after making the moronic mistake of attempting to jump a fence instead of running away from the fifty year old "doo-wop" cops.
For outdoor scenes on the vampire planet where they land, magenta-colored filters were used--though later they abruptly became green filters, red and then yellow filters!
You know it's bad when you find yourself wishing that you were watching the original Filipino caveman movie, without all the stoopid sci-fi claptrap that Adamson & Co. added later.
Now, over 20 years later, I hated it!
A few months later, I happened to see the same movie at the American International School in Lesotho except that this was not made by Sanjay Leela Bhansali, and it was an animated movie.
Only later did I realize (when I got hold of the DVD cover) that it was made much before Black even started production.
OR b) devise an elaborate plan to get one of your people to infiltrate the group, then wait until nightfall, when the building is plunged into total darkness, and take just one victim, leaving the rest for another night-time visit at a later date?
Festival was recently screened on Channel 4's new free movie channel (Film 4 UK) I'm a fan of Stephen Mangan from watching Green Wing so I thought I'd record it and watch it later - I erased the movie from my DVD recorder half way through it was that bad and struggled to make it that far!
Four years later, what does she remember?
Twelve years later, in 2004 they decided to get back together after a series of individual failures that seemed to bring all of them on the brink of personal and financial bankruptcy.
He said yes, then a moment later (after another reaction) quietly got up and moved to the back of the theater.
A while later he exit in the middle of the film.
It was obviously a swan song (she'd only make three more musicals in the later thirties) for her career and a typical "B" picture of the period.
Jeanne saw him later, with her father, and it is said by witnesses that she did not kiss Modigliani.
Fast forward two years later, Shinn has relocated to the PLANTs and enlisted in the ZAFT military.
Destiny just practically copied everything from Seed, except doing them backwards, rather than the ZAFT steals EA's mobile suits at the beginning of the season, this time is the opposite...and ZAFT have shitty mobile suits this season, the only fights that are worth seeing is when Kira kicks ass with Gundam Freedom, and later on both Kira and Athrun kick ass with their Infinite Justice and Strike Freedom.
At a later date she is apparently ready to "screw the rich" (as discussed earlier in a tender moment) via Eurabic alliances bolstered by her Christian mother's money.
These actors had to eat, support families, and it was training ground for some later great work.
How is it, at the end of the movie, that the bulldozers were already on the streets, ready to tear the town down, yet seconds later a fat guy pulls up in a limo and reverses the demolition?
These crusades and searches became the mainstays of the series in its later incarnations.
I got the impression that the initial filming was silent, and that the dialogue and sound effects were poorly dubbed on later.
episode why Fusco chose the worst possible direction is beyond me (maybe he was hanging with Jerry Stahl at the time of conceiving this project)   I say to anyone who in later years discovers the Alf television show to stay away from this movie- it is lame unfunny and a pile of steaminess.
This is a term that had no currency until the later 20th Century and sounds ridiculous in the mouth of Woolsey.
Mary married the King of France and later Charles Brandon Â by whom she became the grandmother of Queen Jane Grey.
It was Mary, Henry's younger sister, not Margaret, who was in love (and later became his wife) to Charles Brandon and was sent abroad to marry a feeble old king.
After her death some years later, he married a very young 14 year old girl meant to be his daughter in law originally.
Mad Dog doesn't catch the person and the assailant escapes, though I believe he is captured later on though that isn't relevant here.\ Murray's character as we learn is a top and tough Mafia Boss named Frank Milo.
And I later noticed that on the cover, a critic (must've been a dumb one at that) quoted this "The scariest horror film since The Shinning".
it seemed to me like they filmed several separate "incidents" that they found funny, then remembered that films are supposed to have plots, so they threw in one scene introducing his roommate as some guy smoking pot on his couch, and then we were expected to have an emotional reaction later on in the hospital scene when he's there and malkovich is pretending not to recognize him?
It's as writer/director Bart Freundlich didn't know what genre he wanted his movie to fall under during shooting, thinking that he would decide later in the editing room.
Cut to five years later.
As both couples later go to the park to relax on benches where "No Spooning" signs pop up, Fatty goes to Harry's wife and walks with her while Harry goes to Mabel where she's is sitting.
Mabel and Harry later pick their spouses up and go their separate ways before any more trouble stirs up...There must have been some morals law if the police are arresting adulterous couples in this short film!
Karla brings her boyfriend (Mekhi Phifer, who plays basically the same character he will play on 'ER' a few years later, and just as annoyingly), and Julie brings friend Will Benson (Benson - Ben's Son, geddit?)
And then later we're supposed to think she was duped by Bogart as well.
Movies like Dawn of the Dead took the idea of zombies and moulded it around a substantial social commentary, and later films such as The Evil Dead worked in spite of a low budget thanks to a constant stream of entertainment; Forest of Fear lacks both intelligence and interest, and it very much just another zombie movie.
If it is based on later books, then I would venture to say that such books, if actually like this cartoon, stray from the original ones and fail in the same regards and for the same reasons.
And I'm almost crying of joy and the intensity of the moment, only to get a "slap" in the face 2 seconds later, when Spike replies; "No, you don't...
Many of those dramas were later re-made as motion pictures.
If it were a little bit more "camp" in style, it might be funny to watch 20 years later, but it just doesn't get how ludicrous it is.
The only good thing to come out of this is Nia Long got introduced to Will Smith and she later appeared on his television show.
Not to mention that, after Tea's mum died because of Irena, Tea continues to write to Irena while she is in jail and pick her from prison years later.
Then I pressed play on my video and half an hour later I was, according to my girlfriend, sleeping like a baby.
Because the Vermeers were real persons who lived at one time, it is wrong to villify them in fiction three centuries later.
I decided on the later, since this was purely painful.
If you look really hard you will see me later hanging from some car chains from the rafters of an old shed.
Thankfully, the series bowed out in style three years later when Peter Cushing re-teamed with director Terence Fisher for the dignified swan song FRANKENSTEIN AND THE MONSTER FROM HELL (1973).
While I am not a huge fan of the later film, BETWEEN TWO WORLDS, it was a good film and was light-years better than this turgid film.
It turns out to be a beautifully photographed (by the great Hal Mohr) film with a striking use of light to create both an eerie effect and,at one point, a breathtaking otherworldly effect, something that Mohr would later win an Oscar for in the 1935 "A Midsummer Night's Dream".
warris charters does not exist and most confusingly of all lucky and dario do not hate each other later in life when they should.
they somehow get over to America some 50 years later undetected by anyone.
The only real merit of "Ants" is its nostalgia value--yes, I would watch this as a child and be utterly terrified of those bloodthirsty, radiation-grown buggers; years later, the puppet heads being shaken off-camera are less than impressive (as is Gordon's excessively shaking camera during the attack scenes), as is the stock footage blown up to make the ants tower over our human protagonists.
A few years later, he is working with his friends Sam Dalton (Bruce McGill) and Rodney Bedecker (Wil Wheaton, from Star Trek), when he detects an abnormal movement of the tectonic plates, provoked by Alan's new enterprise.
Now, 20 years later when the Earth is dominated by a race of dragons, Quinn (Bale) has become the leader of survivors from England.
The first entry in the endless series is surprisingly light on the smutty humour and harmless innuendo that later became the franchise's stock in trade.
Whether you're planning to see this in theaters or later buying it on DVD, prepare to cower yourself in disgust.
Add to that the entire "Wonder" of Bern myth (a fabrication of later decades) and the net result is a not too entertaining fairy-tale.
I haven't seen any of her previous or later attempts, but if this is best she can do, then she is in the wrong field of profession.
Years later, she becomes a famous Hollywood actress, but traumatized and haunted by her past.
He almost made it seem as if something interesting might happen later.
25 minutes later and Jimmy is awake once more.
You might laugh at some gags but later on you might realize that it is a kind of movies that are so bad that it makes you feel you should laugh at it.
18 years later Daytona works at a bad magic show.
Read a good book instead, you will thank me later.
But then, later in the year, they made this film.
19 years later, Daytona (played by third rate Jack Black wannabe Dan Fogler) is washed up and performing ping pong tricks at a run down theatre.
In one moment, Daytona and a female ping pong master are shown as hating each other...and out of nowhere, a minute later, they are suddenly love interests.

17 years later and I still shudder at the memory of having seen this in the theater.
He's not at all bad here (in an badly written and implausible role), but was never able to establish himself as a serious actor, though he continued to work, showing up notably decades later in Twin Peaks.
That's the reassuring part: he confided that this was a first effort which started as essentially an "acting experiment" and only later took the form of a feature film.

When hero burglarizes a dentists office you'll be on the edge of your seat and later when he gets beat up by a flying sheet of plywood?
But later, the horrid beasties began devouring everyone in their path.
Now believe it or not, I later found this film in the 5 dollar bin at Wal Mart and figured, why not?
Also what may be of some notice to a few audience members out there is that this flick was the first legitimate cinematic directorial debut by now-respected director Bill Condon, who later went on to great success with a couple of somewhat controversial, and rightfully Oscar-nominated if you've actually seen them, films entitled: "Gods and Monsters" (1998), and "Kinsey" (2005).
"From the Earth to the Moon" is often confused with "First Men in the Moon" which was made five years later.
Probably because both are set in the 19th century and both feature a female stowaway (played by Martha Hyer in the later film).
This mish-mash film was just as bad as many of the later films and is only marginally watchable.

"Pure Luck" is an American remake of the second one, made ten years later.
Bottom line is that what this movie lacked is what lacks in a lot of relationships where people ask later "what went wrong?
With the exception of Eartha Kitt and Scatman Crothers playing what one would expect, the others play characters that they would not be known for in later years.
Either way, it's a strange choice, made worse by the fact that he remains just as unemotional later as he watches the Cratchets' mourn for Tiny Tim.
Trust me, you'll thank me later.
The characters were so two dimensional and used so many clichÃ©'s, I literally had to turn off the movie and return later when I could compose myself.
The plot is riddled with holes which leave you wondering what just happened and was it significant, then later on you find out that it wasn't.

The other moment comes 30 minutes later.
Sure, it feels like a rip-off of "Star Wars," "Star Trek," "Dark Star," and even "Cave Dwellers" (which came a few years later), but it's low-budget fun in the same way that playing with "A-Team" action figures was fun when I was 5.
All-star political adventure, filmed inexplicably on videotape (later transferred, with poor results, to film), was shown on ABC-TV just a few months ahead of NBC's version of the story, "Raid on Entebbe"; it was a rush job to beat the clock, and it shows.
But I guess the selling point to this movie is more to do with the music of The Beatles rather than character interaction but the music featured here is of the band`s early stuff and I much prefer their later material  As a strange footnote last year Paul McCartney`s daughter Stella was married on the island of Bute where I live .
Don't expect typical Hitchcock touches in this early silent of his called Easy Virture since this isn't even a suspense film but more of a melodrama about a divorced woman who can't escape her past, a past in which her then-husband discovered her painter's infatuation with her, which he mistakes for an affair, and gets shot by him but survives though the painter later commits suicide (which I wouldn't have known about if I hadn't read the synopsis on the DVD case back).
It is obvious that this film was just a chance for the director to work his craft until he ultimately made a dandy film a year later (THE LODGER).

And I will say, Chuck's later movies were actually better.
About 10 years later or so, I saw it again, and it wasn't very frightening at all.
Made more "relevant" for the mid-90s -- by introducing the idea that the aliens were trying to get us to degrade our planet and thus make it habitable for them -- the ecological subtext seems a little knee-jerk ten years later.
I recently acquired this via the full-frame Image DVD in anticipation of the HTF Halloween challenge; I knew the film was nowhere near as well regarded as the 1977 original Â but I wasn't aware that Craven only made it because he was hard-up for cash, that he later disowned the result and that the picture was even shelved for two years (by which time he had re-acquired his stature with A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET [1984] which itself developed into a franchise and, ironically, the director would also return to much later after another lean period in his career)!

The two girls later realize that their being followed by car and lose Yule in traffic.
You first get the impression that Yule has something to do with Tom and their acting, secretly, as some kind of tag-team of sleaze-balls and later feel that there's a falling out between the two.
We also get confused signals to just what happened to Amanda when she's later murdered in her parked car outside the Marlin Bay Club.
The movie gets even more confusing when the off-the-wall Yule after threatening Tom, by phone, at the textile factory is later shot to death by the police as they catch him trying to break into the Deese's house.
Naturally this movie lacks the style and frightening atmosphere of the aforementioned titles and even the make-up effects are poorer, despite being made over 30 years later.

Since the time of The Day The Earth Stood Still, when all Klaatu wanted to do was give the Earth leaders a groovy gift and got thanked by having it shot out of his hand, and in a multitude of other films since, Hollywood has taught us that when we are confronted with something of superior intellect, or of mysterious origins, if we don't understand it, if it doesn't look like a fluffy kittie, we are to shoot first, and ask questions later.
Of course the main star here, James Olsen, is probably more familiar from his roles in The Andromeda Strain a couple of years later, or the Arnie vehicle, Commando, some time later.
They are introduced only to be killed off a couple minutes later.
Quite dismal adaptation of Christie's whodunit, which had been filmed better twice before as Murder She Said (1962) starring Margaret Rutherford as Miss Marple and later in 1987 as part of the BBC's acclaimed series with Joan Hickson.
When members of the cast and crew of Jana's latest flick (called Scream) begin to disappear, only to turn up dead several days later, the finger of suspicion naturally points to Vinny, the crazed, drooling fan who has been stalking poor Jana, but is he really responsible, or is someone else killing time by killing in Cannes?
The movie is dull, boring and completely unfunny..I think this was made too early in the careers of Danson and Mandel...made five years later with a better script it would've been much much better..  On a scale of one to ten..0
I immediately recognized as 1 of 2 movies that I saw when I was a starving (pretty much literally) student living away from home for the first time, in 1973, and couldn't resist picking it up and giving it a look, that many years later.
We see a scene with what looked like a herd of sheep but I think it is cattle since we later find out they were eaten by the locust.
of Homeland Security, in which Lawless briefs a panel wearing full dress uniforms while she is dressed in skin-tight jeans; the inevitable expression of remorse from the entomologist, prior to his bloody demise; the scene in the Pittsburgh office, with the b-day party being interrupted by a picture window full of bugs (plus the revelation that the office hunk is even wimpier than Lawless' bf); the scene in the chopper when Lawless declares she's hormonal due to her pregnancy, and just might kill everyone in the chopper if the DHS doesn't change its drastic plan; the climactic kiss that is interrupted by the buzzing of the swarm; and just about every scene in which people are warned about the locusts' pending arrival -- first, they're in denial; minutes later, they're running for their lives.
The first sign that this movie going down hill fast is when James Brolin asks Hal Holbrook 'how many people know about this' and Hal replies something like 'only a few' but we have already seen about 75 people involved which later turns into about 750.
This film rates as probably the worst ever to be remade (just a few years later, as "Missile to the Moon").

The age of the movie is no excuse, 2 years later "The Awful Truth" would be filmed.. A final word about the direction.
Hopefully, though, most - if not all - of these tiny thespians a year later were able to say that they had a little (not another pun) part in the much worthier Wizard of Oz; not The Terror of Tiny Town.
Carlin's (Washington's) curiosity about the inner working of the agency he is later employed by in the beginning of the film is very believable.
The first time I see it I think surely its a set up that will pay off later.

The only one that went on to become famous was Laughlin when 15 years later he did "Billy Jack".

Even Hal Roach -- in later years and in an honest moment -- admitted this was far from the best work by the comedy team.
When we find out later how this killing is sort of like an attraction for rich adrenalin junkies, the only thing one can possibly feel is apathy.
Roth himself later claimed to make this film "to show Americans' ignorance of the world around them" and in the process only shows his own ignorance when it comes to film-making.
Besides, it manages to embarrass a handful of Hollywood veterans (Brand, Mel Ferrer as the dying father of one of the latter's victims Â incidentally, he'd be featured in another genre offering by this title, Umberto Lenzi's Italian zombie flick, which I had intended to acquire for this challenge but its late-night screening began much later than advertised and my VHS tape ran out[!
The far-fetched premise of being able to see the past as it happens four and a half days later should seem crazy and by watching the previews you are given the idea that it will be just a series of do-overs.
Even though Vardalos is not at the helm this time (unlike the far more execrable "I Hate Valentine's Day" released a month later), I have a feeling that she has more talent than this movie allows her to display.
The romantic couple never interacted that much early in the movie to dislike each other or to later fall in love.
A while later, someone named Clay sets off on his motorbike to look for his sister (who was one of the kids from the start) and he meets some other kids who are there to be slaughtered.

Considering all the things they might have updated 29 years later, there really seems to have been little thought put into this movie.
She'll thank you later.
just absolute piece of utter drivel..although I admit I only lasted about half an hour somewhere in the middle You can't even call this rubbish... for instance, I caught the scene where they are supposedly digging in the wrong place, find the right place (72 steps, but no ones counting) and about 20 metres away the heroine brushes away a few CMOS of sand BY HAND and uncovers the tomb....a few rubbishy sentences later we see someone put a dynamite YES DYNAMITE stick in the very same sand, it blows up, and you have this beautiful SQUARE HOLE with nice clean staircase going down to the tomb.
Almost all of the acting is completely covered up by the continuing narration until later in the movie, when the actors finally have time to present their characters without someone telling us what to think of them.
For some reason, God thinks that the French should be spared the oppressive force of the English (why God 'mysteriously' gives up the French to the Germans countless times in later years is another question all together).
Again, this made for a fascinating woman, as later you saw bits and pieces of her life that led you to believe she is a real person with real likes and dislikes--and even a liking for Gondo.
The mother dies of a heart attack it is clear and it seems like some of the youngsters who die later on might have died by accidents prompted by the spider attacks although this less clear due to the shoddy way the scenes are shot.
All the later victims effectively dying by chance like this seems contrived and extremely silly, although if they did die by spider venom the forensics department in this town is really bad for not picking up on it.
A group of guys who sang together in a college a Capella group reunite 15 years later to perform at a friend's wedding and discover how their lives have progressed -- and in some cases regressed -- since their college heyday, an idea that seems dated and the lack of face-value, disappoints all the way.
No matter how pulpy the subject matter, director Ray Kellogg (who would later go on to direct, of all things, John Wayne in 1960s propaganda film The Green Berets) demonstrates a suitable awareness of horror thriller conventions, favouring a slow, meticulous build up of narrative tension in favour of cheap shocks (the laughably over the top opening narration notwithstanding), making the inevitable lizard mayhem all the more welcome.
A small town in maybe Texas is terrorized by a giant Gila monster for some reason.The local sheriff,who mostly talks on the phone a lot,and a kind hearted young dragster,Chase,set out to rid the town of this threat.Chase races around town in his souped up car and beats the sheriff to all the wrecks and bad stuff that the monster does.Save this tidbit for later---Chase,for some ungodly unexplained reason, also has access to nitroglycerin that apparently comes in what looked to be coffee cans with "XXX" stenciled on them.
Ryoko (Miyamoto Nobuko) and Gondo (Yamazaki Tsutomu) are of course the dueling protagonists, but each is anti-heroic, something I ordinarily can't stand: Gondo is the operator of a chain of Japan's ubiquitous "Love Hotels," where lovers go to find short-term lodgings for their trysts, who's got a complex system in place to evade Japan's horrific taxation; Ryoko is a tax auditor, later promoted to investigator, who, though admirable in her relentless dedication and competence, is party to some of the most horrendous legal assaults on businesspeople imaginable.
We later find out that Aladdin's father is the king of thieves and he goes on a quest to bring him back and reform him.
There was also the local Shealter Island Sheriff Deluca, Chris Penn, who also got into the act later in the movie, after you forgot all about him and thought that his brainless actions earlier were just comic relief.
I watched the movie when it came out (and again when it ran in reruns about a year later) and from what I remember it was typical shlocky '70s action-adventure stuff -- actors trying to either start a career or resurrect one, a suspenseful moment every fifteen minutes or so to allow the director to fade to black and go to commercial, horrid disco-inflected "Charlie's Angels"-ish soundtrack, etc.
This is one of those directorial choices that are difficult to make: annoy the audience and hope they understand later why it had to be done that way.
It's hard to make chicken salad from chicken feathers, but this film hardly tries, loosely connecting indifferent footage of Sellers playing Inspector Jacques Clouseau to later scenes involving the disappearances of the Pink Panther diamond and, eventually, Clouseau himself.
Upon Sellers' death, UA offered the film (which was originally to be helmed by Sidney Poitier, then later Clive Donner) back to Edwards.
The movie is a decent idea and a take on the popular Sasquatch legend was bound to wind up on film sooner or later.
So, if they had to do another one two decades later, why cast the Pepsi Girl in the coveted role as Helen??

OK, so he wakes up without aging, 53 years later.
But making claymation cartoons 20 years later is not going to help.
A later re-viewing, or perhaps speaking Farsi, might lead me to a greater appreciation of this film.
overall together with the first one my favorite part, i mean normally i'm not a fan of little girls in movies, and i hate it most if the director wants to force you into still liking her after she killed humanity or some sort of that, like the children in 28 Weeks later who have just wiped out our world and humanity, hated them right from the beginning, while i even liked Ghost after we learned about her, i mean it's quite a feat playing at the end a little murder girl and still appearing genuinely innocent, but i think it's the way her illness makes her into believing what she does.
So again we sat back and waited for that moment to come again and we figured wow if it was so interesting for the first Â½ hour it would no doubt be even better later on!
But then, only a second later when Scott stops the wagon, the guy is splayed out--dead as a doornail!!

This shots down the park, but some year later a boy goes out to the shut down amuzement park.
14 years later, a journalist investigating the park goes missing (naturally).
The major problem it had, was that it felt like some of the later Laurel and Hardy movies, the plotting was a little trite.
In fact, director Tobe Hooper only shows us what is necessary, maybe because of the low budget he was working with (Hooper's later output would suggest this), but it forced creativity from the filmmaker that is sadly lacking in his other work (Poltergeist may be an exception, but Hooper's direction was steered by Spielberg on that one).
In other words, it's typical later Disney, through and through.
Peron's and later the Peronist's power base were the industrial workers whose unions were brought into line with strong arm tactics.
They instead dismissed it as a pointless exercise in graphic gore(there's actually very little), while praising lousy later films like 'Blair Witch' to the skies because of so-called deeper meanings.
His perfect killer image was later destroyed by other actors in later sequels.
I saw this movie and was impressed first only for one reason .The new concept of short term memory loss .But then later when I saw the original one Memento I was totally awestruck by how beautifully the screenplay was done ,you in fact live with the character ,which you can never feel for once in Ghajini .Well thats not the only flaw the whole brilliance and intelligence of Mememto is diminished in Ghajini .

The later of these two staples of great horror is often cast aside in modern horror movies-especially in those churned out by the great Hollywood engine.

The supporting cast are a lot of then unknowns who later went on to more visible careers.
This film, 35 years later, sticks more or less to the same narrative path, based as it is on the novel and the earlier screenplay, but is louder, splashier, and gorier.
It's quickly corrected and the miscreants later explain that they mixed up Peck's unit with another -- and they apologize!
The later contretemps that deprive Peck of reinforcements and supplies are due to an unavoidable failure in communication, so it's nobody's fault.
This film is packed with character actors, several of whom later became stars and all of whom made their names in Hollywood.
Robert Blake, George Peppard, Rip Torn, Harry Guardino, Woody Strode, Martin Landau (his first role), Gavin MacLeod, Harry Dean Stanton, Clarence Williams III - if made ten years later, this film would have cost millions more and in truth been impossible to produce.
and then when you try to remember it later you can't.
anyways I'm outtie later and don't watch this movie ... "Advice of wisdom!

Even though Bill warned a gal to watch out for the tracks (much later, at that), you could clearly see on the floor there weren't any, and while they went into other rooms there was no logic to the place, no real directional way that the tracks would be able to take a car around in them.

Some 45 years later, the opportunity to purchase this touchstone of my youth on VHS presented itself.
Yes, that's right, Jim Davis who later became Jock Ewing.
And of all these series films, the Falcon films are among my favorites--even the later Tom Conway versions (that were slightly less enjoyable than his brother's Falcon films).
This film was so bad that the memory of it still pollutes my brain some 25+ years later.
Laughlin and Co. seem convinced that they're so important that they're being investigated by the FBI, CIA, and the US government at large for their "scorching exposes" (Laughlin would, in real-life, use this excuse for the failure of his later Billy Jack Goes to Washington).
HOwever long it was later, the TV was switched off, and I immediately started ranting about how bad it was.
The music was good too (except for one instance which I will rant about later) and the cinematography was decent too.

Paltrow plays an aspiring air hostess with ambitions to travel the world,rather than just domestically in the US,but is torn between love for her boyfriend back home (Ruffalo) and eventually goes back to him.And,er,that's it.A story so paper thin and obvious that it seems to have been written by an inexperienced,first time hack (as indeed it apparently was),with forced and shallow comic situations,dialogue and characterisations.Some surface attractiveness and slickness do not detract from it's persistent banality and lack of depth,and events did conspire against VIEW FROM THE TOP from the start.Filmed in 2001,it's original release was held back (due to the events on 9/11) until two years later,by which time it flopped rather dismally.

  As a young lad at school in Southern London in the 1950s I found myself inculcated with the idea of the supremacy of being English, and that the Irish were so silly they only knew how to plant potatoes............  Years later, from my friendly enclave retreat, hidden in the depths of peaceful Spain, I have noted how over the last twenty years the Emerald Isle has been doing some wonderful things in all spheres of life, especially with its valuable contribution as a member of the European Union.

There are brief glimpses of Argento's class, the nicely lit blue tones as Mel is killed, or the sequence when Argento's camera pans across the floor for what seems like an eternity with lots of people walking past to come to rest on the killers & their victims feet by which a few seconds later her decapitated head lands but these scenes are few & far between as although technically Non Ho Sonno is good it's all pretty bland & forgettable for most of it's duration.
The worst is a bit later when Clark is caught committing another crime and Bellamy could have just let the police take her away--yet he vouches for her and prevents her arrest!!

But this factoid is of interest in that, 3 years later, Paramount would try the same thing, once again with M Chevalier directed by Ernst Lubitsch, on another of the major hits of the Viennese musical stage during the first decade of the 20th century, and that time the result would be a smash success: The Merry Widow.

of Homeland Security, in which Lawless briefs a panel wearing full dress uniforms while she is dressed in skin-tight jeans; the inevitable expression of remorse from the entomologist, prior to his bloody demise; the scene in the Pittsburgh office, with the b-day party being interrupted by a picture window full of bugs (plus the revelation that the office hunk is even wimpier than Lawless' bf); the scene in the chopper when Lawless declares she's hormonal due to her pregnancy, and just might kill everyone in the chopper if the DHS doesn't change its drastic plan; the climactic kiss that is interrupted by the buzzing of the swarm; and just about every scene in which people are warned about the locusts' pending arrival -- first, they're in denial; minutes later, they're running for their lives.
This movie tediously switches between these 1873 murders and the modern day story of a woman investigating the crime over 100 years later.
I adored the show, and a week later I had the soundtrack to the 1998 revival.

This surprisingly primitive 'streamliner' comedy from the Roach Studios -- with the collapse of the comedy short subject market in the mid-thirties, Hal Roach decided to go into feature production, first with films like the TOPPER series and later with second features that timed in at less than an hour -- contains all the standard cheap comedy motifs, including a Murphy Bed -- and runs through them in a rather mechanical fashion as made-it-from-scratch taxi fleet owners William Bendix and Joe Sawyer get tangled up with a girl who tries to kill herself and declares herself their responsibility.

Perhaps there is some use made of the ruined piano later, after the point at which I stopped watching, but nobody even thinks about it during the storm?

It marks one of the last gasps of the low-budget, hardware-driven (Rockets and Rayguns, if you like) school of sci-fi and falls well short of its contemporary "Marooned", much less merit any comparison with "2001" and other later high concept films.

Now there were conscientious objectors but these were normally people with a conscience about taking part in war.James Mason is one example.However the ideas and views put forward by Powers character would not have been current in the later part of 1940.By that time this country was fighting on its own in a life and death struggle.Chamberlain had resigned and Churchill was now PM.There was an all party coalition government not a National Conservative government.Hitlers peace feelers had been rebuffed and with the blitz there was now no go back.So the anti war sentiments put forward in the film are totally unbelievable as is Powers character.This film may have been a big success in its day but now looks very dated.

Hellraiser Hellworld is painful to watch and by that I mean really poor, cast with a stereotypical British actor in line with the current US trend it always seems to be a cockney or someone who has the Pride & Prejudice Mr Darcy, Mr Darcy accent, there are other areas in England apart from London, period dramas and Narnia, this film is very predictable and boring, the box and pinhead seem to have taken a back seat in the later movies and also people seem to just die instantly as opposed to being taken to hell or within hell, as IMDb user troyanov states, 'Lance and interestingly even Pinhead looks bored', probably due to their 'uninspiringly' crap dialogue.

In my later years I'm learning to appreciate Bing's movies more than when I was young.

Then the captain is later referred to as a "cheertator".
He later takes her down to his "inner sanctum", which it is cooler, but also isolated.
There's a great moment later on, with Iris swinging on one of the crane hooks by the harbour.
As she explains to the shoe-shiner later, she's unsure about her feelings and feels it is impossible for her to leave the place.
Well I first saw it on the Sci-Fi channel, then a few weeks later uneditied on Showtime, its much better on showtime, becuz then at least there is some nudity.
I'm reminded of the famous story retold by W. Somerset Maugham, "Appointment in Samarra", where a man, upon bumping into Death in the streets of Baghdad, flees to Samarra to avoid his wrath, but instead runs into Death who is waiting for him in Samarra, and whose anger at the jostling in Baghdad is revealed to have been mere surprise, as he had been expecting to see the man in Samarra later in the day.

Such goings on could not have occurred in this film had it come out a year later--after the toughened Production Code was enacted.
And here, almost 40 years later, we have a director who thinks it would be a great idea to try it again, this time (unlike Jewison, who was far more judicious) over the ENTIRE STRETCH of a movie.
In the UK, this film has been rated '15', which is a shame as a sizeable proportion of the audience that would most likely appreciate the schoolboy humour is too young to see it at the cinema - They'll probably catch it on TV sooner or later, which is where this film belongs.
One guy on a casino ship is shot from about five feet away but isn't badly hurt and later Reagan is shot at the same range twice AND the car he's in is pushed off a cliff AND it lands in a lake AND he's fine!!
The speech in the opening sequence was used in the song "Judgement day" by method man,so i know i'm not the only one that scene this.This one opened the door for JC and sci-fi,later he would star in 2 of his best movies Univesal soldier and Timecop(which was critically acclaimed as his best role.
Also later when she briefly shows her boobs.
She is about 12 in the flashbacks but later she is in her 20's and Van Damme looks exactly the same!
Some of the editing is very bad, for example, Keitel standing on a elevated road, and a second later getting on a tram down at ground level with no explanation as to how he got down there (that part's probably on the cutting room floor.)
The later entries on that list follow the same formula, except it substitutes sports for class and coach for teacher.
I've been watching this show as a fan from the first episodes and now many years later have come to the conclusion this show is completely fake and that Jason and Grant are nothing but a couple of frauds.
I had to shut it off, and come back to it later.
it was great tho because when he gets back from Russia later that ,probably year, his son is 5 years older.
A moment later the camera shows the medical technician who's been keeping visitors away so Adama can rest...standing just out of sight listening, smiling.
The sores that later appeared on Montenegro are also kinda cool (though watching him transform was just plain silly).
Awkward for any later trial I would have thought.
The characer "Wet" has a faded scar in one scene; a few scenes later another character is commenting on how she just got a bad scar on her face from a beating, then, minutes later (days later in movie-speak), her scars are all red a fresh, even though she had them way before the mention of any beating.
3 hours later, it became clear it was a tad bit longer.

Then the three take a boat ride across a lake to a country villa where resides a Stern-Looking Woman and, as we will later learn, a Wimpish Man.
After some brief introductions, the foursome decide to have sex and it is during this scene (or perhaps a later sex scene - my memory fails me here so cut me some slack) that said Wimpish Man appears from behind a plate-glass window and proceeds to watch for a while.
While sex movies were all simulated here, home video was wholly unregulated, which in later years would bring up the furore over the so called 'Video Nasties' and the introduction of the Video Recordings Act, so as this movie was made in 1981, a little imagination and a little more money could have made an effective adult chiller.
Fortunately, 20 odd years later, we're still waiting.
At first he's comprehensive and helpful, but later it actually seems as if he wants to prevent people from saving themselves.
I thought the plot seemed OK, which is another reason for seeing the movie, but later on it just got dumb and boring.
As an old Italian movie it was filmed without sound and voice-overs were added later just like a Spaghetti Western.
Unfortunately, the scenes of the air battles later in the movie will make you cringe.
Blackmail and murder ensue...  A step up from the convoluted machinations of THE CAT O'NINE TAILS (1970), FOUR FLIES ON GREY VELVET is little more than a dress rehearsal for the visual flourishes that would distinguish director Dario Argento's later work.
Some years later, his body & those of his comrades are discovered in wreckage previously buried in a sandstorm.

This film reminded me a lot of My Darling Clementine, the John Ford film from a few years later starring Henry Fonda.
This was to have been Astaire's final film, but he came out of retirement a year or so later to co-star in "Easter Parade" and finally do a never topped Berlin "songbook" that includes "Steppin' Out With My Baby," one of Astaire's greatest moments.
The film begins with a woman realizing she needs to spend time alone because she's been having "difficult times" (so we can later explain why she thinks she must be crazy when she sees things), then the big house inherited from her dead aunt (low angle shots here, with blue lights behind dead trees, a la Amityville horror) and a bunch of bad acting locals who act unkind to this lady almost as if just because the script calls for it.
Dodge City is a genuine classic featuring some of the most memorable sequences in the history of westerns, such as a spectacular saloon fight, many times imitated in later films but never surpassed.
You later see his face poorly pasted on a stained-glass window which causes a female character to scream rather inappropriately.
Errol Flynn would later play some great roles in westerns (for example, They Died with Their Boots On), but here he is really just playing Robin Hood in a Stetson, and only the vaguest attempt at an American accent (although, like Captain Blood, he's supposed to be an Irishman here, making his plummy English tones even more bizarre).
Westerns from the 30's and '40's were still much different than the later spaghetti-westerns.
Well, you make his neurotic wife run away with somebody else, and then make him get mad when the girl puts on his wifes clothing and only later give in to his feelings.
The plot is one that later became something of a clichÃ© in the Western, so much so that Mel Brooks chose to satirise it in "Blazing Saddles", the one about the stranger in town who leads the townsfolk in their fight against a gang of villains.
Michael Curtiz was to repeat the idea of a singing duel a few years later in "Casablanca".
However, despite bringing back most of the exact same cast in the movie VIRGINIA CITY only one year later, is really isn't a sequel at all--just the same formula rearranged quite a bit!
This same lady who has absolutely no scruples (she kills her brother-in-law at the end of that scene for some reason or another which isn't really explained *and* she is sleeping with the guy) later on in the film decides she will sacrifice herself for that same sister - huh?
Progress is coming, but a couple of years later, it becomes a lawless town.
Then days later Elton is really taken from him when he is arrested so Bobby is totally alone.
But she related on an interview I saw with her that she was at a revival of this and of Robin Hood and seeing both of them again some forty years later and commenting on how well the audience responded, she felt a pride in the work she did.
Another example (a large one at that) is that even though one person in the film claims he is haunted by what happened everyday and that he is against the church (due to a lawsuit he's filed about 18 years later), the Church is still a big part of his life.
It's amazing that only a very short time later he was acting in the fantastic movie Captain Blood!
To prove that first impressions aren't always everything, we also have Errol Flynn giving his screen debut, in a performance that doesn't show any signs of the charisma and appeal Flynn would have only two years later in "Captain Blood".
OK back in 90whatever in the UK,the episodes of different series were not shown a year apart in order to catch up with the years and also since I didn't have a TV for most of 94/95 I ended up seeing episodes either on video or in whatever order they were on TV,so I saw them in totally the wrong order and never knew which ones were series 1,2,3 or 4 until 10 years later when I found an episode guide online.
Ms. Paddock is remarkable in her power to dominate the episode, even when not on screen, and it's great to see the agents (to quote a later episode with similar themes) not knowing which side they're on.
On that level, comedy buffs may be interested to compare this early, "unedited" Chaplin with the later perfectionist who demanded multiple takes.
Stan Laurel later cited her as one of the finest comediennes of the silent screen.
- *in the background Hagrid's hut is burning down but Hagrid and Fang are apparently too fast asleep to notice* - Snape:*walks into the forest* - Harry: *looks at the stars, surprised*  later:  Harry: It's a shame Dumbledore's dead.
Then Goblet of Fire came out a year later, and even more material was cut.
); later, rather than shoot an unwary American sentry, he simply knocks the man unconscious.
However, certain crazy things start happening around the town revolving around the death of a teenager and later a girl's memories of ritual sacrifices taking place in her own home and finally Mulder uncovering the truth from a deserting member of the group.
Branagh (bearded) has a few lines in the beginning, which he delivers with characteristic gusto, and then later on, a guy named Julian Glover shows up.
I might go back again and watch another minute of the movie later, while I'm having a cigarette....or maybe it's time to stop smoking...
Since the original Predator is one of my favourites, I taped Xtro for later reference.
The crooked doctor hired by Silk to recover the bank statements(..and later recruiting the slime-ball to pose as an orderly within the hospital to torment and terrorize Susan for she saw him murder her mother and to find out about where those bank statements are hidden)is Monroe(Martin Beck).
A few days later, Pakistani troops fired on an unarmed crowd, killing women and children.
The problem with this movie, the TV series, and the later episodes of the radio series was that the cast was getting too old.
Many years later, when the cast of the Saturday morning TV series, Saved By the Bell, became too old looking to be high school students, they graduated them and put in different students.
or Borges .The dialog is never funny,being mean,vulgar, pretentious,almost exclusively revolving around sex .Polanski himself appears as he did in "the fearless vampire killers" and later would in the highly superior "Chinatown" and "Le locataire" (the tenant).
Jones would later make some far stronger patriotic propaganda films that managed to be both informative and entertaining (the wonderful 'So Much for So Little' for example) but 'Old Glory' always leaves me yelling "For the love of god, somebody drop an anvil"!
TIDBIT - Campanella and Pankin, who appear in "Hangar 18", also starred in "Earthbound", another movie on the same sci-fi tangent released a year later by Sunn International.
THE X-FILES would later cover the same territory and do it a whole lot better
I guess I should really see it again to confirm that I still feel that way all these years later, but I'm not willing to go through that ordeal.
He then returns a day later only to be surprised that the vampires attacked the monastery the night after he left...  ...avoid this movie.
You start getting into the tale of the what's behind the strange music from the violinist (in The Music of Erich Zann) and then a couple minutes later you're in present day, wait a few minutes & then you're off again to the story revolving around the mathematician (in Dreams in the Witch House).
He's all alone until later a lady appears and says she, too, has no idea how she got there.
But Spock doesn't notice at once that the beam down coordinates the Gideonites gave for Kirk is different from the ones they sent to the Enterprise to beam up a member of the Gideon council later?
I shudder at the thought that Mercedes McCambridge might have filmed a scene not knowing that at some later point her body double would be enjoying an explicit lesbian sex scene with one of the female prisoners.
The later ones are a non-stop series of tasteless sex and raw violence, but this film actually has a remotely decent script and an above-average amount of stylish elements.
I've especially enjoyed Joan Hickson as Miss Marple and was looking forward to seeing one of Agatha Christie's later works having been released in 1961.
At one point Willis and Garner go to a club that specializes in girls who look like famous actresses, an ill-advised idea given that 1988 and later viewers have no idea who the sexy Hollywood personalities of that era actually were.
A young scientist is trying to carry on his dead father's work on limb regeneration.His overbearing mother has convinced him that he murdered his own father and is monitoring his progress for her own evil purposes.A young doctor uses reptilian DNA he extracts from a large creature and when his arm is conveniently ripped off a few minutes later,he injects himself with his formula and grows a new murderous arm...Admittedly the special effects in "Severed Ties" are pretty good and grotesque,but the rest of the film is awful.The severed arm is behaving like a snake and kills few people.Big deal.The acting is mediocre and the climax is silly.3 out of 10.
When I enjoy a new show for a season or two but then find it growing stale or repetitive or degenerating into self-parody, prompting me to stop planning to see it and eventually to turn it off when I happen across it accidentally, that's a show that I will give a vote of 3 and then write a comment explaining that I'm not panning the entire run of the show but only the later seasons.
And yes, for the last half of the film the audience was checking their watches, their cell phones and even sun dials in hopes that their misery would finish sooner than later.
Amanda Blake had contracted AIDS and she later died from the disease 2 years after this film.
If you want to catch the true peak of the series, watch the films made from 1929 through the mid 1930's, and don't bother with later series entries.
this sparked my attention because later in the movie they saw white dragon on a Japanese comic, they were wondering who he was, even though they were informed of him in the first FIVE MINUTES of the movie.
The one thing I didn't understand was why Simon Cable's mother was never shown.There was only a quick mention of her being dead.His father also died but later appeared in visions along with his dead brother and his girlfriend.
Now, that it's 4 years later, Chris has met up with a motley crew who is plotting a bank robbery.
So, what better way to celebrate Halloween years later than to have a internet-camera view of every room during one night when a bunch of teens have sex in nearly every room for paying customers on0line to see (after, you know, conjuring the dead back to life in a wedgie-board set-up)?
When Meaney has one cousin killed and later another the story is played that Leary is torn between the code of silence and family loyalty.
Through zany mishaps he ends up working for her three years later, and the two have not lost their attraction to one another.
3/10 ..Years later we got a second installment .Well just as before I had to see it.Groan..I didn't expect the "sequel" to be any different (but wait what a difference time makes ) low and behold my current favorite TV serial was born.
She also meets Mara (Tracy Pollan), Yaakov's fiancÃ©e, who tells Emily about her (Mara's) sordid past and how Yaakov found her, took her in, and later proposed to her.
From the mind of Swedens best selling author, Jan Guillou comes the tale of young Arn, a nobleman's son brought up in a monastery, and later charged to do penance as a knight in the holy land.
Arn , movie, tells us the tale of Arn, born in 1150, in the north of Europe, in what would later become today's Sweden.
I will come to that later!
and a moment later (as we switch to existential condition #2) "This can't be --another expletive-- happening!"
Ditto for the later scene of Harold destroying O'Brien's office - a scene which is very reminiscent of one in Keaton's 'The Cameraman' of 1928.
It's even more complicated than that, as when he's playing the character in the previous temporal setting, he has to be two characters at once--the character as he was when that temporal setting initially occurred, and the character from the later temporal setting experiencing it again, as a voyeur, while piecing together the puzzle.
When Star Wars: Revelations is showing the nuts and bolts of an exterior universe, it excels apart from one detail I will talk about later.
For me the highlight is Charlie Drake failing to deliver a cake but it's also fun to see Diana Dors sending herself up - as she used to in later life when she lost her slender shape - in fact I just cannot watch this film without getting a very broad grin on my face.
Some 20 years later I saw it on television and the stunts were quite painful to behold.
(When I give a low score for this reason I always comment so that it's clear I'm not slamming the entire run of the show but only the later seasons.)
Twenty years later and still a lousy director, practice doesn't always makes perfect.
All in all, this was a "coming of age" story.In the end, we see the three characters two years later, in the same place in Goa where they spend that last summer of youth together.At this point though,they have come full circle, and have moved on from "boys to men".We feel their maturity come through as they sit their talking,even though non of them say anything profound.
It may well have inspired Free Willy twenty years later!
Little quirks here and there such as: a woman walks in and catches 2 guys stealing a TV, she yells, they drop the TV, she runs, they disappear.... later, the broken TV vanishes too.
Some of the sewer shots, later in the film, look okay -- but, it's not enough of a redeeming quality.
And there was even an officer named "O'Brien" later on in the movie.
One would have known this when reading BACKGROUND TO DANGER a few years later, when they reappeared.
Greenstreet in particular has two nice ones that come to mind: when he notes his favorite set up (a Strauss waltz on a gramophone and a dead body on the floor), and later when his plans have all collapsed, and he is informed he must return to Berlin (his quick look of horror at hearing what will be his death sentence is done very well).
With David Duchovny in an early semi-naked role as the firm, young, stud whom Rogers cavorts and later marries, and Will Patton as a sheriff who encounters the demented Sharon who has followed her faith into the wilderness, the male balance to this film is one of flesh and reason made secondary to literal interpretation of scripture in vacuous gestures of uncritical blind faith without rationale.
The same producers later delivered the "Night Watch" - an evenly questionable, though better shot, piece of film.
The story is unusual and kept me interested until the tasteless twist at the end (more about that later).
But a few scenes later they reappear.
14 years later, I still don't.
Maybe "Grand Slam" deserves credit for inspiring better films, such as "The Italian Job" two years later.
Though to be fair, this is a relatively early piece, and his later works are much more confident in style and content.
It is not clear whether this is meant to pass for wild sex or (as Roth seems to gossip to Chong) just elaborate, get-acquainted foreplay for a later session.
He later joins her for a polite dinner at her place.
Chong drops by Roth's apartment to console her depressed friend, feebly comes on to her, is rebuffed, and is later accosted by the jealous, angry bar punk.
Just like any well-to-do Asian families, (I mean those in Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, Japan....) the old man of the family would send their children to their own overseas company to receive "wilderness training" so that later they can take over the family business.
An all-around vile concoction that might have desecrated our memories of MGM for good, had not "That's Entertainment" (a compilation of MGM's greatest stars and musical numbers that became such an unexpected boxoffice hit that it spawned two sequels) come along 3 years later and put June Allyson and Peter Lawford together again exactly where they belonged--back on the (then-demolished) MGM backlot, singing and dancing up a storm to "The Varsity Drag" finale excerpted from.
I can't go on any more with the script, but the theme of this film was written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David forty years later, What I Did For Love.
And in one scene, two men go driving, only to arrive at their destination two seasons (yes, you read that correctly) later.
Though it had an awful plot, script, setting, etc., it did at least make an effort to be (halfway) serious about showing and developing a few characters, about as much as some of the "Friday the 13th" later sequels made.
Hi all, it's two years later and I want to say that this review is a bit out dated.
I guess my favorite bit is from Trumpy eating the peanuts: KID: These we'll put away for later.
A little kid comes by later and picks up the last un-smashed egg for his animal collection.
Trumpy is cool, especially when he does "magic things" like stand on the ceiling, make Tommy's laundry fly through the air, and turn an old Simon game into a slammin' beat box (Mix Master Trumpy's jams would later be pilfered by Moby, The Beastie Boys, and others).
Mr. McGavin only begins to help later in the film; otherwise, he's bedridden and uninterested.
Were it not for the presence of two men who scored great success later on television, Ed Nelson on Peyton Place and Leonard Nimoy on Star Trek, The Brain Eaters would have no reason to be remembered.
Tom recently had casual sex with a woman (Virginia Madsen) whom he met at Adam Ant's club (it is later revealed that she was a prostitute, but Tom did not know this at the time).
The titular figure is played by Albert Dieudonne â later the incarnation of Napoleon in the directorâs eponymous epic of 1927 â and whoâs fitted here with an exaggerated domed head, which he finally shelters inside a cage!
My favorite there was Terry Farrel (later to play Dax on Star Trek Deep Space Nine) playing the Cat.
Director Chris Columbus, writer/producer John Hughes and most of the cast and production staff reunited two years later for this sequel, Home Alone 2: Lost in New York.
Payton married him when he recovered and then left him seven weeks later for Neal.)
Sort of like The List of Adrian Messenger later on, but without the makeup.
At a small garage, Courtney spots the guy who predictably will later become her love interest.
Horrible actress although for a second I thought it was Priyanka Chopra only 2 seconds later to have my dreams crushed.
Any excuse to stay behind and mingle with the Indians was used to prolong the situation, (*spoiler*) including a slender pregnant woman who wasn't due anytime soon going into labor 3 days later (*spoiler* - NOT!...if you couldn't see this lame plot device coming, you must be living in a cave).
Ten years later Edwards felt he had to direct "Son of the Pink Panther", awful conclusion to the essentially great series of movies.
That sequence with Kevin at the top of the World Trade Center is spectacular and nostalgic, but also painful and depressing to look now because it brings back memories of the tragic date 11th September 2001. Who could possibly imagine back in 1992 that, some years later, such horrible thing would happen?
Now during this sequence they have unnecessary banter, I know this can be common place in manga but if you wish to produce a slick opening, trying to set these characters up as long time enemies who we should feel a connection for (because many reviewers have claimed theirs to be an epic rivalry) only to have them killed two seconds later is madness.
Why do we not see them in the later episodes, when they seem to be of immeasurable tactical value?
Some years later that same criminal is released and he returns to blackmail the family of oddballs, lunatics and murderers.
Oh, yeah, my favorite part is Macaulay (Kevin McAllister) was walking around in New York when he was lost then later, he went to the toy store to buy something then these 2 bad guys found him then Macaulay (Kevin) was screaming same thing then run away from these 2 bad guys in the city of NY but it was so funny because I loved Macaulay's screaming that make me laugh so hard!
Most viewers will be happier with the later Franco Zefferilli version.
There was promise in adding to Lemmon's original 'George' portrayal, but Martin does nothing to improve on the other actors previous comedic timings, and overall portrayal of a neurotic businessman bent on getting every Manhattanite's name down so that he can later sue them for whatever inconvenience he (or his wife) has been subjected to.
That's about all it has going for it, really; the schtick of having a corpse narrate the movie (Which would be done quite a bit better a few years later by Sunset Blvd.)
Yet later, in a crowd scene, he grinds up against a nubile adolescent who turns out to be her daughter.
Williams later did her best to posthumously trash Chandler's reputation in her autobiography by describing him as a cross-dresser!
When you think about George later, you're going to have to think about Gwen, too.
15 minutes later the relationship is assaulted by doubt and drama.
I actually laughed aloud at "Jeffy" when Tom, piloting a fake sea serpent, crushed several boatloads of people, and later (though not the last episode), we get our happiest moment as Tom is finally granted the sweet release of death, and takes half the town with him.
However, in the end I could not get over the fact that the lead character does illegal acts voluntarily and without any regrets later.
An hour and a half later, I was indeed irate at the loss of my three bucks; I could have put better use to the money by plunking twelve quarters into an arcade machine or a stuffed animal crane.
First, when they are on their flight to New York, the pilot says that everyone on board will have to go to Boston (after much time consumed circling over the big city, due to weather conditions), they lose their luggage when they arrive at the Boston airport (and try to find it in a panic, while hurrying to catch a train), they hustle by cab over to one station to board a train, but Gwen has to go to the women's room, but can't find it due to hurrying to make the train (the one they board has no one on but a cleaning lady, and they miss the one they were looking for, which was next to the empty one), then they hustle to another station to get on board one and try to get something to eat on a car with almost no food, they arrive later on at a transit station in New York and discover that all of the transportation services are on strike, so they walk in the rain to their hotel, and Gwen breaks the heel on her shoe while walking before they arrive, only to discover that their room was given away to someone else after the 10 pm deadline, then they walk with a man who helps them find another room (only to rip them off by robbing them at gunpoint, taking George's wallet), then they try to go to the police station to report the guy who scammed them, then go the armory by the police, only to get their route foiled by some liquor store robbers, they get dumped in the park and mugged by a stranger at 4 am while sleeping under a tree (George's watch was taken while he was sleeping), then they find Cracker Jack on a bench for breakfast (that a dog steals almost immediately, which George breaks a tooth on, causing him to whistle on his spoken S's), they get chased by a cop on horseback for an assumed problem with a child in the park, and more funny situations to come.
It's interesting to note how the husband-and-wife relationship shifts constantly as they are confronted by each new setback: at first, George is rather dismissive of his wife, using her primarily to "verify" facts to be later used in the courtroom.
But the director was Lowell Sherman, who was excellent and has been underrated in later decades.
A primal no-no of screen writing is the over-use of time jumps, you know, when there is 1 minute of action then a flash on the screen telling is "two years later" etc.
The big battle at the end was SO BORING people were leaving their seats and returning ten minutes later... they'd probably gone outside for a cigarette.
For instance, the two opening fights during the plot setup are explosive, impactful and a lot of fun, but after that nothing really happens action-wise until 20 minutes later.
It's no more stop-starty or inconsistent than US or European action fare like Transporter or Red Siren, but it seems patchy and messy in comparison to other Hong-Kong adrenaline-rides like Full Contact or Yeoh's later Wing Chun.
A less inspired actor to play the part of Chan could not possibly be imagined, although I should mention that Winters was to improve considerably in his later Chan characterizations.
In addition, the movie was obviously filmed simultaneously in Italian and English with various actors being dubbed later.
Like Abbott and Costello, the studio first used them in this role and only later gave them their own starring films.
Cue three months later and Girl tuns up in Boys life announcing she's pregnant.
Lemmon's shear repetition of wanting to get everyone's phone number and address is hysterical, because through his fatigue in trying to cope with one problem after another in The Big Apple, he still finds the strength to take down everyone's name and number, and promises to retaliate at a later point in time.
Of course, things start going wrong, beginning with the flight to New York, which is first put into a holding pattern because of excessive traffic, then later sent to Boston because of the weather.
Dennis can be more challenging for many viewers (quite a few people, including my wife, found her more annoying during the later portion of the film), but for me, her character worked as a good combination of foil and catalyst for Lemmon, even if she was something like a slightly toned-down Fran Drescher in "The Nanny" (1993).
A Disney-like castle, weapons, machines and armory invented centuries later.
this has got to be one of those films where the trailer is 50 times better than the movie itself.I first saw the trailer in 1991, it looked great.Since then i have always wanted to see it but could never find it.....until today, yes, 14 years later.
Frightened, vulnerable refugees, escaping the political tensions permeating Europe in 1930 (and, we are to assume, the escalating prominence of the Nazi party), come to stay with friends in London; seven years later, having received their British citizenship, the younger sister embarks on a dancing career while the older sister reconnects with her handsome fiancÃ©, now a newspaperman and leader in the political underground.
As a little aside, Little Lech Junior (who we only later learn is Robert Gilder, son of Mary's ex-employer and the man responsible for sending her to prison) treats his Asian servant like something other than human, even referring to him as "yellow peril" at one point.
Maybe its the dubbing, but this story of a Greek hero who is at first the key to taking control of Athens and later to beating the invading the Persians, should have worked.
For example two movie theater clerks poke holes into paper cups and get kinky with the popcorn tubs while two main characters talk about going out to the improv later that night.
By the time I saw it again a year later at the DVD release party, the film already had a dedicated cult following.
At the time of his death in 1992, he was slated to appear in the unhappy CARRY ON COLUMBUS, which opened later the same year.
Twenty years later he's changed his name to Jack Robin (Al Jolson) and is a jazz signer...albeit not successful.
You may thank me later.
To sum it up, whenever you think something interesting is about to happen, it decides to stop and try again later and never pulls through.
Bette doesn't tell him about their kid and later Fonda marries socialite Anita Louise who is later paralyzed from a car crash.
Overall if your a zombie movie fan avoid this and see the Dawn Of The Dead remake or 28 days later, If your a resident evil fan it might be worth a rental I guess if you liked the first one.
Everything feels really rushed, especially the pacing of the shots... one minute a character is fighting off a zombie, only 3 seconds later he's 40 paces down the street... it seems the director really liked the matrix but had no idea what he was doing... the cut scenes in the video game are better directed.
36 years later, better CGI etc.
Now, years later, I rented Phantasm II and really enjoyed it, and having viewed that film I had a better understanding of the original.
The agent, Keanu Reeves, is shown getting close to a surfer gal in order to get 'in' with the surfers; he tells her his parents died (which is a lie--they are still alive, we later find out, in Ohio) to gain sympathy from her, because he has found out thru records that her parents died in an accident when she was a child.
Even with at times bad plots, you still could watch it and not kick yourself in the head later for watching it.
And yet, there was a later episode where the Witches were exposed, and the cleaners were not mentioned once.
And yet, in all later episodes, it said that blinking was a power inherent in all Warlocks.
The later editions just try to explain too much...I always thought it was best to leave it unexplained and mysterious.
The same guy later meets another girl, "bangs" her senseless, then stops seeing her.
This movie continues to be the only movie I have ever walked out on...I watched up to the point where his fly buddy that is up there when he gets killed sits down with the Russians to plan the attack to take place later in the film and then I couldn't take it anymore...I never saw what happens next, nor do I ever care to find out.....
Give them a film they won't look back at later on and have to shame themselves for.
It says something about the acid generation that while PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE was a dismal box office failure in 1959, twenty years later PHANTASM was popular enough to achieve international release, spawn at least four sequels, and launch the career of questionable auteur Don Coscarelli.
If it was trying to be like the later hit "Lost Skeleton of Cadavra", I'd just have to say it failed mostly because it was too modern in some parts.
But then later on, to wit a touching, sentimental moment when he has a heart to heart and then loses his virginity to a prostitute?!?
It was fun for me to watch the original film after seeing the later sequels because the guys are so much younger here.
Further disproving the idea that the game was intended to be open-ended to add depth is the existence of the FFVII Ultimania Omega book, which was released years later and explained most of the things the game left out, making years of theorizing utterly moot.
28 years later, Don Coscarelli is now seen as a master of horror and Angus Scrimm somewhat of a horror icon (though to a lesser degree than, say, Robert Englund).
Avoid like the Rage virus - if you go in to this film, it will feel like you're leaving it 28 days later.
The girls who are testing them and their boyfriends go to the house later that evening to scare them.
For me, this film remains a nice little piece of spooky and original nostalgia, and I'm glad my mom decided to scare the daylights out of me with it at such a young age, because I grew to love this movie later on.
It managed to keep Avco/Embassy in business so they could bring us later horror stuff like ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK (1980); THE FOG (1980) and DEAD AND BURIED (1981) The MGM DVD also has a lot more extras on it than you would expect from other DVDs released by the same company, including 8mm behind-the-scenes footage of the making of PHANTASM; a 1979 interview down in Miami with director Coscarelli and Angus Scrimm; an appearance at a 1989 Fangoria convention by Scrimm, and movie & TV trailers for the film.
There was an attempt at character development, but it was very shallow, especially considering events which occur later on which are not in keeping with what little character development did occur.
This film had some funny lines in it, but for the most part is one of those films you won't remember any of the lines from the next day, and a month later will have you wondering if you saw it or not at the video store.
It was well-written and I liked the cast including Brian Keith and his real-life daughter Daisy Keith (Both father and daughter committed suicide years later).
Then there was a later fight scene where he appeared to not know how to fight at all.
He puts in an antique Iroquois figure in the cupboard, and later in the morning he opens it to find the figure alive as a small Iroquois man.
She goes to the cabin by the lake to get rid of her guilt, not before picking up a hitchhiker that she'll later screw (her parents would be proud) A mixture of bad and TERRIBLE acting, as well as some crappy split screen.
Some incidentals in the theme bring to mind the later "The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean", but that film was much more ambitious and engrossing than this extremely modest underachiever.
Of particular interest; Ms. Hilliard (Harriet Nelson, of course) in a musical comedy performance more reminiscent of later "Lucy" than later "Harriet"; her "Let's Have Another Cigarette" is an ironic highlight.
Probably wouldn't seem so bad if you did not know what they would do later.
That and a later routine with Ted in which the boys perform "The Elevator Dance" (in which Larry stands still while Moe hand pops his mouth and Shemp rubs sandpaper together) which has "no steps to it" are the funniest parts of the movie.
The thugs include Robert Englund, later to surpass himself as Freddie Kruger, the mad killer of the "Friday the Thirteenth" slasher movies, and Jeff Goldblum, ditto, as neurotic scientists.
Twelve years later the mystery is discovered and the upper class family buys their kid back.
A year later, my wish had come true!!!!!
I saw this theatrically on its initial release and hated it; I tried to watch it again a decade later.
I couldn't watch the rest of until I had seen a brain doctor to tell me everything was OK. Well about three months later I decided to try and watch it.
Admittedly, Joanna Kerns does give a spirited performance, and you can see a glimmer of the solid comedic style she developed later.
(this is part of an essay I wrote for my FHSS Sexuality Class on the film)  "Boys Beware", a film produced in 1959 and later shown around many American schools in 1961 has a catastrophically strong anti-Homosexual message attached to it.
The later TV adaptations, coming into being alongside Christopher Awdry's extension of the book series, wandered somewhat further afield from the feel of the originals, but were still recognisably on-model even though I am aware that Wilbert became somewhat frosty towards Britt Allcroft for deviating from his vision.
Firstly, it is ridiculous that they're releasing a movie originally made in 2001, seven years later in 2008 here in India.
I didn`t know this at the time but later finding out it was made sense .
His one puppy-dog like expression seemed endearing in the first fifteen minutes of the movie, but later translated to simply bad acting.
Unfortunately, the audience doesn't get to revel in this too long, because ten minutes later they were sleeping together, and soon after that, acting like an old married couple.
The shocking rape scene was really well done but I didn't like how she treated her boyfriend afterwords since he was helpless to save her.And then to kill herself afterwards was cowardly and not believable.Yes it was traumatic but I have never heard of rape victims taking their own life because of it.What the skinheads did was rotten,but then so was what the group of black men did to her and her boyfriend.And then later the same group of blacks targeted the white girls.I am sure it probably happens a lot also,but they don't seem to be depicted as bad guys which is a total double standard.At that point I was waiting for the skinhead group to get even with them for shooting an innocent kid who was only lured into it because he was mentally challenged.And they were also protecting their female members from being nearly assaulted which any gang would do no matter who they are.
He still loves it 2 years later.
Anyway, no one bought it, and the pilot sunk without a trace, to be revived by "Mystery Science Theater" over 30 years later.
24 hours later a murder happens just as she described.
There's a couple of chuckles but that can be said of practically any Road Runner cartoon (bar the dire later ones).
Maybe they were told that effects shots would be added later.
The latter could make sense because the stabbing of Pantyhose Face happened in 1978 according to the characters in this movie and it was 15 years later.
I later sold it though, it just had no place on my shelf.
Had the film been made thirty years later Pretzies main customers would undoubtedly have been Madonna and Angelina Jolie, however this was not the case, and some poignancy is distracted from Pretzie's plight as a result.
I can see why it was despised in 1970 - it's only value as a cinematic artifact is achieved by it being almost 40 years later now, and how eerily the film predicted the rise of "reality" entertainment.
Terry was later to appear in Of Mice and Men and Full Metal Jacket Â I can only assume his acting had improved on this, his third, film in which he could have single-handedly re-populated the Amazon Rainforest.
Terry Marcel clearly didn't; a year later he was making the British TV series Bergerac Â the directorial equivalent of being sent to the Russian Front.
Mind you, as flashbacks later reveal, the evil Darth Voltan (okay, he's not really called Darth) has already killed the love of Hawk's life, something which almost shocks one-time Felix Leiter (in The Living Daylights) John Terry into changing his expression, before moving on to underline what a bad egg he is by kidnapping guest star Annette Crosbie's Mother Superior, prompting Hawk into action.
Still, on the plus side former pop star and Hammer and Children's' Film Foundation regular composer Harry Robertson (who wrote the superb Hammer Transylvanian Western score for Twins of Evil as Harry Robinson - it really is outstandingly good) turns in a score that's like a demented disco combination of an Ennio Morricone paella Western and Jeff Wayne's War of the Worlds, and the film is nowhere near as soul-destroyingly awful as Marcel and Robertson's subsequent collaboration seven years later, the almost unwatchable-even-at-gunpoint Jane and the Lost City.
Don't watch it, please, I beg you.... you'll thank me later
I'd seen Golden Boy (1939), The Setup (1949), Champion (1949), The Harder They Fall (1956), and much later, Rocky (1976), followed by Raging Bull (1980) Â and all of them only a few years after each was released (except Golden Boy).
Their characters lacked depth and motivation in the later going, and the 96 minutes seemed much longer.
Six weeks later, Carter buys a ship trip to her from Plymouth to New York; however, Sara decides to visit St. Giles by train before returning to her country.
Garfield was known for his politically liberal views, and perhaps this is why he later ended up as an enemy of the Communist witch hunters in Washington.
Years later, the host's daughter returns to her long boarded-up family home to discover someone is killing off the dinner guests, making everyone wonder who will be the next victim."
the melodramatic roots were there from which 'the method' later grew, with performers like Brando, Dean and Poitier portraying the wounded and suffering hero.
The teenagers friends Morrie and Dotty go to the island looking for them but are told by Dr. Myra that there's no one there but later go to the local sheriff for help.
Well, to be precise, they did turn two teen girls into zombies and turned them back to normal about 30 seconds later.
I later found out the movie was suppose to come out in April of 2001.
This movie is the spiritual ancestor of so many later boxing film, including the great 'Raging Bull,' but its story is too by-the-numbers for it to be a true classic, in my opinion.
You'll thank me later.
Anne was partial to the French hood (the curved one) in which she was later seen, and she did a very forward thing with it: she wore no wimple and her hair was so long she could sit on it.
She immediately has a "delayed" orgasm (only that piece of fiction could be written by a clueless male fixated on a fantasy that doesn't exist in real life), after which they suddenly decide they are in love and oh, by the way, it is six months later all of a sudden because it has been established for the sake of the story that he is so neurotic that he can't remain in a relationship longer than, what is it?
A young woman who will be seen later in the movie arrives, and the rope stops.
We later learn why Inga is so mad at her former lover Eric.
Fame would smile on Talbot ten years later when he met and became involved with legendary "Bad Movie" director Edward Wood Jr. and was cast in four of his cinematic classics; "The Adventures of the Tucson Kid" and "Glen and Glenda" in 1953 "Jail Bait" in 1954 and what many consider to be Wood's greatest masterpiece his "Citizen Kane" the superb immortal and unforgettable "Plan Nine from Outer Space".
A action/crime/thriller about a women named "the Bride"(Uma Thurman) who was at one time a part of a group of world class female assassins until the leader of the group "bill"(David Carradine) and the other assassins turn on her.They beat her up so bad she goes into a coma 4 1/2 years later she awakens from the coma and seeks the people who tried to kill her and her unborn child so she can kill them.
Speaking of which, I recall an article in the British film magazine "Empire" comparing the fortunes of Keitel and Robert De Niro over the years: in the same year Keitel appeared in SATURN 3, De Niro reached his pinnacle with RAGING BULL, but a dozen or so years later the tables would be more or less turned...but that's another story.
(SPOILERS AHEAD) Although the movie is presented as a pseudo-documentary, it shows the main character in a later exercise mission in a role as a downed pilot involved in escape and evasion from enemy forces, while trying to signal to friendly pararescue forces.
The narrative shifts to a month later and we are riding in a car with three characters that bear no relation to the news crew.
An infinitely better movie in the same mode is the Spanish zombie movie "REC" that was later remade in America as "Quarantine."
This British production was written, produced & directed by Michael Bartlett & Kevin Gates & is a sort of wretched cross between The Blair Witch Project (1999) & The Night of the Living Dead (1968) with a little 28 Days later... (2002) thrown in there to, what it boils down to is that I didn't like The Zombie Diaries at all.
Although both of the parts end quite abruptly, they are explored further later on.
Don't get me started on the make up and special effects because the average Goth in the street looks scarier than what this director let loose on the world (and that's taking into account the first person camera and the darkness)  In short, I don't really understand why some critics can be so positive about this movie and the current score between 4 and 5 seems about right  other titles I recommend: Diary of the dead, Rec, 28 days later (for the English angle)
Although once they entered a secluded house that's when tension/suspense started to come in but then it just died a couple minutes later.
less dull) later, but then that awfully stupid ending ruins whatever minimal chances this movie had of being even semi-passable.
Though I returned a day later to finish DIARIES, my opinion of the film on my first attempt hadn't changed.
The few who later turned out to be gay probably started their sex lives as bit later, at university.
I introduced my daughters to the movie first and later I read them the book; they didn't notice many differences except possibly the age of Sarah in the beginning.
More on this later.
Ten minutes later... *light goes on over head* - This is a Hollywood remake of 9 Queens.
I'm sure Wayne's tall good looks and smile kept his contract going until he was able to actually do some real acting later in his career so for this I'm grateful(I guess).
When the magician began causing such rampant sin and perversion as his granted freedom gave way to lascivious appetites, those religious townpeople, who haven't succumb to the lusts of the flesh decide to hang him on a wooden cross in the middle of a cornfield, later burning his bones & burying them in a tomb.
There were some parts where I thought were stupid, like giving the ankle bracelets 10 second fuses, allowing someone to pull the pin on an adversary and kill him/her ten seconds later.
Only 5 minutes later does it dawn on him (after his ex asks for his location) that he should find out the co-ordinates for the island i.e.
This clichÃ© is done so badly, we only find much later why he suffers from guilt that drives him to drink.
(1969) and Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines (1965), both of which are set in times only slightly later than Three Men in a Boat and are equally far removed from contemporary audiences, but are still relatively amusing.
Parts of this movie can be very chilling and then a few moments later you want to shout "That's pretty funny".
And Franz manages unwittingly to cut his hand on the coelocanth's teeth and, later, to smoke some plasma-drenched tobacco in his pipe.
Later, the professor scrapes his hand on the teeth of this dead fish and he becomes....well, we really don't see exactly what he becomes until later in the film--but we do know he's mean and looks a bit like Lancelot the Missing Link.
You see, after becoming a monkey-man, he would later turn back to himself--with no memory of his bestial transformation.
Generally thought to be the first official Laurel and Hardy release(although PUTTING PANTS ON PHILLIP is also put in this bracket),the boys don't wear their Bowler hats and have their heads shaved,but are very much a team in this early effort,more so than PPOP where they play against each other rather than for.There's plenty of amusing incident and situations(especially when they attempt to escape the jail as painters);one slight quibble is that as convicts,the characters they have to play here have a very slightly more unpleasing edge than they would be establishing only a few films later in the partnership.Still funny though,and Jimmy Finlayson's double take and fade away is worth a few more laughs as well here;in early publicity material the boys were sometimes billed as 'Hardy and Laurel' in this film;that soon changed.
A few years later, Caidin decided to recycle the basic ideas behind EXOMAN in his early-80s tech thriller MANFAC.
So two minutes later it was mine.
One of the cool things is that toward the end we got to see the making of the tune Somewhere I Belong, which wouldn't be released until 2 years later.
Clearly they were trying for the feel later captured by "The Terminator" - just as clearly, they failed.
Crichton would have much better luck with Jurassic Park twenty years later.
Of course one day and 20,000 dead British soldiers later changed these thoughts , in fact some historians describe the date 1st of July 1916 " The day British idealism died " .
Years later the estranged couple meets again in Lucerne.
However, just a few minutes later, he's moody, unpredictable and a jerk!
However, six years later, she meets up with Olivier while in Switzerland and he tries very hard to win her back despite the past.
(more later)
It's a similar situation with a few of his later works.
I'd recommend House Of Clocks, Touch Of Death or Cat in the Brain for a taste of Fulci's later works.
All women preformed satanic rituals and wild orgies with strangers, who later vanished in a mysterious circumstances.
A few centuries later group of archeologists started to do the research nearby ruins of church.
A few seconds later the "rest of his life" is cut short (with just enough time to say Goodbye again though!)
This just shows how completely irresponsible the PBS was as expressed by Pham Ngoc Bich "Hoang Phu Ngoc Tuong may have been the one to order the killings...now years later he is allowed to explain about what happened in Hue, it's equivalent to Himmler talking about the concentration camps."
I admit initially I thought the movie bore a distinct resemblance to an episode of the original "Outer Limits" (where a high energy physics experiment goes awry and spews out living radioactive material) and might have been inspiration for the later TV show.
2 hours later I walk out very disappointed.
Impossibly handsome, he is credible both in his innocence (early on) and his corruption (later on).
This is still a Classic film made in 1958 and ten years later, Boris Karloff passed away to the Higher Stage in the real Spiritual World.
In fact, when her friend called in and said I think I am on to something, I'll tell you about it later, I laughed out loud.
John Wayne is completely out of place in the role of Temujin (later the Kan) just as he was as a roman centurion in "The Greatest Story Ever Told" 10 years later.
During the opening credits and later during the first battle, John Wayne is seen charging into battle on horseback, waving his sword in the air, and screaming like a Commanche with an expression of shear insanity on his face that had me busting at the seams.
Several of the players survived him including, John Hoyt, William Conrad, Peter Mammokos (who is still living 50 years later), Chuck Roberson (stuntman, no screen role in this film), and the Duke's son Pat Wayne, who still lives.
This film might be why Hughes was a recluse in his later years.
as Mongol chief Temujin, later Genghis Khan, leading his Mongolian army in a battle against the Tartars, falling for the enemy leader's fiery, beautiful daughter.
Produced for RKO by Howard Hughes, who reportedly was obsessed with this movie and later bought sole rights to it, effectively keeping it out of circulations for years.
Filmed partly on-location in Utah near an atomic weapons test site, with many in the cast and crew later succumbing to cancer-related deaths.
Powell would later go on to direct some good war movies over at Fox with Robert Mitchum (The Enemy Below, The Hunters).
Of course there were other problems during shooting (Sue's erratic and irrational affection for Duke) and the cancer cases that occurred later were an unintentional tragedy of this film.
With a sharp story, tremendous irony, brilliantly low key performances, and elegant direction and cinematography, THE LOST LANGUAGE OF CRANES received tremendous acclaim when it debuted in 1992; a decade later it has lost but little of its original punch.
Viewed the remainder later.
The plot changes are ridiculous: Larry drives an ambulance instead of flying a plane; he goes with Gray rather than by himself; Sophie and her husband are married at the beginning rather than later; Larry and Isabel sleep with each other; Sophie's a prostitute instead of a whoreÂ and she falls truly in love with Larry rather than dutifully, as she does in the novelÂthe only way that her leaving him makes sense.
Chuck Norris leads the scariest cast of all times (M Emmet Walsh should be punished to do a film like that - how come he had done Blood Simple later?).
This begins with a good scene that was duplicated in a later (and much better) Ronald Reagan B-movie, SECRET SERVICE OF THE AIR, in which a pilot, smuggling a Chinese family of illegal aliens, dumps them out in mid-air to their deaths when he's attacked by another plane.
Delicious special make-up effects, like that one thing that first appears to be a talking lizard (the equivalent of a rubber sock-puppet) but then later revealed to be a midget in a rubber lizard costume.
But then, not five seconds later, he threw his urine on the guy trying to steal Tee and Baydool makes the goofiest and Tom says "That's my pee!"
Ronnie (Adam Scott, who'd later go on to parts in Step Brothers & the Matador) is a sad sack loser of a guy who works at a halfway house for the mentally disabled.
So much is his fondness that later when he sees her standing in the middle of the street (she had wondered out of the house) he decides to take her back to his mom's place (where he lives, mom's in the hospital after falling out of a taxi) for some nookie.
BTW,I saw that identical move (years later) in another film called "Teenage Strangler", performed by what I could have sworn was the very same actor, and it again made me want to put my eyes out with a hot poker.
And what's utterly frustrating is this: every actor is in fine form; every scene is beautifully shot; and there's enough of a story and plot line present that it seems ludicrous to blame Oliver Stone's script - Oliver Stone, who'd direct Platoon a year later and who had the screenplay for Midnight Express already under his belt.
At first, I thought that I was watching either a dream sequence or a Jayce's exaggerated internal paranoia, where everyone was conspicuously and audibly talking about her and, later, THROWING FOOD AT HER.
So, in one segment a group of characters are talking, and it suddenly jumps to fifteen minutes later in a different room, and they're still talking, and we're left wondering what on earth is going on.
However, there are a few references - characters discuss the film BLOW-UP (1966) which he of course later loosely remade into BLOW OUT (1981) and at one point a female character subtly picks up HITCHCOCK / TRUFFAUT from a bookshelf and begins to read it.
It's not too explicit nowadays, but we're left wondering WHY De Palma had to cram so much unnecessary sex and nudity into his film, because it seems like it's just there for the sake of being controversial - and almost 40 years later it is not controversial anymore, which makes it all the more outdated and pretentious.)
Pearce and Divine are later dropped off in the middle of no where.
By the way, seeing Lochary shooting up is pretty sad, as he later died due to his drug use.
As you see later on in the movie, from her younger sister's home-video's, Jacey, in her hospital bed after giving birth, just can't part with her baby boy.
One of the other actors is Lynne Thigpen who later went on to play the police captain on "Where in the World is Carmen SanDiego?"
Funny, he ran into Zuniga at Sundance about 13 years later and they exchanged pleasantries.
The idea of a monster created by pollution will return later in Go Nagai's (the famous Japanese cartoon/comics artist ) dragosaurus movie, where his robots (eg Mazinger, Getter, Grendizer-Goldrake ) fight a monster born out of oil pollution.
Other spectacular scenes include a pyrotechnic-masterpiece as it attacks an oil refinery, flies over a crowded city spewing acidic mist, and later attempting to drown Godzilla in a pool of mud.
The special effects are also disappointing, the film gets pretty slow later on and the dire music is completely at odds with what's happening on-screen.
There are many mind-boggling scenes: (spoilers ahead) Troy outruns a car on a ten-speed (later to be one-upped by the overweight, out of shape Rosdower nearly outrunning another car ON FOOT!)?
The Nibelungs were not spooky ghouls out of a cave, they were a proud people who were not extinct, but later ruled by Siegfried as their king, as indicated by his title: Siegfried, KING of the NIBELUNGS!!!
But back to "Wonder Man" -- besides some of the positive bits mentioned in other reviews here, what really first struck me subconsciously early in this movie and then I became more consciously aware of as the movie progressed is how much it seems that Jerry Lewis lifted from Danny Kaye the manic, physical bits and persona he (Jerry) later became famous for and identified with in the 1960's.
Vecino's fish is fresh at first, but is later in the freezer, as is the possibility of a relationship between Vecino and the mother.
He later added some voice overs at the insistence of his distributor.
Sound was added later as well as a voice-over dialog as well as occasional "Popeye Speak".
I take it that it found it's audience, as Steckler would later do a second film with Agostino (playing the same role - hey didn't he die in this first picture - only playing it in Las Vegas).
Co-stars Ned Beatty and Christopher Reeve were re-teamed later the same year in Reeve's break-out movie, SUPERMAN.
On top of that, the picture just looks cheap, like a later Bowery Boys movie from Monogram.
The heroine marries the hero and, approximately 10 months later, gives birth.
First of all, the age difference in the cast, while not readily apparent in the show, burns like a lighthouse beacon FORTY YEARS later.
The sequence of meeting Marius in the convent is rather random, as is Marius' later accusation of Valjean being in love with Cosette.

But, his subject never seems to cooperate and instead, enjoys toying with the couple one evening aboard a yacht when a bloodied woman appears to have fallen overboard (film which conveniently goes missing) and then later, during a weekend in the producer's penthouse high rise.
And this business of him being such a major stud, (First he beds down a stewardess he meets, then later while he's working on the airline account, he manages to nail the owner's daughter, played by Sela Ward.)
while i've read the two books in the series and had been looking forward to this film, i forgot i'd seen it later that same day, perhaps i'd blocked it out.
By the way, this film was based on a play and was previously filmed in 1926 and 1930 as well as later with Red Skelton in 1946.
The gangsters soon notice the attractiveness of the young girl (very strangely and making the film even more "suspicious" considered what will happen later in the film, the cover of the old British tape which was banned, says the age of the girl being thirteen while there's not a mention of her age in the film itself!)
Consequently Slice of Life films from the thirties to the late forties usually appeal to me far more than later films.
A few seconds later, he puts the same jacket on without even looking to make sure there are no bugs on it.
We're first jumped into a chaotic scene, that BEGS me to laugh with an Indiana Jones joke and a chain of baby rabbits, when Chicken rings a bell in an Oakland town to warn everyone that the sky is falling in such a panic, later revealed that an acorn fell on him.
Was it telling me not to jump to conclusions, or actually listen to someone say something far fetched, despite of no evidence revealed until later in the film?
When Maggie later approaches Louisa at her home in a run down housing project (isn't that where you'd expect a glory hole worker to live?)
Years later, under the guidance of a typically Japanese master, he himself has become a martial arts master.
The Cobra needed the money at the karate tournament to fund his ongoing germ warfare experiments for sale to terrorists, and ten years later has the disease ready.
While not particularly interesting on its own, Anger's commentary is interesting--especially regarding what happened to this actress later in life.

Mr Delbert Mann is as entitled as the next person to have a pop,much as fellow American Mr Mel Gibson did many years later,but he was taking the p*ss a bit using big name English actors to do it.
Blaine made a big hit on Broadway four years later as Adelaide in Guys and Dolls, so perhaps movies simply didn't do her talent justice.
Marianne Faithful Â who started her career as a singer, and later got involved in film acting Â looks beautiful (just google her name and see how beautiful she was in her young days) and has acted honorably in portraying the character of Maggie to its core.
As a lad in Marceline, Missouri, he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper; later, as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War, he drew figures on the sides of his vehicle.
This is when Mickey Mouse debuted in the cartoon PLANE CRAZY and just a short time later, Mickey scored one of his biggest hits in his second film, STEAMBOAT WILLIE, as it was the first cartoon with a soundtrack (with sound effects and music).
Years later, when the studios released their old film libraries to television, I discovered that, when she was younger, that same Joan Crawford was not only a first-rate actress ("Mildred Pierce") but when she was VERY young, naturally beautiful and vulnerable ("Grand Hotel").
A year later the film hit HBO and I finally watched the damned thing.
In her later years, Joan Crawford was obviously a very disturbed and unforgivably cruel parent to her two children.
With the help of her studio lackey lover Greg Savitt, she adopts a daughter and later a son.
The editing is terrible (people will jump off a wall dressed as a ninja and land dressed regularly, then 4 seconds later be a ninja again, and so on).
I have nothing against age gaps in relationship, although reality has taught me that sooner or later one of you is saggy and baggy and the other gets disillusioned.
Fast-forward to so many years later and she's giving him the last and only thing she can: her best wishes for a good death.
I later discovered that there may well have been a reason for this: one of the producers insisted on a different kind of ending than the original one that both the director and Lancaster wanted.
After Massai shoots at least two of his people, only minutes later, those trying to subdue him just let him walk away--yet he just killed two people!!!!

Numerous attempts at "moments of emotion" later, the guys in the chem-suits are back.
They aren't there yet - Bennett is unspectacular and Brown's shrieks are more annoying than funny; later, he would successfully refine his comic persona.
Then it passed to the stage (kind of a dialog play) and later to a TV-show.
If you like these later episodes, there is a chance that you will enjoy the movie.
Zombies breaking right through windows, then seconds later, being stopped dead in their tracks by another window; zombies jumping at great distances & crawling on the walls and ceilings, but then not being able to reach a few characters peeking through an air duct; zombies' heads exploding because their bodies have caught fire, (WTF???)
We find this out later in the movie.
Think 28 days later (which was not a zombie film people!).
Pass this one up people, it will only give you a headache later.
Mostly its just rabid, insane 28 days later type movements.
I knew it was going to be bad after a zombie scaled a hospital ceiling for no apparent reason other than being some type of crazy generation x zombie...not to mention zombies later on poking air conditioner ducts with crutches and floor sweepers (apparently not blessed with the gravity defying before mentioned wall crawling) in order to get at non zombie flesh crawling to safety.
There's some details I've left out but while there's some interesting developments later in the narrative, especially at the end, it's mostly pretty repetitious concerning the killings though there's also a sexy shower scene with the female roommates and some pretty entertaining guitar licks during the punk band scenes as well as one amusing scene at a bus stop with one derelict constantly bothering other patrons.
Knowing this director later made the cult movie Ms. 45, which I have yet to watch, I approached this movie with some interest but I'd only recommend The Driller Killer if you're interested in anything Mr. Ferrara made and not if you want to watch a slasher flick (though those drill scenes can be fascinating to watch).
I'm a huge fan of most of his films like 'The Addiction', 'Bad Lieutenant' and 'The Funeral'ÂIt's not that I didn't like 'the Driller Killer', I just think that the poor production values really show off and that Ferrara did not yet had the professionalism and talent to make up for it by adding the trademarks that made his later films so brilliant.
The British party turned back for Concord and was later ambushed ;it was only saved by reinforcements sent out from Concord .The total losses in two actions were 73 British killed and 174 wounded,49 Americans killed and 39 wounded.
- and while it feels free to drop in "famous" Shakespearian quotes from other plays at any convenient turn for the amusement of the adult audience, it could have used a few more in the actual plot without turning off the younger set), but it is coherent and even in "smoothing out" the rough edges of one of Shakespeare's most famous tragedies for overly sensitive parents, it preserves the essence of most of Shakespeare's lessons (at least as interpreted these 400 years later).
later.
The plot is about these losers who still live at home, unemployed 40-year-olds who live with their mother and father they meet and they develop a relationship and get married Ferrel and Reilly hate each other and Ferrel does the worst thing in any comedy movie (besides Charlies Angels 2 with hiring those writers(even though writers isn't a word to describe them) he puts his balls on Reilly's drum set (no wonder earlier in this piece of crap he said "Don't touch my drum set") and then they find out they have more in common and they decide to start a new music band (REPLACE THE DRUM SET) and then Ferrels younger brother is in town this guy is a success with a love relationship Ferrel says he's an ###hole and the brother sells their house and they try to get it back by doing the unthinkable like dressing up as Natzi's and putting makeup on Ferrel's face trying to make out he's dead (if only it was real) and later Ferrel's younger brother runs out of people to sell it to and one night they release their first music video see they wanted to be in this band with 2 people the step-brothers and Reilly's father owns a boat and that's where they were filming it while it was in the water with nobody driving it.
Miraculously, it appeared on HBO a few weeks later.
I didn't realize until much later that it had been re-dubbed with "softer" Scots accents for American audiences.
not sure but just a warning so I can let my mind wander without worrying about it)  I watched this when it first came out and recorded it for the heck of it later.
A cop who is nearly killed by a scandal that is outlined in the pilot and as well in later episodes.
It payed off later on, but not this time.
For at its heart, Bill Forsyth's film captures two eternal realities, the (potentially charming) essential uselessness of a certain sort of teenage male, and the particular uselessness of just about all males when confronted by a sufficiently pretty girl (Dee Hepburn, although Clare Grogan, later a pop star, appears in a secondary role).
The Charlie Chaplin we know and love today only began to evolve later in Chaplin's career with Keystone.
However, it is interesting to see Chaplin's crude and early attempts at what he and others (Jackie Chan to name one of our contemporaries) would later perfect Â well timed physical humour.
We later keep hearing about how the couple has "done so much work" on the house, thought we never see ANY evidence of this throughout the movie.
I'm not sure why but a sequel Sorority House Massacre II (1990) turned up a few years later, I've seen it & yes it's an improvement but not by much.
The money shot occurs when the murderer is coming after the sorority girls, falls two stories off a ladder, then is able to spontaneously crash through the window minutes later.
In fact, I went back and watched the movie again a few days later; I could not believe that it really had been as bad as I'd experienced.

Cut to 900 years later.
But most of the time, either eating life things or catching flies, spiders and birds so that he can feed them to each other and later eat them.
MOVIE; Dracula meets and converse with main characters at opera and later at Lucy's house.
The film still has the same effect on me 25 years later.
I later learned that it cost more to pay American accents to dub the voices, than it did to make the original film in Scotland.
Finaly some minutes later (in the movie, in real it should be a moment only) the hero decides to grab a rifle and finishes the bad guys in a few seconds.
Good thing she did "Terms of Endearment" a few years later.
Unfortunately later years has seen a steady decline in the quality of his work with "Million Dollar Hotel" and "Land of Plenty" hitting a terrible low point.
That said however, this is a magnificent statement of young love from start to finish and everyone of any age currently in love (or theoretically), ought to see it, sooner rather than later.
I saw this movie at a film festival when it first came out and, after skipping over it at the local library for the last nine months, finally borrowed it on loan to see what my younger roommate would think of it and to view it again myself, nearly a decade later.
OK, forewarned that the first episode was exceedingly slow, but promised that later episodes grew in depth and gentle village humor, I slogged through for the first five (a fan friend shared the first seven episodes with me in the usually strong theory that immersing oneself in characters one can lose yourself in their world) and skipped to the finale which involved amateur theatricals and somehow seemed emblematic of the whole enterprise.
But now, 19 years later is truly an embarrassing movie for everyone concerned.
Twenty years later, this connects with a group of investors gathering at a spooky old mansion, to collect their share of the Hindi's treasure.
I bought this movie because it had a very beautiful woman who 4 years later land a usage role in a classic TV show.
The film has few redeeming features, but the main one is that it is quite a good laugh to watch with a few mates when drunk, especially at the hilarious musical score and the cheap and nasty production values, (at one point it actually switches from widescreen to normal, then back to widescreen a few minutes later).
Cathy gets knocked over - inside a hospital - by a nuclear blast, stays there for hours afterwards, and doesn't suffer any radiation after-effects in later books?
Until then he should content himself with learning that Paris is the capital of France,Vienna is the capital of Austria.....are you paying attention?I'll be asking questions later.....
They had time to include this garbage, yet skip vital character development later in the film?
The pacing is bad; one minute the bomb is still being constructed, and a few minutes later its already placed in Baltimore and about to explode, with the cliche of Ryan hot on the trail, trying to warn the President.
Jake is intrigued & steals a Samoan tattooing tool on which he cuts his hand later that night, Jake decides to fly to Aukland in New Zealand to find Sina & return the tool he stole but starts to experience strange dreams & visions.
I'll even admit to guiltily enjoying some of his later shockers like BITS & PIECES and the teen oriented SAVAGE LUST.
I mention this because it's odd for them to have done that, as it's clearly established later that the victims DIE after being drained of blood.
But no matter...in no time at all, a diabolical dog is unleashed, as well as one Veidt Smith, a man that we later learn is a sort of non-vampire: apparently immortal, but without the craving for blood that marks your typical vampire, or the restrictions to avoid sunlight under penalty of death.
Then later I was informed that monks take a vow of silence, and these gents certainly don't uphold that vow.
Mr. No Legs tells the tale of crime kingpin & drug lord D'Angelo (Lloyd Bochner) who has the hard as nails Mr. No Legs (Ron Slinker) as his bodyguard & as a gangland 'enforcer' who shoots first & doesn't bother to ask questions later.
Years later, Matt (Razzie winner Ben Affleck) has become a respected criminal attorney/lawyer, but by night he becomes "The Man Without Fear," costumed and masked hero Daredevil.

Fifteen minutes later all of the suspense goes right out the window.
However later that same day when she accidentally runs into someone she believes to be the new handyman, she invites him into her house to make amends to this guy who reminds her so much of her husband somehow.
Also later in the film when a certain character is portrayed as crazy, the whole film turns into a (unintentional) comedy of errs.
And then later when they figure out that what the bomb is, and how it's detonated, they also figure out a very easy way to defuse it.
But suffice it to say that in later scenes with a bomb, they never bother to try this method of defusing it.
Gatanebo also does in one of the ships crew members by decapitating him who, were later told, was the person back in ancient Nigeria in another lifetime who decapitate his doomed lover Kenya!
Gatanebo in a crud effort to go undercover later takes on the identity of Dr. Craig, whom he had the Zombie-like Freddy crush to death with a steamroller.
It also connects him to the brutal murder of the crew member who's severed head was later found in Sylvia's bedroom.
Most old B-movie buffs know Mantan Moreland as the sidekick for Charlie Chan in the later Monogram Pictures Chan films.
Yet, oddly, later the Count realizes he actually loves Laye and wants to marry her, not just lay Laye.

Then, a few minutes later, the kitties turned into shrapnel, poom!
The dog is then buried, a little later, freaky police officer turned into freakier police officer after being bit by a zombie dog... ooh... ah... scary... Not!

Susan is its one distinguishing factor: giving another in her repertoire of aggressive-yet-vulnerable characters, she's reason enough to take a look but you probably won't remember the flick a day or so later.
Use it to give us a real insight into the relationship of the characters, thus creating a more interesting level to any involvement later on.
An Airplane type comedy would use this moment to do constant sight gags, or create a fake sense of pain increasing any sort of visual of audible humor later on.
Younger tries to show Wheeler how to shoot correctly; Wheeler promptly shoots off a man's hat!Later,at a blacksmith's,Younger creates a device for Wheeler's gun allowing him to shoot straight - with unexpected catastrophic results,later.
They weren't anything noteworthy, but she certainly showed what she had and a year later, she would have been forced to cover up.
Granted, GSN appears to have learned a little bit from its early mistakes and the later episodes have guests with broader appeal and somewhat toned-down, sophomoric sexual commentary.
After being defeated in a fistfight, he tells the boy who narrates the whole story to study hard, walks away and gets shot ten days later off screen.
If my movie would have been slightly better, it would have been a bigger classic than "Village of the Damned", which has a similar theme and got released two years later.
"Spaceballs" was made ten years later then it should have been.
I remember in 1997 when it came out I didn't watch it now ten years later I disgusted with the movie.
Anyway, it is revealed later in the movie the dead students worship evil demons that in return give them eternal life.
The killings are also confusing Â sometimes a person killed is seen again later in the movie without explanation as to whether the killing was real or imagined.
Why shape their characters up if you're going to ruin it so completely later on?
Alex, whom we later learn is a sailor who jumped ship, because of some trouble he is already in back in the states, hunts up Felix.
Years later at the "State Hospital For the Mentally Insane," Calvin suffers from 'Nam flashbacks, escapes through the air shafts and kills a friendly hunter who picks him up hitchhiking.

thirty years later, his old friend Dr. Lanyon is revealed to have falsified Jekyll's notes in a scheme to drive the Son of Dr. Jekyll mad, so Lanyon can steal the Jekyll estate...to replace his own fortune lost defending Jekyll Sr.  Aside from the moral backflips Lanyon has to perform to go from valiant friend to chiseler and murderer, the movie never comes clean about who Mr. Hyde was.
While it is a decent enough idea for a movie, the killer's true identity is given away so early that there are few dramatic or tense moments later on.
Idea: this movie presents the story of a soon to be married couple during the days of the revolution and, also the story of a journalist who 15 years later comes in search of their baby....born in those dreadful days.
1st of all...the sailor returns from seas...goes to Timisoara to marry...get's drunk all the way there....get's drunk there...goes with his bride at the hospital...get's shot by the Communist forces...believed dead is transported to a crematory...lies like stupid and burns alive...STUPID (also very idiotic part where he dreams everything is OK and then we see him burning 5 min later ) bride and her friend - bride is very very stupid as her friends are...their roles r very poorly written and acted Comunist forces and patriotic people - OMG... they have like 300 men and they switch them around...no real drama... 1 other thing...where did they get the cat and the dog in the movie?
those have to be like the ugliest animals i have ever seen...if this is how the director sees this country then he should stop directing  btw...at the end of the movie ..the baby is born..is a boy.......We never find out why his mother abandons him...but 15 years later he's an "aurolac"...actually the leader of them..and in the end he get's trapped in the underground sewage(and will eventually die...i presume :D )  so....whatever u do...don't waste u'r time watching this piece of crap...  2/10 (it actually deserved 1...but i support the Romanian cinema :)
But some days later I saw another episode and another, and soon found out that the first one was not satiric - their serious with this terribly unrealistic drama stuff!!!
I grew up missing later seasons after Mary went to Buffalo to be with her grandparents.
Mary, the second oldest, a basketball star in high school, but goes onto "evil deeds" later on, the rebel of the family.
And in later seasons, Ruthie got some kind of a boyfriend at a young age, and she said she would die without him, it was just ridiculous.
A doll later on is supposedly a likeness of her, but isn't by a longshot.
Suddenly, the plot creakily shifts and we never see the newsroom, or the sandwich boy for that matter (hell, thought he might show up as a witness or something later on, I mean, this was supposed to be a noir, right?)
But she is appalled that he is unwilling to push for promotions she thinks he deserves (at one point later on, Raymond Burr will make the point that Hayden really did not merit the promotions - and pays for saying so).
Only sixty years later, scientists discover this actually wasn't a meteorite, but a Venus spaceship of which the crew didn't really practice their landing skills.
Set in 1970 (later 1985), "a strange, extraterrestrial spool is discovered at the site of the 1906 mystery explosion in Tunguska, Siberia.
There's a bunch of extremely unexciting actor wannabes with the average age of somewhere around 55, who in real life would probably have hard times climbing the stairs to second floor, let alone flee from the living slime which at one point is supposed to be so sticky that the slightest drop glues the female to the floor, and which a minute later pours over the protagonists like a sea of mud (which it is) with no visible effect.
While an excellent example of the continuing development of the persona of Lee Marvin, and containing one of last performances of Bonar Colleano, who would be killed in an auto accident a few years later, it is really a vehicle for several Hollywood character actors whose faces but not names come readily to mind (Arthur Franz, Richard Kiley (pre LaMancha), Barney Phillips and James Griffith).
But don't worry - later on it is revealed that Australian Aborigines are the ultimate sages of Planet Earth.
McRae himself did a splendid job two years later in "Ride the High Country", under a far better director, and Gary Cooper was just about right in "High Noon."
So I decided to give it another go some almost 20 years later... and its still one of the most disturbing animations I've ever seen (and I've seen quite a few!).
I was drawn to this film by the inclusion of actor Bruce Campbell ("The Evil Dead"), who has a pretty pointless part until much later in the film.
Thanks to this success, three years later McKee was offered a bigger project by United Artists, a horror film named "The Woods".
Brian Epstein, their manager and mentor, was dead, and this film - their first movie project without Epstein's guiding hand or Richard Lester behind the camera - was thrashed mercilessly by the critics, and this clearly still rankles with Paul McCartney decades later.
At first, you don't understand why Mr. Turner can't pick up his daughter and later, it kind of filters in that he is a very busy man.

In a later scene, Lilli sees her dying father.

Ten years later, J.D.
(9) A violent child snatcher is released only because the movie needs him to snatch the child a second time later in the movie.
I saw none of this: did any of it manifest in later shows?
Conversely, the later film is a more compact affair with not only less characters (7 in all) but a much shorter running time at only 74 minutes.
They have been largely superseded by "made for TV" films created inexpensively on electronic media by production companies without major studio resources, and only in exceptional cases later transferred to traditional film for showing in theatres.
The same sequence reappears twice later, first as the source of still photographs (the existence of which had been indicated by instantaneously superimposing rectangular frame lines on the screen during this introductory sequence), and as a videotape.
These two later scenes would have needed little or no change had the long and totally unnecessary introductory sequence not been included, and the film would then have opened logically by introducing its principal characters.
McGuire (in the type of role that Arkin might have later played) is quietly understated as the injured father whose inability to work has caused the family financial hardship.
This week I bought the movie, to see how it would affect me 30 years later.
Even later, as the "Team" is assembled it is played very lightly, a lot of gags based on the wartime London Gay scene.
The paper-thin story has Detective Bullitt trying to determine how a Mob informant in Police custody managed to be killed (he's not actually killed until about an hour later though).
On a side note, Fred Dekker took a similar approach with 'Night of The Creeps' released a couple of years later.
Bookwalter is still at it today, nearly twenty years later, and is just as talent deprived (ie- Ozone) as he was when this piece of trash first came out.
85 minutes long and it feels like three hours; the acting is truly awful Scott Spiegel turns up in a small role, ruins the scene and then years later directed From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money, easily one of the worst movies ever made.
Decades later when she was interviewed she admitted that she deliberately ignored the boys in her classes so she could concentrate on teaching the girls.
So many of the teachers in this era in The Bronx must have been like this but never so celebrated so that their confessions years later were not recorded as was Kaufman's.
However, almost forty years later, it just looks incredibly dated and stupid BUT unintentionally funny as well!
This film is audacious and dares to create a horror film in which an aborted child comes back to literally haunt the lady who aborted it several years later.
The film just goes way overboard and is, at times, rather sick and nasty--more about this later.
I took a look on the actor, Darrel Hicks, who played the son and found he'd also later done work on Queer As Folks.
You might be surprised when I point out that Carter never fought Griffith for a world championship in 1963 though he did fight for the middlewight championship a year later against champion Joey Giardello who beat him on points with plenty to spare .
Jayna of the Wonder Twins would repeat this finale on the Superfriends years later with ending each episode with 'Looks Like Gleep.'
Now, over thirty years later, Jackie Earle Haley is nominated for an Oscar, against Eddie Murphy for Dreamgirls.
More than thirty years later, while moving an old filing cabinet, Rock discovered some business documents which enabled him to prove that 'Krakatoa' was his film ... and to claim his Oscar several decades late.
Only decades later did I realize that the movie touched on a very personal sadness in my life that as a teenage boy I couldn't begin to grapple with.
This movie had the ability to allow me to feel what I was unable to as a child and only years later would I be able to understand the reason for the overwhelming sadness I felt then.
As for the fight scenes - it's as if someone associated with this movie watched the action sequences from "Mannix" and "Star Trek" and took notes...but they then lost their notes and tried to reproduce every thing from memory five years later.
The "action" scenes are mostly laughable, Dolph is tossed from a gantry and lands some 15 feet below only to recover later.
Several savage beatings later at the hands of our hero, the bruised miscreants run off to lick their wounds and resolve to team up with a Japanese crime organisation which is headed by a rather rotund looking fellow who has a disturbing propensity for beating up his own sister!
The editor later added sound effects and speeded up the film to give the illusion of extremely fast fighting.
And why is it that later in the film she's able to take down the same group of thugs without breaking a sweat?
They later become bodyguards to William Chung, the wise and fatherly leader of the "good" mafia of Shanghai, by a mere stroke of luck, as I said.
Walter Pidgeon gives a classic performance, both strong and vulnerable, for which he will become better known in later films, and Ruth Hussey, usually in a secondary role, puts in a sensitive and generous performance as the "skipper's" stalwart wife in a part that could have been given to Myrna Loy.
A short time later, Spock is hit by this flying barf and he is infected!
To which I would reply: if she felt, reading the novel, that the squire was just the kind of man who would have done that sort of thing, white European male pig that he was, and that Austen (owing to her famous ignorance of human nature, which causes her books to continue to be read two centuries later) was too much of a booby to see it, whereas the adapter's own superior sensibility makes all things manifest, she might at least have done Fanny the justice of having her react to the discovery as she would have, given her character.
I've often joked in the past about some people's boundless (my words) affection for the later incarnations of The Dead End Kids but, actually, this and GHOST ON THE LOOSE (1943) are my first encounters with them.
But, this is minor compared to some serious lapses in logic later in the episode.
He calls her the BEST co-pilot he's EVER had, and a heartbeat later, he's giving her cyanide, and ordering her OUT of the cockpit!
He (Boothe) engages in fisticuffs with another crew member, and later, THAT crew member ejects himself from the aircraft!
But what is a song that was made popular in a film doing in another film made 50 years later?
I never saw the film until years later.
That may sound homophobic, but it isn't, and it will later be elaborated on.
It is painfully long, and the only reason I kept watching is because I was waiting for this guy to die, but after legitimately being killed off 5 times: he's poisoned (all of his men die from this poison may I add) yet somehow he has enough energy to walk back through the desert (dehydration), fly a plane, which is later shot down and crashes (miraculously he doesn't get shot/survives the crash), then somehow through all that carries his wife through the desert to safety (she was dying of dehydration/maybe a gunshot at this point) and when she is safe he finally dies, but by then the movie was basically over.
And its nice that Willow gets an episode, but she'll get far better ones than "I Robot...You Jane" in later seasons.
Then we see him making his move towards the victim and them the movie switches to a different scene and then later on in the movie like when we see the killer watching TV or drinking a beer or scratching his rabbit which is his only friend we see flashbacks of what happened between the killer and the unfortunate victim which we should have seen while he was killing the victim.
The only highlights are early appearances from later stars Tanya Roberts and Nancy Allen (who plays an ill-fated hitchhiker) however they can't save a movie that's not only garbage but boring garbage!

Many top-flight actors made guest appearances, and Paul Burke, the star of the show and who later appeared in Dynasty, was great.
His knife-edge existence teeters even closer to the edge when Arab terrorist Malak Al Rahim (Gene Simmons) starts blowing up buildings and people in downtown L.A. First 140 people are slaughtered in a cinema bombing; later Rahim proposes to destroy a chemical plant, wiping out some 30,000 innocent lives in the process!
In a movie like Die Hard, which came a year later, the cat-and-mouse psychology played out between hero and villain gives the story a sense of focus and creates real tension.
The book is later revealed to contain everything on how to get to the gold, and even a map!
Then, later, Jody and Beth receive a pack of gold from a lawyer "whose client wishes to remain anonymous".
I saw Predator later, and very much regard it as a good movie, in that it told a well thought-out story, had excellent characters, and an original plot, not to mention a great villain.

It can be compared to the later Jaws movies where you saw too much of the shark.

Jack Black was passable, although perhaps he got better later in the movie.
Gunfight at the end of A Better Tomorrow is less high body count and refined than in later John Woo films.
So, I was still a big fan when this film came out (I was even still a big fan a year later), and remember watching it over and over for a while.
Now, believe me, if I didn't see it then, I would NOT have bothered watching it ten years later, but because of the wonderful memories, I decided to do so.
Trivia: In the closing credits Rod Stewart sings a beautiful version of `That's what friends are for' that would later be made popular by Dionne Warwick..  
He wakes 20 years later (retaining his 14-year-old mentality, which explains why he is now Jamie Kennedy) and reunites his break dancing team from the old days - Miguel A. NÃºÃ±ez Jr., Bobby Lee and Aris Alvarado, losers all, who can't dance any more, let alone act.
When he finally returns to consciousness two decades later, he discovers, much to his dismay, that the world has moved on without him, and that everything that was once important and familiar to him - from the fashions to the technology to the music - is now hopelessly "un-cool" and out-of-date.
When the letter and the ring are miraculously discovered forty years later, one would expect that the revelation would clear up the mystery and end the long-standing feud between two Italian families.

Now, four movies later, many of his fans are wondering when he will reveal a movie as amazing as The Sixth Sense.
While Rogers imitations were funny and helped in his brief appearance in STALAG 17 a decade later, here he just seemed like someone's obnoxious child mugging at the camera and doing some terrible impersonations.
From Taj Mahal's incredibly earthy, a cappella rendition of "John the Revelator" (later given a full-chorus reprise in what, for me, was the zenith of the movie) to the outrageously over-the-top closing "battle of the bands" encore, the music IS the Mississippi, from new Orleans thru Memphis to St. Louis and thence to Chicago (culturally, even if not geographically, a child of "The Father of Waters").
For example, Ahmet has trouble wielding a Viking broadsword but once he has a curved scimitar made to order he is ready to rock (of course, later, when the band sorties on a mission to attack the cannibals, Ahmet has a Viking broadsword tied to his back and the scimitar is nowhere in sight).
It just means they have to attack again later, after the village has time to recover a bit.
"Stars" Sybil Danning and John Carradine are in the film for about 5 minutes each, and Cameron Mitchell has the good sense to not show up until about 50 minutes in and then gets killed about 15 minutes later.
It all appears to be part of an experiment involving Stefan (Andrew Byron - utterly awful, in case I don't get to him later in the review) and Joseph (Nick Simons).
Although later in the movie, the tables turn and the parents are shown to blame -- which was a nice turn(with a good scene with the judge helping the parents understand where they were going wrong), but it comes too late in the movie(about Â¾ of the way thru).
i was dragged out of my bed for this film and frog marched down to the local cinema where i paid my money and i intended to enjoy a film, which i was convinced would be in the style of Bowling for Columbine ... 3 hours later after i had sat through the same point being rehashed and retold to me by various people i ran outside with a splitting headache i had such high hopes for this film, the film had its heart in the right place but the director obviously didn't cut his film enough.
Acting in this one isn't as bad as in some of the other later titles.
Freedom Deep takes place mostly in two time periods, between which it alternates: 1998-ish and 2018, with a little bit of "much later" as well.
The film has few redeeming features, but the main one is that it is quite a good laugh to watch with a few mates when drunk, especially at the hilarious musical score and the cheap and nasty production values, (at one point it actually switches from widescreen to normal, then back to widescreen a few minutes later).
Sadly it does not play out well and I will explain later.
It doesn't take a rocket scientist to discover that there's going to be a later scene, where Susan Sarandon walks in as the video is playing on a TV screen.
William Scott plays some guy that was abused by this teacher and, later on, writes a book about letting go of the past.
I'm wondering if he really directed it, but knew later that it would be such a horrible stinker that he took his name off of it.
Give it a pass, unless you watch it just to have fun trashing it later.
The cars in these shots are largely Ford-Model-A-block / any-odd-freer-breathing-head, rear-drive, backyard/filling-station bombs on Ford rails rather than anything from Harry Miller's shop in nearby Vernon, though there might be an early Miller 200, 220 or 255 (the basis of the famed Leo-Goosen-designed, "Offy" 255/270 built by Offenhauser & Brisko and, later, Meyer & Drake).
Seeing it again a few years later, it didn't feel the same but the movie is still good light entertainment.

Ultimately the morality of this film portrays the Americans not only as 'shoot first, ask questions later' types but also as plain bloodthirsty.
Jessica Lange comes closest, as Big Edie, to a convincing portrayal, since she builds her character from the inside out and doesn't depend on impersonation, but still falls short because she holds back (as has always been her habit as an actress), especially in the later scenes.
She investigates a magician who performs gory tricks in his show, with the same girls he performed his tricks on later dieing accordingly.
This repeats itself no less than four times (if I counted correctly), each scene lasting maybe ten minutes and being as linear as train tracks in a desert, until her boyfriend muses: "All those girls who went on stage in the show died in the same manner later in the evening.
Oddly, hours later, they collapse--dead with injuries sustained from the tricks--as the injuries re-appear.
She wants to book the magician on her show and later he wants to investigate him because all of his stage volunteers keep coming up dead hours later.
Malik who saw what was happening sneaks downstairs and takes off with the 10 million in stolen cash but later stupidly hides the money in the fire place having the millions, and the only reason that Beckett & Co. kept his parents alive, go up in smoke.The movie gets really nuts when Rodney's friend and local lawyer Pendelton, Hal Lindan, pops in to check if every things all right.
20 years later, the special effects are even worse, truly terrible.
this was categorized as a scary movie..........to a 10 yr old he may pee his pants but i don't think it should for the later,this i would say because the ghosts in the movie(a Totally GRUDGE MOVIE RIP-OFF)are shown a lot of times in daytime.......that totally ruins it.....we can clearly see the white powder on the ghosts..............and lot of the movie is 'The Shining' 's RIP-Off.........i don't remember whats scenes are but some like when the kid rides the3 wheeler bicycle and the camera follows him like the same way in the shining......and the background music too was playing same.....DAMN!!!

The screenwriters should had based their story more on "Falcons of France," written by Charles Nordoff and James Norman Hall (famous later for writing Mutiny on the Bounty), about their experiences training and then flying for the French in the famous Lafayette Escadrille.
Malcolm McDowell also gives a magnetic performance as the older version of Paul Bettany's character many years later.
Those came in later in the war and not used in such large numbers, and why so many were made to look like the most infamous one of all was just bad taste.

Mr. Darren does the title song nicely (later on); and, the soundtrack often sounds like the melody to "Tammy" is about to begin.

Coincidentally 4 years later Manmohan Desai made Naseeb, another one of my favourite movies.

A creepy crucifixion painting depicting one's suffering leads us into Strobe and Bleum's first meeting..and, for a reason you'll find later, is as important to this tale as the fisherman painting.
There were later episodes that also had great suspense, and terror that modern gore films can only fantasize about producing.
Rod Serling, creator of "The Twilight Zone", hosts this anthology TV movie that later spawned the TV series of the same name.
Part 1: An obnoxious southern man (superbly played by Roddy McDowall) kills his uncle (George Macready) for his fortune and is later haunted by a painting of the family cemetery.
Director of photography John Russell (later to film Psycho) helps Auer out with some crafty touches (a telephone dial glowing from a flashlight shone upon it comes to mind).
That's it for the threadbare plot -- and said skimpy story is related by cinematic blunder wonder triple threat would-be producer/ director/writer auteur Leonard Kitman (who also puked forth "The Curse of the Headless Horseman" and later did a few scuzzy porno movies under the alias Leon Gucci) with a staggering all-out incompetence that's genuinely breathtaking to behold.

A couple of years later I ran into Desert Moon and was again bowled over (it took me a moment to realise it was the same director).
Despite its baffling ultra-rarity, the film is peopled by an interesting pool of talent both in front and behind the camera: Lancaster is in his third adventure flick; Gilbert Roland is his usual laid-back, womanizing Latino self; John Dehner the proverbial rotten apple in the group; George Tobias (perhaps thankfully) sacrifices himself early on; Nick Dennis and Mike Mazurki are among the rowdiest of the 'Ten'; Gerald Mohr adequately provides the required villainy; this was the second product from Norma Productions (which first partnered Lancaster with producer Harold Hecht); writer Roland Kibbee would much later go on to share directorial credit with Lancaster on THE MIDNIGHT MAN (1974; which I will be revisiting presently); associate producer Robert Aldrich would later direct Lancaster in four movies Â including TWILIGHT'S LAST GLEAMING (1977; which I'll be viewing for the first time during this ongoing Burt Lancaster tribute); and, most interestingly perhaps, this was multi-talented Willis Goldbeck's most notable directorial effort but, at least two of his screen writing credits are highly impressive indeed: Tod Browning's FREAKS (1932) and John Ford's THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE (1962; Goldbeck's last film work)!
I'm guessing that this whole scene was shot in a studio somewhere (on completely solid ground) and stock footage of an island with a big rumbling mountain was stuck on later.

A few years later I found it on video and still really enjoyed it, especially the lurid vid cover.
"Three Strangers" if anything goes "Casablanca" and that other Huston/Lorre/Greenstreet classic, "The Maltese Falcon," one better in the world-weariness department, with moral ambiguities and ambivalent characters straight out of films noir made five years later.
She's aided by some very form-fitting Milo Anderson gowns, one of which, a pleated satin negligee, was recycled in black for Patricia Neal in THE FOUNTAINHEAD a few years later.

I remember that today, forty years later!
The Characters are totally believable, The surfing sequences are only now being surpassed, twenty years later.
He wears an Army uniform when in real life he didn't join until later.
Romance Sentimentale is grouped as avent-guarde with L'Age D'or (Which is still pretty disturbing nearly a century later) and Blood of the Poet but this is really avent-guadre poetry, a move from Dadaism and it's desire to shock into surrealism and a more introverted internal viewpoint.
In fact, the use of Rodin's pieces with fire-works is down right epic and I would hedge a fare money-sum was the inspiration behind some of the images in Disney's later "Fantasia," especially the animation with Mickey Mouse.

Years later, Prince Syrius of the Water and Princess Malta of the Fire meet and fall in love, and they meet in secret.

BTW: Reggie says he was in prison for 7 years which gets explained later.
One unintentional laugh I got was watching a bus roll over a dozen times at 50 miles an hour with Murphy in it but later seeing him walk away without a scratch.
"Double Shock" also withholds important information during the murder sceneÂin order to surprise us later.
The main character was supposedly born around 1936, and the cars in the later scenes were early 1980s models, so the Duvall character would then have been about 46.

They try anyhow and crash land a bit later, at a rather extreme "flying circus" just as some of them actually were at the time, with flyer's who lived passed their expected time and definitely are ready to die for the glory...  Before they landed, did the spot a HUGE air ship in a cloud and that valuable information, plus the fact that they happen to shoot down a very impressive Gotha Bomber (forgot that part) just before they saw the girls...
Vidor redeemed himself later in his career with the thoughtful Japanese War Bride, but this is a depressing lowpoint in his ouevre.

Or I love the fact that these people come back to the team later on in the movie and yet again, didn't have to deal with the dozens zombies they had to walk through to get back to their team (which you hear hitting the door when thye close it).
When 28 days later came out along with its favorable reviews, I though that it was going to be better than Resident Evil but after watching it, 28 days later came out to be nowhere near as good as Resident evil.
Her performance here reminds me a bit of the character she played in "The fifth element" and also the character in the later "Ultraviolet" The other actors did a good job as well so she's not the only one to get credit although the movie revolves around her character.
We as an audience however know something is amiss having witnessed a coffin earlier floating ashore following the flute-playing of a most unusual looking black man who we later see arrive at the castle-like house in which the hippies seem to be squatting now acting as something of a servant/follower to Khorda.
A lot of the later vampire visuals though remind one more of the 60s Italian Horror films and the British Hammer films.
LaSesne Hilton (in his only film role) has a very striking face as the vampire's familiar, prominent character actor John Fiedler is engaging as the unlikely source of assistance for would-be hero Pico (Bill Ewing), and sexy Betty Anne Rees, playing Esslin here, would turn up two years later as Quarry's girlfriend in "Sugar Hill".
Doriana Grey, filmed 3 years later and again featuring the ravishing Lina Romay playing lead, basically recycles the same story but doesn't make any compromises.

Finally in the middle of a completely unnecessary dream sequence that explains the brother's disappearance (something that's explained later in dialog, in a much more succinct and interesting fashion), brother guy returns and drags physician boy off to the middle of the woods to some farmhouse populated by weird people, and they go around busting stuff up and threatening the people's lives and yelling at each other and what the heck is going on?
Or that he later hammers a hole in his forehead before tearing off his face and growing a third eye?

The crew abandon ship and later some of them re-board her and take her back home.
In the early stages Oscar revels in playing the humiliated one, later the tables turn and finally turn again.
His world, in which he would submit to the presence of Mimi purely to feed a curiosity and because he was able to, but would later find himself on the other foot when she submits to him; his world, in which ego driven positions of power were exploited and the phrase 'what goes around, comes around' didn't exist Â not least, until now.
After meeting Mimi in the ship's bar, Nigel becomes entranced by her and later meets her husband and proceeds to learn his and wife's story...and it's not exactly pretty.
Dick Powell's character "James Lee Bartlow" was said to be inspired by legendary southern writer Â F. Scott Fitzgerald and University of Virginia graduate & later UV instructor -- William Faulkner.
Compare it, if you feel like it, to "On the Waterfront", for an example of what I mean, released two years later.
In a manner similar to the way he portrayed Ziegfeld in William Wyler's later "Funny Girl", Walter Pigeon plays production executive Harry Pebbel with stentorian fervor.
The best, however, has to be when Georgia finds a tawdry starlet (played acerbically by Elaine Stewart, who much later became a game show hostess) descending the stairs at Shields' mansion at which point she flees and drives with Hollywood-style abandon in her car.
There were another set of super berserker warriors and two or three more Thundercats introduced in later episodes, but I do not ever recall seeing them as toys.
I saw very many, much was pleasant to me were a favorite "Ninza Turtles", and from "ThunderCats" I then saw only one episode (about huge spiders), but they have sunk down to me in soul and later 20 years they (ThunderCats) is my favorite cartoon serial from serious (and from comic - "The Pink Panther") and I now try to extract a full serial on disks in the original (without a translation into Russian).
When I was growing up in the 60's I used to go matinÃ©es and watch Hercules and even the later TV series with Kevin Sorbo as Hercules.I read that Hercules is the son of Zeus and as the years passed into my later 40's I finally grew to accept there is only one God.The one who counts and God made it clear in His 1st Commandment Thou Shalt Not Have No Other gods Before Me.Zeus is a (false god) I used to think the Hercules films and TV show and even the cartoon were great,But after God wrote His Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai which I call The Capitol Of God's World was all I needed to know God is the only God,all other gods and goddesses are false and they go against God's 1st Commandment.So it was written by My Father.
However, being advertised as a "horror" film, it fails to provide enough ample shocks to please in that department and it lacks some of the chills and humorous touches of Castle's later work.
It's a shame that later on in the movie the movie falls into some obvious and dramatic cliche's.
(OK, sorry I haven't reviewed any movie for a really long time at IMDb--not since "Holes" last Independence season--but, here goes...)  In 2004, audiences were enchanted by one of the best animated sequels of all time, "Shrek 2", and later were wowed by the action-packed power of the superhero family, "The Incredibles"--and both were made in CGI.
The later half of the film focuses on the romance between Giorgio Bassani and Micol Finzi-Contini.
*****SPOILER ALERT*****  While DeSica somewhat abandoned his neo-realism approach later in his career this does have an aura of those wonderful films like "The Bicycle Thief" and "Umberto D".
The Jews in town react in various ways: Giorgio, who is in love with the daughter of the Finzi-Continis, is enraged; his father his philosophical; Giorgio's brother is upset only after being sent to France to study, and later, finding out to his horror about the German concentration camps.
The film of the eruption and the later destruction are impressive and gut-wrenching.
Ultimately this eruption cost fifty nine lives, but two of these in particular provided the media with ongoing human interest stories and later provided the core story for this movie.
Tho his Western output was very hit and miss {the brilliant Peckinpah film Ride The High Country was to come 4 years later} McCrea was always value for money in even the tardiest of Oater's.
Not to be confused with Paul Naschy's even worse "Dracula Vs. Frankenstein" from 1969 or a later Jess Franco film.
Yeah, the budgets were tiny, the productions were unpolished, and the stories were ridiculous; nonetheless, all involved took the films very seriously, and produced something that is still being enjoyed 35 years later.
He decided to shoot framing scenes adding the whole Dracula-Frankenstein angle later on, and the whole package goes as follows...  Mad Dr. Frankenstein (J. Carroll Naish) is busy at work reconstructing dead bodies while retarded manservant Groton (Lon Chaney, Jr.) spends most of the time whimpering and petting a puppy.
Dracula verses Frankenstein is one of those so bad its good movies, a drive in movie.with a great cast;Lon Chaney Jr as a puppy loving murderer,j Carroll Nash as Dr Frankenstein.and Regina Carroll as the busty blonde heroine.and then there's a great extended cameo by Forrest j Ackerman(Dr. acula and to us horror fans uncle forry)OK i know a lot of critics hated this but its really an entertaining tribute to the universal Frankenstein movies,the monster looks like a brute with a face that resembles a raw steak,and Dracula looks like a hippie with fangs.also starring the great Russ tamblyn and Anthony eisley.with music from the universal monster films.troma picked up the DVD rights to this.it really is a scream.notably this was Lon Chaney Jr's last film as well as j Carroll Nash(both were in house of Frankenstein 1945) also in the cast is Jim Davis who later played jock Ewing on TVs Dallas.
The people in this movie are, almost every single one, so likable (at least sooner or later they are), and the places are so recognizably American in ways I care about that the movie was an affirmation.
As with other Haggis films, things that seem ordinary and insignificant at the beginning have implications later on.
I can't remember the last time I recoiled in shock from a bloody shoot-out and laughed until I cried 15 minutes later.
I've seen and admired his later movies, including Hana Bi and Dolls, but i wasn't quite sure what to expect when i got the DVD version of this.
The climax is shown obliquely, from a distance, we can only infer what is happening later.
If you like baseball you'll love this film, and the "Making Of" DVD feature later.
Babe Ruth hit 60 home runs in the 1927 season, and Yankee stadium was still known, a generation later, as the house that Ruth built.
Eventually the asterisk would be removed, but not before Maris' death some time later.
61* would of course become 61 and then later shattered and surpassed by another home run chase.
The Los Angeles (later California and now Anaheim) Angels and Washington Senators (now Texas Rangers) began play, thus spreading the pitching talent more thinly.
The same cannot be said for a goof up at the dance, when you see Franklin in the background, but he has dirt marks all over his head like Pigpen, who makes his own cameo a few moments later.
As Jennifer, she emerges with her gamine screen persona almost fully formed, and it's no wonder she continues to work in front of the camera over a half-century later.
They go on and on talking about meeting later in the day, almost flirting by Gwynn's advances, and there's a DEAD BODY ON THE GROUND!
That MacLaine held the screen then, and still does 50 years later (!
Both of these numbers would later be featured in different installments of THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT.
The show did suffer a bit when Nancy Pimental took over as co-host, as she lacked Jimmy's chemistry (he later went on to co-host the insipid "Man Show"), but she was fairly competent as a comedian.
The cast were all excellent, Lars Hanson was superb as the tormented title character Anson Campbell, he has been accused of over acting, but, Anson Campbell is a man who is losing his faith and heading for a mental breakdown to boot and Hanson portrays that with chilling clarity at times, though admittedly he was a little over wrought in some later sequences.
To take the sweeping course of events in 1941 Hawaii and use them as a source of stories more about personal lives and interactions than grand strategic plans was an interesting course of action; somehow it must have mostly succeeded or there likely never would have been the (far superior) "Winds of War" a few years later on the same network.
The film uses superior sound FX in presenting the attack - the sound FX used by 20th Century Fox are good, but Warner Brothers uses far better explosion, strafing, and piston airplane engine sounds here; the sound FX used here sound even better, despite being recorded in mono, than many stereo sounds used in later films.
The music was sensational and the concept of finding a love years later was very romantic.
Seinfeld has surprised me in the past by turning out a show that I didn't 'get' completely the first time - but later I did.
When he travels into the world outside the hive,he is awed by the larger,mostly human-dominated world,but later comes to realize that the very product he and his fellow bees make(take a wild guess what that is)is being exploited by humans for large profit.
Moments later his son came home and said he needed tens of thousands of dollars to get into Stanford.
The story is great, recalling "La Pacte des Loups"; the cinematography and effects are wonderful; and Julian Sands and Elsa Pataky have excellent performances and chemistry, with the story centered in their romance first, and in the rage of BÃ¡rbara for Romasanta later.
Especially McAdams but more on that later.
The term "gene" wasn't even proposed until half a century later, and additionally, around mid 19th century the mechanism of inheritance was entirely unknown; Mendel's work lay undiscovered until early 20th century, and even Mendel didn't use the word "gene" (so it couldn't have been a case of some exceptionally insightful scientist having discovered the term in some ).
Again, I have no problem with the story and think it compares favorably with the sound version produced by Selznick fifteen years later.
Until I went to their house about a year later and was bored, and decided to play the game to actually feel how it was to play.
Some weeks later she realizes her pregnancy, came back to berlin and in the chaos of boyfriend, his friend (the raper), a drugdealer and her parents she searches for her way to future.
However, a short time later, Kyle is surprised and delighted to find that the "ghost" of hunter is haunting his digs and trying to communicate with him.
A few days later, Linda is fit to be interviewed by the head psychiatrist and he asks her what exactly happened out in the middle of the sea.
What really gets me is that all the reviews described this movie like this: Hip Comedy about a woman who remarries after her 1st hubby goes to jail, and then 10 years later when he is released must choose between the 2.
The thought that him and this girl are going to procreate...>shudder< but the little girl turns out really cute, sweet and unbelievably normal in the end...more on this later...
That thought of Maureen's becomes something later in the film that Eddie says repeatedly.
They cling even ten years later, leaving her new husband out of her heart, that convincing suburban dad (Travolta), imperfect and yet successful, who has given his life to her.
At first Gray is prim and proper and later on becomes attracted to Morrow.
It is nice to see Lee Patrick as a cafÃ© owner with out her high pitched voice that she later became known for.
Weirdley, Courtney Cox's face didn't ring a bell years later, when I got to see "Friends".
It's a pity Jeunet and Caro sought to top their efforts when they made "The City of Lost Children" five years later.
It's worth noting that in the later film all finer human feelings were given to the mentally deficient - a retarded loner, a complete madman, and a child - as if sanity and intelligence precluded the possibility of any other admirable trait.
I found myself chuckling through the whole thing; not just at the jokes, but at the painstaking way Jeunet and Caro plant plot, scenic, and sound details that later play important parts in the film.
Unlike their later films, "Delicatessen" may not be for everyone, as it's mix of black comedy and surreal fantasy may seem at times too close to absurd to be enjoyable.
We later find that the reason for this is that this particular delicatessen hires handymen and keeps them long enough to fatten them up, and then they are eaten by the delicatessen's butcher and the inhabitants of the apartment building in which they live.
The plot thickens when the new handyman meets, and later falls in love with, the butcher's daughter; Julie.
However, Next of Kin is the later creation and he must have fine tuned some of the mistakes from the rather slow moving Raw Deal.
Adam Baldwin as the blood thirsty villain does a good job (not as good his later performance in Joss Whedon's Serenity (aka Firefly) as Jayne but he is convincing as the bad guy.
Years later when I discovered that Liam was british my opinion of his acting abilities skyrocketed.
It's hard to believe that the same actor who plays to perfection this tight lipped, lean and mean mountain man, will later be nominated for an Oscar for his heart-rending portrayal of a sophisticated German industrialist.
Trust me, this isn't worth paying for, and even if they paid you to watch it please don't, you'll thank me later.
"Q" a strange man comes and lives with the family but before he injures the father by hitting him in the head with a large stone, who he later becomes friends with.
He later decides to film his family's life.
He screws his daughter who's a runaway prostitute, then later gets beat over the head with a rock by a mysterious stranger.
First he hits the father with a rock twice which makes him - the father - think about how unsafe and brutal his society has become and decides to make a documentary about violence and sex abuse among the youth (the night he was hit on the head he couldn't get much sleep, grabs his camcorder and goes out to his car to watch a film featuring him being sexually abused by a couple of bullies) which later on made him stood up for his son - with the help of his wife - by killing those bullies which led to him finding his long-time buried feelings for his wife.
She's also into heroin, but then later when something happens particular-like with Q, another unnerving revelation is revealed, one without really any explanation for being there.
My headache set in about 10 minutes in (after a father had sex with his daughter for some reason), and it didn't subside until the movie finally ended; at least twenty four hours later, or so it would seem.
We are to understand that the Garland-Gene Kelly musical "The Pirate" was a box-office flop, but are then told a moment later that Garland was nothing short of movie-gold.
Her later marriages are ignored, as is the birth of her son Joey, but we are shown a plethora of lost or unused footage, lots of song numbers from Judy's unjustly-neglected television show for CBS, and moving newsreel footage of Garland's funeral procession in front of thousands.
And, viewing her later performances, one could see the fire still in her eyes, she was such a fighter!
A month later we meet the survivors again on a regular morning.
There's a great thematic consistency to all of Potter's writings, and it's easy in retrospect to see everything he wrote prior to 'The Singing Detective' as leading up to that masterpiece (he was shameless about self-plagiarism), a view which also explains the relative vacuity of his later work; and this means that watching 'Blue Remembered Hills' today, it doesn't quite have the impact that it may first have done, before elements present in it were reworked (together with elements from all his other dramas) in his landmark achievement.
They bimble across the desert looking for the Mexican border, finding en route a mummified body buried in a dry river bed with a gold medallion on it; when they later find a mysterious Indian (the always reliable, although poorly cast in this case Danny Trejo) who spots the medallion, he tells them the legend.
But, more on that later.
Apparently scores of other viewers felt the same way, because it was run again a week later.
I also remember later that same day my father (may he rest in peace) took us to a Christmas tree lot in Port Huron, Michigan, where we cut a live tree and took it home to where we lived in Warren.
Then, four years later, CBS reran "J.T."
Seeing how a boy about the same age as I lived so differently prepared me in a small way in dealing with people from different backgrounds later in life.
It must surely be one of his funniest performances (ranks up there with Midnight Run), & Billy Crystal provides a cringe worthy 'tough guy' parody later on in the film.
It's also one of the best vehicles for Joe Pesci that was ever made (even if it didn't technically originate with him), and will probably make for part of his great standing as an actor years later through all the other Scorsese movies.
Now it's years later, and I'm still quoting its lines.
I watched it first on a VCD and later found a featured DVD a few years later for a few extra quid.
Launer has also written things that at first appear throwaway at the time like eating grits at a diner but then incorperates them into the plot later on .
Jokes like Ollie checking the time and spilling his drink down his shirt seem old now, but were possibly reasonably new then (and still considered good enough to be homaged 43 years later in The Young Ones).
Yes, things certainly were modified a bit for Laurel and Hardy's characters in these later Fox feature films.
Their later works for the Twentieth Century-Fox studios aren't exactly the most classic ones around.
There are a couple of sequences that are still are of comical greatness, such as the scene in which the boys ride in a jeep during a combat exercise but like often was the case in their later movies, there are more misses than hits with its humor.
her Spanish-born lawyer father Fernando (stefano accorsi) is inspired by his family's opposition to Franco (you later learn he is from a rich catholic royalist family and that his uncle is fighting in Spain) and allende's victory in Chile, to quit his job and become a liaison in France for Chilean activists.
for example Anna's mother makes a comment that she can get the kind of issues-political writing she is turning her repertoire to published in Marie Clare, but later throws out a copy of the magazine when her article isn't published, proving that just because you want to save the world doesn't mean Marie Clare does.
she also says that all radicals have beards, which, when repeated later by Anna, is met with an inquiry as to whether Santa clause is a radical by her kid-brother Francois (played by Benjamin feuillet).
another witty example at one point her parents take her to a rally to demonstrate solidarity, but later in the film, when 'exercising solidarity' with her classmates who all believe Rome to have existed before Greece despite her knowing better, she learns that solidarity and being a sheep are two different things.
What Spelson found was a nascent Chicago film community eager to show off it's chops in anticipation of John Landis and "The Blues Brothers" production army who came to town a year later.
I liked Imola Kezdi ("HoltvÃ¡gÃ¡ny 1973) as Ana Criveanu, who falls in love for the prince, and later on kills herself when rejected by the prince, although I had the feeling she did not look exactly like a 20 years old girl, as the script requires.
100 years later you see an aged Pan, as spectator.
Both the critical and box office success of 1989's No Holds Barred were unprecedented, and needless to say, many had high expectations for the eagerly anticipated Sububan Commando of two years later.
Originally titled SWEET KILL and actually filmed in 1970, the title was later changed to the more exploitative-sounding THE AROUSERS (with a new poster to match) a few years later.
For the first time we hear " Trust no one" which became a catchphrase later on.
Beginning in the 1960s, many of them in Roger Corman's raffish moviemaking academy, a number of directors who would later achieve prominence made their bones in horror schlock and soft-core porn; Hanson would wait until the '80s to do his next film.
When the caretaker of the family Joseph (Don S. Davis) dies six years later, Christy returns to Edgemont for the funeral and has a cold reception by John and his mother.
Eighteen years later has anything really changed?
As the girl has just recovered from a horrific experience - we don't find out till later exactly how very horrific - it seems slightly strange that no-one seems overly concerned about her welfare or why it is so crucial to know if she knew.
We believe her, but later watch her discomfort as she realises she is asking Stephanie not if, but how she knew, challenging a certainty that she herself would not be able to explain with logic.
Ten years later, after an expedition in which he is captured by cannibals, the father is finally reunited with the son, who has been raised by the savages and knows no other way of life.
Naturally, two years later she played Becky Sharp in 1935s VANITY FAIR, and she was perfectly cast for the hard edged heroine.
This film never could have been made a year later once the Production Code was revised and strengthened, as the notion of a three-some (even a non-sexual one) became strictly taboo...as was the liberal use of the word 'sex'.
People in the know realized that Lunt was gay and (rumor had it) Fontane was a lesbian, but the marriage worked because of mutual artistic respect and partnership (oddly enough not so much in film - only one movie, THE GUARDSMAN - but in stage work and later television).
But the wit of the script (written by Hecht but, as always with Lubitsch, carefully supervised and contributed to by the director himself) and the appeal of the performers (more about them later) pull the film through the occasional rough spots, and the second half of the movie is just about perfect.
Irons later admitted that he had never killed anyone, so why was he willing to kill Will Kane?
One of them bites his Captain's (John Saxon) arm when being rescued and he has the dormant virus that will come to haunt him in later years.
The film begins with him being defrocked and soon picks up 20 years later--after he's created an order of nuns who look just like Catholic ones.
Boorman based his movie of a article that appeared in the Los Angeles Time in the early 1980's which talked about a father whose son was abducted by native tribes and rediscovered ten years later.
Ten years later, the kid - now being a teenager - is discovered by his father who had never stopped searching for him.
Just a few months later, she was found hanged in the bathroom of his apartment.
later, the heroine does'nt want to be with him as she is afraid he might die before her.
but, what happens later is the movie.
You'll get a clear picture of just how ridiculously mean he is later on, but for now, let's continue with the story.
Back in 1986, The Wraith just about qualified as a moderately entertaining alternative should the video rental shop be all out of copies of Aliens or Top Gun; however, when watched twenty three years later from a nostalgic point of view, this silly supernatural revenge flick actually proves to be a whole heap of fun.
Granted not many of the stars may be thrilled with such early work and wish to be thought of as more serious, mature actors, but we all have come a long way, considering it was later that Charles Sheen was in Platoon.
Have you ever seen a movie you thought was great, but couldn't even remember its name a month later?
Years later, we find the dude restore the family homestead with the help of his friends.
Many years later Maxx is all grown up (and played by Michael Hanton).
"Kung Pow: Enter the Fist" did the same thing years later and was trashed by critics.
Part of his training includes smoking magic mushrooms which sends him on trip that results in a revelation (one which shows how Hicks had developed the philosophies which would greatly influence his later comedy very early).
He was dead four years later.
He died weeks later at the age of 37.
Jiger manages to stab Gamera in the neck and put some eggs into him that later hatch into little Jigers.
The only really interesting aspect of this film is how Jiger infects Gamera with eggs of hers that later hatch inside of Gamera.
The plot opens with a brief but atmospheric flashback/dream sequence immediately clarifying the protagonist's link and phobia for large spiders; a small detail that will prove very relevant later in the film.
The investigator says he'll come back later that night to talk more.
He commits various violent acts that he has no recollection of later.
The opening sequence of the feature ruined any suspense for many later events and could have been done in a different way that didn't give away much of the story before the audience even had a chance to settle down in their seats.
Even the plot of the story was bad, a man who fell in love with his fiance' in whom he was to marry dies of a supposedly suicide and years later he tries to bring her back to life and fall in love with him again by locating Eddie Murphys wife who we find that she is not his fiance' reincarnated but then she is and then she isn't again and the whole movie is just one mess.
A few years later, the director continued to perform public services, but the complexity of his work had evolved exponentially.
Nichols, as the judge, also does well, playing the sort of sympathetic authority-figure role that Frank Capra might later have set aside for Harry Carey or Harry Davenport.
Now, almost 40 years later, I have a new attitude about the cartoon.
These 16 episodes aired in 1978 as the opening segment of the new 90 minute Scooby's All Stars series and these episodes are coming out on DVD later this year.
I think Smith may have decided to make his later movies more mainstream.
Anyway, Mulder is called in to help talk to Duane because of his "special" background and instead Mulder ends up buying into Duane's "delusion" which we will later find out was true.
The dialogue is typical Kevin Smith work, evident in his later films such as dogma and chasing amy, and might I add work that I thoroughly enjoy.
Give it a shot, it's something different and if it's your cup of tea then you should love this movie, but if not then come back to it at a later date, you may actually appreciate this film at some point in your life!
There's nothing PC about this debut feature, and the relentlessly explicit sex-related dialogue got the film its original certificate, the dreaded "NC-17" rating, which was later dropped down to an "R" rating on a successful appeal by the filmmakers; the characters harass their customers, leave the store during the day to tend to personal matters, and hang-out with girlfriends - not the stuff of responsible employees - and definitely NOT something you would see in any Hollywood production today.
Now, thirty years later, these baby boomers are experiencing problems with their careers, marriages, health and children.
Then later, she abruptly changes her mind and tells Mulder not to feed into Duane's psychosis when Mulder says he believes him.
The Iceberg is one of those films in the later category.
Very touching warm film about two elderly men supporting each other both mentally and physically in their later years.
and a black maid (or something) whose only function in the proceedings is to indulge in some lesbian fondling with the modern incarnation of the heroine and, later, to be whipped within an inch of her life by said wild-eyed butler!!
PS: Two teachers were fired for doing the same thing "Coach Nash" did a few years later...talk about "art imitating life" this was "Life imitating Art!"
I had crushes on teachers in Jr. High (and then later to a coach but like I said, in college), but thank God none of them took advantage of me like that.
Don't get me wrong, I thought it was absolutely wonderful that they actually showed all these important events in John's life, but they didn't outline any of his later years.
From a superheated volcanic eruption... minutes later giant metal shard... hiding underneath rocks.
I recorded it and watched it a couple of days later while laid low with the 'flu.
The end of the death scene proved forever and all time Shia's acting skill, because when he sees his dad's dead body his expression conveys the fact that he's dead with no need to show the body at all, that takes skill...  Short hand, Kale spies on people, one particularly hot chick is his focus for a while, but later he turns into a sleuth trying to catch a killer Kale is a nonconformist, that fact likely added to my liking the film...
So one hot chick and a murder mystery later I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the film, it was very effective...
And some time later it struck me!!!
This episode was inspired by Rear Window by Alfred Hitchcock (1954) later remade by Pei Chan in Hou chuang (1955) and yet another time on TV under the very same title Rear Window (1998) (TV) starring Christopher Reeve.
At first, it's no big deal, but later the man becomes angry--how could they be so self-absorbed that they didn't notice or care?!
Character development is a big big part of movies and this one has development of 2 memorable characters who we would see in a later film..."Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back".
One scene was known as the "cum in the hair" joke that was later made famous in 'There's Something About Mary', but many people at universal including Jim Jacks were holding Kevin back from making the movie he wanted.
Overall Mallrats is an acceptable second offering from Smith that he would later better with Chasing Amy.
But the potty humor mixed with the intelligent dialogue (about scatological topics) hit home with me, and even now -- thirteen years later -- it remains my favorite film.
mallrats is the kind of movie you watch once on DVD and don't take it out of the drawer, because you know you'll wanna watch it later.
All I can say about this movie is WTF the concept is the same as your Blair Witch,Paranormal Activity and so on but somewhere between the halfway point of the movie its almost as the director lost all his sense of thinking and drops a twist which makes you go huh,and then about another 45 minutes or so later when you see the ending credits that is when you will have the reaction WHAT THE F***.
The movie then jumps to what seems like days later (or perhaps even longer) and the main character now has a moustache grown out.
The clues are pieced together from new footage of the girl which keeps surfacing, the deceased girl even buried evidence that is later unearthed.
About a month later they realize her spirit is in her room at home and as a ghost she wanders through the house at night.
Some time later the dead body is found but especially the mother finds no closure and soon strange things happen in their house.
Ten years later, the trend is still going strong, with at least a couple dozen films with the same concept of hand-held terror.
Thankfully, a few years later, Warner decided to bring back the goofy mice from MOUSE WRECKERS, Hubie and Bertie, and the results are just about as terrific as the previous film.
Reality starts when he's sitting in the boat with the red shirt, bearded and eating noodles...  Post card incident is a trick a big trick, its shown him sitting in a hotel window writing to his wife, well if this takes place in his dreams then in reality while he is with his wife later after saying goodbye to their recent friends how could he have the card???
His 1970s series, "When Things Were Rotten" was his first attack on the Robin Hood myth (later revisited in one of his movie spoofs), and despite some decent scripts did not succeed.
Crawford walks off hand-in-hand with Prince Charming, something she would do in many films later on.
Others, like RAIN, seem pretty silly when viewed decades later.
It's later that we see an obvious going insane Davidson as he gets a crazed look on his face and starts losing control of his feelings and emotions.
I wanted to see her when she was young and didn't look like a man in drag, as I perceived her in later movies (maybe it all those padded shoulders of her dresses and coats, emphasizing her mannish looks?).
Barnet catches up to Muni later and tells him that "Sadie" chose the Marine rather than the "cloth" (Minister).
We also believe Huston's face a moment later, as he prays alone, grimaces unreadably, and suddenly resolves into a look of predatory lust just before slipping into her room, the drums implacably beating in the background.
Sixty-five years later, watching the film on a postage-stamp-sized screen of Real Video, I nearly fell out of my chair.
If you've ever written Crawford off as "man-ish" or "bitchy" because of roles she did later in her life, check out this movie and take a look at the sexy, vivacious girl who was once described by F. Scott Fitzgerald as "the personification of the American flapper"!
This movie still sticks in my mind 36 years later as one of the most effective dramas I've seen.
Even the youngest girl, who is Phoebe Nicholls of Brideshead Revisited (TV) fame some years later.
He's even produced pictures of them on vacation with him with his mustache, but Agnes never really looks at them & later they've disappeared to, and Agnes denies they ever vacationed in that place to begin with.
Years later, as a teenager I saw it again......this time I thought I was a mature person and nothing would happen.
The children do a fine job as well as Dirk Bogarde and Yootha Yoice (the later Mrs. Roper in the cult sitcom Man about the House).
But, later that day, he asks Agnes to cancel a lunch with his parents - and she replies that his father died a year earlier!
Hours later he wakes to hear Agnes and Bruno (Hippolyte Giradou), his office associate, discussing plans to have him committed to an asylum.
When you see the movie, watch out for the clues that tell you it's all a dream: as the credits roll, there are city lights on dark water Â water heavily connoting sex Â with a sampan just in view; a long column of lights from skyscraper Â a phallic symbol, much repeated later in the story; the photos from Bali, every lover's dream destination.
The manufactured tension comes across 30 years later as more humorous than anything else.
(To see this, note that the earthly part wakes up from the implantation surgery just before the one nurse says that her shift is over, while the tormented half wakes up two or three seconds later, just after.)
Trevor's knocking on both sides of the trunk (later on) further illustrates this point.
Contrast this with later discussion of the first crusade where vivid scenes of fighting and death are shown along with narration explaining how horrible it was for the unsuspecting Muslims who were attacked in their peaceful towns and villages by the evil Christian soldiers from a Europe just emerging from the dark ages.
On DS9 he suddenly becomes a non-commissioned officer Chief rank and loses the ability to give orders to anyone but the engineers- and later submits to Ensign Nog who was but a child a year before to him.
They kind of address this a tiny bit later on by Sisko threatening Quark to do his bidding because they let him operate for free, but he never says "free services for the crew" and there are times when they make payments on quark's thumbpad so money is being exchanged.
Although the acting in this first episode was occasionally a little stiff, given the scope and convoluted plot, and the newness of the complex characters which would evolve later in the series, I think this is understandable.
It's only because when I saw this flick I was a young teen who thought Jan Michael was cool (I had a haircut like him, and later I came darn close to buying a bar by Clark AB in the PI called the Airwolf Bar because the chicks there said I looked like him, oh my was I stoned cold drunk that time).
26 years later I STILL feel robbed for having paid to see this joke.
Jack Smight must have been distressed at getting such cheesy directorial assignments such as "Airport 1975" and, a few years later, this weak science-fiction entry.
Its humor carries through 60 years later and the actors felt right for their roles.
It has all the hallmarks of a successful Spielberg production and the movie is all the more better for it  Robin Williams's performance as Peter Pan/Peter Banning is very good in both his roles as a professional businessman too busy for his children andas the reincarnation of Peter Pan later on in the movie.
Granny Wendy (Maggie Smith) tries convincing him he is Peter Pan, and later that night, he is visited by Tinker Bell, who takes him to Neverland.
And one of them is alarmingly obese, so much so that later on in the film, his body doubles as a boulder for bowling pirates over.
The main thing about this film is that it is really good, but it IS designed for children, and adults who go back and watch it years later, then suddenly spot loads of mistakes are just ruining it for themselves and others.
The success of this children's TV show was later made into a film in 1993 called Batman Mask of the Phantasm.
He discovers later in his mansion that he has a cave and in one scene of the film he's at the funeral of his dead parents and tells him that he doesn't want to fight crime; I felt Bruce's pain in this movie, unlike the other films because all he wanted to do was lead a normal life.
It makes all the live action films look painfully silly, particularly the later ones and is truly worth hunting down.
Now I have been adding some Batman titles; I began with the Batman and Superman movie, a movie that I found just good by the way (later I will be writing on here a complete comment for that movie), and later I began to watch Batman Beyond, a series that I never watched before and that right now I'm enjoying a lot (soon I will be writing a full comment for Season 1).
Oddly enough it was intended as the series finale, but thankfully it wasn't as later on in that decade we were treated to another series which was also great.
), and packs a good punch for fans so many years later.
At first I thought Samir Horn(Don Cheadle) was trying to infiltrate the terrorist organization who are suicide bombers that believes in something like the Qur'an by earning there trust, but later it seemed that he was actually loyal to the terrorist organization or even a double agent.
But later it is revealed that he does work for a organization that is trying to take down the terrorist group leader Nathir and get a hold of the terrorist plans.
These cyborgs (or Dynamitards as they are later revealed to be known as) exhibit calculated and unsympathetic views of animals, at one point referring to a dog as being 'One of these lesser animals', before disposing of the poor canine in a dumpster!
well that's all for now and later in the movie a female cyborg was crushed on a wall by another cyborg that malfunctioned .
Many story elements that would define the X-Files years later are on display here.
Several centuries later all the kinks got worked out and the Starship Enterprise certainly didn't need a mother figure supervising the crew's every needs.
The plant was shut down a year later.
The Angles occupied the island five centuries later and called it Anglesey!
Then I see some "news" story about it at six o'clock, and later on in the evening there's some story about one of the stars, and later again, an interview with the director and so on.
The next day, the movie opens in a theater near you... and it turns out to be one mediocre dog doo of a flick that's begging seats in the "dollar theatre" a month later, only to be forgotten by year's end.
Although if you're like me, you might think it's about that one hand-me-down that nobody else wanted, that got you started, the one that years later, when you saw some kid admiring it, you just *knew* it no longer belonged to you...  
We know they'll get whacked sooner or later.
When the movie was over I had a smile on my face and I am still thinking about the provocative theme of the story days later.
"Woodstock is not only a documentary, it's a real piece of history that teels us what happened during that three days of pure heaven on earth (as a matter of fact Jimi Hendrix's performance was deferred two days later, so the days are practically 4).
The kung-fu action I was expecting was short but, straight to point, it left you wanting more, you could tell Jason Yee knew what he was doing as I found out later in the DVD extras he is a real kung-fu champion.
A few minutes later I LMAO'd.
Thus, Ottola Nesmith's tufted Victorian sofa from "The Leopard Man," later becomes the property of Miss Julia Dean in "Curse of the Cat People, besides making an appearance in Lewton's "Mademoiselle Fifi," and a 1966 episode of ABC's "That Girl" !
Likewise, Miss Nesmith's daughter in the same film, ("Teresa") sleeps in the same curly maple bed destined to later belong to little Ann Carter in "Curse...".
This last sequence still has the power to unnerve the viewer sixty years later, and is one of the best of the Lewton "buses".
The leopard gets spooked and runs off, only to maul a poor girl later that night.
Soon, one girl dies, then another, and another...and evidence points that a cat did it and later to something completely different.
With the local police as well as the towns people looking for the escaped black leopard it later crosses the path of young Teresa Guadalupe who's outside going to the store to get corn meal for her mother to make dinner.
A moment later there's a terrifying scream and then all is eerily quiet.
After their success in 1942 with the fabulous 'Cat People', the star team of producer Val Lewton and director Jacques Tourneur would team up twice the year later.
Just like Val Lewton's earlier and later productions, The Leopard Man is notable for it's breathtaking atmosphere, which is once again up there with the greatest ever seen in cinema.
As I said, this film is flawed in many ways, (I'll let you decide in what ways) but a few weeks later I still find myself thinking about the issues it raised.
The film is pretty close to "School on Fire" even though it is not as fierce and pessimistic as that film which was made one year later.
I wouldn't say its any better than say 28 days (or even weeks) later, but its also certainly not worse.
For example in movies like 30 days of night (which basically is more of a zombie type movie than vampire)there is the long tedious scenes where they are watching for the vampires through a crowded basements window, or in 28 days later sniping zombies from a rooftop.
One of last years "8 Films to Die For" is a New York Lensed tale of a zombie/28 Days Later tale of biological horror set in New Yorks Lower East Side as some disease spread by rat bite and later people bite turns people in hungry beasts.
Larry Fessenden has a funny cameo as a running civilian who locks the gate on a fellow citizen, later suffering the consequences when he himself needs help.
Fair as some may say, several other directors have approached the matter increasingly (and) specially since the acclaimed '28 days later' by Danny Boyle and Zack Snyder's remake of 'Dawn of the dead'.
I thought it was that last crash we heard but did not see later on in the film.
Great little horror film that i found when i was about 10 at the local book shop for sale under the title scared alive, the back of the cover looked interesting and i thought for 5 dollars, i can't really go wrong, Anyways i got away with buying an M15+ rated film which ten years later I'm so glad i did, The movie starts of with a girl who is getting ready to go for a swim, (notice the weird, but cool pop song she is listening to on a little tape player).
Here's every kill in the film so you don't have to see it: gal at the pool gets blasted in the head with a shotgun at close range, which decapitates her and causes her cranium to sink to the bottom of the pool; guy boils to death in the pool and then later on the cook makes boiled lobster for dinner, which causes everyone to leave the dinner table in disgust (I take issue with this because it's lobster...who the hell turns down lobster for crissakes?!
You can thank me later.
Warners released there parody later that same year.
An early scene where Thomas the patient flips out violently after being touched by an extremely hot, sexually agressive young woman gives away the fact that Thomas was sexually molested as a child, although like a bad poker player who shows his cards but figures nobody was really paying attention anyway the filmmakers seem to think the audience will react with something other than complete indifference or a loud duh when they finally pull the molestation card out about forty minutes later.
We later learn the real reason for Kyle's suicide and it shows how right Michael was in feeling guilty about his death and what he had, unconsciously and unknowingly, to do with it.
It's now three years later and Michael is getting his life back together, and putting Kyle's tragic death behind him, as he goes on the lecture circuit and is invited to speak at his alma mater Kansas University.
Michael begins to realize later the reasons for Tommy knowing so much about Kyle, he's been secretly dating his daughter Shelly, and even more shocking the real reason for his mothers murder that shaped Tommy's mind and turned him into the Dr. Jeckel and Mr. Hyde that he became.
I am able to identify flaws in this diamond, this relic of my childhood, that I was blinded to by its light, but those will be elaborated upon later.
A while later (I can't remember exactly when), I saw it on the small screen for the first time, and while I don't think I ever liked it as much as Disney's "Aladdin", it was enjoyable enough for me to watch several more times.
In just a couple moments later, towards the end of this Disney cartoon, Gaston wants to kill Beast, and have his head mounted on his wall...
At the time, I thought this movie was pure science fiction, but it turns out that CGI and animation are actually replacing live actors beginning with Max Headroom a few year later.
Reading the book "The Beatles Get Back disaster" gives some insight, because it shows that they were running through stuff like 'Every Night' that later appeared on solo albums.
Sooner or later you implode, if you're this famous and everyone wants so much from you.
That ragged sound was popular by bands later, but the Beatles had moments of pure brilliance.
It is amazing that, as lousy as the Fab Four were playing, both at Twickenham and later at Apple Studios, that they managed to pull off such a kick ass performance on the roof, despite the freezing temperatures.
I didn't see it then; it was several years later, when it was a staple at 'midnight movie' showings (as was 'Magical Mystery Tour').
Having never seen any VHS copies of this last Beatles movie and since it will probably be a very long time before it gets on DVD, I was stoked when I found out YouTube had this uploaded since the later part of summer 2007 and it was still there.
I believe this candid look inside the troubled world of the later Beatles is a good account of why the world's greatest musical force ultimately broke up.
At last but not the least, Ringo Starr is shown for the first time ever playing a song - Octopus's Garden - that would later take part of Abbey Road - the LP that marked the end of the Fab Four as a group, but the begining of the Beatles as an universal legend.
Shots of guards running across a bridge would be reused in later episodes.
I have just bought the two volumes of "The Time Tunnel" on DVD and while watching this fantastic episode, I felt like traveling in time to my adolescence when "The Time Tunnel" together with "Star Trek" and "Lost in Space" were my favorite shows in the Brazilian black & white television (color TV was introduced in Brazil in 1970, and only years later I could afford to buy one).
(more about this later.)
All too often you'll find films which leave something hanging, resolve it, then find something new to leave hanging only to resolve later and repeat the process.
It started out simple (with narration is about as simple as you can start - they even employ the dictionary a couple times) and braided itself together, occasionally ripping itself apart a bit, only to weave back together later.
Not that you can't catch up later.
I remembered a few months later that "Serial Mom" was the first R-rated movie that I'd seen in the theaters (followed by "Backbeat", and then "Ed Wood").
Billy Gray who later was Bud Anderson in Father Knows Best plays Doris's younger brother Wesley (Penrod).
Valentino far outclasses everyone I've ever seen play "The Red Shadow" - and visually the SON OF THE SHEIK is much better than any DESERT SONG film version (even the later, color one).
Alas, the worker who was attacked is sent off-screen a few minutes later for medical treatment and that storyline is lost.
First off you see a man going diving, I wasn't paying much attention at that point so I wasn't completely aware of what he was doing, anyway man dies as you would expect, 6 months later man finds tooth, searches tooth on internet and decides that over the 5 or 6 species of sharks that this tooth is not there and therefor is a complete mystery and the shark obviously ends up a dinosaur.
When he played a gangster again in white heat a year later it was a big hit.
It seems like Joe is very interested in the random nature of the saloon and the kind of random people who come into the saloon, as he befriends Kitty and later an old drunk frontiersman (extraordinary character work by James Barton).
But the denizens of the bar at Harry Hope's flop house hotel are all failures, who drink to forget their failures and reassure themselves that they can pull themselves out of the failure sooner or later (none of them really can).
While in the original movie the doctor turned himself into a giant fly, in Cronenberg's movie Seth Brundle doesn't change instantly, his mutation is progressive, at first not apparent but later he becomes a new creature, something that has never existed before, as Brundle describes himself, he becomes "the offspring of man and fly".
But now as I watch the film 2 years later I realise its the emotional story between Seth and Veronica that drives it to the end.
Remade from a 1958 concept starring Vincent Price (and later popularized by "The Simpsons"), the film follows a pretty archetypical horror premise: science gone (of course) horribly wrong.
Nestor Paiva played a helpful ambiguous peasant and Joseph Vitale a rather unhelpful serious dancer, some of their best stuff was to come later with Paramount.
It left a great impression and is the reason that years later I've sought out the rest of Val Lewton's work.
But ancient animosities were aroused and the entire Peninsula lay waiting for the next international incident, which obligingly took place 10 months later at the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo.
Second theme is domed love   which in this movie is rather short, more of this later.
I loved the book and I still cannot believe that Astrid Lindgren sold the rights to these filmmakers (she later made the same mistake with the animated Pippi Longstocking).
I saw this movie first in the early 90's when I was a kid and watched it again yesterday, 10+ years later.
Because of course, Our Heroine, completely minding her own business, crosses paths with The Villain (who has a perpetual scowl on his face to rub it in and reveals himself to be impermeable to injuries and holds quite a laughable surprise much later in the movie) who shows his appreciation for her by planting a big, sloppy one on her alabaster face.
Many weeks/months/years later, after Han-Ki goes to jail, one of his men offers to let her go.
The answer comes later in the film when we do hear him speak for the first time.
One superbly staged scene is where the two kiss through the one-way glass, she unaware of his secret response to her longing, at least until his lighter flame belatedly flickers his visage into view later.
I was quite confused myself the first half an hour but later everything came clear.
But getting back to "A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving",there is one thing that I got to say about this special presentation....it is a bonafide classic that still holds up some 30 years later.
who cares when you have plot lines which includes a dysfunctional couple (played to the extreme), repressed homosexuality which blossoms at the end, amazing soundtrack (even the cake song was relevant), a man who is mentally a bird due to hypnotism gone wrong, later taught by his his son to fly due to the son's admiration of his father, Vinnie Jones !?
He started off as part of "Our Gang" but just a year later was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance in "Skippy" (he just lost out to Lionel Barrymore in "A Free Soul").
The old lady ended up partially naked later on in the movie, but it wasn't nearly as funny.
The splendid direction of Lean, the superb moody photography of Guy Green contrasting various shades of darkness and light as well as interesting character studies of familiar character actors' and actresses' faces, the excellent film editing of Clive Donner(later to become a great director as well) and Geoffrey Foot, the authentic costume design of Margaret Furse all add to the moving drama.
Jewel-like performances by such thespians as Barbara Everest as Madeleine's mother, Jean Cadell as Mrs. Jenkins the careworn landlady, Kynaston Reeves as a lugubrious Dr. Penny, Amy Veness as the sympathetic police matron Miss Aiken, John Laurie as the hypocritical Bible-spouting religious maniac and fanatic Divine rabble-rouser exhorting the crowd to condemn Madeleine, Edward Chapman as the worried Dr. Thompson, Moyra Fraser(more than HALF A CENTURY later, 55 years to be exact, in Dame Judi Dench and Geoffrey Palmer's "As Time Goes By" latest 2005 episode as one of the regulars, bumptious Penny, a role since 1993) as a spirited Highland dancer!
Eight years later, trying to recover her brief stardom, Brooks was desperate enough to strike a one-sided bargain with low-budget studio Columbia: former Denishawn dancer Brooks would accept a chorus-girl role in "When You're in Love", at a chorus girl's wage and indistinguishable from any of the other chorus girls.
His surprise when he first sees the couple in an embrace, and his look of both great disdain and knowing when he later sees the prince flirting with a servant girl says it all.
I loved the trailer for this movie because it looked interesting and funny.I really liked the 2 leads Nick Nolte and Trevor Morgan.They work really well together and I could easily see them working together in other movies.I liked the relationship they built.Ray was estranged from his own son for reasons we don't know and David looked to Ray as a father figure since his own dad couldn't be there for him because of a disability.It isn't uncommon for males to bond this way whether it be platonic or not.Throughout history older men have often had younger male companions.Unfortunately society nowadays has to put their ugly spin on it and make assumptions.Even in the movie David's younger friends ridiculed him about spending time with the older ump even though there was nothing happening except they were developing a friendship and Dave was like a son to Ray, and I think Dave looked up to Ray and respected him and later obviously really cared about him.The only problem with this movie I had was their relationship was over as quick as it began, and it seemed there was way too much more that had to be done and said.I agree with what another person said about why even mention Dave's mother since she wasn't even in the movie period.None of her absence made sense and wasn't explained well or explored at all.Also the 2 kids turned out remarkably well for having a disabled dad and being abandoned by their mother.I didn't find that believable.And then there was this whole back story about Ray's past that got thrown in and also not explored.If these missing characters were in the movie it would be easier to understand the characters better and understand how they ended up being so broken.I mean for Chris'sakes!
One feels defenseless before so large aggression and single they are left desire to vomit later to see resemblance clown outfit.
Someone will call him later to update their conditions.
Austrian-born Director John Reinhardt (who died two years later) keeps the film tight, suspenseful and very well paced.
During the exchanges of gunfire that follow, Holiday shoots a prison guard and later Cotter tells his co-conspirators that Holiday's brother was killed by one of the guards.
Cotter later records an incriminating conversation involving the two policemen and with the assistance of a shady lawyer, turns the tables on them.
Post "White Heat" and Jimmy STILL has a fresh arsenal 1 year later.
2) He quickly rehashes it, adds in some god-awful ugly sex scenes, all of which takes a couple of days and hey presto, a week later the film's released!
Perhaps he is even more compelling in the touching solo scenes, with little or no dialogue, where, to William Walton's evocative music, he is found by his colleagues overworking himself deep into the night, trying to design the Spitfire before the imminent spread of Germanic imperialism, or, later on, close to death, scanning the skies for a sign of David Niven leading the way on the famous fighter plane.
It makes me wonder if Paul Anderson saw this movie as a kid and then subconsciously recreated it later.
Then years later i found out that it was a fake documentary, to highlight how easy it is to make people believe any conspiracy with a documentary with made-up facts.
Neo-clan member Giuliani makes his pal Silverstein an offer he can't refuse - sacrifice two asbestos-riddled, low rent behemoths in exchange for millions in insurance money, and a bonus to be determined later (when Rudy becomes President?)
It does not deal with the political questions or economic ones that perplexed him, but seems to go back to his potboiler period, when he was turning out stories for money while considering better stories for later publication.
Also there's the fact that the director / screenwriter does not know who the real villains are (the aliens are shown as evil at first, but later come across as being sympathetic).
Stanley being a Polish/American whom Emil felt to be inferior to him was able to take him on and give him a bloody nose and even later force Emil, with their teacher Miss.
Why don't they just fly him to this prison - we see a helicopter later in the film !
On his way to prison he escapes from a boat which later crushes into a rock and sinks.
This is about the story of Jang Geum, a palace maid who is an orphan, but adopted by Kang Dook Gu and his wife, 'Qiuxiang', I assume (It is later mentioned that when Jang Geum's house was raided by Yin Mojie's men, all letters were taken, and all of them were love letters from Kang Dook Gu to his wife, and the letter always starts with 'Blah blah blah Qiuxiang'.
The medical knowledge that Jang Geum has later on in the serial is really impressive but then at times, it got her into trouble as well.
A great plot, characters you fall in love with, evil bad guys etc But the film has aged well as a drama also, I reckon now way later...
I saw it when it was first broadcast--and some of it again when rerun a year or two later.
It really is not worth it, and may give some gamblers false hope that all will be okay later on.
The plot itself is a fairly interesting take on well-treaded territory: the hero, Nick, invents a way to make his ultra-light plane travel through time and sells the idea to a CEO, only to later discover that the CEO is going to use it for, you guessed it, evil.
Well, 20 years later, and every time I ask in a video store they give me a funny look.
