Lars vTrier is a genius,no doubt.Everything he did,especially The Kingdom is extraordinary and very very good,shocking..but there is something that makes me feel humiliated.In Epidemic this feeling comes to its peak.It is like 'you stupid audience,watch whatever I do with your open mouth where I can put everything I want,it can be a candy or ..it'.The first I saw from him was 'Breaking the Waves' that impressed me so much that I begun waiting for the next work of the director.That was 'Dancer in the Dark'and I became a child who ate a chocolate bonbon(Danser in the Dark) after a caramelized bonbon(Breaking the Waves).In the meanwhile I found the opportunity to see Riget on the TV,this was a box filled with chocolate candies filled with caramel.Even though,all those candies were taken with no finishing,I was still a child with wide open mouth.And then 'dogville'came.Another big different candy.

they think that if we show the violence in a different way we will be more creative ...but they do not respect to mother identity..and they don't want us to watch all the film because we couldn't stand it only one hour.... everyone left the place... No human being can afford to stay meanwhile those guys are having fun with the girls that will make you think if they were your girlfriends or anyone you know.We should not make producers think they are on the way to win with this film.We must think clearly that anywhere anything may happen to anyone but the way to be more conscious is not the way on this movie to watch.People that will be conscious by the help of the film are not much more than ones that will probably make those behaviours unconsciously or consciously on another people so this way is wrong to be object lesson
The plot, meanwhile, shows the gang cleverly take up various disguises to accomplish their criminal schemes (dressing up as undertakers, members of a film crew and priests during the course of the film); interestingly, the scene in which they hold a family hostage will be reprised in Milian's subsequent and better-known effort in the genre, ALMOST HUMAN (1974) - where he actually plays the psychotic leader of a gang of crooks.

I watched meanwhile returning from a night out - a bit drunk to be honest-, and found at the beginning amusing it's use of pyrotechnic camera tricks at first, but in a few minutes becomes just plain annoying replacing ideas and emotions with cheap gimmicks, besides the script reeks stupidity and Mexican high-class prejudices ( especially in the central characters.

It's about as long as the first one(in general, it takes a bit of inspiration from it... including in a way that I'd have preferred it didn't, but I understand that others did want that; you should definitely try to play the original one before this, you will appreciate it on another level), but the well-done puzzles seem simpler(that, or I'm getting better... and I tend to think it's the former, not the latter; meanwhile, this has the greatest riddle-solving system yet), if there may be about the same amount of them.
It is about the life of the Carati family, of people gravitating around them and meanwhile the life of Italy from the 1960s to the 2000s.
Stylish and compelling mystery thriller along the lines of the CRIMSON RIVERS series, staring the consistently likable Jean Reno as a retired detective recruited back to assist a young Captain who is investigating a series of cruel murders of female Turkish immigrants which are suspected to involve a cadre of Turkish terrorists known as the Gray Wolves; meanwhile Arty Jover very well portrays a young amnesiac woman married to another police investigator who learns disturbing truths about her past Â with both stories eventually merging in a thrilling climax that works despite some inherent preposterousness.

Serge Cockburn, meanwhile, does a good turn as Mikey; he's a likable youngster with a natural talent that was a definite asset to this film.
Jan McGill as Wood's wife meanwhile is just so outright bad that it's no wonder that Wood's character doesn't seem all that effected when she (thankfully) leaves him not long after the film begins (I'd be relieved too).

I try to classify movies as they manage to get what they want, example: John Woo's a better tomorrow is far better than The Matrix, just because, even though a better tomorrow is just about nonstoping action, unfolds in its essence something deeper, and it amuses at 100%, meanwhile The Matrix, tries to get you into a new level of action cinema, tries to do a more reflective exercise in the audience, and that's something impossible to get just by splatting on, between gun shots, the basics of the Platon theories (the myth of the cavern).
