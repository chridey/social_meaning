There were times when she lost character and broke into her "girl next door" personality but those mistakes were few, however, and I'm sure when Miss Day sees the film today, she could kick herself.
I know next to nothing about Snyder's non-fiction life, but if we are to believe his composite in this film, the dude must have been completely lacking redeeming qualities of any kind.
The only problem for me with continuity in the film is one minute Cagney's forcing himself onto Day at her moment of greatest repulsion to him and the next they're married.
The real Ruth Etting seems frail and too sweet, she's adorable, which makes me wonder why she hooked up with a gangster anyway but then again looks can be deceiving, I heard she wasn't the sweet, girl next door type in the first place and she wasn't so naive and a pushover like Doris Day portrayed her.
She starts out going from one crappy job to the next.
", but rather "I did this this way because... and I am pleased/disappointed with the results, so I will do it again/try something else next time".
The story is always interesting and you never know what is going to happen next, thanks to the unpredictable and realistic characters that are being portrayed in this movie.
Whenever I watch Blackadder I simply do not stop laughing throughout the whole thirty minutes, the jokes come thick and fast, in fact they probably come a little too fast since quite often you'll find yourself in stitches at one joke and be laughing for so long you'll miss the next one.
I don't like being afraid of the dark for the next 2 days, and I usually HATE Spanish movies.
If all goes well, next year, I'll be replacing the bike with something similar and using my 3rd week of vacation for a Then Came Bronson adventure.
The next day was lovely and he lovingly applied sunblock to her back.
They visit the beach the next day and while Marie is sunbathing, Jean goes for a swim - and never returns.
I watched this more out of morbid curiosity than from any real desire to see what happened next.
Judged next to other Cosmatos fare (anyone for COBRA?
If you are a fan of rats (or LAWYERS who are the next best thing, hahaha, OK I'm shutting up now), I would highly recommend watching Of Unknown Origin.
Louis "Seeing Things" Del Grande is very good as the helpful janitor next door to Weller's yuppie palace.
The power soap operas like Dallas and Dynasty used sex with far more effect than these producers because they knew the audience could fill in the blank between the bedroom door and next morning themselves.
Anyway, watch it if its on, think about this as you watch it, and the next time you vote.
Also love to hear anyone's comments on what they think would happen next to the girl and the guy.
One minute we see a fairly realistic use of of weapons and tactics the next Arnie throws a truck down a hill equipped with C4 and Jesse Ventura pulls out his M-134 Mini Gun and shreds some Gorillas.
My problems don't revolve around the exceptionally linear themes or plots that you could drive a jumbo jet through sideways, nor around the alcohol, sex and drug abuse, or even the switch of leads from the first season to the next.
Then there's the fact that no one notices Cassie speaking to what would appear to be nobody at all, even when she's in a crowded room with people right next to her?
We have really enjoyed the show thus far and are looking forward to seeing it next year, but will not be thrilled when the show comes to an end.
After the first episode I was hooked, tuning in every Sunday to see the next episode.
Thus if you look back at any given show you will notice that very little changes from one season premiere to the next.
It mixes the right amount of humour with romance and horror, the story lines are brillaintly written and fast paced enough that you are never bored you are always sitting on your seat waiting for the next epsoide.
Still, the movie doesn't really have many happy or fun moments, it's the portrayal of a guy who just doesn't care anymore and wants to spend his time hanging around a bar with a bunch of other regulars with no aim in life but the next drink.
You'd like to see a sequel just to find out what happens to these guys next.
Lars vTrier is a genius,no doubt.Everything he did,especially The Kingdom is extraordinary and very very good,shocking..but there is something that makes me feel humiliated.In Epidemic this feeling comes to its peak.It is like 'you stupid audience,watch whatever I do with your open mouth where I can put everything I want,it can be a candy or ..it'.The first I saw from him was 'Breaking the Waves' that impressed me so much that I begun waiting for the next work of the director.That was 'Dancer in the Dark'and I became a child who ate a chocolate bonbon(Danser in the Dark) after a caramelized bonbon(Breaking the Waves).In the meanwhile I found the opportunity to see Riget on the TV,this was a box filled with chocolate candies filled with caramel.Even though,all those candies were taken with no finishing,I was still a child with wide open mouth.And then 'dogville'came.Another big different candy.
I hate him in one scene and love what he does for these kids in the next.
You can either see what they have to say, or see the next assembly line CGI garbage.
next is the prince himself he was sissified since the second game now he is stupid and who ever voices him should burn inf *bleeping* hell!
There is next to no gore.
Which means you should not make your game multiple ending and pick up only one of the possible endings in the next installment.
if i hadn't seen his Otar Iosseliani's next film, 1999's masterpiece "Adieu, Plancher des vaches !".
OK morons, you're touching the ground which touches the person next to you which touches EVERYTHING.
I give an 8 only to movies that still make me think about them the next day; and when I feel that I have to recommend them to others in the confidence that they will like it too.
I hope Sean Astin doesn't become the next star to finish one of the best movies of all time (LOTR) only to end up making crappy B movies like this one.
But if you just recently saw the original, and you got the Henenlotter fever, the next logical step would be to check out Brain Damage.
I can't say if I prefer this one ore the next one, but sure this two are very different from the first Basket Case: here you will find true comedy painted in a gory way, but no suspense or thrills!
The funniest scene takes place when Jane Wyman, Victor Moore and David Niven are striving to drive the one bad tenant, Potts, out of the Cleopatra Arms by having Niven come and do his 6-8 hour piano practicing in the room next to Potts who works nights and makes everyones life miserable by yelling at them to keep quiet so he can sleep days.
A huge roll of the dice that wiped out Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope studio and saw him spending the next decade churning out pictures to pay off the debts the $28m flop left him with, One From the Heart is one of those films I really want to like Â to love, even Â but which just won't let me.
Find a copy to rent, duplicate it and save it for your next first date with someone.
The couple is so enchanted with the pair that they take a weekend to the city where the performers are appearing next.
It's pointless to go much deeper into the story as the plot merely drives slapstick scenes one into the next.
Flailing confusion followed for the next 75 minutes, which seemed a stretched out version of a 45 minute script.
If the only comic relief next to the performance of confused, awkward "straight man" Jennifer Esposito is a guy repeating the same line over and over again, you're scraping the wood off the bottom of the laugh barrel.
However, I hope he gets another chance in the next few years with a supporting role in a better movie, because "The Master of Disguise" is so much of a disappointment I feel embarrassed for Dana Carvey.
I have the feeling, however, that the next project he works on, whatever it may be, will truly be a big comeback for him.
I'm looking forward to seeing what Matthew Saliba will do next - perhaps with Super 16 or even 35mm (and possibly lip-sync!)
The doctor makes an appearance next, feeble assistants who aren't quite human in tow, all leading up to some strange ass visuals including a meatloaf mask, a pick axe wig splitting, and a return to the womb.
I will go and see the next Jackie Chan film but only AFTER checking the production date!
However, Prey's storyline, however basic, is solid, and will keep you pressing forward through the game just to see what happens next.
It is one of the smoothest games we've seen in recent years, compelling players along not by hardened challenge but rather sheer pleasure and a desire to see what's in store next.
Check out the way De Palma cuts from the Gothic night horror of Douglas's confrontation with his demon son to Amy Irving's cozy sunlit bedroom the next day.
What happens next?
Because it won't sell overseas (see some of the comments from the colonies on this one) and because it's hard to categorise by dull marketing types the show got next to no advertising and was thrown on at something like 11pm on a Thursday evening.
As it is, the show is a hidden gem for those who get it and will become even more of a cult favourite over the next few years.
Oh well, maybe next time.
The girl next door is overweight, wears too much makeup and is dramatic, so of course she is the gay guy's best friend.
This film has such a wide range of emotions, one minute your happy for the characters and the next your angry.
I am not trying to say it's the next best thing to peanut butter and it's time for an Oscar; I am saying it was a fun ride and worth the E-Ticket!
He seems disgusted with her the morning after, and leaves callously, saying he won't be back - YET, we're to believe that within the next day he's become smitten with her and discovered he can't live without her?
Oh well, perhaps next time.
In spite of the menacing presence of Neel next to his wife, he trusts her as he knows her kind heart belongs to him only.
That of course still doesn't stop his brothers, especially the next in line Susima (Ajit Kumar) from continuous plotting his eradication.
The scenes were edge of your seat suspense, guessing and enthusiastically awaiting the next.
His performance is bound to get him a nomination for best actor in most award ceremonies next year.
She had a very challenging character which took many twist and turns, and she played it perfect to the T. She too is bound to get a nominee for best actress for her performance in Asoka at most award ceremonies next year.
The relationship between Kelly and Joanne remain one of the highlights of the film, two women who have nobody else to turn to, trying to determine what their next course of action might be at every turn.
There's next to no extraneous incident, which means that Williams has to get the tone pretty right first time.
I wish Paul every success with whatever he does next!
You will find yourself singing "Baadshah" in the supermarket the next day, remembering a scene and chuckling to yourself out loud.
The next time we see them, they are back from the visit and have a new character, Willem, with them.
The scene in the Hair Styling salon, where Johnny Yune is wearing a blonde wig and a mumu and is posing as a mannikin (a mafia torpedo, looking for Yune's character in the shop, keeps stabbing the mannikin next to which Yune stands, never once noticing that Yune keeps moving to reposition himself down the line of mannikins to avoid getting stabbed himself; the torpedo's partner, holding a pistol to the shopkeeper's head, never notices the moving "mannikin" either, distracted as they are by the shouting of the clever shopkeeper) is just unbelievable.
Sometimes, I don't like historical movies, because I know what comes next, but here, I never knew what can come in the following spot.
We love the smooth lines of Kata Dobo's face, and we are a fan of her not because of her talent - so no complaints here... however, Ivan Fenyo excels throughout the movie and I'm looking forward a lot seeing his next title.
Maybe you catch this movie than next week you forget it.
If this is a his debut, and it is very good for a first directorial effort capturing the noir atmosphere very effectively, I am almost itching to see what Richard Tuggle could come up with next, whether in this genre or not.
So often I get caught up in trying to "say the right thing" that I end up using the time that other people are talking trying to think what I should say next.
Andy, who is believed to be a participant in the whole criminal dealings, has no other choice but to cooperate with Derrick and solve the case in time to make it to his convention the next morning.
Bedtime Story comes up next.
Love Don't Live Here appears next from her Like A Virgin and the new Something To Remember album.
Ray of Light videos show up next.
Maybe they'll be on the next one.
The next chapters are just a collection of naked girls and nonsense action.
The language does get rough in places, though, so if you find that objectionable you've another good reason to skip The Man and hold out for what we can hope is a better week for movies next week.
I was one of those kids who'd sneak an issue of Heavy Metal, found on the magazine stands in the local drug store next to the grocery store where my father did his weekly shopping, inside another magazine and stare at the drawings, looking for some violence and humor ... and naked women with bi g breasts.
I guess what finally did It for me Is that, They no longer hid somewhere to slide anymore or just slide from one unknown destination to the next, It all was planned.
I knew next to nothing about Suchitra Sen.
- The 'juvie' and foster care 'system' was corrupt - right from the beginning as well as bouncing our 'hero' from one decrepit environment to the next.
If you've read my previous comment on A & C's first film One Night in the Tropics, you know the story of how their next one, Buck Privates, came to be.
The "Buck Privates" theme worked so well that Abbott and Costello eventually found their way into other branches of the military, their next film was "In the Navy", followed by "Keep 'Em Flying" and "Buck Privates Come Home" a few years later.
On board this barge are a group of characters who all have it in for her, including - Angela Lansbury, a famous erotic novelist who is currently battling a defamation suit with her - Bette Davis, a con-artist on the prowl for her next scam, the victim's set of priceless pearls - Maggie Smith, Davis' ill-mannered servant whose father's career was ruined by the victim thus leading her to a life of servantry.
Peter Ustinov stepped into the role of Hercule Poirot for the first time and despite no resemblance to Christie's descriptions of Poirot, made the role his own for the next decade.
Bette Davis does wonders with next to nothing in her role as a jewel thief.
His boss was the one who bailed him out, and now unless he can get him back in L.A. in the next 5 days, he will forfeit the bond and be placed out of business.
Or they just might in the next life...
It's not hard to guess what happens next, as Travolta and Curtis fall for each other, Curtis finds a copy of his article on his computer which causes conflict between them, and we get to see some fine acting from Jaimie Lee during those scenes.
Aerobics class became the next singles hang-out as the song "Masquerade" blares out, while everyone obsesses over plastic surgery and the perfect body (The Laraine Newman character is particularly pathetic).
It's a drama that fascinates so much, because you have absolutely no idea what is going to happen next.
I caught it on TV a few days ago and I can tell you that I now have an answer for the next person who asks me what's the worst movie I've ever seen.
It's already very obvious that the film-makers were trying to introduce him as the next big action star, but sadly that plan failed miserably.
But after that, to my utmost surprise, this turns into a soap-opera family drama and all this lasts for the next 40(!
All through the film we are unsure what is coming next.
As if one day there will be oil, and the next Â oops!
The effect is highly disturbing and makes a movie no-one with a sense of responsibility to the next generation should miss.
Thanks Basil for the great movie, I look forward to your next film!
He's a really funny guy, and standing next ta him woulda made me look more handsome than I am.
With their jealousy peaked, Lucy and Jerry try to sabotage each other's next serious relationship - Jerry with priggish, suspicious heiress Barbara Vance and Lucy with wealthy Oklahoma oilman Dan Leeson.
The rythm is great... your never bored or know whats coming up next.
Beethoven's next mission is to rescue Missy and their children.
Or next time, try watching it with a child.
Yes, you can spot the "ending" from a mile away - though of course half the fun in these realist films is predicting what might come next - but if there's one reason to see it, it's Kris McQuade (you might know her from the FIELDS OF FIRE trilogy) as the taxi driver: unmissable.
From the initial meetings to the scared first steps, the initial sex to the first words the next day, the progression of knowing nothing to seeing the unfolding of a relationship not yet defined and blossoming.
Many people say that they got very bored watching the explosion again and again , but i found this interesting as each time you see it from a different view point and each time it gives something else away and leaves you on a cliffhanger, wondering what will happen next.
With every rewind and restart there is some redundancy to be gone through only to be given the next piece of incomplete information.
For instance in one view point we have a secret service man hesitating whether to make a call about a suspicious window and in the next view point we see that someone in the audience sees him looking and looks back and forth amongst the windows to get a glimpse of what could possibly be happening.
We watch the first POV from that of the news crew -- however, it is real not a point of view of any specific person, we just follow the action of certain people -- when the story reaches a certain point we quickly rewind to the next POV (kinda) from the same time (which time-code on the screen becomes part of the films laughable points) the first began.
It gets a little annoying because each time it stops, the audience is left on a cliffhanger which carries the film's tension into the next character.
This is where some people may be mildly irritated because after you see one point of view everything is suddenly rewound and shown from the next person's point of view (this is done six times) before they all converge into a thrilling finale filled with one massive adrenaline-fuelled car/chase sequence.
But by the end, I could almost predict what stupid mishap is going to happen next.
Cleese is a uptight, cross-dressing hotel manager with a presence that takes the movie to the next level.
What will be in the next part?
We can rest assured they are dead, until the next grade D sci-fi- clone of Species is produced.
Its not all amazing visuals but great story telling as well, something that will probably allow this film to live on for the next hundred years.
I watched Kung-fu hustle a few times now and bought it on DVD and cant wait for his next movie.
So I don't mind, just bring on the Chow, be it old or new, in the next year.
Overall, it is a highly recommended movie to watch and I can't wait for his next film.
The only possible answer is what comes next, death.
One frailty after the next, Son, like many of the other characters, is tested on how resilient he really is.
Even a horror flick like "Bhoot" could be put right next to William Friedkin's "Exorcist" but movies like "Darna Mana Nai", "Vastu Shaastra" and "D" were mere techniques of cashing out on the previous film's successes.
Watch his next release "Risk" directed by Sawant and you will feel his voice.
The insane antics of the camel then completely take over the picture, resulting in a bravura tour-de-force of jaw-droppingly mad animation in which Humpty Bumpty snaps from wild pose to wild pose, howling in paranoia one minute and playing some inexplicably produced bagpipes the next!
To emphasize that point, the very next scene has a veiled, what-looks-like, sexy woman with a great body passing by, the guys whistle....until she lifts the veil and we see a toothless old hag!
Macauley is, as we say in England, a little bit crooked but he next meets a truly evil man.
I must make notes next time.
We know Macauley is dead because John Cassavetes checks his corpse in the next scene, in the Mortuary.
For Peter, it is the revelation that he is just as capable of racist sentiments as the next man.
We are going to revisit Hidalgo and look forward to Mr. Fusco's next project.
Benton delights in leading his audience up various blind alleys, adding layers to the mystery and generating constant tension about what will happen next.
The next ONE-EYED JACKS element in the film is the appearance of a beautiful young Mexican woman, Maria Salvador (Pamela Duncan), who likes hanging out at the beach alone.
She says yes, and we next see Turner being put in the same jail cell with Reno.
The next raid Frost led was on an airfield in Tunisia, just like the second raid in the film.
While watching this movie, I had to repeatedly rewind the movie because I would be in such deep thought about a point Andre had just made, that I would completely miss the next few minutes of the movie.
The introduction also perfectly sets up the situation we are going to find ourselves in for the next two hours; it shows Wallace going about his normal, mundane activities, expressing discontent with his life and how he has to see his old friend Andre for the first time in years.
The major flaw of the film is undoubtedly the camera-work, this is especially worrying with a film like this because in theory this should be one the most easiest films in history to shoot but instead of simply taking a subtle approach and showing the characters through two or three angles, the camera will suddenly jerk from one shot to the next in a very disorientated manner.
The next part is Wallace responding to all of this, and the final part consists of Andre and Wallace basically agreeing to disagree, all while dining at a fine restaurant.
He plays a young typical middle-class English guy that has just begun to watch the girls as an unknown new universe; he has a family, a brother next to the marriage, and an ordinary social life.
"I could tell you of a forceful woman," says Doctor Valonius, a white-haired old man who can tell the correct time without looking at a watch, to the spoiled, impatient, well-dressed woman seated next to him in the club car of their train.
There's an amusing pattern of repeated visuals that change meanings as we see who is now next to whom, who is asleep and who is awake.
This gesture's unplanned and the girl's inexperienced and they have to break back in the next night to find her cell phone.
My biggest fear throughout was that at any moment the next scene would see Sam (sean Penn) and Rita the lawyer (Michelle Pfeiffer) deciding that the best solution to their problems would be if the both united in a marriage / pseudo-marriage, so they could lay happy families and all live happily ever after, blah balh blah ad nauseum.
The next best is What's Eating Gilbert Grape?.
As the film progresses, you will find yourself laughing one minute, crying the next (you WILL cry no matter how mature or old you are, so make sure you have tissues), the next moment tapping your foot along to the familiar Beatles tunes found throughout the movie (even though they're covers) and the next moment simply staring at the screen not believing your eyes and ears at how emotionally powerful a film can be.
IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE has been the top of my list for all time favorite movies, now I AM SAM has moved in right next to it.
Two of the men playing his friends really were developmentally disabled, having been found at L.A. Goal, a non-profit agency dedicated to helping such people through a variety of programs, and it's next to impossible to tell them apart from the other actors.
Better luck next time!
I would like to see more Independent action-based films like "The Incorporated", rather than those we see every year at the festivals striving to be the next Neil LaBute or Woody Allen.
I would call Heroes of Might and Magic III a truly GREAT game- if it wasn't so easy to get stuck in certain scenarios that are necessary to get to the next scenario.
I thought it was extremely fun, especially as we had to sit next to each other (I didn't have Internet nor the knowledge of LAN by then).
The objective was to cast the Blacks into the mold of the unexplainable will of God and the necessity to suffer in this world to be saved in the next one.
This seems to be leading us into the next line of wrestling.
My next target is the first movie, which I still haven't seen.
What follows is a moving tale about how a father does all he can to make life better for the next generation.
While you're watching this movie, don't be surprised if your mind starts going elsewhere, like into thinking what's for dinner or the next day's chores.
The sudden change from comedy to drama is kind of jarring, since you don't know what's going to happen next.
This it where it differed from a typical Hollywood film; the characters didn't always serve to move the plot onto the next page.
I know, you thought the trashy cheerleaders would make for a fun sex-romp comedy, but remember that part where they died in the beginning and you didn't see a single breast for the next hour?
The movie is self consciously stupid; the huge penis transplant, people getting shot and instantly turning to charred corpses in the next scene.
These characters' only concern is where their next beer or orgasm will come from.
If you're metroplex mainstream, in the mood for the next Bruckheimer blockbuster, you'll hate it; The art house crowd will despise it.
I saw in IMDb that this is the first feature of the unknown director Martin Murphy, and I really expect to see his next works.
Also, the new release WOLF CREEK will be the next title to get cast and crew rave reviews all out of proportion to its lame sad reality.
On so many shows, you have this token alcoholic character (soap operas in particular) who goes on a drinking binge in one episode and recovers in the next.
The thrill of the next race and the challenge of the next tune-up are all that matters to them.
Their journey and ours leads into the rural, back-roads heart of the country, leaving us there and making the next step in the journey open and unknown.
Oates is one of the most tragically underrated actors of all time, and this is next to only "Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia" as his best film.
Not that I suppose anyone is interested, but I eventually rated this at about #70 in my Top 250, but next time I watch it I may move it up to #1 or drop it out of the 250 entirely...
Going off the beaten track ...let me also take the forum to write about two things regarding Quick Draw McGraw: One, this cartoon did not promote violence and again, I was totally ticked off at the 80's parental group that ruined it for the next generation of children behind me to be able to see this....and two - in the 90's when the Arsenio Hall Show was on, I remember he came out and performed a monologue about "El-Kabbong".
Gracie had to make decisions for everyone, basically she put her life on hold, And as mentioned earlier, her boyfriend came across as stupid, one moment he's in love and admiring her strength and the next he's urging her to chuck it in and throw her lot with him and "his nouveau riche" family.
Arguably the most beautiful woman who ever lived, she deserves a place next to Ingrid Bergman, Sophia Loren, Bardot, and Liz, among others, as one of the great screen beauties.
She has the charm and the ability to be the next major child actress.
At the end credits it was announced that the audience could expect a new Matt Helm film The Ravagers would be coming out next.
The Wrecking Crew turned out to be the tragic Ms. Tate's next to last film.
i thought that was why he didn't do the ravagers which had been announced as the next Matt Helm movie.
It is graphic and heart ripping, it is a movie EVERY teen should see so that they can relay the message of Never Again, because next time it may not be The Jews, it could be any culture.
The next time a ghost disappears over an edit, or when a light is turned on, I'm just going to pitch the DVD out the window.
The next bleeds to death from his nose.
Can't wait to see the next one that they filmed this summer.
Can't wait till they release the next film.
There is some cute comedy relief in the next scene provided by the Orchestra leader who is played by Al Shean who was in real life, uncle to the Marx Brothers.
The next shot is later and much more intimate where Raymond Massey and Fairbanks are in a dark room only lit by a fireplace and they sit in two large chairs with their backs to the camera.
So here goes:   Salma is one of my favorite actresses, she has great talent, while Russell Crowe is my least favorite actor next to Tom Cruise.
Well the company has made a rather drastic change for it's next project in Santa Santita.
So rather than ask for my dollar back, I just got up and walked into the movie they were screening next door.
I understand that this was created entirely in 3D and then forced to look 2D but I think the process is similar to using a nuclear bomb to kill a fly - which may be the next adventure of Hoverboy.
And so it is that, for the next 90 minutes or so, we are in the company of a ditzy blonde (Joan Blondell who's killed off early and becomes the ghost in this case), a put-upon heiress (ill-fated Carole Landis), a mysterious masked assailant (whose identity when revealed proves quite clever), an ailing father (H.B.
Wayne and Carey have a great chemistry between them because next to John Ford, Harry Carey was probably the single biggest influence in creating a star named John Wayne from a USC football player named Marion Michael Morrison who earned some extra money working as a prop man on silent movie sets.
The relationships are unearthed in true Vidhu Chopra style during the next few frames as we look at one ugly facet after another of this royal bunch.
When he stands next to the bed where queen Suhasini devi (Sharmila Tagore) is lying, he has the eyes that will negate the possibilities of any words from the screenplay.
as much as the next person, but this just seemed lazy.
The next 30 minutes is all relationships, flashbacks, idiots sleeping with curtains blowing across lit candles.
The chick got issues and I sat there wondering how the next person was going to die.
One minute I was sympathizing with one character, the next minute disliking them.
I'd like to support indie filmmakers as much as the next film fan, but let's be honest please.
Anyways, what exactly happens next, I'll not explore further, as I don't want to spoil the film.
(Again this will probably be better on the next viewing) Over all worth a shot.
When we next see Sharpe he's making his way through dusty Indian villages towards the encampment of a small British army not far from the fortress of the Rajah of Ferraghur.
But the finished product was a treat with a terrific cliffhanger at the end of episode one which wasn't immediately spoiled in the next time trailer!
We can't wait for the next two shows.
Despite many pratfalls found in the script, sometimes silly voice acting (common in the genre), and some (at times) counter-intuitive pacing, scene-for-scene Tekon kinkurÃ®to (US title is Tekkonkinkreet) will probably remain the most compulsively rewatchable, primarily hand-drawn work of art to be savored by pencil-aficionados until the next driven team of artists desires even more.
This was made like a TV show with a typical ending begging for the next season.
You have to only guess what is coming next, and when it comes, something else is brought into the fold which skews or distorts what you first believed.
Contrary to what some folks claim, I didn't know what was going to happen from one moment to the next and there is surprise and suspense throughout.
Later, their Sergeant beats them up and Curly clearly has a swollen eye which becomes a bruised black eye in the next scene.
Now while the plot really is quite unlike the show (in which Steve is NOT the next James Bond, but he is still pretty cool in the show), the basic idea and structure is there.
So I guess if you enjoy this, then you may like the movie, but I personally couldn't follow who was fighting for who from one scene to the next.
This one will be next on my DVD shopping list for no doubt.
and then for the next two hours he runs around killing people and being or being the subject of "deep" discussions in various times and places.
Chances are you'll buy the soundtrack recording immediately the next day.
The next day Gen. Ramey, Matthew Falson, arrived from D.C and told both Col. Blanchard and Maj. Jesse Marcel to change their story from a "flying saucer" to an army weather balloon crashing in the desert outside of Roswell.
But anyone who has seen Tod Browning's 1932 masterpiece "Freaks" and knows of Olga Baclanova's fate in it (or who has seen the trailer reel that precedes every movie from Something Weird) can guess what happens next.
They actually fill/waste so much footage in the thing: there's a 6-minute montage (complete with bad lo-fi jazz) of the circus guys taking down and setting up in the next town.
I usually read the reviews of the users here on IMDb before I watch a movie.I have come to rely on this site for renting and watching films.When I saw the title of this film "The other side of heaven" I felt that the title was somewhat inspiring.After 5 minutes from the actual beginning, I kind of knew what direction it was heading.I still wanted to watch it though.I'm Christian Orthodox, but this has nothing to do with this film or with me thinking to better watch a sample from a movie after reading a review next time.
I am this "mean" because I really don't like to see propaganda in films.Films are made for people to enjoy and relax, not to attract new followers.I don't have anything against loving the man next to you, selfishness and dedication to a cause bigger than you and I, but this is really bullshit.This film is not about "loving the man next to you".This film is about "You can find God, and peace if you repent.Repent and God will welcome you with His arms wide open.
It is not to be missed and everyone should be checking HBO to see when it plays next.
This film tried desperately to be one of the next jungle gore feasts, but just turned into a heaping pile of boredom.
(The same dark undertone is even more pronounced, I think, in Ron Howard's next big hit Cocoon, where the old folks willingly escape an earth and families that don't seem to offer them anything anymore.)
It's tough to successfully reconcile the duality this film presents to its audience - the great retrospective fun of high octane 80s culture sits uncomfortably next to what is essentially a grim and unsettling story.
Del Toro plays an accomplished and stylish car thief... well, I think you can figure out what happens next.
Its not the greatest film but it a film that will make you watch from start to finish because you never know what will happen next!
He's a doctor one moment, a parking enforcer the next.
Traveling from one city to the next, Mateo calls on each child with great anticipation to see the meaningful impact they are having on Italian life.
This Benicio Del Toro's Funniest role next to "The Usual Suspects".
The interesting elements, like the preacher who lived next to the twins, were completely wasted in this film.
I look forward to seeing what the Polish brothers will do next, either collaboratively or on their own.
Again, a so totally stereotypical character, but Turturro's seamless, peerless delivery made me perk up in anticipation of how he would deliver his next line every time he showed up in a scene.
Not too much love scene, then the scene the next morning by the lake was touching.
Farrah Fawcett was the next to join; filling the blonde role, but then the producers dropped the hair color concept and brought in Jaclyn Smith to complete the trio.
Whether you want to hang around for the next ninety or so minutes will depend on your propensity for sucrose.
Or it could be that the cast worked for free or next to nothing on this project.
I appreciate any film where it is difficult to predict what will happen next, and "In The Company Of Men" was definitely one of those films.
Disliking programmed happy endings of romantic Hollywood movies I enjoyed the unfolding narration of 'The eel' having no clue what is going to happen next and in the end.
Whitesnake singer David Coverdale has received more than his share of criticism over the years for letting his band be a revolving door platform for talented musicians who come in for an album/tour, then ride off into the sunset only to be replaced on the next tour.
Burt spends the next few days acting like a supercop, trying desperately to get killed by any means necessary!
And so for the next hour the audience is bludgeoned with droning melodrama and incongruous stock footage until a conclusion that will shock you with its utter stupidity and inexplicable nature.
Once in space the crew watches as the deice destroys the earth, Stranded in space the crew has to decide what to do next.
Then, the next hour or more of the film is watching both Melvin and his wife, Lynda, screw up their lives again and again because they both have the wisdom and intelligence of tree shrews.
In closing I just want to say that I am a film historian and preservationist at heart and I would NEVER think of making my next statement if I didn't feel it was the best solution, that being said I feel that this film should be erased from history.. All it does is tarnish the memory of one of the greatest actresses that ever graced stage or screen.
The cable broadcasts deleted a few scenes (not because of content, but because of time) and it makes the transition from one scene to the next a bit bumpy unless you know what's missing.
So next time you wish to discriminate against someone for their race, greed, religion, or sexuality.. Just think you would you feel in their shoes.. to be the recipient of that hate.
Seriously, didn't know what to expect next.
But it always bugged me in Bambi, that in one scene his mother dies and his father takes him away, and then, in next scene Bambi is big and everybody is happy.
They would make one more movie the next year, a film Powell called nothing more than a programmer, and they would then go, still friends, their separate ways.
Let's go find a party," and by the time you wake up the next day, it is possible you are no longer thinking of it at all.
Then, there is a movie that is upsetting or intricate or unusual, and you leave unsure, but you think about it the next day, or off and on for a week, or off and on forever.
The worst part was that Karloff had a huge group of evil satanic minions and the next, they are gone and Lugosi seems to have won--sort of like a "scene missing here" card should have been inserted here!
and conveys this drunken feeling in the way the scenes cut from one to the next.
The next step the LumiÃ¨re Company took in exploiting this mobility was with camera movement.
See for yourself and find out what happens next.
Most of the other actors come off poorly next to Cagney, because his style of acting was so different from the conventions of the time.
The next time around, it was adapted from the Broadway Musical adaption of the original play.
The two next hook up with Gangster Paddy Ryan (Robert Emmett O'Connor) who gets them into the muscle end of pushing bootleg beer.
i gave it two star because i actually couldn t wait to see what bad acting would come next.
or what corny effects would come next.
As the night and next morning ensue, Werdegast's and Poelzig's sordid past is revealed, and Poelzig also decides that he must have Joan for a satanic ritual.
Great acting by the supporting cast and fine direction by the always demented Tom Savini - who will be the next genere director to breakout!
The only epilogue in the ORIGINAL is that when the "posse" comes the next morning, they see Ben in the window.
This is ridiculous for the next reason: The ridiculous thing is that she DOES leave and DOES walk right past them.
Barbara comes back the next morning, and sees Zombie Ben coming from the basement, and he's shot.
Rather it's because they failed to HAVE an intelligent ending because of what happened next.
This new version also is a full-blooded and genuine horror film with loads of tension (even though you mostly know what'll happen next, it's still scary), good acting (a lovely B-cast with names like Tony Todd, Tom Towles and Bill Moseley) and excellent make-up effects (although, it has to be said, the gore is a less outrageous than expected).
Make-up maestro Tom Savini's color remake of Romero's 1968 classic follows the original almost shot-by-shot,but it's of course not better film.This remake was clearly made for younger viewers who refuse to watch black-and-white films,no matter how good they may be.The result is passable,but it lacks dark atmosphere and mood of the original.If this version has anything to offer,it is Patricia Tallman("Army of Darkness")in an engaging lead performance as a tough,independent heroine.This is only my opinion,but I'm really fed up with "strong female lead" concept that every new horror film seems to have.The next thing I dislike in this picture is the lack of gore.For God's sake this film was directed by gore wizard Tom Savini-the man behind such hard-core splatter flicks like "Maniac","Nightmare" or "The Prowler".The violence is very tame-even by today's standards.However the acting isn't bad,the zombies are pretty scary and the film is never boring.Recommended for horror buffs all around the world.
He has a profitable new venture sewed up until his mistress become jealous of the woman whom she recognizes as his next mistress.
The prospect of money and fame charms Nini, and she become Danglard's next mistress, as well as an apt student of the cancan, which Danglard has dubbed "French Cancan," to cater to the current Anglophile tendency in the dance.
I hope 1st Channel never puts its name next to Studio Tritey again.
Poelzig informs him that his family has passed, but Verdegast believes that Poelzig murdered them both and seeks vengeance on the Satan worshiper, who plans on making Joan his next sacrifice.
One minute she's reasonably independent, the next she can't even spit out what's on her mind.
This film was probably shocking in its day Â not very nice - like watching those lovely people next door have a drunken brawl.
Hopefully, in the next couple of years, studios will use the technology of "Dinosaur" to make quality movies that we'll enjoy after the first five minutes.
At the literal level the film is entertaining in an almost comedic way (you really don't know what they are going to come out with next) and on a more theoretical level it is a serious drama.
She shares Squier's love of beauty and poetry and dreams of fleeing her repressing entrapment at the restaurant and traveling to FranceÂ   Into their world of fanciful idealism enters Humphrey BogartÂthe reality, the brute force which threatens not only the dreamers but all of societyÂ It is a finely truthful portrait of ultimate evil, magnificently played by Bogart with all the uncompromising ferocity the role demandedÂ It was one of Bogart's finest portrayals and it was the model, although considerably restrained, he would follow for the next years of his careerÂ  Final note: Duke Mantee was a killer on the runÂ He was not a big-shot businessmanÂ The assumption put into the audience's mind was that this mobster was a bank robber, a hold-up artist, an escaped convict... but never a wealthy criminal controlling an empire of corruption from plush offices on the 18th floorÂ  Approximately twenty years later, Bogart recreated his original role in a television production of "The Petrified Forest."
Foreshadowing should cause tension in a thriller, but foreshadowing is lost when Dina says what is going to happen next.
Indeed, I enjoy an espionage, horror or sci-fi fantasy as much as the next guy.
The police suddenly divine patterns of how the murderer tells the police who the next victim will be, and if you've got two brain cells to rub together, you know who's going to be marked for death next.
After this the audience is left bored and uninterested when the killer/victim leaves and lines up her next victim, imagine Basic Instinct on Valium.
Nor do we know why that eerie painting did not raise the attention of the police when the knew good and well a head would turn up next.
Love feels so real at that age and I remember the next year at 14 falling for the 17 year old I had a crush on for many years.
I actually watched it again the next day, and even fast-forwarded through it a third time to watch just the scenes between Piven and Fenn.
3 of 10 even though it's Trek, it's a pain to watch and I won't be next time I see it on.
So it only made sense that for the next one that Schulz and animation director Bill Melendez to focus on Snoopy.
But the story doesn't end just there, it goes on further... more secrets are revealed... some that may even change the story's plot... to find out what happens next, watch 7 1/2 Phere...
), this game gives a unique perspective on this series and i hope to see more games like it in the future, especially for the next installment to the Jurassic films.
Dean mutters that the next time Sam gets into trouble, Dean's not gonna come looking to find him.
When they tell him to choose which person they'll hunt next, Sam or Kathleen, Dean hesitates.
The setting of hong Kong is beautiful and you never really know what emmanuelle is going to do next or who she is going to do.
FLESHPOT ON 42nd STREET is an honest look at characters living in an urban jungle, a place where if you don't take advantage of the next person you meet, that person will take advantage of you.
Worse, earlier crises are left unresolved before the next one hits.
I am now waiting for the next film,H2O: Trojan horse.
Anyone who can't see what's coming next must either be very naive or new to (at least) this genre.
For Supernatural fans having Sam die in such a sudden, almost unexpected way was effectively executed and felt almost as if someone close to them had passed (i knew some people who, the next day, wore black arm bands in respect).
Then the next 10, the story took a turn and i was like maybe I will live through the movie and not go to rehab or bang my head against the wall..but that's when it goes downhill again.
The next 90 minutes were worse than the first 90.. i never imagined that could be possible but it was... i ceased to exist as an individual after that movie and now roam the roads of New York like a homeless bum..
When you think you know whats happening but the second next you don't.
I welcome her return to the screen, and if she displays similar care in choosing her next project, it will be worth the wait.
Oh, and next time they want to use computer animation for sharks, they should just give me a call.
and 1 for better luck on their next film.
Most of the dialogs are pretty annoying, too: Most of the time you only see the face of one character filling the screen saying his line, then the next character filling the screen saying his line.
I could understand it if it was a first film for these guys - it's as if a director put a gun to the actors' heads, threw up the script and gave them one reading and on to the next scene.
Trampas:(smiles) "When there's a gun next to my belly, I...I always smile!
By spontaneous, i mean that whenever some event happens in the movie, it is solved in the next 5 minutes.
Multiple Maniacs mostly comes off as a rough draft for Waters next and most famous trash epic, Pink Flamingos.
Ruby wakes up the next morning with Mrs. Glass' dead body lying next to her.
I fear when the next poorly delivered line would come.
!Some of us would go see any film for 5 seconds of Kajol....especially next to Shah Rukh!!!
One second SRK and Preity love each other, and the next she's still getting married...Why are we not shown the process that goes in between.
And I will look forward to his next movie.
Leelee will likely win awards in the next 5 years but not for this one.
When a couple move in next door she thinks nothing of wearing the disabled woman down physically and emotionally to get at her husband.
Interestingly Julia Davies has both naturalistic supporting characters like Cath and Don the couple next door and exaggerated broad comedy characters that inhabit Jill's world without the mix of the two jarring in any way.
And now, I'll never know what happens next.
There are several positive Italian-American characters - Artie Bucco the chef, Dr. Melfi and her family and the Cusamanos next door to the Sopranos.
All in all, the biggest crime from the Soprano Family is that we the viewer have to wait until January 2000 to see the next season.
This movie just rushes from one scene to the next, in an attempt to create a breathless and exciting tone I guess, but scenes aren't allowed to play themselves out.
We're on to the next set piece before we've had time to absorb the one we just saw, and the characters get buried underneath all the furious editing.
In the next room he finds a dead body and a blood stained knife.
Needless to say, what happened to the dead woman next to his bed.
Spend more money on the manuscript next time, Mr. Petersen.
I can suspend my disbelief as well as the next guy, but this was just asking too much.
A quick "victory" over Iraq (celebrated aboard an aircraft carrier with Bush in pilot's gear strutting around with a helmet tucked under his arm shaking hands) would allow him to go one up on his father who foolishly abdicated such a possible advantage and lost the next election.
I think this last reason is the most compelling reason that Bush went to war, whether he realizes it or not: he wanted to win, not so much the war on terror, but the next election.
One minute, she's dressed for the Antarctic, the next she's wearing shorts and a skimpy blouse (where did she get these considering she was just along for a helicopter ride?!?!).
At point are you held in suspense or questioning what will happen next.
So, when the slasher disposes of one of the victims - a roman candle is left next to them.
The ending sets up a sequel, apparently intending to rip off "Halloween" in the next installment, since they blatantly ripped off the theme music to set it up.
This is a film that defiantly deserves a place in the family library, right next to 'Cars'.
But she's an acting master-class next to Sheffer who is an abomination, coming across like a lost grunge rocker in need of rehab.
Every character is morally ambiguous to some point, acting nobly one moment, brutally the next.
On the next level of interpretation, the Irish issue always somehow shoves it's face into the picture.
On the next level, this movie is called The Long Good Friday, because it is also a religiously symbolic movie.
If you haven't seen this movie yet, you should make it your next rental.
His world is also introduced to us through very good use of London iconography as we realise he's rich, got plenty of friends and also has a good looking girl; with his biggest problem seeming to be what nationality to make the chef for his next get-together.
Maybe next time, Barbara who is played beautifully by Gwen Taylor from another British comedy, Screaming, and her husband is played by the veteran comedian Sam Kelly.
The only one of any note was Daniel's partner Paul; he may not be able to carry a movie on his own, but standing next to Boyd Rice made him look like John-friggin-Malkovich.
I thought Brett Chukerman really mastered the role of confident guy on the prowl for his next conquest as he teased Troy while changing for art class in the restroom.
Bergman finally calls Wigand's bluff by daring him to meet him the next day.
Martin gets drugged and offers to put on his pajama top (over his suit) because it's needed to match the schmo he's doubling in the next vintage clip.
Barda is the next attempt of director Serdar Akar.
I loved the pilot episode, but didn't think too much of the next handful of episodes.
The next day, while playing golf, he shoots a miraculous putt and claims he 'hypnotized the ball' into the hole.
The next time Charley want to go out for poker night, he tries mesmerizing his spouse.
The next day, he and a friend are golfing and Charley tells a big fib to explain his great golf shot--he says he hypnotized the ball!
Sorry, Antonio, try harder next time.
this movie is fitting for that so amazingly i'm getting the DVD tomorrow and organizing a 'movie nite' next week to show this (together with 'Alien Sex Party') to some friends.
R.Dickerson who also directed the not so good but entertaining "tales from the Crypt: Evil Knight" assured that this movie had elements from Italian horror cinema, I donÂ´t know but perhaps there is one: The warms.A homage to Lucio Fulci?, I know there is many homages here but it is the same for other movies and the cocktail is far from being so effectively combined as here.I donÂ´t think they are going to make a sequel, but I am looking forward eagerly the next movie from this director and I wish "Resident Evil" was so satisfactory.
Working with next to nothing in the way of funding, Tec apparently wants to trade on the idea that low- to no-budget automatically equals "arty."
All I can hope is that with the 150th anniversary of the publication of On The Origin of Species coming up next year the BBC will finally do the honorable thing and make this available.
Maybe next time they should concentrate more on the adult aspect of the storyline.
So i finished the book that night, really happy and excited about renting out the TV Adaption the next day.
I wasn't sure then if I liked it, but watched the next couple of episodes, and by then I was hooked.
This series deserves to become a regular next season or at least a regular mini-series.
I'm expecting a very compelling fourth edition on Feb 11, which will serve as set up for the home stretch next week.
I think the show is riveting, intriguing and I'm really looking forward to the next episode, but I am disappointed that "Kingpin" is just a six episode miniseries as opposed to twelve or more.
of "Kingpin" on Bravo next season if the ratings merit it.
this movie was a lot like "the girl next door" when i say this i mean that it had the plot involving 2 kids, a rebel teenage girl and a not-so-rebel teenage boy.
like i said, it was a lot like "the girl next door" just not casted with famous people.
They just wander from one bizarre scenario to the next (from a town where the youth have turned on their elders, to a bunker where everyone is eating drugged food) without any causal relationship between the stages of their journey or the events they encounter there.
If you liked this, Eraserhead would be my suggestion for your next watch.
Take out the violence and this movie belongs next to Pete's Dragon on the movie shelf.
It must be his general calm that's so unnerving about him, as if you never know what he'll do next.
Miller and Gough: next time, consult with me if you ever try another superhero/teen show.
Maybe the CW will pick it up next season, or mid season next year if enough of a following develops.
A girl next door type as his best friend, a woman naval pilot with a chip on her shoulder, and a big tough black guy who gives him a Shakespeare play as training for his destiny (Aquaman is Mr. Action, mind you, not a reader so he is not as appreciative of the gift as he really just wants to learn to kickass).
Only one cheat at a chapter ending, where you see Zorro fall from a building, but the next chapter shows him still hanging there.
And I won't ruin anything by saying what happens next.
Although I do not reveal crucial plot elements, I discuss to some small extent what the movie talks about; so, please be warned about what comes next.
I'm watching out for the sequel and will donate half my life's savings to the production of the director's next venture - as long as the little girl is cast in it.
The next ports of call include Marseilles, Naples, Athens, Istambul, Cairo and Aden.
Guys, the next time you look in the mirror and don't like what you see, try telling yourself that at least you're not Rondo Hatton.
It's hard to imagine them having to be funny on film for the next several years while seeing Curly waste away, or during 1956 having to pretend the late Shemp was still filming with them.
Im glad I finally found the name and now I will look for its next showing on bravo or IFC.
The next...the explosion comes!
At any rate, we already know that burning books is bad and I don't know that we need an entire twilight zone episode to show us that the next step of killing librarians is also bad, but it's an entertaining enough episode.
The script is mysterious and keeps you hanging on to see what will happen next.
Not that the dolls aren't cool but trust me, you'll couldn't possibly care less about them or who they are killing at the moment because all you'll be thinking about is What insane thing Virgil or Mascaro is about to say next.
The two films she made next, 1985's "St. Elmo's Fire" and 1986's "Out of Bounds," cast her with members of the Brat Pack.
Virginia reads in the book where the next victim is a swarthy Mediterranean type with one heck of a schnoz.
She does a little stakeout of her own where the murder will take place, and bam, her swarthy Mediterranean type friend from acting class with one heck of a schnoz sits down next to her and they have a chat.
Now cop beauhunk and his lieutenant are all ears (so to speak), and Virginia reads in the book that the next victim will be a librarian watched over by cats.
Virginia, not learning her lesson, decides the killer will strike next at a library.
Following "I, Madman" as a source for where Brand will strike next, the difficult part is getting her boyfriend/detective, Richard(Clayton Rohner, with a light beard and jacket, resembling a hard-boiled PI from a noir film)and the police to believe her cockamamie story.
A guest named Dr. Kessler (special make-up effects man Randall William Cook) leaves the building as the front desk clerk (Raf Nazario as Rafael Nazario) receives a phone call from the room next to Dr. Kessler's complaining about animal noises, the manager (Bob Frank) goes to investigate & is attacked by a monstrous half man, half jackal creature which Dr. Kessler had created.
The next day at work Virginia tries to find the other novel by the same author called 'I, Madman'.
The next day Virginia sees a report in a local newspaper which tells of the murder of an actress & one of Virginia's friends named Colette Berkowitz (Michelle Jordan), after this event & a face to face meeting with Kessler before he kills & slices the ears off a pianist (Bruce Wagner) who lives near her, Virginia is convinced that the character of Dr. Kessler is responsible & comes to life when she reads I, Madman.
For The Bible Tells Me So, is an excellent documentary that will hopefully win an Oscar in that category next year.
Like many plays it begins slowly, almost too slowly, as Wyler gives the viewer exposition: Buck Cantrell and friends, including Pres' brother, talking at the bar, the end result being arrangements for a duel the next day, The story moves to a party at Julie's house, where the host is notably absent.
Drive In Massacre opens with a juicy double murder which suggests that the film might be something of a treat for lovers of outrageous 70s gore flicks: a sabre wielding maniac graphically kills a couple at the drive in, decapitating the guy whilst he is adjusting the loudspeakers next to his car, and then skewering the screaming girlfriend through the neck.
All those unsuspecting patrons sitting in cars, gazing carelessly ahead as an armed maniac, cloaked in darkness crawls around the lot looking for that next kill...
Germy at the "police station" with both the detectives desks next to each other like a couple of grade schoolers.
And so, until next time when I'll tell you about my documentary, I'm going behind the scenes of a bakery, not because I think it'll be a good movie, just because I like the donuts, remember that the best movies are bad movies.
Seeing newspaper one-sheets and hearing radio spots for old films like 'Torso', 'Last House On The Left' and 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' brought a nice nostalgic touch to the film, and it's hard not to want to pick-up a handy-cam and join these fellas in their plight to make the next low budget masterpiece.
At the next family get together you will look around at your normal (newly realized of course) ancestry with admiration.
A lot of Crumb's observations on the changing world are used by Terry Zwigoff, who directed this film, in his next movie, "Ghost World."
It starts with the young Austrian princess, Marie Antoinette, going to Paris for her arranged marriage with the grandson of the King who will be the next French monarch.
"Jezebel" does have the somewhat same patronizing attitude towards blacks that "Gone With the Wind" had, but at least it wasn't as objectionable as it was in "Little Foxes," Davis' next and final collaboration with Wyler.
It seems so real as Kersey could just as easily be a next door neighbour or uncle, he is no hulking giant with an arsenal of weaponry or superpowers, no fearless warrior who can't be scratched...he is just another man trying to make a living.
that is because of the sheer knowledge of the director.. looking forward for the next creation of this great director
Unpleasant night owls, severe misunderstandings and eventually the next thing he knows, poor Paul is running for his very life.
Unpleasant night owls, severe misunderstandings and eventually the next thing he knows, poor Paul is running for his very life.
I love GWTW, but "Jezebel" works as well or better at capturing the same basic period in US history, while also keeping you waiting expectantly for the heroine's next outlandish maneuver.
Most of the time it is too disturbing to pass for an all-out comedy, but it remains compeeling thanks to its edgy script which never allows you to guess what is coming next.
It's as if the world is crumbling all around Paul Hackett, and the next door he walks through may be his last.
As Paul steps into the next venture, there is no telling what will come of it.
The script keeps the viewer constantly on edge and clueless as to what to expect next.
I like bad movies as much as the next guy but this one is just BORING.
(By the way there is next to none and it's not good.)
Keeping in line with the theme of "last minute paper due the next day", profanity and nudity are placed into the film like similes in order to make it look more convincing that actual work was put into the project.
Richard Karn is the next closest cast member to being well known, and he is terrible in this film.
I could've skipped my next night's worth of sleep just seeing Godzilla get pounded.
Well, I still think that the next Godzilla movie, GODZILLA X MEGAGUIRUS: THE G ANNIHILATION STRATEGY, is even better, and that it was the type of movie Toho should've made (and the movie that should've been shown in US theaters)!
Sean Connery plays Edward Pierce, a comely yet conniving thief of thieves, who decides for his next project to lift the Crimean Gold from a train bound for Eastern Europe.
It's a great comedy, I love the part where the crooks are trapped by the police and they realize all the hostages are gone, so they look at Bingo and in the next scene they grab the dog and say "one move and the dog gets it!
For the next candy-man movie, I think the producer should lock all directors, writers, and film crews that want to make horror sequels in a room with a ceiling mirror, play the Sammy Davis Jr. tune "the candy man", and have all those present sing along.
Basically, CM shows up, kills someone, frames our "heroine" (I use the term loosely, as she basically whines, jumps in startlement a lot, and wanders about in her undies) and disappears until the next time.
At one moment more nasty than the baddies and the next seeming to deserve our admiration, this guy seems to be playing good cop and bad cop all by himself.
!Eager to keep his myth alive,the hook-handed one goes about his business of slashing people from groin to gullet,trying to get Caroline to come with him into the next life and let his myth live forever.
She's a lot of guys' dream of the girl next door....the one you want as a wife.
I was particularly interested to see Albert Bassermann appearing in this film and recognized his voice immediately because of his next and last acting performance which was in the famous 1948 film "The Red Shoes" in which he had a fairly significant role - not bad for an actor nearing 80 years of age!
What next?
The last scene increases the mystery of the island and leaves us, fans of this magnificent series, anxiously expecting for the next episode.
I don't know whose idea it was to cast Rupert (should be the next James Bond) Everett as Holmes, or to bring back Ian (his ears can pick up satellite television) Hart as Watson but they didn't do themselves any favours.
No team ever lasted more than 4 months, and would themselves be added to the groups herded into the gas chamber by the next sonderkommando group.
And, in our current political climate, it is more important than ever to understand how easily we fall back on our ability to turn a blind eye and believe the lies that even our next door neighbour will tell us.
Hope we don't have to wait another 7 years for the next one.
And his next target is the newest U.S. president.
My next stop is also an early nineties cheese-fest, this time about vegetable-lovin' freaks: "Troll 2".
Oh well, maybe next time.
This film stuck pretty close to the character and I think people should give it more of a chance, I really hope that when the new Cap film is released in the next couple of years people go back and re evaluate their opinions.
As for those of you who share my affinity for comics and bad movies but can't seem to get their hands on this gem, I can only tell you that it's been out of print for more than a decade now and your best bet is to find it at the next comic con in your area or at a flea market that sells bootleg tapes (ditto that for the Fantastic Four movie from '94).
One is crazier then the next.
This means that the movie, if looked at as a whole, seems to bounce around a bit because it is made up of several story arcs that begin and end in under 30 minutes before jumping into the next one.
I had to think about my next move, and sure enough, there was.
I thought it was really well done... when's the next one?
Just when you think, "Oh, I know what's going to happen next!
The direction is intelligent and cautious, never giving anything away and barely hinting at what's to happen next.
The next day, they all (including Peterson) have a shared dream of signals from the aliens, thus ending the movie on a resoundingly positive note.
The next time they try the ship they let the force take them to a spaceship far away.
But, instead of having them act out the story, the film shows inter-title cards that describe what has occurred and the cast pose like they are going to be photographed or just make a few minimal movements or actions until the next card appears to describe an all-new scene.
I turn sixty next month, so I figure I'll have another twenty years of movie-going left in me.
Before the unfortunate functionalism started to make Tabula Rasa with each trace of architectural generosity, houses often had strange hollow parts in the walls, little closets that lead wide into nowhere, "crawling spaces" between ceiling and next higher floor, mysterious huge and sometimes more-level attics and cellars, etc.
Most films that have somebody killed in the beginning have the next scene take place somewhere else or on the next day, the scene after it takes place the second after it!
While jogging, she is introduced and becomes close to her neighbor Julia Cunningham (Juliet Landau) and they schedule a hike together on the next day.
Aune sand has been filming his Russian girlfriend for the next movie.
Any of today's generation not knowing anything about Linda McCartney other than a name on a veggieburger packet in the supermarket would not understand this horribly jumbled story.One minute Linda is seen on stage the next in chimotherapy.
What next?
Soundtrack is distracting - each new scene begins with a swell of music, so if you're falling asleep, just listen for the music..that's the start of the next, and hopefully better, scene.
I guarantee you'll be on the the next bus.
This is the first movie I saw in a long time that I could not guess what was going to happen next.
It is soft and sweet one moment, difficult and tense the next, but always subtle and sensitive.
The next effort probably will be decent.
The next time out they would be the leads.
It's just time when pressure from Bogart and Allan's own growing gumption will make him take the next step.
Things become complicated when Linda and Allen become more than just platonic, and one night things go to the next level.
His advice to the kid to just get through the next 2 years and then escape to college, really confuses and hurts Dean.
STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs   A serial killer by the name of The Black Angel is on the loose in a college campus,slaying girls or boys without discrimination.College party animal Jimmy Scott (Kevin Costner) falls under the heavy eye of Detective King (William J Kulzer) a short-fused,foul-mouthed detective driven by his own personal needs to track down the killer on account of his own daughter's savage killer not being found years before.But when Judy (Elizabeth Trosper) one of the sexiest girls on the campus starts getting heavy breathing phone calls,it looks like she may become the next target if King can't find the killer in time.
The next day I looked for it on Amazon and couldn't find it.
I guess I'll be spending more time at noon in front of the TV the next weekends to watch this one.
But it's being revived, and I hope the next few seasons are as good as the last ones.
Some of the endings include the ending to Jurassic Bark, when a flashback shows that Fry's dog in the past had waited next to the pizza parlour for Fry to return for the rest of his life.
Little-remembered Claire Dodd predictably plays Jack's slithery fiancÃ©e Sophie, while character actress Helen Westley plays Minnie with her amusing gruffness intact (she was to reunite with Dunne the next year in James Whale's classic version of "Showboat").
In any event, history takes its course and Corregidor falls but not before some of the women, including Royce are flown out (in reality, American army nurses were captured by the Japanese and while they were spared the horrors of the Bataan Death March, they didn't exactly have a nice time for the next three years either).
At one minute it's a high tech space thriller, the next a grim survivalist tale, then social satire and finally a big, stupid shootout.
Here - I just wanted to rip my my own head off and feed to it to the smelly Golden retreiver next door - hoping that the furry menace would choke on my tortured eyeballs.
And your next question probably is: What the f..k!!!
"What city is next mentioned?"
But she ought to be careful in Vienna....' Who is speaking and what is the next line?"
This movie is one of the darker movies of the series, hearkening back to Mewtwo Strikes Back and setting the tone for the next series, Battle Frontier, and would be a good watch even for someone who doesn't like Poke'mon or anime'.
The next paragraph is a quote from the film.
Better luck to the actors and producers next time.
John protested until Yates agreed he could form a production company and own a piece of Wake of The Red Witch,his next outing.
They have ridiculously overdone battle scene's and the rest of the film seems like it is on auto drive until they get to the next action scene.
Joanna Going just happened to sit next to me in the balcony of the Paramount Theater at STILL BREATHING's world premiere in Austin during SXSW a few years ago.
The nudity is tasteful and at one time, you are more interested in what is happening next and not what is in front of you.
The dialogue is lightning paced and flows quickly from one character to the next without a break in between.
This all happens while Hildy interviews Earl Williams, a man due to be hung the next day... and then hides him in a roll-top desk in the courthouse press room when he escapes during a psychiatric evaluation.
Which is quality, I might add, and the next two were exactly the same.
The first part of the plot is pretty common (a guy being set up for his girlfriend's murder) but the next is typical Crow-Corvis(Mabius) comes back from the dead to revenge both deaths.
Remember the first movie where each villain was clearly distinct from the next?
We looked forward, each evening, to the next episode.
No sooner had they cleared up the suspense from the last episode than something would happen and they would break off- telling you tune in for the next episode.
Each episode is as long winded and wordy as the next, until something may just happen only for it to be a classic and clichÃ©d horror blunder trick.
Sure I like a talky as much as the next guy maybe even more than the next guy, but excessive dialog simply doesn't usually work well in a thriller.
They'll be cute and bouncy for one moment, then murderous and psychotic the next.
I can't wait for the next flic.
Cam'ron seems to be the next Rudy Ray Moore.
Without providing spoilers, the plot seems straightforward but certainly can have you reconsidering what you think has happened or might happen next.
Richard Dreyfuss is perfect as the smart kid, ready to drive off to college the next morning, but wondering if he's doing the right thing.
The next character is Steve whose Curt's best friend and happens to be dating Laurie and wants to rush things as quickly as possible.
Weingartner's next project will have to make up for this mess.
Or somewhat - the next superstar model casting shows.
I can't remember the last time that I genuinely couldn't wait to see the next episode of a programme.
By the conlcusion of this story there seem to only be bodies left over as lifeless as they were wandering the slums for their next high.
I had a similar trauma by the time I was in the sixth grade, and there were no "wise-cracking" kids, "wacky next door neighbors," nor any talking dogs there to help.
Perhaps the next sequel will be better.
Even though film is picks up well from beginning and doesn't allow spectaculars to move from the seat, after some time you can easily predict what will happen next.
From there, we are shown snapshot glimpses of his early childhood (I use this next term very loosely) "development."
I just sat there waiting for the next one to die and other than being mildly curious about what kind of morbid way they would be offed, I was far from being on the edge of my seat.
Want a film to remake for the next century?
I thought that I would know what happened next and for the most part I was right.
Pacino delivers an unusual performance as a socially and sexually awkward cop who meets a murder suspect (Ellen Barkin) and falls for her, only to realize she may be targeting him next.
In next to no time, Keller is in too deep Â he finds himself falling in love with a suspect, playing a dangerous game with his own life, so obsessed with the thought that he may have found love after his marital failure that he cannot face the possibility his new lover might be the very murderer he is out to catchÂ.
Never seems to know where it's going next, as if they decided on each next scene as they were making the film.
Which will leave you wanting more and anticipating the next episode.
What's next, some idiot with a video camera doing a prequel to Audition?
In my opinion 'To Hell and Back' is one of the best war movie ever made, (right next to 'Saving Private Ryan') because it was about a true story of a kid from Texas with a run-a-way Father and a dead Mother, wanted to do something for the war effort but was turned down by every other service except the Army, and the Army had second thoughts.
The emotions of the two are clear but watching them to see what happens next is the best part.
I don't really know when will be released in my city Che Part Two (Guerrilla), I hope it will in theaters next Friday and if so I will, certainly, be there.
Unless you heard the real Che Guevara speak at the United Nations, this is probably the next best thing.
While this was probably Corbucci's most finely crafted film to date, his next Â The Great Silence Â was to be his masterpiece.
A cool political western the theme of which was continued in Sergio Corbucci's next film Companeros (another very good 'Spaghetti Western').
Howard Vernon provides a further link with the EYES WITHOUT A FACE prototype Â since he played the title role in Jess Franco's THE AWFUL DR. ORLOFF (1961), a character to which actor and director would often return (the last time in FACELESS [1988], a viewing of which followed the next day).
Another FMV is the awesome Dollet clip, terrific graphics of machines and Squall's escape: it's one of my favorite scenes next to the dance clip!
10/10 GREATEST GAME I've ever seen, next to Final Fantasy X and VII, although I think FFXI will be just as awesome!
It would spawn two so so sequels in the next two years, inspire an imitation, get a TV series make over and was remade in 2005 with Billy Bob Thornton taking on the role of Buttermaker.
Nothing was done about it, and on the next pitch the batter took one to the helmet.
Framing same-sex marriage as the next great civil rights challenge, Saving Marriage navigates the long, complicated political and legislative process with a human context, giving a face to a topic that is often eschewed as empty political rhetoric.
I was amazed how my friend talked about it for days after and may even accompany me to the next fund raiser event.
However, it stands up very well next to other noirs of that era.
In Kansas City, the criminals Peter Harris (Jack Elam), Boyd Kane (Neville Brand) and Tony Romano (Lee Van Cleef) are individually hired by a stranger (Preston Foster) that plots the robbery of an armored car after receiving the money from a bank in the next door of a flower shop.
John Payne is a ex-con who drives a florist truck and one of his usual stops is a delivery next door to a bank.
His trouble is that you can set a clock by his punctual rounds, and that one of his deliveries coincides with the arrival of the armored car at the bank next door.
Sam's next film should be out soon: Global Metal.
If you were fascinated by the "Banned from Television" series or more circulated material like the Real TV show and all the "see it to believe it" programs on the tube, then Traces of Death is the obvious next step.
The next fascinating thing is that Dr. Gillespie goes to watch a rare operation done by a brilliant black doctor (Jack Carr).
Having just watched The Bronze Buckaroo, I picked the next film on the "Black Westerns" disc of the DVD set "Black Entertainment in Film" which happened to be Harlem Rides the Range.
I tuned in to "Sneakers" last night without realizing that I had seen it before, and kept wondering for a while why I knew what was coming next.
"Sneakers" has enough twists and turns to keep the viewer guessing where it will go next.
He is injured badly, and while wrapped in facial bandages in hospital he makes the decision not to notify next of kin and drop out of his young wife's life because he feels he could never be the same man again, at least to her.
One minute Bob is chastising Grace for being exploitive and the next he is going hog wild in the staging of a burning village.
The whole time while watching this I found that I couldn't predict the next thing and I like that in a movie.
They change clothes so that the Prince can go and get his dog from the kennel for their next game, but he's caught by the cruel guards who think he's the pauper.
He was well past his youthful days as a romantic idol and it's sad to think he would be dead next year because any number of parts would have opened up for him.
With no land for the next 1200 miles, Powers must remain in control, even with death knocking at every door.
Well, you can guess what happens next.
You can tell a movie franchise is in trouble when it starts killing off its main characters and that's what happens here when Ronny Cox is shot (Foley's foul-mouthed boss, Inspector Todd, would be killed off in the next movie).
I love their discreet but firm way of glamorizing Lois LaneÂshe's not your everyday average girl next door Â.
After robbing a bank, robot number five's next task is a big one: take the $50,000,000 worth of jewels on display at the "House Of Jewels."
And in the next frame it gets dumber.
I am keeping my eye on the people involved in this very enjoyable movie to see what will come next.
The script is OK but there are far too many plot holes (for instance, Dee tells Stockwell she can't stay the weekend...in the very next scene she's saying she is!).
Unfortunately, this movie is seldom shown, so make sure to grab a video tape the next time it is shown.
This simple, sensitively handled love story with a WWII background is often bundled together with Mikhail Kalatozov's THE CRANES ARE FLYING (1957) - they were both issued simultaneously on R1 DVD by Criterion and will likewise be issued on R2 by Nouveaux Pictures next January - but actually they are poles apart in terms of stylistic approach.
The Bad:  * some cheesy special effects (by today's standards)  ---> ...and reuse of the same special effects  ---> why was Count Iblis' crash site off-color in one moment, and clear blue the next?
Shields reaction is perfect, she is angered that he still thinks of her as a child, but cannot help but play with the doll in the very next scene.
This was the next to the last episode of the series, by the way.
There were Skippy, Malory and Michael Gross probably the funniest next to Michael J.
In later years some nice additions were Scott Valentine as Bateman's weirdo boyfriend, and making numerous appearances over the years was Marc Price as the nerdy next door neighbor, Skippy.
The movie simply rambles aimlessly from one episode to the next, shamelessly invoking deus ex machina when needed.
Freddy Highmar (as August) has a winning screen presence and an infectious smile, but I am not sure his acting ability is beyond that of the charming kid next door.
Surprisingly, the next scene shows us the newspaper being printed with details of Lady Snowblood's quest.
They agree to meet somewhere the next day but her parents whisk her back to where she came from, and the two don't connect.
One moment Henry is throwing the suit & tie clad Young Republican into the pool; the next moment he's bonding with him and hiring him a hooker when he learns he's still a virgin.
activist; we next see him a sensitive best friend of an AIDS-stricken woman.
Next he's telling her that he also had sex with her boyfriend that gave her AIDS; we next see him caring about Henry, whom he had vowed to "out".
Better luck next time.
When the next husband dies, she is left a pauper.
The plot is broken up into chapters and moves episodically, mostly just going from murder to the next.
I checked it out from the library and over the next week I probably watched it half a dozen times!
The cinematography and locations are breathtaking enough to make me want to jump on the next plane and fly over the Bermuda Triangle in an attempt to transport myself to Austen's 19th century rural England.
The next time this film is on IFC, sit your keester down, give it five, and you will see what a keen flicker it really is.
too funny - don't pass this one by when it shows up next time!
What to do next?
He just killing them and moving right on to next victim.
I recommend missing it the next time.
If the first movie went with the first game's plot then I hope that he uses the plot involving the grown up Alessa from this game for the next movie.
One may think they should sell it in pet-stores -- maybe next to the DREADED CANNIBAL GERBIL-HAMSTER WHATEVERS!
May I point out this arm is about as skinny as two fingers next to each other, and only about a foot and a half long.
At times it was very apparent they were "thinking" about what they had to say next, before finally spitting out their uninspired dialogue.
I attended the first three hours the next night and the final three hours the following evening.
It is one of those series where one is longing for the next episode, I found myself pondering about the film, the characters all day.
I saw it as part of the Vancouver International Film Fest, and it's played at Toronto already, and will be at Berlin and Sundance next year.
If you missed this picture, view it the next time it is shown on TV!
Julie sees an improvement when "the healer" selects Nick as his next project to help and asks her to follow him as he goes through the countryside seeing people.
Which bring me to my next learning point, if you are planning to sail to a place called 'The island of Storms', don't do it in a straw boat.
Dumpling - 7 out of 10 - Id never heard of Fruit Chan before I saw this film and now I'm interested to see what else he has done and I'm excited to see what he'll do next.
The next instalment of the three is 'Cut' directed by Chan-Wook Park (famous for his Vengeance Trilogy) and stars Byung-hun Lee and Won-hie Lim.
The next Dirty Harry "Sudden Impact" restored considerable tenacity to the franchise and still gave the leading lady something important to do.
A well made and entertaining film, `The Enforcer' keeps the `Dirty Harry' series alive, well and on solid ground; in retrospect, it seems a shame now that Eastwood waited seven years to make the next installment, `Sudden Impact,' as with the dreadful `The Dead Pool' in 1988, it all ended with barely a whimper.
The minute they walk into the office the patient from the next room lets out a scream and Lou is up and leaving.
The next 5 minutes inside the office are amazing.
Can't wait for the next one.
He comes from a broken home - his mother died when he was young, and his father married a much younger woman - and has next to no emotional connection with his long-suffering girlfriend, Sera, who leaves him because he just won't talk to her.
Then the scene continues, and we all knows what happens next.
You can't tell what happens next, especially not in the last act.
Late on Halloween eve, they stop by a sleazy gas station and next to it is "The Museum Of Monsters And Madmen", owned by Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig).
What happens next?
The one fault i'd say is that the passage of time is not particularly well expressed particularly right at the end of the film when what seems to be a present day Ewan is wearing the exact same outfit as in the next scene which must be set sometime after.
Not because Herbert had any love for Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union but believed, unrealistically, that Communisum was the only way that those hundreds of millions exploited by the big corporations can get their share of the wealth that they provided for them with their hard and back-breaking labor which they got paid next to nothing for.
I'm unsure of the implication the poster was trying to make, but I venture to say that if Biberman and Sondergaard (who were married for 40 years, until Biberman's death in 1971) had been allowed to work for the next 20 years or so, who knows what might have happened to their careers?
The next day, Sergio goes hunting, Liliana goes into town get some groceries and Paola decides to stay behind to sunbathe (topless, of course).
One girl deadpans the tale of The Legend Of Hellgate, which is apparently the next town over.
It is the type of ending that has you literally hiding behind a cushion one minute, then jumping up and cheering the next.
Imagine Chris' surprise when she shows up on the slab in class the next day.
You don't ever desire them, let alone like them or care about what happens next.
I really enjoyed this movie because Kathleen Turner and John Waters just let loose with the demented psychotic energy of a parent who takes many legitimate parental urges to the next level - or maybe the next 5 levels.
Kathleen Turner, alternating between dizzy, unquestioning devotion to her family and clinically cool, yet psychotic anger to offending neighbours, either appears to possess a martyr's yellow halo above her head, denoting divine lightness and freshness, or a focussed smile as she carefully contemplates her next victim.
For Pete's sake, hire a mimic next time you dub an actor as well-known as Reno.
It kept me all the time guessing what came next and there were many puzzles to solve.
mayhap I will record it when next I find it playing.
The next morning Joe is accused by Jennifer of raping and abusing her and is later indited by a grand jury to stand trial.
On he stand Joe comes across so truthful and straightforward about the events that happened that evening with Jeniffer that Abe reviles her name, a possible rape victim, in public at a news conference the next day.The trial of Joe Campball is a forgone conclusion with him being found innocent,a verdict announced by a pretty and admiring young woman who's the jury forewoman, and admittedly set free.
Everyone in the courtroom, with the exception of Jennifer and her lawyer, feels that justice was done but the person who you would think, next to Joe, would have felt most happy about the verdict didn't.
In the opening scenes we find out that the President and Speaker of the house have both been killed, and the Vice President has been an invalid for awhile, so the next person in line is James Earl Jones' character - he believes that he has been given his position as a token gesture.
The next was a disappointment for me.
Robinson, in particular, makes the most of a meaty role that has him cocky and confident one moment, then bruised and bitter the next as his past crimes catch up with him--and his conscience.
The show uses gross out humour which is probably the only show of it's kind now next to ren and stimpy.
I think I'll watch The Last Dragon next...  Rap, Hip-Hop, whatever you want to call it, this is a great piece for the culture in general and probably an awful amount of fun for those that were there to make it.
Yet any meager student of this era knows that the likes of Sedgewick Bell, the boy who cheats to gain favor, would have fit in just fine next to tyrants such as Augustus and Julius Caesar, who used Machiavellian cunning and force, not honor, to make their mark in history.
I recently sat next to such a family when the film played in March 2003 at the Grand Action cinÃ©ma in Paris.
If the women are rarely more than eye candy, the men are compelled to wrestle with the various technological & situational challenges that the storyline tosses at them--which they do less well than my friends & I did in first grade when we played in our backyards & argued about what was supposed to happen next.
Dull, cheap, and thoroughly boring, the only time this film attempts to wink at the audience is in the hopes that you'll come back for the Asylum's next feature.
That mostly revolves around the so-called "King" of this Lost World, who I assume is the giant gorilla whom we see next to nothing of for a long time.
The next morning it is a wide open, six inch long gash on the front of her lower leg.
For the next half a day in the movie the girl is deathly ill.
The next thing you know she's up and running as if nothing ever happened and no further discussion or observation of her wound is necessary.
She would also appear the next year in another film--"The Naked Jungle"--featuring man-eating ants.
Director John Sturges would go on to make three more classic Westerns over the next seven years ("Gunfight at the O.K.
But here, he marries his potential sweetheart off to his rival and goes on his merry way to his next adventure.
The climactic tightrope walk is a bit of a letdown next to the earlier, funnier bits (like the opening funhouse chase), but that is a small detraction.
His next escape attempt leads him into a magician's act in which he finds himself, to wild applause, frantically trying to stuff various small animals -- doves, ducks, piglets -- back into top hats on a table but finds himself swimming in the little beasts.
It's kind of sad that Chaplin didn't really mention this film at all because I believe it is his finest film next to The Gold Rush.
When a man (Hopkins) kills his wife it seems like a slam-dunk case for the ambitious prosecutor (Ryan Gosling), whose mind is already set on his next lucrative lawyer job.
We next meet Willy Beachum, played by Ryan Gosling, who is with the district attorney's office.
Ryan still looks like the 'kid next door' type.
Hopkins and Gosling take it to the next level with great lead performances.
I am not a big anime fan..I watched a lot, but none of them made me impressed like this.I'm really congratulating the writer..I watched all episodes ( including special ova episode ) in 1 days without moving..In next 3 days, I watched two times again..
I mean, come on..  Then there's the moronic Kohta who does little more than act as bland as he can before the onset of his next little flashback to yet another oh-so-cleverly concocted plot device - Lucy killing his father and sister when he was a child.
After that we can see how cute Lucy is, and she's crying, and next we see Nana as she going home, but in the same time Lucy has to face with the enemy.
Maybe next time my roommates refuse to do the dishes I'll make them watch a few minutes of this movie.
There is next to no dialogue in this film, no sex and rarely any decent violence.
Sullivan's next series was 'Only Fools & Horses'.
Well how should I describe this movie... the very first scene of the movie itself sets the background of the movie and tells about the masterpiece we are going to witness in the next 155 minutes....... Have you heard the song "doli me Bithay Ke Kanhar..."......?
It's a hybrid film that you'd never see this in a cineplex next to the big-bang sci-fi action fare, but then most probably wouldn't want to.
I hope they fix all the technical problems for the obvious sequel and get some well spoken actors next time.
Be still my aching ribsÂ It's a reworking of Fellini's near career killing early flop The White Sheik, even including a Felliniesque lineup of hookers at a bus stop in one scene, only without Fellini's restraint (yes, you did read that right), with Wilder's unemployed baker heading for Hollywood to enter a screen test to find the next Valentino while his young wife seeks out the real thing.
This production was built around the search for the next Rudolph Valentino.
Upon learning of a contest held by Rainbow Studios (NOT the #1 studio) to find the next Rudolph Valentino, Rudy Hickman just "knows" this is his ticket to a better life.
So I watched the movie again, the very next day.
next...
Okay, so the day the first High School Musical came out I watched a documentary on PBS instead, so I had no idea what horrors were going on at Disney Channel until the next day at school.
I have no doubt that over the next decade or so, people will want to revisit it and examine the politics and the cultures; it should be studied in classrooms, it should be valued.
I don't know if the editors were blind or what, but whoever was in charge of splicing the stock footage together didn't seem to mind that the women were mongoloid one minute, negroid the next, and caucasoid the next.
Repentful the next day, he listens again to Irene's idea and becomes enthusiastic when he sees Eric's formula first hand and they start a business that brings them all fortune within a few years.
Overall this is a great film, so get tickets and go see it, but a message to all the crew from After the Sunset - next time miss out most of the sex and nudity!
Maybe he isn't ready for the next Bond role.
Max (Pierce Brosnan) knows he can easily clip Napoleon III and make Lloyd look like a jerk againÂ For him, it's more about the challenge and the alibiÂthat's his work of artÂ But he affirms that the two are a couple of retirees trying to enjoy the island lifeÂ   The gorgeous Lola (Salma Hayek) knows that, with Max, they went out at the top of their game, undefeatedÂ They were great togetherÂ But, now, she feels it is the best time to quitÂ For her, now, the challenge is to find joy in simple things, as a life filled with sunsetsÂ   Lloyd was chasing Max for seven yearsÂever since the first Napoleon Diamond went missingÂ That day, he got to the scene, and took a few shots at the getaway carÂ Next day, a bottle of champagne arrives at FBI Headquarters with a note saying, "Aim for the tires next time."
The trip changes her life (of course) which we get to follow for the next 40 years.
hell, why not take on the army in a biplane next.
I was very disappointed with this attempt, and would admonish Disney to do better next time!
The next step in this witches' brew of a film is assembling the most familliar and tired screenwriting cliches, grinding them, stirring them to a boil, and then pouring them out onto the screen.
At one point, the film effortlessly demonstrates how immigrants were drafted right off the boats as they had a suitcase from a foreign country one moment, and an American Uniform the next practically unable to speak the English language, yet ready to wage war against an unknown enemy.
The next scene is in the hallway Giselle is screaming at Nene ,"You fag, you fag".
You never know what's coming next.
I sure hope the next one is good, otherwise I'll never get hard for Parker Posey again.
As a logical next step comes "For Your Consideration," a classical-narrative comedy about Oscar hype and Hollywood buzz.
I would say that I'm very forgiving and will be there opening weekend for Guest and company's next movie.
I walked in "For Your Consideration" with a broad grin, eagerly anticipating the next ingenious Christopher Guest film.
I certainly hope with his next one he's back to form.
My hope for the next Guest film is that it continues to stretch the troupe in the way that these last two films have done.
This was not 'Another Country' and neither was it a wish fulfillment fantasy about finding the ideal boy next door.
I hope to rent this movie abroad and I also look forward to his next film about a lesbian love.
At the beginning they explain what will happen next.
At one scene the characters are doing their job for whomever at the next they are doing something else.
One minute she's in and the next she drops the pill and out she goes.
If you were wondering what happens next after Terms ended, the answer is that the characters continued living.
There's also the loyal housekeeper Rosie (Marion Ross), who despite always being on her duties and quick to have a sarcastic comeback, is falling in love with the next door neighbor Arthur (Ben Johnson- in his last screen performance).
Juliette Lewis takes the role of Melanie and in my opinion, I thought she played the best character next to Aurora because we have to remember that Melanie is the only child that has never really known her mother so you can automatically feel the pain of the character.
I liked that it has the same type of features that Tarzan of the past has had, but with a new look to head into the next generation.
The stop-motion process is complex: fragile puppets ranging from 6.3 to 11 inches high are shot on a miniature set one frame at a time, with animators adjusting each puppet slightly before the next shot.
Enter Michael who says little and provides next to nothing as far as support except for some hippie rambling about "driving the devil out of your house".
So then Michael shows up the next morning, and the three friends work through the trauma.
The boyfriend goes for a walk the next day and runs into the two dummys bickering amongst themselves and he goes after them with a small tomahawk but no blood is shed and the rednecks run off and everybody lives happily ever after.
The next day, Michael arrives.
What follows next looks like a cigarette ad from Playboy Magazine circa 1973 come to life, with Hooten and Baumann wandering through the woods, climbing a steep gravel slope, encountering a bear, getting into a blueberry fight and generally bringing the film to a grinding halt (and it was only in first gear to begin with).
The next morning Englund finally shows up, gives Baumann a little therapeutic pep talk (in which she actually displays more acting chops than she was generally credited with having).
For nearly a full hour, the camera simply follows them walking up mountain paths, climbing down rocks and sleeping next to a lake!
In fact, they ought to have him host the Oscars next year; he would probably be better than Jon Stewart.
Morricone wasn't too happy in advance that he received this Honorary Award, claiming that it would look like as if his career was over already but nevertheless he seemed emotional and touched by this honor when he stood on the stage, next to his friend and interpretor Clint Eastwood, since Morricone himself (still) doesn't speak a word English.
), Guillaume Gallienne of the "ComÃ©die FranÃ§aise" (from 'Monsieur Ibrahim' which won a prize at the Mostra de Venezia with Omar Sharif and introducing Pierre Boulanger...), a small but very funny part for Gilles Lellouche's girl MÃ©lanie Doutey as a girl who only sees half of things, a funny part for Lellouche himself as one of the bounty hunters/ice-skaters twins next to LÃ©a Drucker (who has played in each of Aurouet & Lellouche's two short-films...), FranÃ§ois BerlÃ©and is good in this kind of cynical roles as always, Jean-Pierre Cassel (yep, Vincent and CÃ©cile's father...) is coming back stronger than ever with both this movie and the great but under-rated "Virgil" in which he was even better...etc...  Oh and don't blink to catch Guillaume Canet's 6 years wife at the time (they're not together anymore) make a small kind of cameo appearance as a nightclubber at some point in the movie...LOL  Just go see it!
Please do rent this comedy classic for the next decade.
Whenever a character develops in an episode, all the progress is forgotten once you get to the next one.
But seems to develop amnesia as she returns to her usual whiny-self in the next episode.
(I expect that her agent will be getting more than a few calls over the next few weeks).
Sun thanks Jin for getting her water, and he replies "That's what husbands do," although up til then, we hadn't seen Jin as a particularly desirable husband, and the next episode, "House of the Rising Sun", gives a closer look at Sun's perspective of how he has been on and off the island.
Told in three parts, TAXIDERMIA is about the last three generations of Balatony males, a trio of men each weirder than the next.
Guess what happens next?
The next scene shows the graphic depiction of the butchering of a pig.
The next morning, the fat woman's husband enters the peasant's shed and blasts his head off with one clean shot to the head.
Lynn manages to gain access to the baddies HQ and guided by Sue who runs all the techie stuff manages to kill the Chairman - one neat trick is too flood the building security systems with music - in this case The Carpenters Close to Me - so you end up with a kick ass Kung-Fu fight sequence set to Burt Bacharach.....which you don't see too often.... A local maverick cop(Hong at Hong - Karen Wong) is soon on their trail - things become complicated when the next hit they undertake turns into a set-up and soon the two sisters are fighting for their lives while trying not get arrested.
At the end of each part the connection to the next is worked out, and it all makes sense, in a twisted way.Each of the parts is a barrel of laughs, dark and grim in its own.
The child grows up and ends up being a champion of speed-eating, he marries a woman (wich is also fat) and thus the next generation is born.
It makes you want to turn to the person next to you, and just take care of them.
I expected it was an attempt by photographer David La Chapelle to associate his name with (and commercialize) the next big dance craze, grab some cross-racial street credibility, and introduce a new fad to push product.
Harold Lloyd ranks as one of the three greatest silent comedians next to Chaplin and Keaton.
It actually kept me watching to see if the next ninjas death was funnier than the last.
The improved method was achieved by the use of testing out the material to be filmed and timing the laughs; as the one knock on the previous Paramount product was that one laugh would drown out the set up for the next.
That's why some of the gags seem a bit laboured as there is often a calculated pause for the audience laughter, so that the next gag won't be missed.
What happens next is just too exciting to reveal, but the film has one of the most interesting and lurid conclusions I have seen in a long time.
I simply cannot wait to see what he offers us next.
The doll travels from one owner to the next, seducing men and women and luring them to weird and catastrophic actions.
The great thing, I remember, about watching Charlies' Angel (2007) as a 7 year old, was that when you came out of the movie (and for the next few days)Âyou felt you were Qi Shu !
I'll try not to do spoilers, but if you haven't seen the movie and don't want to know what happens, I strongly suggest you skip this next paragraph.
The lives they live could be the ones from my neighbours next door, if you know what I mean.
As much as I wanted this film to be the next Dark Knight, there was an obvious plot hole that was impossible to overlook.
So, what's worse than a romantic comedy with next to no compelling or memorable performances?
Martin Scorsese once famously said he does one movie for the studio and one for himself, and so do many other directors or actors (George Clooney admits he did Ocean's Thirteen because that way he could do Michael Clayton next).
The next day something does.
They are down to their last nickel and wondering where their next meal is coming from.
He is next on the list for the long sleep.
Boone and Dunne return to their office to wait for the next fool to walk in.
A man is seated in the back quietly, when a soldier sits down next to him.
For what must represent at least an hour or two of traveling the soldier is just jabbering away, while the man next to him is...well trapped, hoping this clown will just move away, leave the bus, or shut up.
And trust me the third one is going to be bad the first one was not bad, the third one was bad and I truly hope the next one isn't worse than this one.
Goal 2 follows Santiago Munez through the next phase of his soccer career and all the same characters are back.
I really hope that Santiago's half brother plot will be important in the next "Goal"!
It's like a carefully put together car crash, you wince, you can't stop looking, and you can't get it out of your head the next day.
a piece of advice, guys: next time you make a bunch of money puppeteering kids shows, don't make another lame attempt to impress babes.
Since it doesn't, the next best thing is to watch this very entertaining movie.
Good luck with your next project, Jim, although I'm not expecting one.
The experienced Ann-Margret has the biggest, if not the only laughs in the movie, drinking without stopping for a second, and living next to his son Washburn (Jimmy Fallon).
Queen Latifah, a charismatic performer, is handicapped having to act next to an inane actor that ruins some of her best moments in the movie.
Yet, despite this, by the time they do the next episode, they once again begin this same process!
The story is that the Pre-Cogs have named his as the next person to commit a murder, and in four days he'll murder a man he doesn't even know.
It is only as the film progresses and the hero is forced into the underbelly of city life that this idea of entrapment continues to the next level.
His next two films were improvements (there was nowhere to go but up): the first anonymous but not bad ("Amistad"), the second bad but not anonymous ("Saving Private Ryan"), but they were both pompous gestures which appear to have been designed to win still more awards; and it wasn't until eight years after "Schindler's List" that the skilled director of old times re-appeared (with "A.I."
Then he discovers the next murder they have to stop will be committed by himself.
At times this documentary was disturbing, talking about pogroms and mass slaughter; then, in the next scene, the topic will switch to Monty Python.
jerusalem resident: "No thank you, we're doing just dandy actually, perhaps you would like to save the next city?"
The film lover next to me fell asleep!
I kept waiting for the dialogue, acting, scenery, whatever, to create my next feeling or thought and then I realized that I was doing so on my own.
On the whole, Possessed is a very entertaining film that left me wanting to know what would happen next.
I can't wait to see what these guys will make next each one of their productions they seem to raise the bar.
I can not wait to see their next film... hopefully they will have another movie out within the next year!
One of them even had the nerve to compliment the stunt team and say he can't wait to see what they do next - wow!
Who's going to write the next rave reviews, the director or producer, or is it going to be left to the caterer staff and grip departments to save the day.
Dietrich is at her best as she charms her two beaus, the score is charming, and Rene Clair brings the same light touch he showed the next year in I Married a Witch.
Though it's obvious that they love each other still...this movie still keeps you still on your seat...wondering what might happen next or what crazy little subjects Ben and Katie might fight over again and again!
Williamson would return to the Dakota character in a few more films, the next one being "Down N Dirty"   Eye Candy: Nina Richardson shows some T&A; Mary Kapper goes topless   My Grade: D   Where I saw it: Showtime Extreme
And her portrayal is the single memorable thing left in my mind the next day.
Bravo to picture me rolling productions and the best wishes to Tim Folsome - I can't wait to see your next movie.
I'd like to see what he does on his next film.
"The Love Guru" may have hit an all-time low in this regard....until another film worse comes out next month.
While I enjoy a good low-brow laughfest like the next guy, I still would rather have a somewhat decently constructed story, something this tale lacks completely.
One minute Pitka is being hailed as a spiritual healer who lives to help people and the next minute he's insulting a midget for no particular reason.
The next most common is the Guru's constant repeating of "TM" after one of his catchphrases.
The first time you watch Little Britain, you will be laughing so hard and will keep on laughing for the next half hour.
It definitely ranks up there next to Crouching Tiger and Hero.
I can't wait until I get to see the next movie with this director, these actors or actually anything with anyone involved in the making of if this movie.
Nicholson should do a Tim Burton or James L. Brooks film next because he has done way better with them than anybody else.
so did the couple next to us and the guys behind us.
If this is some of Jack Nicholson rubbing of on Sandler I look forward to Sandler's next movie.
There's something else about Kilpatrick - did you notice that after every one of his bloody encounters (that first one with Schoolboy was the worst), he appears in the next scene with a clean set of duds.
It has some offensive, adult-oriented material, but if caught on television, this is nearly perfect family entertainment: as long as you don't mind your kids talking from their a$$es for the next couple months.
Did anyone not laugh when he was `testing' the food at Ron Kamp's I'm-the-richest-man-in-the-universe party and stuck his tongue out at that poor guy next to him?
And, let's face it, those conditions were pretty ugly, resulting in a pretty ugly setting from one scene to the next, never much of an audience incentive.
Steele next to Chaney is the one to watch.
Just a warning to readers who want to see this movie and want nothing given away: this next bit forcibly reveals a few non-critical plot elements.
But there's a downside - see the next point.
Jafar then makes his next move with Abis Mal by capturing the Sultan and Carpet and trying to kill Al but sparing his life.
The next day, Aladdin and the Sultan depart to have a discussion at a place suggested by Iago.
I can picture men turning to the person next to them and saying, "We don't act like that, do we?"
Those wacky Weinstien brothers - when they're not frequenting bars looking for the next Quintin Tarantino or Kevin Smith, they're buying Oscars (I'll never forgive them for robbing Saving Private Ryan of Best Picture).
The money spent making this film would have been better spent on the catering budget on the next Scream film.
Hopefully the next generation sees this for the crap it is.
all it was was a bunch of guns blasting all over the place, and ppl yelling out the f-word and ranting and raving about who to go kill next... and a gay transvestite cop, who was also an idiot (dafoe).
The script wanders aimlessly from one incident to the next without any real plot development.
I think that director Troy Duffy should really consider the script for his next work and ditch the cinematic pitfalls that plague this film.
Case in point - one moment the twins can knock off nine mobsters hanging from a rope upside down and the next they can't hit the broadside of a barn in the shootout with Il Duce.
As the film opens in Boston after St. Patrick's Day, Conner and Murphy get into a bar-room brawl with a couple of Russian toughs and said toughs are discovered the next morning in an alley in piles of their own blood and guts.
The opening moments don't prepare you for what comes up next and even though the action (which there is quite a bit of and, as stated earlier, is extended in the unrated version) is quite bloody, there's a morbid sense of humor running throughout the carnage and I fell out laughing on more than one occasion during this picture.
The story by Fisher is so convincing, to everyone at the magazine, that it becomes the mag's next front-page story!
With the trouble comes a story that keeps the viewers' interests high for what comes next, but plot holes that accompany the story remain unexplained throughout.
Having watched this film recently has encouraged me to want to watch Mel Gibson's "The Passion of the Christ" when it comes to Singapore next month.
Despite a few other minor problems (the "interview" device used in the movie slowed the pace down a little and some of the dialogue was hard to understand), this has got to be one of the best shot-on-video movies out on the market today, next to SAVAGE HARVEST and SHATTER DEAD!
My favorite musical next to the Jolson Story.
And Jesse may be the next victim.
Also there's a murderer around and it seems Yolanda may be his next victim...If that sounds disjointed you should see the movie!
For example, the movie begins as Lewis enters a therapist's office and spends the next 75 minutes slipping on the floor and sliding off the vinyl furniture.
That's a shame because when you've seen that part you should see the all the next parts as well to get the big picture.
It did set up for the next outing, but it made it feel like a TV series....but it was 84 minutes long.
This serial is absolutely forgettable with absolutely nothing to keep the viewer in any suspense to watch the next week's chapter or the serial throughout.
but one which you basically forget about the next day.
The scene of Rocco and Kennedy going at it in bed while Steele sleeps next to them is a scorcher, and the best of the film.
The trailer promises an action-packed film, but the actual film is mostly talk, with about 3-4 fight scenes, all of which are spoiled by the disastrous editing (in one scene, a guy gets kicked in the face; in the next shot, he is holding his stomach!).
Watched about an hour of it and found it very hard to drag myself off to bed (had to work next day), so I video taped the remainder.
The plot is pretty predictable and all the other characters pale next to Crawford.
I hope not, as his been apart of a few greatly creative horror flicks and lets hope the next Re-animator film doesn't follow the same suit of his latest two.
well i just end up seeing this 3 part of the eye franchise.i start liking this pang brothers and i get some of theme earlier movies,the eye was really surprising me for the power of scaring you and after giving you chill-out feeling.but the eye 10 make me disappointed but be cause of the willing to get scared.it was making sense until it start turning to looks like scary movie ,so if you like parodies this is your movie and if you wanna scare your self try french HIGH TENSION.i hope so they will go back to were they start , with the next movie.but don't call it the eye don't know witch number.give it other name so don't make the first eye be refused by those who never seen it.i give 3 of 10 for the break dance and for the good looking girls.make me remind me of the 80'is.
Bring on the next one.What a great series of films.
next thing, the heroes swap goggles for sunglasses and throw flares... so they outsmart the gangsters, but, perhaps more importantly, they also LOOK way, way cooler - and that is the whole point!
Building on the events of the first film and following the dreadful video curse through to the next level, it is a very worthy successor to the original classic.
But, in any case, here we are with the replacement, 'Ring 2', which has caused producer Takashige Ichise to rethink his strategy concerning the next follow-up, and reunited most of the cast and crew from the original 'Ring'.
So, of course, there has to be a sequel (which, oddly enough, wasn't based on the next book in Koji's series; different filmmakers had already adapted that as Spiral).
It's very instructive that although he manages the first test--even offering his satiated wife breakfast in bed the next morning, it is sex in bed--with him (to reclaim ownership) must come first.
As a spoiler, I think it would have been a riot if, after what we see in the film, Walter ended up with the widow next door.
At night I like to watch films sitting on my sofa next to my lovely wife who crumbles into my arms and sleeps most of the time.
When a group of robbers come to town with the view of making the bank their next hit, they inadvertently kill Driscoll's son.
Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): After being identified by multiple witnesses during a blatant murder in a small town filled with vigilantes, the main characters return the next day to rob the bank.
Please, save the song for the credits next time.
Here's to the next effort in this sub-genre, may it be something deep and resonant... Ernest Dickerson, where are you when we need you!
And the next scene is that horrible sword slashing thing.
It is fast paced, it has good acting and it does have a plot you wanna follow from one episode to the next and you wanna know where these characters might end up.
In the beginning of the episode Caitlin breaks up with her boyfriend just to fall in love with a woman the next morning, who magically appears to be a Lesbian as well.
Even though the story is pretty bad, I still got interested in it and I was excited to see what happened next which is a testament to Corman's technical skill in handling material.
I hope Carlin will work harder to be funny the next time around.
Yes the show had it's up's, but very few, and none of them where worth repeating the next day.
Either George goes back to pot before his next stand-up or I shall have to take it up to tolerate his new very dark attempts at humor.
We watched 5 Killer Bee movies in one night and two the next!
Each sailor who survived had to wait just as long as the next man to reach land.
Of course, he photographed Citizen Kane in the next year, as well as Ford's Best Picture winning How Green Was My Valley and The Grapes of Wrath.
So, bee-careful next time should you ever go to a "Honey Festival" in the future.
And then the next season or so there was the two hour episode that introduced Magnum's and T.C.
The next best thing to hearing these stories yourself from the dreamkeeper would be to see this movie.
Creative use of modern film editing to bring the supernatural to realistic visions.The importance of passing on the ancient Native American stories from one generation to the next.
Better off next time, Elissa!
It was an eyeopener for me, and though it caused a lot of upheaval in the media the next day, it showed that times where changing and that people no longer let there lives be ruled by others but made choices for themselves.
But that's the point Lowenstein is making, he has deliberately structured this film in a way that mirrors the lives the characters led: directionless and stagnant, not planning or thinking of a future, but just staggering from one party, gig or shag to the next.
The thing is, at that age, and in that type of life you live without worrying about the next day because it's just too big a concern to deal with.
The fact that this director was given several movies to direct after this, each more offensive than the next, is disturbing.
So i guess in the next Dracula movie the new Vlad Tepes will gonna be an Asian...
LOL Well I hope the next Dracula movie will revive Vlad The Impaller somehow and regain some sense and fame.. and most of all i hope they will stop mocking Romania like that!
And then the actual story would get next to zilch screen time.
He had promised he'd throw his next documentary online, maybe he threw out this stuff because he didn't want to skimp out on the earning potential of an actual decent documentary he's making.
I couldn't guess what was going to happen next, I loved the story and all its twists and turns, and the ending didn't let me down.
Director Emmanuel Kervyn spends the first thirty minutes introducing us to his raft of absurdly unlikeable characters (none of whom really deserve to survive 'til the end credits), and the next sixty dismembering them in as many inventive and silly ways as possible.
It teaches love and does so without relying on the tension of plot because as I discovered, it still works after ten viewings when the end is not in doubt and "what happens next" isn't why your eyes are fixed on the screen.
But the way the film progresses from one brilliantly written scene to another, we can't wait to see what will transpire next, and we somehow end up caring so much for everyone in the film (even though they often don't care all that much for each other!)
Oh and it might pay to watch to the end...  PS I can't wait to see what these guys can do with the next film and some cash support behind them!
The quality of acting comes as a welcome surprise, and the story has the audience roaring with laughter one moment and close to tears the next.
I'm generally good at picking up on contrived plots and have spoiled more than one movie for my friends by guessing out loud what would happen next.
When it was over, I turned to the girl setting next to me, and we both agreed we wanted to see it again, right then and there!
The girl next to me said "Oh I love him" or similar comments every time the character Priestly came on.
Don't let the fact that most people have never heard of it keep you from picking it up during your next trip to the video store.
Robert Lord grabbed a well-earned Oscar for his original story, a fanciful but ingenious doomed lovers yarn that must have offered solace to Depression-era audiences whose miseries could only pale next to those of hard-luck leads William Powell and Kay Francis.
It was so overwhelming, I went back the very next midnight for another look.
Fate pushes Encolpius and Ascyltos from one adventure to the next.
Like reading Don Quixote, there are stories within the story and we lose our protagonists sometimes, but then they reappear to guide us to the next chapter within the art history book Fellini has created.
The next time i watched it my mind was clear, and it scared the s*it out of me.
Jeff, who had tickets to the game the next day stated forlornly "I'm going home to a funeral".
The game the next day was close but the Sox found themselves down by 3 entering the last at bat.
Our only real glimpse of BB's travels are on the tug boat and those are probably the highlight of the film, next to the uniqueness of the make-up and special effects.
By the time Swinton's character departs the film, we know next to nothing new about Benjamin other than that he has trouble sleeping and likes hot tea.
Even worldly sophisticates like George Plimpton or Wm F. Buckley like slapstick, sophomoric sex jokes and watching drunk frat-boys being jerks as much as the next guy.
This is dated in a lot of ways--the violence is extremely toned down, there's next to no blood (even when one man is shot at least 30 times!)
I bet that if it was an American film, every person in the United States would be saying that in everyday situations, next to "Hasta la Vista, baby" and "Yippie-ki-yay, motherf**ker".
The theatre troupe has a bad feeling about Sadako, as most of them have been experiencing the same disturbing dream about her, where they see her next to a well, and a certain air of doom has clouded the theatre since her arrival.
The training escalates as Buster begins roadwork the next day.....but he isn't up to training or fighting or any of this.
The next segment is probably the funniest, as it cuts to a "wilderness" scene--complete with a butler, tub, poster bed, and all the other modern conveniences (that's the way I'd like to camp!).
You'll have to tune in to see what happens next, as this only takes you through about half the film--watch it and enjoy.
While Mick discusses business with Ahmet Ertegum, Keith is in the next room nodding off in the arms of some groupie, who also nods off, leaving them in a tangled mess.
His next film was Key Largo where he played the luckless deputy sheriff killed by Edward G. Robinson.
A complete change from the norm, that served to make me actually think about not watching the next episode.
I was hopeful after the first episode as that was quite good although still a little overdone with that annoying cinema effect they used but then in the next few episodes, Rimmer left and they brought Kochanski into the show.
My current favourite episode is "Legion", although today is a Monday, so this choice is subject to change within the next 24 hours... !
Her interest is peaked when a handsome young Johnny (StÃ©phane Metzger) moves in next door and she fantasizes an affair with him.
Give it a go and, on this score, I can't wait to see what all you guys do next!
.... We next see the Aztecs following a hand-to-mouth existence in the marshes of the great lake, or 'Lake of the Moon'.
"Suddenly" stands next to greatness without touching it.
I spent the next hour wanting to bash someone's head in.
What about the sheer excess of stock footage, then (with the shark changing dimension and look from one scene to the next)?
The next shot is a live action shark under the water and it looks completely different than its animatronic counterpart.
look disgusting, their table manners are sickening enough to put you off of having dinner for the next couple of weeks.
A previous comment noted "A Touch of Zen" as a "minor masterpiece" next to its Japanese contemporaries, which is as ethnocentric as saying Asian films deserves such broad-sweeping generalization DESPITE their completely different context of cosmology, specific relations and development of individual and social structure, etc., even given the surface similarities of skin color, religious practice, select cultural affinity, and more.
The next two parts offer a very different experience each providing the story with politics, war tactics and a growing spiritual element of mystery through beautiful photography, great direction and awesome fight scenes.
Finally, the three races don't have equally interesting story-lines, and they have to be beaten in the preset order, so if you're stuck on a dull and/or hard mission with an uninspired one, there's really nothing to do, except to just do your best to get through it and hope for the next one to be more interesting.
Like the couple for instance one minute they fine, next minute they were boastful, and arrogant, in situations that didn't call for it.
This is great, I can't wait to see what happens next!
However, next to this movie Kurosawa made a breathtaking "Yoidore Tenshi", whose scene is also laid in late 1940's poor Japan.
It seemed to me that the closing device of the girl's making a date for the next Sunday works very well.
The travel from one level to the next by a system of huge elevators, and on this particular day a young girl named Luchino and her drug-addled friend happen to board this particular elevator & are treated to a stop at level 99 for the pick up of a couple prisoners, both of whom are highly dangerous.
This is a twisted, different world with no rules, and nothing leading you into guessing what could happen next.
Some documentaries, whether good or bad in their own right, consist of so many talking heads that you can listen to it from the next room and still follow the presentation.
The next day he tells his friend what he heard, in confidence, but doesn&#8217;t believe Jakob heard it on a German radio and believes Jakob has his own radio (Jew's were forbidden to own or listen to radio's, and rarely return from German office's,).
And the whole time you are left in suspense trying to figure out what is going next and what is going to happen to the main character Jakob with all the lying he does if either he was going to get caught or get away with it.
Mueller-Stahl plays the character with a quiet dignity, and next to Williams is the clear highlight of the movie.
By the next morning, literally everyone in the ghetto knows that Jakob Heym has a radio, and so he is venerated like a God and constantly hounded about what the newest news is, and thus enters the main conflict of the movie.
The film tries very hard to be a "Heathers" for the next generation, but it fails on every level humanly possible.
I'm going to marry my next woman from that beautiful country.
The next day, the boys go to see Anna as per her invitation, but first have to elude the angry chef.
He does it and films the attacks as his next movie.
It's impossible to see how he moves from one topic to the next or to watch him perform for even a minute without being swept up in his rap.
One of the best things I notice about his style is that you are never aware when he has moved on to the next joke.
This is something that the best speakers have, the ability to move from one topic to the next so that the listener is not aware of the transition.
the ending is a bit IFFY and OPEN ended i guess.... well thats the reason why i liked the movie....though i bet Sanjay leela Bhansali dint intend the movie to imply so.... Anyways I don't Think of Sanjay Leela Bhansali as a terrific Director though KHAMOSHI made me cry like hell....and moreover he was the one who hired ASH and Salman in his SUPERB film Hum dil De....WHo are both the WORST actors India has ever seen... anyways i hope Sanjay leela Bhasnsali gets a Original script and SOME Better actors to work on his next movie.... getting back to Saawariya... One thing that cant be denied is that this is a very important movie in the History of India... many Firsts in this movie....
I seen Saawariya the next day and it was very peaceful & relaxing.
A good advice for you SLB, don't spend 4 years on your next project, we love to see your movies and do experiment but keep the story-line strong.
At one point, he's a bumbling idiot, the next moment he's arguing a case in court and then he's back again to being the idiot.
No, next time it appears on television, I'll pass.
The monster also grows bigger and bigger from one generation to the next, so at the finale we get a house-sized giant spider going on GODZILLA rampage on a college campus and through the city.
Then he proceeds to spend the next hour recounting the youth's cliched life story in long-winded detail, playing up his hard knocks upbringing in gooey, unbelievable fashion.
But I found myself actually drawn into and interested in what would happen next.
When he arrives late for the first rehearsal of his next play, the director (real-life director Sydney Pollack plays this part) is brash and obnoxious--further pushing him to long for the good old days.
I like surreal humour as much as the next person, but I swear I could feel my brain cells dying off while viewing this waste of time.
OK, before watching this show, it is important that you are aware that the next 30 minutes is going to be full or randomness, silliness, and general surrealism.
Yes it was rough around the edges, the props were bad (that was the point) sometimes the timing was off, but you could forgive them anything for that next belly laugh.
The next eighty-seven minutes takes you on an unforgettable journey through the salvaged areas of New Orleans and the stores of heroism and shock concerning man's best friend.
Keeping the pot at a roiling boil are subplots including Alberto (Gustavo Salmeron), Yeye's gay "play husband" who is having an affair with a married bisexual, Alex (Javier Albala) and a mad infatuation with straight physique model, David (Liberto Rabal); Luis (Javier Manrique), a psychotic cop masquerading as a secret admirer of Maria's who has his own agenda involving Max, and Maria's own secret crush, Carlos (Juan Diego Botto), her cute student pal who lives right next door, and confides in her about his latest romantic involvements, clueless to how she really feels about him.
Daniels talks to this guy who in prison on a filthy bench for 15 plus minutes!What a waste of film and time.Is all the guy was talking about was I gotta stop taking drugs and get out of here.If I wanted to a conversation like that I'LL talk to MY next door neighbor.
Look, I love a good car chase as much as the next guy, but some types of human experience require more than machinery to chase down.
It's neither cathartic nor informative, but it does remind me of the thrill I used to get from that once ubiquitous adolescent prank ("See you next Tuesday") when it was pulled off to great effect.
You never know where it's going to come out of next, and the plot twist with the crewmembers' cat and LILY cat (the Companies' spy) is inspired.
And here's what I came away with from this movie: Stacy Valentine isn't the girl next door.
Or at least she isn't the girl next door as we like to imagine the girl next door to be like.
The football (complete with stock footage of England's National Team in action) and essence of the atmosphere stay true to the intended settings' accuracy and makes for a great opportunity to play off the characters via their differing interest in the British National Sport ensuring that the characters brim with a level of anticipation of each others' next direction that mirrors the results of the team they barrack for, the 3 Lions of England.
As such, it may not come off as surprising that he chose for his next story to look back upon his rough past, which partly consisted of humiliating treatment from managers, lousy payment, and less than average living conditions.
The star is given yet another memorable introduction - being signaled by his daughter of the presence of the law, representing their creditors, on his way to the train which is to take them to the next town; here, again, we have a daughter who is willing to forgive her rascally father his every whim and foible.
As our story begins this troupe is fleeing a town one step ahead of the sheriff, and heading for their next engagement in the village of Bellefontaine, where prospects don't look much better.
Ayesha Dharker gives a charismatic and spellbinding performer as Asha who believes inside that she is special but needs just a jolt of external validation to really take things to the next level.
My overly-optimistic prediction is "Outsourced" will be the next "Big Fat Greek Wedding"...if Hollywood manages to look past the lack of a big-name actor.
Your next call with an Indian call center won't be the same.
He stands proudly next to Christopher Reeve!
The guy who played Alex in the movie (Doug Copithorne) works next door to me and is a friend of mine.
I truly hope Duvall brings this character back to life and shows us "what comes next."
But his next move is to be the ruthless hit-man.
I had already submitted some (Seasons 9, 10 and 11 are done) but from now on I will write in order (with the exception of course of the up-coming 7 episodes of Season 13 that thankfully begin airing next Wednesday).
The racers never know where they are going to be next...there is no planning ahead of time and that's one of the things that makes this show absolutely exciting.
I hope they have better characters next season.
During the bizarre chase, Jane accepts a ride from the limo driver because she can't wait 3 hours for the next train, even though she has more than 6 hours to get to her speech.
I see here its director's debut film, so I hope next time, he will find a better way to express himself and spend the production's money.
I anticipate his next film with hope.
Dongmakgol is such a memorable, powerful experience that I'm afraid to watch another movie lest the next one be a dud.
A too lovable parents one day and hostile the next day.
AWFUL comedies like "40 Yr Old Virgin" play in over 3000 theatres & this real good movie & many other good films like CHILDREN OF MEN have next to no release at all.
at first I had no intention of watching this movie well at first i didnt then i watched the last half hour of it and it really held my attention the next day it was on again.
Will does not call the police, and on the next day, he visits Amira with the pretext of sewing a coat.
Now i know it's a kids movie, but even the kid sitting next to me said it was a con.
The next scene opens in a cop station.
The next day is Halloween and four gay friends are attending the party in West Hollywood.
this was the dumbest film ever, next to Cruel Jaws.
I was at my girl's house and popped this in at 10 p.m., knowing that I had work the next day, I waited for the movie to pick up, while trying to hold myself from busting up from the ridiculous acting, poor script, and CGI that was probably generated by the Director's 6th grader son, hoping that in the next few minutes the movie would offer something interesting.
in the next scene, he is in the sheriff's office and has told his story to the deputies.
Too big and bulky to climb anything resembling the Empire State Building, it does the next best thing by falling through and collapsing the Tower Bridge.
Made to hold a one frame pose for an exposure to be slightly changed to the next & next.
I don't know if I've ever seen such a realistically sociopathic performance from another actor in any other film- its chilling you just don't know what he'll do next but one thing you do know is that someone is going to get seriously hurt.
Apparently Don wrote the script for this in his sleep and started filming the next day without checking for a storyline or inconsistencies.
I hate to say it, but Reggie was next to useless in this sequel.
At one point Jody is seriously maimed and apparently dies, but then in the very next scene he shows up looking good as new, and has to be killed AGAIN.
My only criticism would be that the film is not edited in a seamless way from beginning to end, so that at certain points in the film it abruptly goes to black until you select the next DVD chapter.
Thumbs up again to all the actors who have done an extremely well job with the acting in the series and hopefully will continue to do so in other movies or in the next Phantasm movie.
I'd love to recommend it to people, but seeing as how it's next to impossible to lay hands on, I'll have to settle with pleading quietly for its re-release.
Although the cast itself was small and a couple instances of plot lines were a bit iffy, the movie still kept me in anticipation of what was coming next.
All of the films leave you wondering "what happened next?!?!?!"
This is a good story about a man whose friend bets him that he will find love with one of the next ten men he meets.
One minute everything seems lost, the next minute - it's the end and problem solved.
Perhaps next time Mr. Dutt should use some marijuana instead of beer and chill the characters.
This is overall a great series, but the wait for this next sequel is starting to get excruciating.
In the monster category, go past vampires, werewolves, zombies, giant reptiles and put a check mark next to "incest freaks" 'cause that's what you're dealing with in this lame movie.
The two sisters arrive the next day with friends of theirs and begin the usual fun-in-the-sun activities by the lake, but when two of their number disappear and they go looking for them, they find them dead, hanging from a tree.
It's well photographed, and I liked when the guy beat one of the killers over the head with a wooden chair while he was still tied to it, and a couple of other scenes, but as soon as the movie would come to life, it would quickly fall back into a familiar predictable pattern of said earlier movies in the very next scene.
When a series of murders are committed, Helene begins to suspect Popal, worrying that she is next.
into the next 'what do I do here, Mr Director' scene.
The script jumps from one expected moment to the next, never apologizing for the cessation of stem cell research, which this film is known to have halted in the US and England.
Hopefully Shaw Brothers can come up with something more consistent next time.
The film follows John Kerry's winning the Democratic Party's nomination for President in Boston in July to his self destruction over the next four months when he blew a double digit lead in the polls against President Bush to end up losing in the November elections by 50.7 % to 48.3 % of the popular vote!
The movie paints the wife as a shallow but glamorous socialite, caring only for the next party of get-away weekend at his expense.
Vinson is standing next to Cooper as he gazes out the window.
One moment you think the guy is full of hot air and fantasy, but in the next his obtuse ramblings make sense.
'The Postman' was a great action flick next to this.
The Avenger claims his next victim on a night the Lodger has mysteriously stolen out of Daisy's parents' house, making Daisy's mother more than suspicious her daughter is in danger.
It's exhilarating to see Hitchcock, in a silent film no less, stage the implied murder of a woman by showing movement, shadow, a pause, then a seemingly over-the-top close-up of the woman screaming, then cutting to the next day or whatever.
What makes the lodger character (Ivor Novello) particularly creepy is his unusual behavior in turning women's pictures away from view and the borderline malevolent interest he takes in young Daisy Bunting, a fair haired girl who has all the prerequisites for the Avenger's next victim.
What's next?
The next very obvious thing about The Lodger is that right from the start Hitchcock was more interested in cinematic technique than he was in performances or artistry.
But then the Buntings begin to suspect that he may be the Avenger and want Daisy as his next victim...  Hitchcock's first thriller and a very good one.
And good luck hatching anywhere with that kid William having the next egg, looking all American tourist like.
However, what really drew me in was wondering what would happen next.
As a woman whose great love ended before the relationship could fully develop, she imparts what she has learned to them about what's really important in this world, and what really stays with those we leave behind when we go into the next one.
The film is more of a play on film but the editing is so smooth that you feel one scene weaves in to the next.
Screenwriter Leo (John Saxon) next gets to tell his story in "Stanley's Girlfriend".
- Jibaku: In hopes of classing up the film with some Asian flare, the next story headed to Japan.
The next episode is what might possible be the best and most experimental Sean Cunningham film ever made.
One minute he hates her enough to spit in her tea when her back is turned; the next he smiles at her childish singing like the first fool in love in the history of the world.
Ironically, however, it is the Boss who takes the little girl back so that she can grow into the next Bijou.
Maybe it inspired some of that Stooges lunacy in the next decade.
His next gig is a washout and there's love all around him; even his newfound friend, the cute little waitress that works at the same place as him is getting married.
I don't think I really need to tell you what comes next, but even though it's a predictable ride; trust me, it's a ride you want to be on.
The next scene could be something as random.
And I can imagine how much fun this show must be to make - whenever the writers think up another "brilliant" gag, they can just insert it into their next episode.
I though the male lead Ben was great and nice looking in that down to earth boy next door way and not the I'm a male super model worship t my feet way, which is very unique for male role now days that have to be the knight and shinning armer type.
ALSO RECOMMENDED: Nelvana's Care Bears show (all of season 1 and a few in season 2), the next two Care Bears films, and "My Little Pony: The Movie".
Oh well, the next one has got to be better than this loser.
But all she wants is to jump into bed with the next penis that walks down the street.
Not only are they unrecognizable but from the moment you see them you KNOW and FEEL exactly where you are, who you are dealing with and that's exactly every director's dream...or nightmare...can I put my audience in the context of the next x minutes.
The "homeless" are just that for a *reason*: nobody who ever knew them wants anything to do with them--- where they are not out-&-out psychopaths they are predatory sociopath drunk-addicts who would kill their mothers for their next hit.
The next thing we know, Bobby is contemplating coming out of the closet, much to the shame and embarrassment of his father.
Is Bland the next Roderiquez?
A guy who has been a sleeper for 20 years who was a simple murderer before comes back to life and is a skilled fighter, who proceeds to treat a seasoned female rebel like she is some sissy amateur (are you OK,get down, do as I say etc)  The resistance made up of survivors all talk in American military speak in one scene and in the next are huddled round a fire being unskilled.
Only in a B-series do you expect a Terminator to survive rifle fire in one scene, die from it in the next, taking several grenade launcher hits standing up in one scene and getting blown 100 feet backwards from a single shot 5 seconds later.
Sure the city inside the Macross,the Earth gets destroyed, and death of some character etc reflects that war isn't great and deadly but everything is made peachy again with everything (environment and characters) nice, clean, happy go lucky and perfect again in the next episode.
In the year 1999 a city-sized extraterrestrial battle cruiser crash lands on Earth, and over the next decade scientists and engineers repair its damage and refit it into a hybrid of human and alien technologies.
Prochaska does, however, count on the surprise factor as well: not all in the script is a deja vu, and he takes advantage of those moments when we don't know what's gonna happen next to scare us witless, with almost sadistic joy (in terms of how off guard we're caught).
If he takes better care of the script next time, he might even be able to join the likes of Carpenter and Romero in the genre's Hall of Fame.
I just hope that you have kept enough back for the next two movies!
Over the opening credits, Patrick Stewart narrates that "in the not too distant future" genetic mutations will trigger the "next stage of evolution."
As the next evolutionary stage of life, mutantsÂa.k.a.
Its understandable to see why Christian bale did his rant, after caring about a script and doing so well in his own performance, and being let down by the director and some dodgy lighting ;)  4 the next one i suggest any talented story director, Michael bay and jerry bruckheimer maybe?
After watching his film i couldn't sleep properly for next few nights.
Bad title, good movie, and I am torn, after seeing it between joining the NRA, the next anti gun violence rally on the south side, Googling wet nurses, or renting The Best of Bugs.
While the plot seems forced,and the tempo and pacing of the film knows only one speed(well,okay,maybe two),the film is so rife with eye-catching and dazzling stunts,acrobatics and gun-play,and tied together with dialog that seems to be lifted and dried off from old James Bond movies(perhaps a nod to Owen's flirtation with becoming the next 007)that it is perversely enjoyable for its own excesses.
A lot of people argue that Owen should of been the next Bond (Craig was just too good).
The director does seem to know what he's doing, as he takes scenes that have been used in many action movies in the past, and brings them to the next level.
Ever since Clive Owen ascended to the A-list of Hollywood's leading men (something that took far too long in my opinion), he has often been pipped as the next actor to inherit the ongoing role of James Bond.
The camera pulls back to reveal Clive sitting on a bench, waiting for the next bus.
It just glides by from one revved up action scene to the next.
Better luck next time.
I can't wait to see what relative newcomer Michael Davis does for his next movie, but it will be hard for him to top this one.
Unfortunately, by next week the show was cancelled.
Contrary to popular opinion.....this series was the scariest, next to Boris Karloff's.."Thriller"!
As "worked up" as Bale must have had to have been in order to pull off these angst-filled scenes (one after the other after the next), he exhibited amazing control in not HITTING the guy who blew the scene for him.
I certainly hope that they show this again before next year.
You're always wondering what their next fight will be about.
Every episode is terrific, you're always drawn into the story, and you're always left wondering what happens next.
And then they had the nerve to end the stupid movie with John giving one of his terrible speeches leading right into the next movie.
Over the next decade, I'm sure we'll see much more of him in the big blockbusters to come.
But I want suspense fans to remember the name, because Zambeck brings classic suspense out of the attic, polishes it up, and displays it for the next generation.
Again I think this was a very valiant effort by McG, he needs to work out a couple kinks for the next films, which I really he gets the green light on.
In the end, the couple seems to stay together because they are too tired to move on to the next drama.
I just gave him a blow job - this guy will later in the film describe that it was like sex between sister and brother - her father has a gallery filled with sexually explicit and obscene paintings,he salivates at the name of orgasm, cunnilingus and is ecstatic when saying: sex good - at the party the guy who sits next to the main male character starts stray away to speak about women pubic hair   Please, I am French, I know a lot of French people, I have been to lots of parties in Paris and know a lot of uninhibited people, but the description of French sex obsessed people in this film is grotesquely twisted and exaggerated.
I can't wait to see Araki's next film OR JGL's next performance.
He has everything he needs to be the next De Niro.
It's not as classy as the previous one or as exploitative as the next one, making it the runt of the trilogy.
The two youngest leads, Chase Ellison and George Webster, were entirely convincing in their scenes (and I hope they feel proud of their work, seeing as how there's no way they'll get to see this movie until sometime next decade).
Webster masquerades as Bobo Hutch from Pittsburg, to infiltrate the gang - but in the next scene that is forgotten about.
Before this situation can be dealt with along comes the believed "deceased's" next of kin and a gang of jewel thieves trying to find a fortune in diamonds hidden in the house.
One might hope that with the advent of next gen DVD which will have more than enough capacity it would be nice to have all the Hammer horror movies on one disc.
I hope with this directors next film, he will not hire a piece of particle board to play the lead.
He shows promise, and hopefully with his next film, he will rectify this egregious mishap.
What makes this click with so many horror buffs, in particularly those who love lesbian vampire films, is the one-time star Yvette Stensgard, a gorgeous Scandanavian child-woman who looks absolutely innocent (particularly when her eyes fetchingly cross), even the moment before she rips open the neck of her next victim.
I can't wait to see this writer/director's next story.
The next guest at the Black Raven is a long-suffering, milquetoast bank employee, Horace Weatherby (a spectacled Bryon Foulger of "Sullivan's Travels") who has embezzled $50-thousand so that he can finally enjoy life to the hilt.
The next two guests are an unmarried couple, Allen Bentley (Robert Livingston of "The Lone Ranger Rides Again") and Tim Winfield's estranged, under-age daughter Lee (Wanda McKay of "Raiders of Ghost City"), who are trying to elope across the border into Canada so that they can get married.
His blurbs get repeated at the water cooler the next day... His portrayal as son AND Father is precious, and Brenda Fricker is a marvelous mum, giving the willies and the grins as she leers at Mike's buddy (Anthony LaPaglia)!
I can't wait to see what's next for David Drach.
Not content to just offer up a one dimensional rescue piece concerning mixed races, they take the ugly racial aggression here and sit it next to the ugliness of human wild fire ignorance.
It takes one of the very earliest looks at racism and how it can ... and did in real life in the next decade ... tear apart a community and ultimately a nation.
Just as the town is on the verge of an all-out racial riot, a boy rushes in to announce that he has discovered the little girl's things next to the well.
It's obvious what will happen next, and indeed it does.
The only thoughts you'll be provoked into are thoughts about exactly what method will be used to kill the next victim.
We watch as a wheelchair-bound baroness is brutally strangled, only for the rug to be torn from under us moments later when her assailant is the next one to bite the bullet!
Throughout the labirynth like story-line, we bounce from one character to the next, never having enough time to get to know the people in the movie to care enough for them and when they are killed, their deaths suddenly take a surprisingly modern twist.
Looking forward to see your next project.
Vince Rocca has a truly original movie here and I can't wait to see what he does next.
I can't wait to see what Vince has cooked up for his next project.
that something we thought was gone is still here just over that next mountainside.
You just never know what's going to happen next in the Grand Hotel.
He hits just the right note in his performance and it was to be his next to last great performance.
John Barrymore, next, does the best he can playing a Baron who wears more eye shadow than Garbo.
Even after 70+ years, Grand Hotel remains just as brilliant and fascinating as it was to begin with -- if not more: each character is as dynamic and enthralling as the next, and each frame is filled with surprises and idiosyncrasies.
The sheriff's daughter, who's planning to be in the next homecoming parade at her high school is kidnapped by McNichol, and from then on, it an all-out auto war between the two starry-eyed kids, the cops, and other hot-dogging speed freaks.
All I would like to say is better job next time.
Maybe I'm being a touch harsh on it as I've seen far worse but I'm fed up of wasting my time with crap like this, having said that I'll still be stupid enough to be the first in the queue when the next low budget piece of crap gets released.
Now if they only find a way to make the next film somewhat entertaining, then it could be fun again.
Many of the great sword fight movies from the next 25 years were his handiwork -- including 'The Adventures of Robin Hood,' and 'Captain Blood.'
They glory in it, they obsess about it, they talk about their last encounter and look forward to the next one.
If you watch this film carefully, you will see that both begin in an exploration phase of their relationship, eager to jump into the unknown, but not quite certain the next step.
One can only hope that this kind of thing does not reappear when the next lucky, totally over rated boy band member attempts the same thing.
His only moment of madness was choosing to take part in the Da Vinci Code...he should give his salary to the American Writers Guild in the hope that they may start finding the next Preston Sturges...  Juliette Binoche could act underwater and always brings something new to her roles.
The next scenes show her difficulties in trying to break into the movies.
The next scenes show Lester and studio head Oliver Niles (Adolphe Menjou) worrying about where Maine is after four days.
They think he is sleeping but he hears them talking in the next room.
Now they must transport Rabbit from Arizona to California in the next ten hours.
Well, here's three lines from the greatest MST3K episode to ever hit TV that explains the next scene.
This film had a limited marketing and release because it didn't quite fit any of the "commercial" film genres-- but I'll be watching out for director Lu Chuan's next film about the Nanjing massacre (or "incident" as some Japanese call it).
We finally get to see what Flip deserves for trying to be the next Eminem.
Is he the next rap super star?
At least for the next 10 minutes.
I was anxious for the next episode and they couldn't get around soon enough.
Trapped on a mysterious island at the heart of the famed 'Bermuda Triangle', a group of travellers venture from one dangerous time zone to the next, searching for a way home.
Intro Martin I will really humiliate myself for a scrap of food Kove.. shoots his next in command about 15 times because his colleague is attacked by a plastic ant that basically sits on his shoulder.. like a parrot.
This scene would have benefited if they had stayed closer to the novel, but for some reason they considerably shortened it and consequently that scene conveys next to none of the heartbreak and despair of the scene of the novel.
It's the same as watching a very badly edited film, where all of a sudden we jump to the next sequence in the story, without any explanation of why, or what has gone on in between.
Hearing this,Sally comes to the realization that she is Geoffrey's next victim of a well-planned crime.Stanwyck has never been better as a panic-stricken wife,trying to survive her husband's evil doings.Bogart gives a highly underrated performance as a psychopath,who gets brutal when his murder plot doesn't go according to plan.His presence on screen is often frightening.The ending is wonderfully witty and comical.While not in the same league as "The Maltese Falcon"or "Key Largo",this is still a highly entertaining Bogart film,that will not disappoint.
My tip, next time stay away from biased scientist all together.
While the short goes on Daffy attempts to become the next president trying pass a law for rabbit season to last twelve months a year.
I really hope his next effort will be more thought out.
And, given the amount of blood that appeared in the scene, it's hard to explain why there isn't even a mark on Willard's hand the next time we see him!
Screwed's pace is just perfect; the laughs are fast and frequent, although you are given a slight breather just before the next joke hits.
Finally, Willard cannot take it anymore and after a ho-ho-hellish eruption at Crock on Christmas Eve he discovers that he will be fired the next day.
All of this and yet the mission's target ends up escaping the captors and finding its way back in bed next to Crock.
Couldn't drop this one in the mailbox fast enough to get my next netflix rental.
I've never seen Shane Meadows' other work but after seeing this, I'll definitely keep an eye out for his next movies.
But right next to that is a movie...I'm sorry, let me rephrase that, a revolution that is "The Texas Nailgun Massacre."
(However since it is next to Critters 3, I bet you'll pick up both covers and compare the pictures on the boxes for awhile before you skip over both and rent "The Truth about Cats and Dogs," which is much cuter I think.)
Paddy Considine's script is very good, and leaves enough room for the audience to be surprised at the next turn, and his portrayal of a vengeful brother is spot-on.
I can't wait to see the next Meadows/Considine Film, its always nice to look forward to something in films as the big blockbusters these day just have no soul anymore.
Drawn into a life of drug abuse and general mayhem, Billy takes another crack at the big time with his next great idea.
one forever feels that around the next corner will be the demon awaiting to devour the souls of the main characters, but lemarchand's box is not quite so literal as it is in a film like hellraiser.
The less you know, the better, but the basics are:  ** Start Minor Spoilers **  Billy Byrne is the next big thing.
Battlefield Earth would be able to stand next to this one and hold its head up high.
For the next forty minutes it's a case of chicken little crying the sky is falling, as Edwards single handedly starts a panic in Los Angeles that has the populace rioting and fleeing for the hills.
You know whatever happens next will reunite her with her father, who seems to be getting a message from his dead wife that the girl needs emergency help.
The beginning of romance between the two and the moments they draw together and next when we see them as a couple are all well portrayed.
Even Dotty has the starlet look, as do three nerd girls in the next room.
The one thing that caught my eye about this film was the fact that she could be skinny one second and "fat" the next.
The next scene is Joan and Bernard being confronted by the school counselor.
The kids really take the film to the next level.
Of course, the next night when Weiss visits the townie in order to commit adultery, she bites him.
After telling Marie it was a wolf that attacked him the next day he tells her he fell and scratched is shoulder.
You can guess whats gonna happen next, so not much of a suspense either.
They announce her daughter is a victim on TV the next day and make it official.
To know this is real just breaks my heart, but Dawn Anna's strength keeps me going, as I'm facing a third brain surgery in the next couple weeks.
After watching it I jumped on IMDb to get some info and ideas for my next movie.
The rest of the film is mostly their bickering as they travel from one apartment to the next and carry out their improbable, Pygmalion-like opposites-attract romance.
Although director Giuliano Carnimeo and European sex symbol Edwige Fenech had teamed up to make one of the pulpiest Italian thrillers of all time, "The Case of the Bloody Iris," in 1972, their next collaboration, 1973's "Secrets of a Call Girl," is hardly a giallo at all.
Sordid, heavy-handed approach to the conventional shark tale, with perennial Cardona leading man Hugo Stiglitz, tag-teamed with Andres Garcia (no, not Andy Garcia) acting like a pair of macho morons in pursuit of the next booze-fuelled orgy.
I consider myself a genuine fan of bad cinema as much as the next guy but this film was truly awful, in an often hilariously inept kind of way.
The shark attacks (specially the one at night next to the boat with a REAL shark) are really believable, it achieves it's goal of scaring the crowd in my personal point of view.
When Dourif beats hell out of McDormand, we only get a few introductory blows before the cut, just so we know what's going to happen next.
I found that to be the scariest thing about the film, that these depraved people could indeed live next door to me or share a cube at work.
What made me feel good after watching this movie was ... a good story and brilliant acting.. specially Priyanka Chopra has done a very good job... she is the lady who knows what acting is.... and no doubt if she will be the next bollywood queen... John Abraham has also done a very good job playing the character of a hit-man... all together a good movie to watch ... worth the time... And I think after a long time had bollywood came up with such a brilliant movie I don't know why such movies are not liked by the Indian audience... they go in for crap...
The next day Albert is in his office with the IRS and after going over his books, Albert is told that the IRS owes him $11.19.
But Claire may have met her match with her next job applicant, Alice Dimmock, played by the forever feisty Ruth Gordon.... As regards those killings, they are almost completely bloodless, and any comparisons that may have been made to 1944's "Arsenic and Old Lace" may be fair ones.
Turns out that her late husband's stamp collection - that she used to bribe the next door neighbor's son - was a lot more valuable than she thought.
Page's character is equally disenchanted with her new next door neighbor, Ms. Vaughn, whom she refers to as "crabgrass, never really quelled, only cropping up secretly and victoriously in another spot".
Portraying a circle of friends double-crossing each other with the aim of getting a part in Martin Scorsese's next picture, the movie pulls no punches.
The lead is Sarah Morton (Rampling), a successful author in the crime/detective genre who is having trouble coming up with an idea for her next novel.
Charlotte's web of mystery guides to her to a French villa where she inhabits for tranquility & inspiration for her next literary project.
It revolves around four male actors who become captivated by the prospect of auditioning for the part of Al Capone in Martin Scorsese's next production.
Each half hour episode ends with a cliffhanger to get you back next week to see what happens.
A Native American priest finds them the next morning and takes them to his home.
I would also recommend to see this film along with another great film:The Mission(1986).If you liked "Apocalypto" and want to see a true story about what happened next, you should see "The Mission".If you saw "Apocalypto" and hated it, "The Mission" will make you fell better.
It is so nice to have a show to watch that isn't so drearily predictable - you never know what Flower, Mozart, Tosca and company will be up to or up against next.
I can't wait to see how Mel Gibson's next project turns out.
I'll take my wife next time, she stayed home, brainwashed by the avalanche of misinformation claiming it was one of the most violent films ever made.
If you would look up the term "misogyny" in the dictionary, there's a fair chance there will be a poster image of this little movie next to it.
It, of course, incorporates even the meerkats with social problems (I was half expecting the next meerkat to be a drunk.)
Actually, any little girl would sound like a grizzled old lumberjack next to Sarsgaard's orgasmic tittering.
I have not always been a Craig Lucas fan, as I sometimes find his work to be a bit preachy (Prelude to a Kiss), but with this film, and his obvious director's eye, I look forward to his next effort.
Brief, because the next morning begins with him dragged away by Beijing cops who, having found the girl's dead body in the room and her fresh blood all over him, proceed to assume the American guilty.
But the next day he closes the hall and goes into a period of grieving.
A film like this --- almost without suspense because of continual misjudgments by the director --- will run its course on DVD in the next few months and end up in the same dumpster as a Styrofoam clam from Mickey Dee's, while the classics of 1938-1950 will be sought-out long after we are all planted in the ground.
Skip the introduction on the next viewing.
Anthony Hopkins, as great an actor as he is, is an old, senile, drunken fool who can't stride from one chair to the next.
Each twenty minute story is just long enough to engross and short enough to leave you happy that you didn't waste your time and you're ready for the next.
But sit tight, because that's all you get for the next hour, until finally the title character shows up.
I saw this film (uncut) straight after Absurd and kept wondering when it was actually going to start - there is one initial scene where a guy on a beach gets a meat cleaver through his head (extremely unrealistic effects) and then the next "excuse of gore" is a head in a bucket which is so pathetically unreal I nearly split my sides with laughter !!!!
They don't realize that an extremely impending figure has murdered everyone on the island and they are next.
The ending does not follow logically, but for me it asks the question: What is next?
next, the one character who was supposed to be individual because that's just who she really was was actually just trying to be different because she couldn't be popular or to seek revenge for petty stuff.
For the next hour I heard a lot of references to two shows: "Malcolm in the Middle" and this other show, "Popular."
As for me, I normally prefer "I Paliacci" or "Turandot" when I am attempting my Risotto or Lasagne Bolognese but I think I will pull out my Louis Prima albums the next time I cook.
At least then you won't be able to remember it the next day.
While many of Billy Mitchell's claims may have seemed absurd at the time the showed quite an insight of how air power would develop over the next 50 years.
Arnold (to achieve five-star rank in World War II) and Carl Spaatz, a four-star architect of strategic bombing in the next war.
The next day I told all my friends about this incredible movie, and NO ONE asked if it could been a hoax.
It was only the next day, after bemusedly watching a workmate fold over laughing when I related the latest proof that a kiwi had beaten the Wright brothers to it and demanding explanation, that I discovered the whole thing was a complete fabrication.
One moment she's kittenish, the next, cold.
Which would the public go for in the next show?
And why did the owner of the club refuse to serve Conchita just after she quit, but then the next time, he practically prostrated himself for her.
The first time you see certain things and the next time, now that you know everyone, you'll see more.
Every time a battle scene/flashback occurred you were basically just waiting to see which one of the faceless, nameless, GIs was going to be killed next.
While watching Flags of our Fathers, there are a few scenes that you can imagine being in the next years release and maybe that is where Eastwood and the gang lost their focus.
I don't think I have ever gone to a chop socki movie and expected to see the next Titanic or the next American Beauty.
Sometimes when one version of Conchita walks through a door the other figure enters the next room.
It seems pretty obvious that violence will continue to escalate and the stakes will be higher the next time Conchita winds Mathieu up.
Joely Richardson shows an uncanny resemblance to Wallis Simpson, a woman with her own style who made headlines and who appeared to have lived a fulfilled life next to the man who gave up everything for her.
I don't want to spoil the film by revealing what happens next.
I still remember trying to finish up last-minute stuff, have my shower and get ready for school the next day in time to watch "Life Goes On" (and on many occasions, "America's Funniest Home Videos" after that) Often I would be running late, and would watch "Life Goes On" in my parents bedroom, practically still dripping wet, wearing a bathrobe, with my hair wrapped up turban-style in a towel to air-dry as my dad ironed his work clothes, and I watched the show.
It's such an intriguing chess-like game, and I'm always trying to guess what the players are going to do next... or rather, what I would do next were I in their place!
The launch show ridiculously hypes the next 10 weeks with a hyperventilating Davina Mccall shouting to compensate for lack of presenting ability.
The only consolation being that, Jade (RIP) aside, they sink without a great deal of trace within weeks of each series ending, sure, they may be recognised in the supermarket for years to come, but sleep with your next door neighbour and you'll be recognised in the supermarket for years to come.
I don't need to watch it next year because I know who's going to win.
If you get an ice pick rammed through your arm or hand do you think the next day you could function without pain in that area??
Constantly on the run, both to and from, never knowing what is around the next corner.
Looking forward to the next Scott Wiper project!
David Bernhardt is going to be the next "Van Damme".
Bernhardt definitely has the looks and talent to become the next action star.
It was only the next year that she set all the men of America afire by her sensuous role in Bill Inge's 'Picnic', opposite William Holden.
Carey while doing surveillance on Novak's apartment gets to peeping in on Malone next door.
And some scene's had nothing to do with the movie, for example when one of the guys goes home with his girlfriend her sister opens the door, what we have next is nice to see but has nothing to do with the script, and a lot of girls show their body, clothed, in an explicit way.
To make that happen, he gives the reporter clues about his next killings.
It does not surprise me a bit that Dern's next movie would be David Lynch's "Blue Velvet" where she played sweet and innocent Sandy and in a few years she would play her best role, Lula Fortune in his "Wild at Heart" (1990).
It's an unconventional, yet readily accessible film that Richter has packed with interesting asides, lines and situations, all of which drive the story forward and keep you guessing as to what could possibly happen next.
Weller's Buckaroo is intelligent and self-assured-- watching him you get the feeling there's always something going on in his head, and always a step ahead of the next guy-- and it's his ability to convey the complexities of the character that makes him believable, and his incredible exploits seem credible.
Slam Dunk Ernest cancels our preordained concepts of natural realism, and provides us with the necessary trajectory on which we can launch films respectively into the next millennium.
It was done in a very intimate, non-hokey style and I felt I was right there living with the characters, like maybe in the house next to Mary Astor's.
was the title of DC Thompson's Dandy comic that is seen next to a copy of his own book, and for some reason it's that image that has always stayed with me since '81.
It's worth a look the next time it is broadcast.
Whenever two people are talking on the phone, for example, they are rather obviously standing right next to each other with a wall in between them.
I can appreciate underground cinema as much as the next man, but I'm hocking my copy of Duck!
I would love to see who the series go to next.
Watching him you never know when the next head will fall, or if he's suddenly touched with sentiment and decides to spare some perceived slighter.
Rent this and for the next few weeks that snaky, insidious theme tune will be inching its way across your subconscious.
One minute you can barely hear the actors, the next you are being blown away by music and/or background noise.
Please remember that the next time you go to the theater.
Put away the medkit, because in the very next scene, the nastiest of cuts will completely disappear!
It's a compelling tale, grippingly suspenseful as you wait to see what Henry and Allan will do next, yet disturbingly funny as you watch Allan delight in the most unpleasant things (just as long as they make Henry happy).
The next time we see the killer, he approaches Mr. Burt, who is playing three card monte, having recognized him from before.
OK, so I watched it again the next day because I didn't really see the ending the first time, and I knew it wasn't even close enough to being scary to bother my kids.
He invites a film crew to come document his life, his friendships (including his now-retired mentor and his wife) and his plans for his next developing murder spree.
Leslie wants to be the next greatest psycho/horror/slasher/serial killer who ever lived like Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers.
A TV crew follows Leslie Vernon around, a guy who has the ambition to become the next slasher legend after his idols Michael Myers, Jason Vorhees and Freddy Krueger (who exist in the movie's reality).
When a commando mission in the jungle goes horribly wrong, he is called in to help lead the next team.
And don`t complain either , you`ve got your foot in the door and with any luck your next screenplay will be produced with a budget ten times your debut movie .
Which leads us to the next thing this movie has to offer: The gore.
Lucy plants her Easter eggs around the yard with intent to find them again the next day.
She ends up (by the time the movie begins) as a lonely alcoholic close to burnout, but with a manager (Alan Bates) who won't let her have time to recuperate, and instead just keeps pushing her on and on to the next show.
I could never tell what was going to happen next (and that always is a GOOD sign!).
At times I'm reminded of other sci-fi shows like Smallville (character dynamics such as Ming's twisted tough love approach to his daughter, which is reminiscent of Lionel and Lex Luthor...and the fact that Dale is a bit of a cross between Lois Lane and Lana Lang, as a smart reporter/hometown girl next door/long-time love), but honestly, Smallville has become unwatchable and offensive in many ways.
However (and fortunately for me), my parents enforced a Three Bite Rule at dinner when I was growing up; I adapted this into the "Three Show Rule" and sat down to the next two episodes of "Flash" with a virtuous, if heavy heart.
I enjoy watching the episodes, they make me laugh at some points, and by the end of the episode I want to watch the next one to see what happens!!
But, who said it had to be the next great sci-fi series?
The pilot episode was a little slow, and I almost didn't watch the next one, but I decided to give it another chance and am very glad that I did.
A planet that should be a hotbed of tectonic activity with not just 2 moons but a whole other planet right next door in orbit.
The film spends the first third fleshing out everyone but the centerpiece and then doesn't give him any depth as he stumbles through his thick cockney mumblings from one costar to the next.
Maybe in the next film, Mick Dundee could call on his old friend from the movie business, the character played by Rodriguez, to help him out of some jam.
For the next hour the film is as funny as any I have seen.
This ranks next to Jaws, Forest Gump, and Gone With the Wind.
But, the next day it is funny again.
The racers never know where they are going to be next...there is no planning ahead of time and that's one of the things that makes this show absolutely exciting.
I hope they have better characters next season.
For all of you complaining about changes from the book - do you really want to know what happens next in every scene?
I believe that the next movies will be good.
I loved this movie when I was 12 years old... and I still have to say that, next to modern movies of this type (Anaconda, Arachnophobia), Frogs is still the champ!
So next time you rifle through that $5.00 bin at Wal-Mart, do you're very best to avoid thisÂ this thing.
It wouldn't be a little more logical to kill the husband and in case next his sister to inherit from her?
In other words, I'm already interested in his next AC adaptation, which according to IMDb will be "Hallowe'en Party" (also, I find it quite funny that some people complain about lack of faithfulness to the novels BUT want Hastings, Japp and Miss Lemon back in the movies, even if these characters did not appear in those novels at all!).
It concerns 3 rather dimwitted criminals who come up with a plan to rob a bank by tunneling in through the basement of the luggage shop next door.
Three criminals buy a luggage store next to a bank so they can tunnel their way to riches, but the luggage business takes off.
Gangsters buy a luggage shop situated next to a bank in order to break through the wall into the bank vault; instead, they find themselves dragged kicking and screaming into legitimacy.
parodies his bad guy image perfectly in this flick as he wants to pull of one last heist before going straight, so he buys a luggage store next to a bank to break in, but he soon learns that he can make more money in a legit business... but that's only the beginning!
Thieves getting into a store next to a bank in order to break through the wall into the vault.
In the next scene with Liz, the scratch is gone.
Serling had to take it to the next level, by injecting irony.
The Neger/Jaeger-Gag is a cheap joke (and they even repeat him), but everyone, who thinks he has a problem with those lighthearted jokes, must check, if he is not a better visitor for the next Visconti-Retrospective or a Woody-Allen-Festival.
I don't know about you, but with someone as gorgeous as Julie Bowen next to me, golf would be the very last thing on my mind!
What next?
Maybe next time, there should be a more realistic story(ies)line.
My guests and I are already looking forward to the next film.
The indigo child seated next to me- who is a little out-of-sorts with her environment- was delighted by the film!
They smugly proclaim this movie to be the next "What the Bleep", and tell how all kids should watch this.
First of all, it's an insult to characterize this as the next "WTB", this is the most amateur hour, half baked and overcooked drama I've seen in ages.
But then they take it to the next level.
The chemistry between Fallon and Richards is awesome, and when they weren't on the screen together I found myself waiting for my next fix of those two crazy guys in action.
Many early cinemas had only one projector, with live entertainment provided during the longeur while the previous reel was rewound before the next reel could be shown.
At one point he admonishes a confederate in the next job for trying to figure out a way to pull off the robbery without killing any innocent people.
I hope that their next feature will be at the same category of that one, because "Deaden's" cult has just born.
He spent the next several months in the hospital--during which time, the evil plan grew.
The plot doesn't make much sense at all, it was truly incoherent and all over the place as one scene slowly dragged onto the next without any real urgency, then you get a twist that you see coming- but then it would twist back on itself and your left scratching your headÂ fancy that?
So besides the lavish package, the next question is: what's up with the content?
I had never heard of this movie until monday, when i found out it would be available for rent(dvd) the next day.
But the editing, cinematography and art direction in this film really put it next to its American huge-budget brothers.
The film takes place in the fifties and we focus on David Moran; a young boy who meets a young girl named Meg Loughlin when she moves in next door with her sister after the death of their parents.
i've seen "the girl next door" in the title and i thought it's the comedy "the girl next door (2004)" one with Elisha Cutbert.
One day they're fighting in a bedroom, the next they've got a girl bound in the basement, tearing her clothes off, the next they're engaged in kiddie rape, while the Cruella DeVille mom urges things on.
A foster Mother has a couple of young Sisters join her foster family, and the boy next door becomes friendly with the oldest girl.
The boy next door tries his best to help her, but there's not much he can do, except never forget it for the rest of his life.
At first the young David seems like a lucky fellow-playing games with local friends, drinking beer next door at his neighbour's place, and meeting Meg, a lovely young lass who is adjusting to a new life at Auntie Ruth's house with her caliper-splint wearing sister after losing her parents in an automobile accident.
But Auffarth accepts the role and does an amazing job of being the normal "girl next door".
Only the boy who lives next door, who has become friends with the girl, has a growing sense of unease about the "games" which are taking a very sinister turn, yet he is powerless to change the course of events.
Best of all, the movie really does present a relatively accurate microcosm of American ignorance and intolerance as well as the -soon to be- trademark humor of *the next generation*.
Even going as far as to top There's Something About Mary in its crudeness and extreme vulgarity, South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut does what few TV-to-movies do: make a jump to the next level by pushing the obscenity to the limit.
Not knowing what the words mean, they continue this behavior the next day at school.
So I did and ended up purchasing the DVD the next day.
The rest of South Park kids see it also, and by the next school day, the parents find out and totally hate the movie.
The Queen did not survive, and of the 20 known survivors the next in line for the throne is a Mrs Ethel Schroake of 393a High Street, Leytonstone.
For the next fourteen minutes, he delivered an inaugural address that is still honored to this very day.
When is your next film coming out and what is will be hidden in it?
And it's mostly a family film but there's some language kids might repeat the next day at school (and get in trouble) and there's some very strange violence :)  Well worth a shot, though.
I'm looking forward to your next one.
The very next scene abruptly takes us to the Ukraine where she is continuing to recruit.
it makes you want to see what happens next.
by golly, "the music lovers" was a cinematic masterpiece next to this, travesty of tchaikovsky's life as it was.
Very talented individuals and I look forward to checking out what they have in store for us next.  
I await the next project and plan to check out the many plugs included in the commentary.
What's most heartbreaking is what came after this film; after the promise of his debut, Vasquez was given a ton of money and backing for his next feature, but the film had to be shut down after a week of shooting as Vasquez was walking around the soundstage proclaiming himself Jesus, among other insane ramblings.
I highly recommend it, so rent it next time you go to the video store.
A collapse at a nightclub (due to drinking too much) is mistaken for an early sign of her mortal illness (sentimental Oliver begs Dr. Downer not to spare him the worst - the next edition is going out in half an hour!).
I love these little "one reel wonders" that TCM throws in at the end of their regularly scheduled movies as filler till the next movie comes on.
Then he took it to the next level with SHIVERS, (released in this country as THEY CAME FROM WITHIN.)
I think the people who don't like that should support movies like that, so that next time the film company will have enough money to make a movie with better graphics
The camera speed is turned up a notch and director Byron Werner has his editor cut a lot from one zombie on the prowl to the next.
Nonetheless, I now have the massive undertaking of deciding which of Akira Kurosawa's films I will watch next.
Kurosawa would go on to achieve international acclaim with his next movie, Rashomon, but Stray Dog already shows that he was destined for great things.
Indeed, *Stray Dog* tends to meander during the next two hours.
Strippers, dope, stag films, parties that you can't remember much about the next day.
It should make us laugh, give us insights into the human condition, and keep us wondering what will happen next to characters that we care about.
It's interesting to see what is inspiring the next generation of filmmakers.
The next of interest is Slote (David Dukes) as a U.S. official in Europe trying to bring the Holocaust to the attention of Roosevelt, but to no avail.
This movie isn't DVD worthy, but neither does it belong next to TRON (in file 13, or the round file.)
I'm going to put it on my shelf next to the WarGames and Sneakers VHS tapes, to be watched over and over as I dream of a hackers ideal...
Hopefully, this excellent film will make its way into American theaters, at the very least the Art Theater circuit, in the next year.
When his next door neighbor, Simon, gets robbed and beaten brutally, his friend Frank assigns Melvin to take care of his dog while he recovers.
He will not step on a crack on the side walk but skips to the next block of concrete.
Greg Kinnear (Sabrina) is Simon Bishop, the artist who is Udall's next door neighbor who finally has Melvin turning into a little more normal human being and he is there to teach him many life lessons.
It next cuts to a scene of a mother frantically herding her four youngsters (the 4 who protagonists of the film) to their bomb shelter.
On moment, the fox is telling the children and beavers that he will throw the pursuing wolves off, the next the wolves have arrived and demand the fox tell them where their quarry is.
Narnia isn't the next Lord of the Rings, nor the next Harry Potter, at least on the cinema screen.
The green-screen use is laughable: for example, when standing on a hilltop, next to an animal whose fur is blowing in the wind, we see a too-close shot of the children, whose improperly-lit hair is standing PERFECTLY still... on a hilltop.
P.S got my fingers crossed for the next film.
Overall, this movie is a must see and the next six will likely be the same.
I didn't have to worry about having the urge to fast-forward to the next scene.
That real "girl next door" vibe.
Hoffman had just come off playing another biographical figure of Louis Dega in Pappion and would be Carl Bernstein in his his next film All the President's Men.
The next time you're feeling blue, remember: "You remind me of a man!"
Perhaps the most telling scene has Thomas, hands still bruised from "business" dealings, tapping out classical piano chords on a bar, while electronic music blares out in the background and his thuggish partners discuss how they are going to drive their next deal home.
He's forever on the move, and with his short fuse and inscrutably smug little smile, one never quite knows what he will do next.
hitting squatters over the head with a baseball bat one moment, agonizing over a bach fugue in the next scene?
The next, he's in suit and tie and negotiates with real-estate moguls.
They are allowed to keep the child, who we next see as sweet a little girl as anyone could wish for.
Then BAM, the next minute the kid is dead (no warning to the audience that the kid is sick, just BAM dead of something or other).
Stevens, perhaps the ablest filmmaker of the era next to Hitchcock, saw the profundity and catharsis in it, and the receptive, insightful control and room to allow his particularly personal vision to make it feel like the experience cinema is meant to be, a chronicle ensuing the life-changing happening of falling in love, and the innate personal longing to make a family and a home with the one you worship, and the trials and grief that can be as intense, though never really more, than the pleasure and gratification it begets.
Mind you, Irene Dunne is lying on top of the cover with her dressing gown on, tensely waiting for the baby's next feeding, while Cary Grant is off to sleep, but I still wonder how it got past the Hays office.
(A washroom scene rivals Meg Ryan's famous restaurant scene...the audience laughed so hard we all missed Cooper's next line!).
The next time it was screen i made sure my students saw it.
There was the whole family, at a christening, including Philip and Julian's ex-wife, standing next to her son, and everyone is happily smiling at one another.
My next complaint is that the story moves along at a snail's pace at three hours.
I think the best way to begin this would be not to thank but to bear hug,the creative geniuses who created this piece of art..i mean everything about this show is f**king perfect-the characters,the plot,the direction,the music,the screenplay,the script..Its a perfect example of when all the things come together to make something that is larger than the creators themselves..I don't know how i stumbled across the page of cowboy bebop but it must have one my lucky days..I have to say i was not intrigued from the plot as much as from the characters,which i read about in the comments..my expectations from the show were pretty low despite the rating but man when i watched its first two episodes,even the 9.4 rating seemed an insult..and IT IS THAT GOOD..you would filled with awe for its creators after you watch it..you would even love the cowboy bebop sign that comes in between the show..The best thing about the show is that is has no specific genre,or you can say its a genre in itself..i wont have the slightest doubt if the show gets a cult status..so you never know whats gonna come out in the next scene,whether you will be convulsing with laughter or staring at the screen in empathy for one of the characters..as the show goes on and on,you keep on going deep into the skin of the characters..you don't know when it happens that the characters just occupy a permanent space in your head..you start to wish that they are always around..with a bored spike smoking his cigarette,jet watering his plants ,sulky faye with her frown and industrious ed jumping around with his laptop..and when the show ended,i actually felt a part of my life going away..and i bet you will feel the same way when the show ends..you will stare into the eyes of spike and say " no this is not going to happen,i wont let you go"..its a rare feeling for someone in real life but its almost impossible for someone in reel life..  so my respect to shinichiro wantanbe from the bottom of my heart for directing the show so perfectly and congratulations to hajami yatate for writing something so perfect in itself..and kobayashi and yoko kanno,no man i ain't forgetting them either..the show wouldn't have been complete without their music which encompasses everything from jazz to metal to blues to country to electronic..I urge everyone who reads this comment to watch this show..doesn't matter if you're not an anime fan..this show is apiece of art and it must not be missed..and if you're an anime fan,then you wont be seeing something as great as this in a long time..i guess if you take my word,then you're in for one of your luckiest days of your life..  SEE YOU IMDb COWBOY..
Naderi's Amiro becomes larger than life in his next quest.
I found myself thinking about it at work the next day and laughing.
Does Marcus Adams want to be the next Danny Cannon?
You really couldn't care less who's going to die next, and I was hoping they'd all die soon so we could reach the finale of this cinematic calamity.
Let's hope Adams fares better the next time around.
I hope that next time he decides to do just one job--either write or direct.
At times it did seem that some of the actors were searching their memory for the next line to say, but in all, it was a very good movie.
The entertainment was in wondering what was going to happen to Lee next to prevent him leaving as he was constantly planning.
I'm looking forward to what Cherot will treat us to next.
If Hollywood producers were smart, they would stop wasting their time on has beens like Seagal and try to make Gary Daniels the next big thing in action movies.
There is absolutely no doubt as to what is going to happen next, and very, very little as to when or where.
I await the release of the next seasons on DVD.
From one scene to the next, the stories are never quite fully developed until the end, kind of like a soap opera.
It is one of those types of pictures in which many different characters, with their own dilemmas, are left till the next time around to pick up where they left off in their sequence.
Sometimes one story will be within another, and other times a character from one story meets one from another, and the camera abandons the previous story for the next.
This film is brilliantly made and has great stories and the transition from one story to the next is fantastic.
As he has done in several of his movies, BuÃ±uel doesn't have a narrative thread through the movie choosing instead to connect each "tableau" to the next with the introduction of a random character that becomes one of the main ones in the following scene, creating a random series of events.
This movie is definitely not normal, it is really a bunch of shorts put together, each transition is just a character followed to another scene and can at times seem confusing; because its right when that short climax's and you are about to find out, and then it switches and you are on to the next one.
Though, somehow you would keep wanting to watch the movie to see what happens next.
I liked very much some parts, like, for example, the hypocrisy of the priests in a hotel, praying for the health of the father of a guest in a moment, and drinking and playing cards like gangsters in the next moment.
This film is like a relay, where one member of the ruling class passes the stick to the next, and never comes back to the vision of the audience.
Instead of being grateful for her amazing opportunity and letting the old bird show her off for a few hours and then quitting ballet the next day, she had to embarrass her.
The next show, the tank was gone.
However, when she came to work the next day, Brent's character was such a ridiculous and impossible to believe jerk that the film really began to spiral downward very quickly.
Then after it started, I walked off doing chores and taking care of things for the next day.
THe two men who play the American soldiers are truly pathetic all in all this is a film that should never have been made .I only hope Wesleys next film is better than this.Do not bother to watch this film you will only be disappointed .
The script is so bad that actors have absolutely nothing to work with, for a 90 minute movie it drags unbelievably from one scene to the next.
Miike pulled out the stops for this one giving us enough blood and guts to wonder what was coming next while allowing for his own unique style to peek through.
and the somewhat corny dialog such as "i am for you Sulu" when the program comes to take her next victim.
These old men get up to the most strangest of adventures, Compo being sexually obsessed with next door neighbour Nora Batty (Kathy Staff).
Wilde played the role for ten years, then he left, so next "third man", Seymour Utterthwaite (Michael Aldridge), a mad inventor.
Who was to be the next "third man".
I have even changed my next vacation from Greek Isles to Yorkshire.
When I go to England next time, I will definitely stop in Holmfirth, England, outside of Manchester to visit this charming little Yorkshire town.
I have seen this film many times but each time i enjoy watching it, it's the best film I have ever seen, Antonio Banderas did his best , he's a Cuban man loving an American girl but there's a problem : She was such a lier girl and a thief as well .Simultaneously she was in love with another man so after a while she took all Banderas money and ran away, Banderas started to find her in order to kill her .He Employs a detective to do so but guess who the detective is : It's her lover missing her too and is searching for her.What would happen next?
Then you can see a guy who looks like Mister T on a different vehicle in a scene, then in the next scene he's on a different vehicle and then back on the first vehicle.
Advice to Benson family: next time you get a new pet, do the poor animal a favor and DON'T name it Fred!
Pls, make more of these - I had a good time guessing what next would go wrong...
They were only broken into by a guy that wanted them dead, have a nutter living next door, who needs help?
I might even show it to my friends next time I have them round.
(How hard would it have been for the director to have Olga put her hand next to the victim's face, yank it back suddenly, then show that particular footage in reverse?)
If Steve Harris edits the next DVD, I am not buying it.
I just hope their next concert DVD (Ullevi, Sweden 2005 please - that show was awesome) is much better.
The next DVD looks like it'll be the Ullevi Stadium show from 2005.
The Shakespearean references and underlying philosophical "being and becoming" themes involving machine and human nature, elevate this above average Sci-Fi film to the "next level".
Back in Oklahoma, I would watch this show after Mary Hartman, then go to summer school the next day and laugh about it with my mates.
If I had as much money as they do, I'd still have to find some time to do some stuff not for profit... but for fun -- that's how you keep your goals in check and not purely based on how much money your next gig pays... keeps you straight, in line with your actual creative goals.
But all of the cast made this show one of those "gotta see the next episode" series that should have stayed around for a long time.
However with the success of "Brokedown Mountain" (critical NOT financial), I think I know what the next version of "Guess Who" is going to be and may god help us all.
One moment he's fiddling with the window, and a second later he's standing on the floor next to the bed.
And at the end of the go-cart scene, the two guys are surrounded by cars and trucks and the sound of a crash; and in the next moment, all the traffic is flowing smoothly around them.
After his first day in the restaurant, we follow Freddy as he roams the streets of the neighborhood next to the place he works.
In fact, the next day, I met him at Club Embargo and asked him not to beat me up!
This crazy person is played by Marshall Thompson, (Gunther Wyckoff) who is riding in a bus and sitting next to a lady who is trying to be friendly, but Gunther just looks straight ahead and views a gun that the bus driver had on his sun shade and just gets up and blows this driver away.
Now if you have ever seen any films from the 50's you should know what fate always falls upon the villain.If given the opportunity to see it you definitely should just to see a basic storyline before it became overdone, but if you need your movies to go from one moment of terror to the next this is not the movie for you; otherwise this film should hold you attention from beginning to end.
It'll give you ideas on what to do next to spark up your relationship.
The film moves along at a slow but steady pace and you do look forward to finding out what happens next or how a situation is resolved.
People have no where to turn, they have no tutors, no credible religious mentors, so they undertake the journey on their own and end up with loveless sex and the inevitable next step, a slow, but certain, death.
One moment characters are engaging in sexual activities, the next they are spewing pretentious dialog, and then they do something totally unexpected that is seemingly from another movie.
Being a French film, I do not think it was the intention of the director to create irony by his odd choice of playing "Happy Together" by the Turtles at the film's end when we see the son masturbating next to the dead body of his mother.
For all its efforts to pummel on a miserably superficial level, "Death Race" left me feeling nothingÂnot empathy for the characters, not excitement at the alleged "action" (which is cut so rapidly it's next to impossible to tell what's happening, and where), just a void left unfilled by anything resembling experience.
I've never been to a racing course myself, but I sure as hell hope that next summer I can go to the Edmonton Indy.
Each scene segues beautifully into the next, each is composed with the utmost care.
I am looking at showing Lyric at the "Reliant Center World Dog Show" in Houston this next Month.
There are suspenseful moments and one wonders what would happen next - outcome could be predictable yet its share of drama and humanity lessen not.
However what happened next were not what they expected.
I hope the comparatively enormous budget of Barcelona, Stillman's next film, healed the wounds he must have suffered in viewing this one.
The actors all seem to be standing around, with no sense of true life or action, waiting to spew out or be the recipient of the next unmotivated monologue.
The next day Micheal is late for class but everything is fine.
While at school Micheal receives a warning in the shape of yet another vision, a warning which tells him Christy (Melinda McCallum) will be the next to die, Micheal must try & save Christy & his remaining friends who were present at the sÃ©ance before this unknown source of evil kills all of them...
The manner in which the story is related is very much in keeping with the fragmented and paranoid mindset of Santiago and for this the director is to be commended for successfully achieving the next to impossible!
the characters are so involving you just have to put in the next tape even if you know what happens.
Good characters and a well written script always left me wondering where the plot was heading next.
Besides, the performance appears quite mixed: Ledoyen and Canet are paling into insignifiance next to DiCaprio.
I grew up on the television shows of the late 60's early 70's- you know- same bat time same bat channel stuff- I could handle the weekly cliff hanger, the anticipation for next weeks show, and still function in the world  So as each episode of '24' ended I was completely unprepared for the barrage of cliff hangers I was left with Â at minimum 3, will they kill the candidate, will they kill Jack's family, will they kill, catch or hurt Jack, will they will they- of course there were more issues and more story lines but hey I could only handle the Joker, the Penguin, and Mr.
How over the years the speed of information and technology has increased our capacity toÂblah blah blah Â No, I'm not one of those who pine for how things used to be, I don't want to go back to Green Acres or Gilligan's Island but I also don't want to be dragged through the next '24' hours wondering whose going to survive.
Every cliffhanger drives you crazy as you do not want to wait another week to see what happens next.
I needed to know what happened next every single episode, so now, I'm addicted.
It's like a roller coaster: it has many twists and turns, you never know what'll happen next, thrilling, exiting, and fun.
Each character ties perfectly into the next, and while there can be many different sub plots going on at once, they are all connected somehow, and go together so smoothly.
I was hesitant to watch the show, but my friend got me watching it on DVD, and I literally could not wait to toss in the next disk when an episode ended.
I am anxious to know what happens next.
After I finished, I could hardly wait for the next season.
I'm impatiently waiting for the next season because this show is truly one in a million.
A show needs to give me a good reason to watch next week.
The next best thing about this movie is the kooky story and underused but amazing stop motion aquatic life.
I've seen the next two episodes and parts of episodes 4-12 (My wife is watching the series - Her review would be, at least, Luke-warm but she does just like to veg in front of the TV).
Now I am waiting the next season I think now jack must have some peace in his life.
Watching 24 won't make you smarter or add anything new to your brains, but will definitely entertain you more than any other TV show for 43minutes and you'll pray till next Monday arrives!
Please Mr. Stone, next time you want to criticize the fascism of tv shows using violence to get high rates, avoid doing the same with your movie !
The 90's - A decade after the Reagan years and a time for the next generation to settle down and basque in the trails of excess that the previous decade left behind.
Will the next person she reads for live or die?
What's next?
Yeah the mom sang one song with a woman's voice and the on the next song she was a member of Blackstreet and then back to a woman's voice again...
Frances O'Connor, who holds her ground next to the indomitable Alice, plays her cohort, Lucy Burns, equally well.
I immediately checked out when the next showing was so I could see the whole thing.
I remember this movie serial as a boy in the thirties,we would ask our mother's for a penny on a Wednesday after school,and line up at the local movie house along with hundreds of kids..mostly boys,it always promised fast action,the Mystery Squadron who had their hideout in a mountain cave,the Black Ace the leader always seemed as though he would never would be revealed,would provide the bad deeds,as the action heated up thousands of young feet would stomp on the balcony floor,it was a wonder that it never collapsed.it would build to a crescendo,THEN it would stop suddenly,everyone would hold their breath as the hero would be put in seemingly inescapable peril,NEXT WEEK...see the next thrilling chapter,we would pile outside still gripped in the spell and discus with actions what had taken place,we would then speculate as to how he was going to get out of this latest fix,Bob Steele,Tom Mix,Hoot Gibson,Buck Jones,Ken Maynard,our heroes,who never kissed a girl,in our games no one wanted to play the Black Ace.Happy innocent days.
The potential this game shows, shows that the Dreamcast could compete technically with whats next with ease.   
I formed my first band the very next morning...
It's one of those kinda moovies that the herd luvs to pop into the vcr late at night, with a greasy pizza and a 6-pack of moo juice, knowing full well that their brains will not be required for the next 90 minutes or so.
It is another film that had next to no release & also made next to no money.
He gets a promotion, a brand-new office next to the big boss, Mr. Shelby (William H. Macy), and the company car.
Cuthbert looks great as always but nice to see her in a movie where some acting is required, i would find it hard to criticise though as the film "the girl next door" is my favourite film of all time and Cuthbert can do no wrong.
In Los Angeles, the lonely and paranoid Bob Maconel (Christian Slater) is a complete loser: at home, in spite of living in the same address for five years, his next door neighbor ignores his existence and he only talks to his alter-ego golden fish in his aquarium; in the office at ADD company, he is abused and humiliated by his colleagues and nobody has ever asked an opinion to him or invited him to a happy-hour.
When his next cubicle colleague has a breakdown and shoots his colleagues, Bob kills him with five shots and becomes a popular local hero.
Can You remember the scene where Rob Roy desperately holds the sabre of the opponent who is going to kill him in the next moment with his bare hand?!
However, I was able to temporarily suspend disbelief and liked what happened next.
Dern nails the role and let's hope for a Best Actress Oscar Nomination that WON'T happen next awards season.
It just draws me in with the sights and sounds and I want to see what appears on the screen next.
I'll try to catch it next time.
It saddens me to say this, because i love Tupac as much as the next bloke, but on his form in this film it's no bad thing that he now lies six feet under.
When I was in 7th grade, (so many years ago) I saw Sid Caesar in a movie called "Tars and Spars" In it he did a sketch called "Wings over Bermerschnitzen" I stayed for a second show and came back the next night and memorized it.
Mind Game sort of takes Waking Life's "all over the place" style (cartoony one moment, then rotoscoped the next) then adds a story and characters and a LOT of humor.
Maybe next time I watch, I'll keep the volume off and scan through the dialog scenes.
i think its like shooting a movie about Vietnam and having next to no shootings.
The movie is supposedly about a group of teen agers who are all pushing 26 or so that find themselves trapped in a web of terror & murder patterned after a movie script found in the basement of a house next to a studio.
In this film Alstair Sim (who would play Scrooge the next year) has his best performance in any film of his I have seen in addition to the classic as Wymans father.
Hitchcocks next Warner film would be Dial M For Murder.
Anyway, it's nowhere near as bad as the way the police act at the end of Hitch's next film, Strangers on a Train, where a cop shoots randomly at a crowd (with the criminal in it) and accidentally kills an innocent man!
It only picked up one half of a conversation between two characters in a booth... and they were sitting right next to each other!
Schipper tells the story of three friends and their last night together as one of them (Floyd) feels he have to leave town the next morning Â probably forever.
As Floyd' s probation has expired he's going to leave Hamburg the next day to see the world.
You want to see more about Ricco's family, about the barflies at Horst's and especially about Telsa, the girl next door (who is played incredibly cute and vulnerable by Julia Hummer in her film debut).
Floyd, Walter and Ricco have only one last night together to come to terms with the fact that Floyd will ship out on a freighter the next morning.
It begins fervently, excitingly, but as events go awry and daylight slowly inches over the horizon, the crushing reality of what is to follow sets in for the trio, who along the way also pick up their next door neighbour, the gorgeous but self destructive Tesla.
The next movie about alienation and made during this period - I am bound to love it!
There's a shot of an elderly woman in a wheelchair, dressed and coiffed beautifully, with her neck in a tortuous looking brace being pushed quietly through a service area on her way to the festivities and then a quick, jarring cut to James Gurley, one of Big Brother's guitarists, playing a psychedelic riff, then a quick cut back to the woman in the wheelchair, then back to the lobby floor festivities where Joplin is singing at the top of her lungs next to Sam Andrews playing guitar whilst well-dressed party goers (looking very decidedly unlike a typical Big Brother crowd,) boogie all around them.
Will Smith better be nominated for an Oscar next month!
Considering how the film is shot in the over white effect, the answer was clearly they are all dead...perhaps the oldest "twist" in the book next to "it turns out it's man!".
If you're looking for something more upbeat and redeeming, try out Eddie Murphy's next project.
Interrogating discarded support actors until the general direction of the next set is revealed.
and getting all hyped about that, the next hour is a pretty boring escapade.
I have seen most of the other air buds and am wondering what sports they will come up with next.
From one cut to the next, time might jump ahead six months or so.
I applaud you, and I will be checking out MISSIONARY MAN next and I hope it'll score as high on the Dolph-scale.
What a waste of an outstanding actress in the first segment The first segment had so much potential but then they moved on to the next segment... Miss Tree put the bird back in and the home was empty.
The next shock for me was to search here on the IMDb for it...
Each short is extremely action packed, which makes watching each micro-episode one after another a little exhausting, since you rarely even get a chance to catch your breath before the next section of action begins.
Due to the fact that this so-called Microseries sticks closer to the next two movies (Episodes II and III) than anything else, fans of the movies will be delighted to know that it remains true to the spirit of the Star Wars mythology despite additional sub-plots and newer characters.
I eagerly await the next Dolph film.
Fleeing the village, the group board a passing steam train, but soon learn that the locomotive is being controlled by gypsy black magic, and that their next stop will be an unscheduled rendezvous with the Satanic Serbians, who are keen to get their wedding ceremony under way.
Lenzi's next film, Le Porte dell'inferno, was further proofÂas if we really needed itÂthat the director's best days behind the camera had long since gone.
From that point on there's a real creepiness to the movie as the next two of Lucinda's prophecies come true, and John finally realizes what the final one (which didn't identify a number of people killed, but simply recorded "EE") is.
For example, the list of numbers show the worldwide disasters, but the next two big ones are only in New York??????
You may want to argue that point but the next time I hear Dakota Fanning scream in Dolby Digital 5.1 I swear to god I will slit my wrists.
It was interesting, scary, disturbing and I couldn't wait to see what happened next.
Naturally, he is at the location of the next accident just as he discovers this, a hideous plane crash complete with passengers running around covered in jet fuel and fire.
If you are one of these people whose "jaw hit the floor"Â turn your cell phone off next time.
There were parts where it kept you wondering what would happen next.
What happens next is another matter, and I don't want to get too rosy about it.
It felt like you were shadowing Keane's nearly every move from either over his shoulders or as you stood next to him.
It makes you wonder what's going to happen next?
You want to comfort William and pat him on the shoulder and say "don't be frightened, it will be alright" and the next moment you want to avoid him and "get away as fast as you can" because he is scary and disturbing and you never know which William you will encounter next.
When a woman, who lives next to him, starts trusting him and asks him to care for her daughter for a while, the audience just waits for the inevitable tragedy to happen.
One day Keane sees a single mother and child (Ryan and Breslin, both excellent) arguing with the desk clerk over money and he ingratiates himself by offering her a hundred dollars to get her by (earlier he is shown in a near similar sequence) and Lynn and Kira invite him over the next night for a takeout dinner.
Although I have not seen much of Damian Lewis' work in the US, the next time I see his name connect with any movie or TV program, I will be sure to watch.
I'm anxious to see what he comes out with next.
And I'm really looking forward to whatever Mr. Devaney does next.
And when the three of them finally sit down together next to the pool, Monk whips off her tiny swimsuit and sits down nekked, except it just isn't funny or arousing or anything.
The plot line is on the lame and predictable side, and the direction is next to non-existent.
j/k  Now lets hope that the next scary movie is not a piece of crap like this one.
Hank: And another Â£25,000 next please.
I really wonder what crap can come out of Hollywood next that can be worse than this film.
An undercover cop is sent to find out what's going on, by joining a prison-team at the next world most likely to be targeted.
Naturally things go belly up and what happens next amounts to a riotous invasion of Gremlins causing no end of destruction to the small town of Kingston Falls.
His portrayal of a man tempered by constant rejection, yet bravely holding on to dignity and hope that the next audition brings, is fascinating.
I put it up there next to "Quark" with Richard Benjamin.
I have to say that this is the worst video game I have ever played right next to Eragon.
I brought the PS2 version of this game and sold it back the next day, it was so unbelievably bad.
It is also really cool that it was made by a group of students for next to nothing.
John Gulager is the next Alfred Hitchcock for the Y-Generation.
The patrons in the bar spend the next 90 minutes battling the monster family.
It was also really funny, and the way the movie plays with character stereotypes had me guessing as to which character was going to get it next.
I wasn't a huge fan of the sequel, even though I have it in my DVD collection right next to the original.
Perhaps I jump ahead of Curtis here and suggest the next movie he should do, but it is directly in his trajectory.
I was searching on the internet for it and then walked into the next room and saw the closing scene on the TV!
Am absolutely gutted that I missed it and would be grateful if anyone could tell me when it was next on Sky.
But, much of this episode emphasizes the routine: we never find out anything more about the dead civilization - it's probably one of many the Federation finds and explores; ship's and crew's routines are viewed during the creature's stalking, notably Yeoman Rand and Sulu; there's a casual banter between Kirk & McCoy which we all came to appreciate and look forward to in the next 3 years.
His sidekick(s), Art, played by Alex Harz, brings some comical Rain Man or even Sling Blade behavior into the mix, while the blowup doll, Nancy, takes on the weird role of Dr. Ruth combined with Jonbenet Ramsey and the good old wholesome girl next door.
The film-making tandem of Tom Kennedy & Alex Harz, seem to have the potential to be the next Farrelly brothers or Trey Parker and Matt Stone: aiming for the limit of what audiences might stand in front of a screen.
As the multi-layered narrative weaves it way from one uncomfortable moment to the next, via hidden camera scenes too, one 'Question' keeps repeating in your mind; how the hell did this ever get made?
Wonder what the next season will hold now that Kate is gone.
Every episode brings something new to the table and makes viewers to nervously wait for the next one.
That's why we see Gary Sinsie breaking a terrorist, David Carusso putting his sunglasses and shaking the hand of his Mexican friend, who in the next episode, he may kill, after doing what they call "justice" OK, ladies and germs: for those that think that crime and justice are so easy words, I'm sorry to tell you: You're wrong.
Oh she had a few lines here and there that were light hearted and worth a giggle - usually at DiNozzo's expense - but for the most part she was played a little too 'boy next door, or trying to be' by Alexander.
The next day Micheal is late for class but everything is fine.
While at school Micheal receives a warning in the shape of yet another vision, a warning which tells him Christy (Melinda McCallum) will be the next to die, Micheal must try & save Christy & his remaining friends who were present at the sÃ©ance before this unknown source of evil kills all of them...
The Doom Generation has no real story, it is just a road movie in its most basic form, the characters just stumble from one scene to the next.
It lacks an intriguing plot and the characters aren't interesting or likable enough for the audience to care what happens to them next.
ASH versus his hand is some comic gold and is a great way to give you some breathing room when you're not terrified of what might happen next.
For example, when Linda's head tells Ash that "she is being tormented, and suffering in hell; you can feel a little scared but the next scene has a corpse without a head holding a chainsaw.
Of course we couldn't wait for the next terrifying episodes.
Buttram himself only cares about his new found status as owner of the mysterious contents, sitting next to it like some proud hayseed Buddha and keeper of the secret.
The next one on my list is Hrithik Roshan.
It's simply an irresistible combination, one that everyone in the cinema hall would attest to, given the full house, and the full house in the next screening.
I was expecting him to get out a hairdryer and an electric razor next.
Rai is slated to play Anarkali opposite Ben Kingsley's Shah Jahan in an upcoming film and has yet another role as the pining courtesan in Bhansalli's next, "Bajirao Mastani."
I remember liking his next film, FORCE: FIVE, better than this one, but I've been unable to find a copy of it (this one I found at Netflix).
When I listened to the song "Gloomy Sunday', I felt this chill spreading through my body, as if I was going to be the next victim.
One night is spent with Andras and the next one with Laszlo, who after all, is the one with the money and paying the bill!
Were also given to understand that David's next door, and somewhat unstable, neighbors have something to do with the weird and deadly goings on at David and Emily's country home.
The next door neighbor Laura and Steven, Melissa Leo & Robert John Bork, are a bit odd who's actions can be explained that their young daughter recently died of cancer and look upon Emily as a replacement for her.
The next day, Emily is in a mental hospital and the family decides to move out.
He follows without telling and the next thin we see is a face touching across his face.
i still don't understand the story now about if Charlie was part of the dad or a thing that went into different people , cos what was with the pervy next door neighbour ???
Their role is more to provide the necessary little nudges to justify our stars' next dazzling feats.
Ms. Hamilton would later that year or next become familiar as Fred Sandford's girlfriend Donna Harris on "Sandford and Son".
It will make you think more kindly towards her the next time she, well, acts like Miss.
Cromwell did wonders with Betty Davis the next year when they did,"Of Human Bondage"...
Mr. Powell was exactly the same as he was the next year in, "The Thin Man"--- so, it would be my suspicion that Ms. Harding rose to the 'occasion' on her own 'horse'.
In fact, she makes everyone else pale by comparison - Powell is his usual charming self, but next to Harding he comes off as a typical Hollywood performer.
Characters are full of charm, flesh and blood, and life... yes, Central European life after WWI (some visits to the area are still a good help in order to take better understanding... but be careful because later the understanding becomes LOVE forever, I can assure)   Just waiting the next one by Menzel, based on another classic by Bohumil Hrabal: I served the King of England.
But the bliss is threatened by the arrival of Cedric's drag-queen, admirer (Celia Imrie) Â   Emma Thompson is the next Helen Mirren/Meryl Streep without a shadow of a doubt and here is a prime example.
Think of 'Mary Poppins' if Roald Dahl had written the character and you have an idea of what happens next!
In one shot you can see my house and the bar next door.
I see this guy's next movie will star Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards, that one looks like it will be one worth watching in theatres, not just because of the talented actresses but because it sounds like it has a great plot and story.
I'm looking forward to seeing what the director does next.
I should mention that while there is no Lindsay Lohan nudity per se, there are some extremely raunchy scenes involving close shots of various body parts of Dakota's while she is wearing next to nothing and writhing around a stripper dance pole.
This role was a good next step in my opinion.
Better luck next time -- if there is one for Lindsay.
The actors playing Charles and Camilla were excellent, helped by some of the best dialogue I've heard in ages - effortlessly witty at one moment, direct and emotional the next.
For some reason, it came out choppily edited and one scene jumped a bit too abruptly to the next.
Lastly: I'm going to be starting medical school next year and I'll definitely be taking this movie with me.
Pawlik was said to have the best chance to win the next European and World titles.
ART OF THE DEVIL 2 is another one that I had to watch as an import VCD with no subs/dubs as the U.S. release doesn't hit til next month - so anything I say about the film is based strictly on what I "saw" - as I have no idea what anyone was saying.
Regarding the storyline,I'm not writing to spoon feed anyone;you can read it for yourselves but I am stating that when it next pops up on Turner,take a peek.
Hot Bubblegum is the third entry in the Isreali Lemon Popsicle series.There are nine films in the entire series.I have seen the first three because they are on youtube.Part of the fourth film is on youtube and the whole film should be up soon.Anyway Hot Bubblegum is not as good as Lemon Popsicle 1 or 2(which was the best one), but it is still a funny 1980's teen sex comedy with a good mix of drama and romance in it.My only problem with this film is Bobby and Benji are always friends even after the events of the first and second film.In those, they always fight and never become friends again, yet in the next sequel, they are best friends as if nothing has happened.Also Nicki from the first film(played by a different actress) returns.Benji and her date and talk as if none of the events of the first film happened.Also in the first film, she seemed like a nice girl, yet in this one she's a b**ch!
There is no real foe or a villain worthy enough to be superman's rival, given superman: TAS and JLU gave us darkseid, one can only imagine who could fill the next big villain boots.
And with the season finale of Sundown and seeing all the members of the Legion I can't wait until next season.
The Inca convinces Pizarro that if he is put to death he will be brought back to life at dawn of the next day by the Sun god.
I really hope that one day a network will show it again to the next generation of children.
None the less this was a firm favourite amongst young British lads for the next 10 years or so.
Is this all just a dream and Suzanne Plechette is lying next to us when we open our eyes?
One day he likes Rose and then the next minute he becomes a horrible monster.
That other time wasn't till the next year when I picked up the game around 2004 and played it I figured out what to do and spent months training up playing the game.
They shouldn't be spending so much energy when they might need it in the next few hours, but they can't help it.
While recognizing the vast difference between the usual depth of O'Neill dramas and this warm remembrance of an idealized youth O'Neill might have imagined wanting in middle class Connecticut at the start of the 20th Century, students of the playwright must view this play (and film) next to his more obviously autobiographical masterpieces A LONG DAY'S JOURNEY... , MOON FOR THE MISBEGOTTEN and the sea plays (filmed collectively as THE LONG VOYAGE HOME) for a complete understanding of the author.
The men are coming to repossess his car but he escapes and parks it into a garage next to a house that he believes is abandoned.
The movie opens with the bullet-riddled body of a young man floating face down in the pool next to a mansion.
At one stage you could see the camera and sound men the next shot pans too.
I rented the DVD years ago, and look to buy it for my collection... to put next to my soldier and starship troopers dvds, no less.
After this directorial debut I can hardly wait to see what he can come up with next!
It contains great casting,an interesting plot,& the interaction of all the charismatic characters kept me glued as to what they'd say & do from one moment to the next!
I can express with great certainty that the editing could have been better as often there are instances when the screen goes dark for several seconds in between scenes, leaving the audience wondering what's next.
So they decide to start experimenting with spouse-swapping, with the hot-to-trot married couple next door.
Biller's strength is in the tonal shifts; one moment she can be playful and fun, and the next moment deathly serious.
I'm curious how she found funding for this film in this day and age and am eagerly looking forward to her next one.
I loved this film because I never knew what was going to happen next, despite it following the model of '60's/'70's sexploitation films pretty closely.
Who will have sex next?
The next contest featuring Sean O' Haire accompanied with Roddy Piper who had insulted O' Haires opponent Rikishi this was the worst match of the night only lasting 6 minutes with O'Haire using a death valley driver to pick up the impressive yet boring win.
The next massive World Tag Team title match featured current champions Rob Van Dam and his partner Kane squaring off against The Dudley Boyz with the odds against RVD and Kane.
The next 6 Man Tag Match featured 6 former World Champions the first team of Booker T, Shawn Michaels and Kevin Nash against team 2 Triple H,Ric Flair and Chris Jericho.The match quickly took action as all 6 superstars got involved as fast as they could at the end Triple H (shockingly) pinned Kevin Nash after a pedigree.
I need to take this next paragraph to smash on the music alone.
1934 was really Colbert's year, with this, Cleopatra, and her Oscar-winning role in It Happened One Night (which I'll watch in the next couple of days, incidentally).
It jumps from one strange bit to the next, including things such as, a doctor who has sex with a sheep, newly weds with bedroom problems, a transvestite caught in public, a game show satire called "What's My Perversion" (ironically featuring a younger Regis Philbin), and the funniest being a mad scientist whose breast implant experiment breaks loose and a giant silicone filled tit roams the countryside, eventually being caught in a huge bra.
The sets are spectacular and would set the ground work for the Woodster's next science fiction movie "Sleeper".
One year later, the teachers and students who mocked him start dying, each one leaving a clue as to who will die next.
Guess who Detective Dimwit brings in the next day?
Seriously, didn't know what to expect next.
The pace at which the plot moves is extremely intense; it seizes the attention of the audience and leaves them waiting for the next scene.
But it always bugged me in Bambi, that in one scene his mother dies and his father takes him away, and then, in next scene Bambi is big and everybody is happy.
It's almost as if the writers had no idea of what to do next, so we get to see exciting scenes like the wife staring at a window for 30 or so seconds.
I wanted this to be a fun movie - I like a fun, cheesy action film as much as the next person - but this movie didn't even try.
There are animals galore that are mean one minute, tame the next, and can rip off a leg, and make it disappear in a millisecond.
And yet, this happens throughout the film and makes viewing and enjoying it next to impossible.
Things to watch for: the explorers climb a cliff with no supplies, but somehow a huge tent filled with sleeping cots is set up in the next scene; the plane diary is in English in a Chinese movie and although the jungle girl can only grunt, she can read the handwriting in the diary with no trouble; the "costume" she wears keeps peeling off when she runs...you can even see some of the glue peeling in a couple scenes; AND, the tree-climbing scene is NOT to be missed!!!!
After asking the wise owl, just how many licks does it really take to get to the center of a tootsie role tootsie pop, I found the time to ponder & reflect my next visit to McDonalds.
Only one group encounters a single zombie before they make their way, and they miraculously act like they all know each other perfectly the next morning.
End shot, next scene somewhere completely different.
So, one day, Wong is a sweet cabaret dancer and the next she's expected to carry out a plan for murder--and at first she agrees wholeheartedly.
Having ripped off Rambo, Indiana Jones seemed the next obvious target, but their back-to-back sequel to 1985's King Solomon's Mines, one of their least unsuccessful films (well, it lost less than most of them), proved a disaster on every conceivable level.
The closest it comes to charm is when the real cold that Stone is obviously suffering in one scene is clearly caught by Chamberlain in the next.
Maybe better luck next time.
And hopefully the next role Uma picks will have a little more spice to it as it is always pleasant to see her on-screen, and she usually has better judgment.
You might want to rethink that technique for the next one, Ben.
Imagine, for a moment a giant staircase where you must look at travel brochures of London or slides of a dog show for five minutes after which time you are forced to jump onto the next step and land squarely on your head.
So the 3 ninjas are spending the day at a theme park with their nerdy next door neighbor friend, Amanda.
Part of me spent the next 85 minutes hoping I was wrong about my prediction, sadly I was not.
), somebody just finishes saying no upon the pain of death to one person when this character suddenly seems too afraid of dying to reject the next person wanting the same thing.
Evident are a lack of story, character study or anything that resembles "action", instead, one dumb scene is added to the next.
since there aren't too many of those we it becomes clear very early in the movie what will happen within the next 90 minutes.
as a movie buff it always worries me when they reveal most of the next events so early in a movie.
Over the next few weeks they bond into best friends, not caring that they are somewhat removed from the rest of the campers and counselors in the entire place.
However, one day, luck might seem to change, as a stroll through the park she meets Dorothy while sitting a park bench, an unusually intriguing one who just happens to move in to her apartment building the next day.
OK.......so what happens next?
At one time, after a dialogue is finished, the camera stays focused extreeeeemely long on a guy's face instead of cutting away to the next scene.
This is one for Malone, and I hope his next movie will make me bow at his feet and forgive him for the 5 bucks I wasted on this movie
for the next 20 minutes i just see someone is digging, and a few lines coming from someone's mouth, then followed by goodnight sleep.
I look forward to these film makers next film, and hope they have a bigger budget, but mostly I urge them to find a better script.
Scott battered and bruised tells Lucinda that if she doesn't give the persons who worked him over the money, $100,000.00, the next time he won't be so lucky.
Maybe she felt too stereotyped as "America's Sweetheart" or the next "Audrey Hepburn" -- I don't know.
The ghosts were almost incidental apart from the next door neighbour using smelly devices to keep the ghost away.
What happens next?
Everyone else seems to be just mannequins standing around waiting for the next plot twist to fall on them.
The kids arrive, are locked away in a northern room, and that's where they stay for the next few years.
Which brings me to my next point - Cathy's thing is ballet - she's an excellent dancer - and aside from a couple of pathetic scenes involving Swansen trying to get her leg higher than her hip-bone, they ignored the one thing that the entire character centres around.
One can only hope the principals of this picture will learn something from this, and do two things with their next film -- slow it down to a brisk walk, so that the plot can develop, and hire an actor who can express nuances, and something emotional, besides disgust.
I'm going to cry in the dark for the next few hours.
I expected to see some serious scary sci fi thriller, but instead this movie was extremely predictable... on what will happen next and blah blah blah.
One thing for certain, The next time I see this film it will probably be on "Mystery Science Theater 3000" getting about the same review...
When I first watched this short, I actually was enjoying the new footage and when I saw the reused footage, I was quite dissapointed and when I saw reused footage from another episode, I was even more dissapointed and I think this short is only worth for the first 5-6 minutes and I understand that Curly was ill during this time and I think that Curly was more sick than usual in this short although Curly seemed more healthier in the next two shorts 'Uncivil Warbirds' and 'Three TroubleDoers' although his condition went even more downhill in the two shorts after that.
But with creativity and an inventive idea, this movie takes micro financed film-making to the next level.
I like good horror like the next guy,I don't ask for a whole lot but I do expect a decent film to keep me entertained for 90 minutes.
While the film was quite watchable (mainly through waiting for the next glimpse of Bolo), i had a few problems with it - firstly, the bad dubbing, but of course thats a given in old kung fu films.
In one breath she's trying to be 'deep' about the bland story, and in the next she's "selling" this entire cheap project as something stupendous.
Good luck filmmakers--hope to see a better movie next time -- but I doubt it'll happen.
Mick, please try for your more subtle brand of humour next time.
I just return from watching this movie at SXSW Festival here in Austin and I just gotta say that this is a perfect example of what you can accomplish just by having a good idea and lots of creativity to take it to the next level.
Now I will have to wait for the next Batman to see Oldman in a good film.
I think he is a good actor but next to Gary Oldman, he was less interesting.
I think that shows how strong Gary Oldman is that brilliant actors like Considine seem to fade next to him.
Adam picks it up, and for the next hour, an Islamic extremist (who has kidnapped his mother and sister) threatens to kill Adam's family if he doesn't follow every single order he's given.
She seems to think she's the next Meg Ryan -- she's not even close.
The funniest thing happened next: a strange woman who didn't even know her own name or the dog's showed up a couple of minutes later and I just let her right in!
On top of that, they seem most concerned with finding a place to warm up instead of the fact that their boyfriends are dead and they're next.
The acting varies from decent to very, very poor, from one scene to the next.
after the brilliance of the original series and next gen, the darkness of ds9 voyager does what no one else was able to do, kill off star trek.
Only redeeming value is younger kids might find it amusing until the next pet food commercial comes out.
Whats next?
The car apparently hit something and the fuel tank ruptured, spilling fuel all over the ground next to the car.
In "Sorry, Wrong Number," Barbara Stanwyck had the phone next to her bed, and that was during Hollywood's Golden Age.
Several of my friends that saw the first tour said it was good, but when they saw the next tour they felt that the Get Back Tour was just a rehearsal for the one in 1993.
This video goes on my shelf next to "Give my Regards to Broadstreet".
Which doesn't make a lot of sense because there's a scene where an 1800's doctor with no eyes or mouth and one monster arm (yes THE 1800's doctor with no eyes or mouth and one monster arm) kills some broad in the house and the babysitter cleans up the blood the next day to hide it.
His next victims are the New York psychologist and his family who move there to study suicide.
Some of the "going down into the basement" scenes are kind of suspenseful... but this is negated by the totally over-the-top blood and gore that is usually the next step.
The gory deaths are so horrifying that I think it's a good idea that they were cut out so that you don't just zone out and miss the next 20 seconds of intense action and suspense!
when they would cut from one character to the next, it did not line up right.
You watch the film because, like the men in the tunnel you don't know what is coming next.
I thought the acting was the WORST part of the movie, next comes the production, this editing is scratchy, the camera-work is lacking and the music is at times weird and randomly inappropriate.
Better luck next time.
Ultimately this film can't hold a candle to director John Hughes' next project, The Breakfast Club, which does a considerably better job capturing the exploits of mid-80's high schoolers without all the two-dimensional, misanthropic portraits of the older generations cluttering up the movie as they do here.
Paul and Joe sneak back into the estate because, well, they're men and that's exactly what I'd do, and soon the seven of them party into the next day.
The broken airplane hanging on a string, the Lionel train, the village with the name "Plasticville" on the side,the Bernz-O-Matic torch sticking out of Godzilla's mouth, all of these things and so many more make it an absolute agony to watch, in fact, that's what makes it so good: waiting for the next scene to see if it will possibly be any worse than the last one!
Hollowborn is in charge of a group of young soldiers who risk their lives everyday where one slip is fatal even being warned not to smoke the night before they go into the tunnels the next day because the VC can smell the smoke on them.
The next day, the squad goes on a simple "Search and Destroy" mission, but all hell breaks loose and each man must fight for his own life in order to survive.
To all of you i have but one Warning : the next level is UWE BOLL!
Anyways, next time you're in Boston, please be careful in Chinatown, you might fall victim of spontaneous time traveling...
This film tries to twist and surprise you which it doesn't do and you find her transition, jumpy and forced, instead of a steadily realisation she just seems to wake up or click instantly into this next stage of realisation (after punching a woman in the face.. hmmm.. our heroine suddenly develops a very strong south American accent and this quick transition comes across as purely ridiculous.
Awful with a capital A, if anyone actually derives any entertainment in the least from this (and I'm very hesitant to use this next word) film, I'd NEVER want to meet them during my travels, if only for the reason that they'd in all likelihood end up drooling all over my shoes.
Here the film takes a sharp turn into obvious bad movie making with a Must To Avoid in capital letters: the dual personality theme is abruptly dropped and forgotten for the next 30 minutes or so.
You next get lots of terrible stock footage of African animals and the plot takes a side road as the husband hunts down two tigers.
But it was also sappy from start to finish--and also made war seem pretty cool--like a recruitment film for the next war.
I watched the first 30 minutes with genuine interest and curiosity, wondering what was going to happen next, and even thinking that this movie was promising, very different from most that I have seen.
They're rumored to have about eight more planned for the next few years.
For example, one minute she is alone in the world after the revelations about her ex-boyfriend, the next, she is in bed with a massage colleague and has been made pregnant by him.
The only sad thing is that no longer could you imagine seeing movies as plays on the stage, something which was very easy with the old rather over-acted melodramas...  Keep up the good work and I for one will be waiting for the next release!
(sounds like Exorcist III).He then hangs himself the next day in guilt.The mysterious characters continue with a lady with a glass eye (Mrs.Morioriti)who tells the story about the priest.
It's never said exactly when the next scene takes place but Dennis is walking OK so I'd have to assume its at least 6 or more weeks later (thats how long a broken ankle would stay in plaster).
I couldn't last more than probably 1/3 of the way through it before I shut it off and went on to my next DVD.
Worse, earlier crises are left unresolved before the next one hits.
I read in the papers that W.Snipes was broke so no wonder he would take parts in low budget projects like The Contractor.He is just the next action star to join a growing club:the penniless action stars of the 90s (Van Damme,Segal,Lundgren,Snipes).
The Great New Wonderful - a mixture of 5 stories in NYC set in Sept 2002 - a mix of comedy and angst- this low budget movie has several recognizable faces including Stephen Colbert,Edie Falco, Jim Gaffigan , Maggie Gyllenhal,Will Arnett & Olympia Dukakis- but the guys that stole the movie were the 2 Indian bodyguards that lived next to each other.This felt like an art-house movie- nothing wrong with art-house flicks I guess- but after awhile I get tired of the meloncholia and the intrusive soundtracks.This comes out on Tuesday and has the option of watching the movie either as one story or as 5 stories- while all 5 stories have some interesting moments- the best one is the bodygaurd arc.
I also love how the  hero/heroine are thrown out of the resort one scene & the next  they go back to have a drink.
An all-purpose stream of overlapped yells too often substitutes for dialog - in this scene for fright, that one excess, the next one anger.
Apparently not....apparently no security cameras at the new asylum captured a few of the inmates walking out to go wreak havoc next door.
Better luck next time.
1 (2003) to this as his next film?!
This despite the previous poem by an inmate being titled "I shot three mother" you can guess the next word "and I don't know why".
The crew escape back to Earth without a solution to the problem (luckily the red cloud dissipates freeing Earth till the next time.)
Don't judge the next three serials based on this one.
Special note must me given to the director who aspires to be the next Orson Welles but this film shows that he is a failed Ed Wood.
The time-line is also confused, mixing day and night, i.e., in one scene it is day, and the next one it is night.
We don't care about a car that could never exist and if it did we would be able to afford it or worse it could become like the next DeLorien car.
It brings its own array of bizarre characters and situations, mixing them with the locals, and then takes them away again just as quickly, until next year when some of them come back for more.
If you're looking for El Charro to introduce you to next round of cinematic genius, you'll be sorely disappointed.
The next time that the investors decide to invest in a movie I hope they remember how pitiful this one was and decide against it.
The film doesn't know what it wants to be, one minute it's going for the intense dramatic angle with a girl coping with the suicide of her sister, the next it features snore inducing stereotypes trying to party, and get laid.
And over the next couple of years, the cult of Metallica became so feverish it was literally impossible to escape mention or playback of the band.
Oh well, let's move on to the next scene.
The characters weren't interesting, you can have movies where the characters are cold, detached, and live meaningless lives, and make them interesting, these characters weren't interesting, I didn't care what happened next.
Thriller is used for movies that have you on the edge of your seat and have you guessing about what twists and turns the main character will see next.
I would bet my life it was him next to me today.
Again he was right next to me so I was not seeing him from across the theater.
And make sure the next time you sell your story to Hollywood to get paid enough money so you can take it a little easier when the "Filmmakers" butcher your work (who likely did not want you interfering with them cause THEY know how to make films, not some writer)!
Why make a lead character (who had an actually good story to tell) along with a set of new characters when their next step is to shine the spotlight on the old set of characters?
Everyone in the neighborhood saw everybody else practically every day; couldn't they just get their money back the next day?
I really hope his next effort will be more thought out.
And, given the amount of blood that appeared in the scene, it's hard to explain why there isn't even a mark on Willard's hand the next time we see him!
The character's & dialogue are poor, their decision making is hopeless & at times strange, some of the scenes here are just plain ridiculous & make no sense, it's too long at 100 odd minutes, it has next to no gore or exploitation & it's just very badly written & thought out right down to a none event of an ending.
Also, the script is incredibly witty in some places, and incredibly meaningful in the next.
And next time include some solid facts and references.
TCM showed the David Niven version of "Raffles" the other night, so I went to check on it in my library and found this movie sitting next to it, that I'd taped years ago but hadn't yet watched.
and gives him a blow job, and then throws a childish tantrum because Cute Neighbor wants to leave the next morning.
(Coincidently, The next and last installment "Battle For The Planet Of The Apes" is well worth watching, and I'd recommend it and all the other apes movies over this one)  
The story: Two people decided to hole up in a small room at a rundown motel so he could write his next great play while his girlfriend works at a menial job in town to supporting him.
The bad: The next 83 minutes of the movie.
"The Making Of The Off Season" "Well we went to this small town in the middle of BFE and I had my sister's hand held camera and I handed my friends the napkins I had wrote the play on and we had a pizza and some beer and by the next morning I had a movie."
Then the exploitation-fun continues, as the bare plot wheels away until I couldn't really care less about whatever really happened with most of the characters, and just wondered when the next big huge violent gush of blood would occur.
Its rather predictable what would happen next.
South African cinema has moved to the next stage in evolution i.e.
However, I will say the character development is quite nice at one point but all got smothered in the next scene.
She's in one moment and out the next.
There's nothing to assume he won't do the same thing next week.
I like Hudson Leick as much as the next guy (and probably more than most of the next guys), but even for her, this movie is just not worth watching.
The casting on the other had was next to perfect.
Do I expect to see this on TV again next year?
NBC has ruined a classic, I hate to think what they will try next year.
It was all we howled about in school the next day.
I lost track of the amount of scenes we have to endure where characters introduce themselves to other characters after a few episodes (in the second episode alone, Chris introduces himself to Sonic, then the next day introduces himself to Tails and Cream, who introduce themselves to Chris, who introduces them to his grandfather), and the lack of action the setting forces upon us (Sonic and company moves into Chris' household, and have to hide from everyone else for a few more episodes, then get the attention of the outside world after that) forces the writers to hammer out awkward "Komedy" (like the excruciating seventh episode, where Cream spends most of the time hiding from the household while a party is being hosted and generally gets into all sorts of wacky hijinks) to try and make the complete lack of action more tolerable, but are really just making the show even less dignified than the fourth Home Alone movie (you know, the made for TV one with French Stewart as Marv).
and Cream comments on a game of catch in such an awkward, mangled fashion I was on the floor laughing), often for no reason, but that actually makes things entertaining, as you never know when he's going to do it next.
Most of the pot growers start getting sick by the next day, cough up blood and then become raving lunatics who kill random people for their blood.
There's next to no gore or violence in it, a chopped off hand, cut off leg, a few gunshot wounds and a few splashes of blood here and there, that's it.
Give Deadwood a shot and you will be hooked, the worst part is waiting until next week for another episode.
I don't think they should list actors in the credits unless they have prominent roles, and if they do, then maybe the word "bit part" should be next to their names.
I saw it on the next day I saw "Gulaam" on TV.
Perhaps next time he will interview at least one skeptic or scientist who has an education beyond 3rd grade.
The thin trunks of topless trees can't camouflage the old man in black whose convergence with the woman and the boy is halted by the next anxious moment.
Long time TV Director Rick Rosenthal isn't used to making something longer than 45 minutes and isn't used to the fact that we need to know about these characters in the run time of a film because they won't be back next week to give us more.
Ashley Johnson is decent enough, and probably has more depth than most of the other characters combined as the next door neighbor best friend of Henry.
And Sangster matches him beat for beat; scenes have no pacing, they're just there, fulfilling their plot function (most of the time -- there's no payoff to Victor getting the dean's daughter pregnant), and then going slowly on to the next sequence; each scene is laden with boring talk.
There's some humor in the film (and some failed attempts at it), the best joke being Victor's body-part number appearing (in his imagination) on the forehead of the next "donor."
"Empire of the Ants" is an interesting epitaph for a genre that has long since passed, but its best possible fate will probably be drunken viewing at your next house party.
looks like we have the next Golan globus.
is still kicking away and if this is any indication of what we should expect from Chuck Norris for the next couple of years, perhaps it's not such a bad idea that he peddles total gym commercials.
Among her favorite flicks there were Vincent Price's stuff (deliberate camp); among her least favorite flicks were Doris Day's stuff (the wholesome girl next door).
At one point Al pays a cabbie $100 so he can drive his taxi, then takes the opportunity to drive around explaining the plot instead of racing to the next location.
Moving on, the Pacino character meets with the D.A investigating the Jon Forster case in the next scene.
I wish Ms. Redford more luck next time.
All the characters have a handful of human-like expressions that are supposed to make the viewer identify with them, and these expressions are recycled over and over and over from one movie to the next.
That goes on with the next scene in which the aspiring knight Tiuri just has to sit quiet in a chapel for one night.
They just ride next to one another through the endless woods.
Mysterious murders begin plaguing the town, and Leslie and Jana become the next targets!
Thank god it tanked, let's pray it taught a few people to actually read the screenplay before they make the film next time.
It seems my boss at the time (Fred) felt so bad the next day he went back and killed the deal, much to the dismay of the head of MTM (and Mary's husband) but being that he actually managed to sell a Joey to an Aussie nothing was said about it... No other network through 88 worldwide bought it to my knowledge...
For example, large, cumbersome hallway vehicles inside of space stations in which astronauts may sit and enjoy the ride while others can just walk beside the slow moving motorized box while moving from one hallway to the next bend.
So, as you can see, the special effects and costumes are next to none but it sure doesn't stop there !
How about the romance in which Joan and Jack argue one minute and make love the next.
Right next to Double Dragon.
But "No Vacancy" is worth seeing just to fully appreciate the miracle physical transformation that took place between it and her next film, "Sleepy Hollow".
The relationship between Randy and Mahogany materialized out of no where, one minute they barely knew each other and the next they're kissing on a river, and Randy has a gun?
I should have left this so-called movie 30 minutes in and gone to see "Superbad" in the theater next door.
The movies plot doesn't make a lick of sense and ambles on from one random scene to the next.
Another scene has Daytona refusing to join Rodriguez in taking down Feng, only to learn that a water park has been built next to his father's tombstone.
When Balls of Fury does manage to include some original jokes, it involves stuff like the aforementioned water park being built next to a tombstone, which sadly enough, is less funny then the blind man falling down a staircase.
They should have made a new movie called the thorn birds: the next generations that takes place after Ralph's death.
Complete with an awful, overly sentimental soundtrack next to which even Coldplay seem lively and heavy.
Hopefully Gael will perform better in his next work.
If Sam didn't want Buck's advances, and knew he was sick (the stunted mental state, not any reference to being gay), why would he want him next door?
I guess their next move would have been to throw a banana peel in front of its feet.
They have a haggard mother who catches the vapors every 12.5 minutes and they all live next door to a worm farm(that figures)which is run by a skeleton named Mr. Beardsley and his hired hand Roger.
Third, there are numerous red herring "boo" scenes, even Condon admits this, which greatly limit the fear factor after a while; because, we're just waiting for the next false alarm to "scare" us.
But as is the case with performers who have either left the studio in a bad way, or were known for being erratic, disruptive, or plain uncooperative, or could not make the transition from one period of their career to the next (in this case, silents to talkies), they were immediately replaced with performers who could fill their shoes.
The guys in this film are the type of people I would like to see killed in the next university shooting.
It's amazing that this first 1950s Hercules film was the stimulus that led to bazillions of Hercules and Maciste films over the next 15 years.
For the next 98 minutes i was subjected to an exercise in mind numbing tedium that will never be equalled.
I would say that this is one film to avoid if possible, unless you want to spend next bonfire night burning effigies of the Wachowski brothers.
Tony awards and a Pulitzer prize notwithstanding, RENT drones from one barely memorable song to the next, trying to be soulfully operatic but revealing its greatest weakness: it's faux operetta can't conceal that it is an utterly trivial story about utterly trivial people.
This, next to Volcano, is the worst Tommy Lee Jones film I've ever seen.
It's low budget, so badly acted you'll want to gouge your eyes out, unintentionally hilarious, blatantly homoerotic (Elliott having trouble choosing between his "boys" and his girlfriend, Elliott's "boys" sleeping half-naked next to each other) and it gave me the impression that Claudio Fragasso has a fetish for the colour green.
Maybe next time a family will move to a town named Llort and the adventures will start all over again.
Oh yeah, and maybe next time they'll throw in some gratuitous nudity to transition the scenes.
The lead actor seems like he's positioning himself as the next Jean Claud Van Damme--he's got the physique and accent but, unfortunately for him, the role is entirely dialogue driven and he can't act at all, at least not in English.
The next day, the mummy is gone too.
For the next hour we see the couple have sex, talk about sex and wonder about the lone man who they're sharing the lodge with.
Are there anymore "black " films like this coming next year?
What are her next movie project?What is her name?
The next day everybody shows up at the church in their finest garb, but poor Mia has no idea why Lance is tardy.
Better luck next timeÂ.
While discussing her feelings the next day with her Psychiatrist Dr. Jeffery Rosenberg (Richard Benjamin) he finds out about the bite and says that she has been bitten by a Vampire & also that he is a descendant of infamous Vampire hunter Van Helsing.
One moment he appears to be frightened by Jacob Marley's ghost, the next he's calmly helping lift Marley's jaw when his jaw-wrap is untied.
I can't wait to see what he does next.
i went to see this movie with some friends and i was sitting on the end with one of my best friends next to me, and we kept giggling.
my expectations were fairly high as i see Lindsey Lohan as the next big thing.
I hope Lohan's next film will have the wit of a 'Mean Girls' again.
If you accidentally pick this one up at the video store instead of that good movie next to it, fast-forward to about an hour into it, watch as Ice Cube uses an aircraft carrier's catapault to launch an APC into a tank, and immediately turn off your TV.
I love action films just as much as the next guy, but this was a high budget piece of crap if you asked me.
This would leave the Secretary next in line for Presidency.
Maybe for the next sequel, we could get M'onique or Anthony Anderson to star?
Action sequences are spaced every ten minutes or so as bookends to move Cube onto the next dilemma, each new sequence becoming further and further detached from reality (the final twenty minutes is utter insanity that makes films like Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle seem like documentaries).
Willem Dafoe typecasts himself as the overacting bad guy yet again and X-Zibit pops in so he can possible audition for the lead in the next sequel xXx3: Turkey Season.
You pretty much can predict what is coming next all the way through the story.
It did not set the world on fire to my memory.I can only hope they inject the next Forigner sequel with some class,imagination,Less stunt doubles and a livelier Seagal.If not then leave Jonathon Cold on Ice.
2 women start fighting dressed, in the next shot they are naked (because a lesbian scene in-between has been omitted).
In one shot it is night, in the next shot it is day.
In one shot the prisoners are in a circle, in the next shot they have formed lines.
Sometimes things are best left unanswered for the next two films get even worse.
Like some of the others, I would like to know more about the historical Reno Brothers and how closely this film represents their true story; I'm sure that it's somewhat closer than Elvis' ''Love Me Tender'', which is about the same topic and came out the next year.
The movie was full of countless clichÃ©s: saving her future charge from being run over in the park while his mother is nowhere to be found, being forced to live in a shoe box of a room next to the washing machine, catching Mr. X cheating on his wife, and catching the eye of the rich "Harvard Hottie" who lives on the 12th floor of the apartment building.
Scarlet I love ya, but better luck next time.
The character of NAN called for an actress with a Yuppie, upper class vibe -- in some ways, she's a younger version of Mrs. X and both characters know this....i.e., if she marries Harvard Hottie, she'll become the next gen Mrs. X.
But there is no apologetic letter from Mrs. X to her -- the point of the novel is that the X's have learned nothing and will continue on with their horrible ways, oblivious to their son and (presumably) their next baby.
Smith and his date drunkenly exit via a window and the next minute Lola and Mike go to Bill's with a policeman claiming it is their flat and they have been burgled.
If that is true why, in the next scene, is she auditioning for a spot in Bill's club???
Now, he was not friends with the president during that period, nor with the next president, but he was friends with Bill Clinton.
But at least there wasn't a song stuck in my head for the next week.
Everything about Revelations falls exceptionally flat, and I would be exceptionally surprised if this series got picked up for a full season next year.
Until next time.
Funny scene #1: In the first scene we have one of the Nazi studs returning to the dorm and saying how much he is looking forward to banging some hot women in the next experiment.
She covers her mouth and collapses, only to be fine and eating food the next day!
a woman sits at her daughters bed and the next thing we see is that she is somewhere in the woods in a coffin-like box.
there is no connection to ANYTHING in the next part of the movie, except that she has a daughter.
As were readying ourselves to see a movie about a crazed stalker on the looses all of a sudden the movie changes course with Catherine's father Tom, Charles Shaughnessy, popping up in her apartment the next day.
Going to the Marlin Bay Club the next evening with some of his friends Tom spots Amanda there as a waitress and you can see that he's addicted to her and that he'll end up going down the tubes if he continues to try to get it on with Amanda.
I like a good vampire film as much, if not more so, than the next person so imagine how I felt when I had the misfortune to see this so called 'artistic' effort.
Still, we do get some lively snake dancing and the matching of the two sets of footage is not that bad, although Karloff's foreman appears in one scene with a beard and the next scene without!
It's easy to see why they want her in the next Indiana Jones movie.
Incidentally, guess what's up next for Keifer Sutherland: action-thriller "The Sentinel," with old-timer Michael Douglas in the lead.
The action skips from one scene to the next, but nothing grabs the eye.
Whatever next?
Director Jonathan King is clearly aiming to be the next Peter Jackson, but he has started far behind the curve.
Probably the worst movie I have ever seen next to SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS.
As the bodies pile up, Jeff begins to realise that his girlfriend Lisa (Michelle McCormick) could be next on the assassin's list.
The ambitious script deserves some credit for the way it keeps intercutting the past with the present tense, a technique that results in some intriguing effects; in one scene we see somebody killed, in the next scene there he is, moving and talking!
One minute he is in Virginia and the next minute he is in Pittsburgh.
One minute they are living together the next scene they are separated and she is pregnant.
And there was no indication that this was 2 months later..it was like the next day.
If that's what you think, then just catch it next time on TNT (don't rent it, like I did) and post at least one funny line.
ANY country would pale next to the US at this point in history.
Initially he balanced his action movies by doing independent and TV movies as well, to have more challenging roles but looking at his next lot of movies, all action based, it seems he may have made his bed for good and is now content to lye in it.
But, instead of this signaling a move to more serious crimes, in the next scene the gang literally goes out and beats up little children playing baseball.
In the very next scene, his girlfriend calls the cops to report the threatening phone calls she got and they respond that there's nothing they can do(?).
If you ever happen to see this movie, there is a fight scene where the hero kills his attacker with a big (wooden) sword by clearly stabbing the ground next to his chest.
It ranks up there with the biggest wastes of talent in movie history, right next to Max von Sydow in "Strange Brew" and Sir Lawrence Olivier in "Clash of the Titans".
There's also the baffling instances of being able to hear the wind blow against the mike & since certain scenes were probably shot over a certain period of time the wind from one shot to the next in the same scene has different levels of this noisy blowing wind.
gimme a break ridiculous, waste of LOST-time Hopefully next weeks will be better, and carry us through til April.
There is next to nothing good I can say about this movie, considering its precursor.
What could the story be next?
Even if there is a medical explanation to such a phenomenon what next happens is a mixture of dialog among ... say ... souls?
It's one of the problems with amateurs making movies these days: everything thinks by making pop culture references, you're the next Tarantino and it doesn't work that way.
I like a rip-roaring horror movie as much as the next guy, but this one just didn't do it for me.
This time around, the story is about a deranged inn keeper who, for reasons never explained, keeps killing the guests who come to his motel and feeding them to the large crocodile in the swamp next to it.
The next hour consisted only of pointless crap about a band being signed to a record label.
The next morning, Whispering Nicholas Cage scalds himself in the shower and Perky Meg Ryan gets hit by a truck.
But on her next four-day trip everything will change for the better, thanks to the quirky members of her tour and her moody bus driver.
The story has a lot of twists and turns and they are obviously there to keep the audience guessing as to what might happen next.
I'll certainly not be watching the next one!
And by calling it just 'Friday The 13th' they've screwed themselves on being able to call the next one, the 13th one, which could've been called 'Friday THE 13th' but now that's shot down.
The next time the killer(Jason) finds her somebody else gets slashed in trying to save her.
Taija Rae is the (chubby) sweet girl next door (who will do double(you-know-what)), while Joey, Gerry, and Ron raise hell and remind you of why the porn industry is not what it's cracked up to be.
Underrated Tish Ambrose, a woman I always felt should have been the next Veronica Hart but whose initial promise Â in Revene's own WANDA WHIPS WALL STREET among several prestigious projects Â remained unfulfilled (perhaps due to well-publicized drinking problems), also scores highly as the soap actress who rallies to Eddie's defense in one of the film's funniest scenes topped by their freaky coupling, stylistically influenced by the Kelly Nichols/Ron Hudd psychedelic porker from ROOMMATES.
As always, the carnage accumulating around the heroine doesn't seem to faze the cops who appear to wait for the next killing, show up, then calmly survey the damage and ponder why it just keeps happening around our female lead.
Meanwhile people start getting killed all round Beckinsale, and these killings seem to be related to those of 500 years ago and follow the pattern of the same chess game which is portrayed in the painting (the next moves of which predict who will be killed next).
Add in the indirect encouragement to Singapore's Prime Minister Lee to work harder for the next elections, one couldn't help but feel that Jack Neo tries harder to boot lick the country's leaders than to make a decent movie.
Both seemed to jump from one trait to the next.
Unfortunately for them, the last twenty years have shown us that anyone with enough drive and vision can make a movie with next to no budget, such as Primer or even Cube, which maintained its otherworldliness with one square room and enough of another room to make it look like there was another cube beyond it.
I love Italian zombie films as much as the next guy, but this film is  so monotonous that boredom soon sets in.
The storyline is simple, I will give it straight away, a professor unwittingly unseals a cursed underground crypt, what happens next is that zombies are coming above the burial ground trying to eat those who are on the burial ground, end of script.
Another lady with a wounded ankle hears zombies hacking away at the door she's standing next to, so she sends her companion to "go get her husband", leaving her all alone.
Wonder what happens next?
Maybe to a lot of people in the poverty ravaged country of Mexico, it's not funny because of the next to life reality of a severed finger and a senseless beating to a sequester victim, but to us in the U.S who have been desensitized by all the smut we see at the movie theaters, this is a great movie.
The story is not pretentiously developed in a way to be unpredictable, it's more like going out in this trip that you simply don't know what's going to happen next because you simply just don't know, just like in 'Go!'.
Let have balls and instead of kitsch theology talk about Heidegger the next time.
I'm sure Blake Edwards wanted to make something special for his good old friend and at the same time also use this movie as a set up for the next sequel "Curse of the Pink Panther", which was also shot at the same time as this movie and is therefor also featuring most of the same actors.
Clouseau is not found, that is a mystery for the next movie to solve.
You can end the franchise on a low note, you can hold a world-wide search for the next Clouseau, you can quietly seek someone to take his place, or you can make a regurgitated piece of crap from the old footage lying on the cutting room floors, slap a new title on it, bring back a few favorites, and call it a day.
You watch it, take a good laughs and forget it in the next half hour.
The color was off, the English subtitles were poor translations and blurry, the sound was awful and the voices on the "other end" of the phone conversations sounded like they were standing next to the person on screen, etc.
It suffers from two major flaws, and they're probably both writer/director Jonas Quastel's fault--this film (which I'll be calling by its aka of Sasquatch) has just about the worst editing I've ever seen next to Alone in the Dark (2005), and Quastel's constant advice for the cast appears to have been, "Okay, let's try that again, but this time I want everyone to talk on top of each other, improvise non-sequiturs and generally try to be as annoying as possible".
And yet again, since the character decides to keep dreaming the whole darn movie, the people that die are alive in the next scene.
Shame on all the people that made this movie and I plead all of them to have nothing to do with the next 2 that have been greenlighted.
She's better at roles as a 'femme fatale' ("Irma Vep") or stunning 'girl next door' ("In the Mood for Love")
Thumbs down to Brooks then, and better luck to Paz next time, I hope this mistake doesn't stop her rise to stardom.
If there was ever a point where the viewer was meant to wonder what was going to happen next, or what course of action a character might take, I missed it.
I can be as nihilistic as the next GenXer, but this is a little too depressing for my taste.
At one point he is drawing locations of different spots where bodies were recovered, and based on that he figures out that this has some significance in terms of some cult and predicts the location of next murder.
This movie was extremely predictable - you knew what was going to happen next throughout the entire film.
The plot has become the standard story for the next four decades of horror flicks, the characters are as generic as they can be, the violence isn't even scary nor disturbing...
What will Hollywood scenario writers think up next?
Actually the fact that two kids grow up in the same house and one has an accent like he just stepped off the boat and the other sounds like the girl next door is pretty far fetched.
Sherlock Bones is the heartwarming tale of a small boy, his potentially dangerous father, his veterinarian love interest (who wears a lab coat in the one scene of her working, for the next three scenes, and then never again in the entire movie), her incredibly badly acted miscreant child, a talking dog, and an entire cast and crew of people who make a series of misjudged decisions after another.
Watching it is akin to seeing a bunch of toddlers attempt a revival of A Midsummer Night's Dream.. you know it's wrong but you can't pull yourself away because of what might happen next.
A genre that before had been frowned upon and never really explored, was taken to the next level with The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.
Dialog is so horrible, that you literally cringe waiting for the next line.
I got really shocked when i saw that they called themselves experts and that they said something about how this movie should set the standards for the next coming 3d animated movies, NO WAY!
But it hardly mattered as Mama Dracula's plot is there only to set up one lame comedic bit after the next Â most involving the twin vampires played by the Wajneberg brothers.
At some point in the next century, the last of the baby boomers will die and the rest of the world will no longer have to suffer from their bizarre notion that the 1960s was the most important decade in Western history, or films like "The Return of the Secaucus 7".
See the women lean against fences, crouch next to streams and play board games while they talk about their interpersonal relationships!
This should be filmed by August of next year for a 2011 release.
Maybe then they could've used the money they'd have saved and spent it on better writers, because the next glaring mistake was the bad writing.
After saying their lines, if they had any, they just stood with blank expressions, sort of like asking themselves "What is my next line".
There isn't really much character development to speak off as the stories are more focused on the plot and the characters are just pre-set anime stock characters, put in place to advance the plot from one fight to the next.
Whether it's the first victim twitching uncontrollably after being clubbed on the head with a lump-hammer, witnessing the next being hung on a meat-hook or watching poor old Sally being held down to be 'whacked' by a cadaverous old man, the nightmarish images of Hooper's movie will stay with you long after the film has finished.
Still, there were several classic and traditional "monster" movies released in the next few years.
Let's see if the next time John Waters does it better (I really hope so).
Too bad maybe next time.
Even though the budget was almost next to nothing and the conditions of making the movie were, according to many articles, hellish, the film doesn't have one weak element.
Hooper achieves sensory terror and doom by piling on images and sounds, each of them spilling to the next frame starting an avalanche of horror.
Maybe next time...
Unfortunately, these ideas are lost and muddled, because the film keeps switching teams; one minute it's about vigilantes being wrong, then the next minute they say the hero is needed; then the villain gets all of the sympathy, making you want to hate Batman, and then when it ends, they want you to sympathize with Batman.
The guy then spends the next 2 years on the street.
The guy shoots himself in the head on front of Batman (why he is upset by this, I have no idea), the next day, Batman is found dead in the Gotham river due to a drug overdose.
I expect the next one out of her's will be "In Search of Gregory".
She is next referred to a dentist, who wants her jewels back from her ex-husband.
But hard ass/cutie pie act -- punching men in the groin one minute and making wisecracks the next --never really works.
For some inexplicable reason Julie's hair keeps changing lengths as in one scene she'll sport the Mrs. Brady look and in the next her flowing locks are down her back.
This is one of those "slick" Italian movies where the world is populated with easy-to-bed don't ever wed women, well-heeled "where is my next lay"?
In the next scene that man is up running around.
The next time it's on TV you may want to watch a few parts just for a laugh but trust me, you will quickly be flipping the dial to the Home Shopping Network or some such dribble.
In the next scene that man is up running around.
First off, two forces from different nations, caught up in a fight next to the island was a poor way to get a few people killed by dinosaurs.
Watching this film is like being locked in a room with an obnoxious small child who has always been told by his parents that he/she is the next Judy Garland or Marlon Brando.
The only good thing to say about this film is, it has Christopher Eccleston in it, so maybe next time when they re-make it better, set in England with out the stupid commercial, American-ness they'll have him again.
If we cast it properly, plan out a set of films to bring the books that brought joy to millions out to billions we could if done properly be in the money for years to come and rule the Christmas films for the next 5 years.
I like movies where I'm wrong when I guess what comes next.
Everything from who gets killed next to the warlord's true id and everything.
one of my favorite scenes was when they meet the hunter and for like the next five minutes all his dialog was exposition.
3 votes are also for good camera work for initial 30-40 minutes of movie.Its bad movie,its really very bad movie.Don't waste your time as well as your mood and your next day by watching this movie.
Android 17 could very well be my least favorite villain in DBZ next to Garlic Jr.(I did like him a little cause it was Gohan, Krillen and Piccolo that fought him and not Goku) The Dragons could have been cool but just were another version of Buu.
At school the next day, suddenly Georgia and her three school-mates are all best friends again.
If I died in the next minute it would come as blessed salvation.
"Faces of Death" at least had a documentary feel to it, some attempt at a sequence or progression from one scene to the next, not here though.
Taxing to watch, an avid movie fan can nearly anticipate what will happen next.
The next day the guy is running around with no problem.
Not only did most of it outstay its welcome by overlapping from one scene to the next but it was often inappropriate.
Meanwhile, a strange handyman is given a list and the next thing you know he is attacking a woman and her lover who is a rather clumsy kick boxer.
But the next winter sacrifice is coming up and one of the cult members suggests using his granddaughter because she's still a virgin.
It jumps from one scene to the next containing irrelevant characters who really serve no purpose to the thin story line the film does have.
The most annoying aspect of the film is that as you sit there witnessing it's length you can successfully predict what will happen next right up until the moment when I decided I'd had enough of this crap.
onto his next Â and thankfully unfilmed Â adventure!
After watching this 75 minute insanity fest, the only natural thing to ask is, "What Kincaid film should I watch next?"
It will be interesting to see what tabloid material Kohn tackles next.
Having said that, there was a lot going for this...some nice shock surprises (albeit totally unbelievable, if the killer is supernatural like Michael Meyers it needs to be established, how  else could he be EVERYwhere at the same time, and know the kids' next moves before they make them?).
!I wouldn't recommend it even if it's the last movie you have.The plot is simple and I was able to make up what is going to happen next, and you know what I was right.I'm not going to write anything about the story itself because there is nothing to write about!
I thought at first I just had a dud.I wasn't able to get a refund only an exchange for the same stupid movie, and the next factory sealed one also skipped in the same exact spot so obviously the master copy is bad and has been transfered to all of the discs.I won't buy or rent anything again by this no-name new filmmaker and hope other's don't make the same mistake unless you like bad quality, grainy B-rated films made by a guy and his friends with a cheap hand held video camera.It is nothing more then someone's student film.All the money was spent on deceiving us with interesting looking cover art and a nice animated main menu.This is the only reason I even gave the movie a 2 out of 10.That is all this movie has going for it.It's a shame because I wanted to like this film but could never sit through it again.Now i've lost 14 bucks that could have been spent on something else.I feel ripped off!
It wants to be cool, it wants to be hip, but like Jerome in his quest to be the next Picasso, it's merely clueless.
I had already figured out the twist in the storyline long before the audience was supposed to get it and spent the next hour bored out of my mind.
After "The Piano", that most enchanting of movies, I became a Campion fan and couldn't wait for her next offering.
9) Terri Garr - Again, nothing against her, but this has to be, next to Willie Scott in Temple of Doom, the worst written female character in any Spielberg film.
And of course, the annoying musical conversation between man and alien comes next Â something else that only makes the film more grating so many years later.
While we find out little about the real life Honus Wagner, we find out next to nothing about the fictional Mandy, a wasted part played by a ditsy Kristin Davis.
This automatically leads to the next question: How did the killer know the blonde woman at the apartment (who is seemingly raped in a very long and tedious scene) was going to the audition and how did the killer got hold of that creepy mask, which was a prop stashed away at the mansion, a place where the killer hasn't been to yet?
Master P thinks he is the next Ice Cube.
What next???
At no time does the movie have you gripped with suspense or even bothered about what happens next to the characters, it's just not entertaining!
What next...
Despite the "real threat" alluded to above, I'm not entirely pessimistic about the next offering from the production group ('King's Mob').
But the fun of hating this movie (that occurs while they're cruising around L.A. drinking generic beer, which becomes banally involving) withers when the actual party begins, and for the next (what feels like an eternal) forty-five minutes we cut back and forth to various people who look like they're all buddies of the director as they drink beer, swear, philosophize, swear, drink beer, snort meth like it's cocaine, quote classic films (mostly Apocalypse Now), and swear some more: while drinking beer.
Daniels might be the next Bruce Lee for all I know, and PROBABLY knows his moves since he's been a pro, but in this movie he's worst than most C grade Hong Kong movies.
And we all know what happens next don't we.
He's a chameleon, an everyday man, who looks like the guy next door.
When Raymond offers a chance for Rex to see Saskia again, he must first experience what she went through, and you're left wondering "Where the hell is this going to take us next?"
If this is a must see for you this summer, I recommend waiting for the next sci-fi flick.
Coming next week, Battlefield: Earth special edition...... you get a copy of Annie in the box instead!
Distmantling nuclear bombs from a manual... stored right next to the bomb.
The next question I found myself asking is this, "How long would certain things (books, computer-dependent machinery, combustion engines) last and still be of any use to anyone?"
I like a passionate love scene as much as the next, but when you have EVERY sexual encounter involve the woman grinding away on top of the man (who of course isn't showing any of HIS private parts!)
That's because most of the truly frightening monsters in real life wear clothes just like the rest of us, have normal jobs just like the rest of us and are often living right next door, usually appearing to be ordinary family men and women on the surface.
Some of the scenes are far too serious and contemplative one minute, only for dramatic considerations to be thrown out the window the next.
Everyone was issued a free pass to come back, which I did the next day, having barely been able to get the creepy story out of my head.
The next thing I noticed is that this really wasn't a biography but instead was more like a series of sexually explicit episodes (a lotta rapes in particular) and beatings that were linked together by the theme of Marilyn Monroe--like it was inspired by her life only!
"Comes an age in a man's life when he doesn't want to spend time thinking' about what comes next," he says, a contrast from the forever-young come-what-may Billy.
Pa informs the group that a friend of his should be coming by boat within the next few days, and could probably help them get home.
They take off Â and guess what happens next.
I couldn`t help noticing Francis Ford Coppola seemed disgusted with the result , I doubt if Penn`s next starring role will be a Coppola production  In terms of shocks and presentation I do hope next year`s ceremony will be an improvement and we get to see Steve Martin in a cheeky mood  As a footnote we in Britain get to a see a slightly different Oscar show .
The one really good thing about this waste of time is that you don't need to have watched it to understand the next film in the series and can therefore skip this pointless plodder and move straight on to the far superior Land Before Time 5.
Curtis was doing pretty much everything to pay the bills about this time period, so although he's not exactly phoning it in as Harry, he's also got this look like he's going over lines for his next gig in his head, even while he's doing this one.
Even the background score makes us think that something is going to happen next even though nothing interesting after that.
I read an interview of him that he will become the next "SHANKAR" and what I am saying is being "SHANKAR" means not dancing with more than thousand people around you.
This guy isn't looking for someone to love, he's looking for the next trampy, highly obnoxious, limited educated, utterly stereotypical 'street trash' this show can put together on a weekly basis.
With entertainment fair like this to push onto a young demographic for alleged chuckles, I can just imagine what their next slate of shows will be like: Lassie finds a new owner via DIO and goes on a 30 city tour...or 6 Ex-Drug addict musicians are put together in a house for 30 days where they are told one kilo of cocaine is hidden and at the end after they all messed over each other to get it, it's actually baby powder...or several single surprisingly still-living 1960's/1970's era rock musicians get to vie for their own mail order bride from overseas...or Bishop Don Juan has a beauty-type contest where the winner will accompany him to the next 'Player's Ball'and get the chance to perform in front of that audience ... entertaining?
But taking ideas from other films shouldn't come as a surprise for this series since the first two "Urban Legends" were ripoffs of "Scream" and "Scream 2" (what's next?
I haven't even seen the next episodes yet but this could hardly be more clear.
In some scenes there are 5 or 6 people making plans, and then the next scene the have added about 10 to 15 more people to their group.
The story of the film being that that the neighbouring town takes in the killer children of the original film just seems a stretch, why would they take in children who appear to have killed every single adult - more to the point did they not notice that the town next door was missing it's entire adult population.
No one seems to notice they all stand in a pack and brood next to the person who ends up dead.
One minute he is in Virginia and the next minute he is in Pittsburgh.
One minute they are living together the next scene they are separated and she is pregnant.
And there was no indication that this was 2 months later..it was like the next day.
The kids are all adopted by foster parents in the neighbor town next to Gatlin.
Someone slowly being crushed under their own house, nobody finds the body, nobody even knows she's dead, until finally the smell of muddy hair, rotted flesh and mushed bones greet the next visitor on that hot summers morning.
A dancer at the 'Zoo' club named Mel (Elena Marchesini) is the next to be murdered.
Then, she produces a fake marriage certificate the next morning--which complicates his life, as he already is married--to a lady that Clark met while in prison!!!
The editing is appalling, in one scene two people are fighting in broad daylight one second and the next its pitch black.
Hopefully the next version of Eyes of The Mummy will be much more better.
The next major problem is the acting.
It's obvious they did not use a military consultant, or if they did, the producers were taken for a long ride, because there was next to nothing accurate about the portrayal of things military.
The only consolation prize I have is that this movie is so unmemorable I will probably forget it by next week.
There's also a little fun to be had from seeing just where teensy Nelson will pop out next: during the film, he launches attacks from a wardrobe, a fridge, a box, a luggage bag, and a toilet.
Basically the movie's about a detective bent on finding a killer or killers in so-called random murders, with clues left behind, before the next person dies!
Hannah as Mortica is quite good & pretty sexy, a pity she is given next to nothing to do other than stand next to Gomez.
Don't be the next to suffer this scam; steer well clear and stick with the other two films and the cartoons.
Which then prompted and almost asleep insomniac to be awake for the next 4 hrs.
This one's not the usual gore-fest, there's a cool scene when someone messily melts into ice cream but why did the previous two victims not melt in this way especially the first one who one moment is standing there & the very next he's melted to nothing within a split second?
He sits down next to her on a tatami when she is alone.
Other than the finale it's just a far too logical next step from the original and tries too hard to capture the good parts of that movie without trying to improve upon them.
It is one of the worst i have ever seen, next to "Troll 2" (that might even be better).
All the blame shouldn't be pointed at the actors who are clearly not ready for their next pilot that doesn't get picked up on the CW.
All these get a little screen time, then off for the next CC's.
That was the only movie I ever saw where I walked out went down the line asking people if they were planning to see it and begging them to cash in their tickets and do something, anything, else with the next two hours of their life.
SPOILER WARNING: This next paragraph contains the spoiler I mentioned up front, skip to the "YOU ARE NOW BEYOND THE SPOILER" message to avoid double spoilage.
As it took me nearly three viewings to conquer this behemoth, one has to question the 1972 value, and whether this musical stands up next to the others nearly 40 years later.
In one scene we are troubled by York's disagreement with one of Minnelli's haphazard choices (a big decision that was diminished by choice) and in the next, we are dissecting the idea of a German Jew.
I like as much as the next moron (yes I am a moron) but there is a line to everything where it's just no longer funny and instead, completely moronic and a waste of time.
The next seen Eric is pregnant, they both look sad then go to the grocery and sing about corn.
And if Adult Swim keeps going down this road, I'd stop watching that cheap garbage and wait for the next "smart" network to pick up the good shows.
In fact, after about 5 minutes into each of them you just want them to end and hope the next one is better.
the acting was atrocious,at best.the budget was next to nothing as was the first one.the whole plot was ludicrous,which is to be expected,but not to this degree.nobody would behave like these characters did,given the same situations.
Even if this were a good movie, it would be damn near ruined by the too-loud and uninspired soundtrack, alternating with scenes where the barely-talented leads mumble their lines in an evocation of intimacy...if you turn it up at such junctures, prepare to be blasted by bad orchestrations with the next scene change.
To give an idea of what sort of den the club is, Michael York finds himself at one point standing next to a transvestite in a men's urinal...The cabaret performances get all the more provocative as the plot gets tense.
Fortunately, the next film in the series (THE INVISIBLE MAN'S REVENGE) is quite a bit better.
The main reason behind this attitude is the thought that if we don't stand in solidarity with our neighbor (Saddam's Iraq) we would be the next to be hit.
I began to watch the movie after a guy cuts the head to another one, the next story was of an Indian and three idiots that want to kill him.
I enjoyed watching the movie just to see what he'd say or do next.
Hopefully the next VanDisel picture will be a lot better and more like his XXX pictures which is what he's known for.
What Toorop (Vin Diesel) thinks is an ordinarily dangerous mission soon becomes much more when he discovers that his guest is carrying twin babies, thought to be the next Messiahs.
At least until the next one.
Better luck next time Vin.
The movie moves along from one on-location set piece to the next, with action scenes and fights popping up out of nowhere and then wrapping up nicely as our heroes rush off screen to the next set.
I was disappointed that every time the movie introduced an interesting plot thread which would have made the movie about more than just "liberated students vs. stifling university dean" it was dropped by the next commercial because serious thought would have interfered with the party atmosphere the movie tried to foster.
Better luck next time to the cast and crew... if you had to ask me, I'd say skip this and move on...
*Fast-forward, peek at next episode, turn off TV*  *Shrug* And I'm no FF expert...
I like subversive material as much as the next guy, but come on!
The suspense is really edgy and makes you want to fast forward to the next scene to see what happens next.
There is no flow from one scene to the next.
Also many shots (no pun intended) were not taken well in this movie.For example the coach tells Tomasso to take a free quick, and he kicks the ball and you can tell it goes over the net,but the next shot makes it look like it went directly into the net in the most bizarre angle.
1) The Jag is seen approaching the starting line with no race number, and in the next shot it is still approaching the start bearing the '55' that had been allocated.
It seems the next generation of good filmmakers are not exactly bursting out of the film schools are they.
Eddie Murphy had just had some high profile cinematic bombs and people were anxious for his next great hit.
Director Jill Sprecher (I will have to watch more from her) has aimed her dart at office politics: The pecking order, the self-absorption, the pointlessness of it all, the feeling of "Oh, how I would I love to leave this place but where would next month's rent come from?
The next saddest thing I envisioned was a funeral consisting only of the heinous entourage of money-grubbers and hangers-on featured on her show; not a real friend among them; just a Hollywood set that provided a coddling, reality-distortion field for the starlet.
Mona next meets the young, attractive Tamsin, a girl who has been temporarily suspended from boarding school, so is home for the summer, and living nearby.
Maybe next time knox.
This horror omnibus gives us 4 tales of surprising unoriginality that will keep you guessing at what the next lame horror clichÃ© is going to be, while offering some amusing 80's star watching.
Maybe next time knox.
I kept trying to guess if her next line would be an Irish or an American accent.
The life of the families of Ramsay Street is anything but entertaining, and as with all 'soap opera dramas' it is extremely shallow, a character may hate someone one minute and love them the next, etc.
If you wanted to know what happens with neighbours next year, this is it!
And then he launches into a narrative about his next movie - and how good this next one, as opposed to all the losers before it, is going to be.
After running around corridors for an hour and a half, being put in solitary confinement (although allowed out to have sex, because sweet mercy that's what being Jean Claude Van Damme is about) Burke suddenly finds out inmates are being killed and their organs removed, not in some event relating last hour's worth of clues he'd been gathering but because the guards left a surgical saw conveniently next to their big suspicious medical cabinet.
The next time James Franco has this much time on his hands, I suggest he take up treasure hunting, or anything else that doesn't involve writing or directing.
SPOILER ALERT: The "Ape" was actually a guy in a really BAD gorilla mask, although I have to admit I did get a pretty good laugh every time the Ape sat next to a lamp or a wall and turned his head so you could see the empty eye sockets.
Then you get goofy sequences like the one where Griest is in a shower, gets drenched in blood, and is next seen dry and unfazed.
The next involves a man whose hand is chopped off by his other hand (!)
"Plot" now simply lurches from one incomprehensible sequence to the next and makes no sense.
Best game: Guess which character dies next.
I will say one thing in this film's defense: As absurd as it may be, and as uninspired in terms of plot, characterization, visual effects and believability, it did keep me watching to find out what would happen next all the way to the end.
7: Throwing reactor grade plutonium next to a weapon is NOT going to make it more powerful (otherwise, they would be doing it already!)
And it looks like York might be next...
On his next visit, Bogart finds her drinking and jitterbugging frenetically with a boyfriend.
The next thingÂ wellÂ Dennis Rodman.
The actors, the storyline and the governing VISION of this project seem to be dis comfortably stuck in the feeling of average German 90s television bonanza (no matter how successful it must have been at its time) - and this doesn't add a sense of missing aura and charming feel to the flick...  And finally: the producers really ought to be warned for their slated upcoming productions: if you tailor you next films after this model DON'T EVER ATTACH THE KIND OF CREDITS WITH FEELGOOD BACKSTAGE FOOTAGE AND BLOPPERS ... it's simply downright embarrassing, period (I had to cover my eyes).
The most amazing part of this movie (other than the lack of story, acting, decent props) was that the movie gave me a major headache until that lasted till the next day.
Tim Allen didn't appear to give a damn about this movie other than that it's going to pay his cell phone bills for the next three months.
Christmas ornaments for your tree next year...
Buckwheat tries to milk a cow just by setting glass bottles below it and standing next to it.
Then you wake up the next day and think "Wow, I was really wasted last night, what was I thinking"?
Basically the movie's about a detective bent on finding a killer or killers in so-called random murders, with clues left behind, before the next person dies!
So when "Dark" finds an amazingly true moment amongst the usual Araki violence, hilarity, sex and clutter (a moment to simply relax and hold the person in the bed next to him) it rings true to the heart of experience.
The movie ends in the next moment with an equally true touch.
Upside: I can tolerate the irony of Brian and Kenya meeting again in the next scene at the garden party.
There's one scene in particular that stunned me, it's just after the first attack when Rich is killed & as Wes drives the jeep away next to a sheer drop & Sean grabs the steering wheel & they have a struggle which sends the jeep over the edge of the small cliff & causing themselves all sorts of problems.
Like all low budget movies, you'll know who's next to get it from the spliced in stock footage.
The cabin scene is the only scene that was remotely well done, but then it's back to stupid behavior by the next victim who leaves the safety of the cabin when he hears the bear growling.
This may come as a spoiler, so be aware, and if you don't want to read it move to the next paragraph.
Strictly speaking for myself, because I'm strange, I would have thought a much better ending would involve the latter-day heroine, Bonnie, and her boyfriend going into the upstairs bedroom and finding Frank and John in bed with their mother's dead body, or Frank dressed as his mother with John next to him and Frank talking like their mother.
What next Â the Lord of accountancy?
He dies the next day, propped up in a chair with blood pouring from his mouth.
The next time you may be tempted to watch Y&R, ask yourself, "Is this the best way to spend the next hour of my life?"
From the Schizophrenic SAAB driver, to the scary next door neighbour you can't get away from fast enough, to the dog who you have to put a mirror under it's nose to see if he's still breathing!
I appreciate smart dialogs and subtle atmosphere as much as the next guy, but a synopsis claiming to revolve on blood addiction and passionate murder eventually must show something, right?
This travesty of a movie is the kind of thing that happens when talentless people fail to recognize their shortcomings and start trying to be the next Tarantino or Lynch.
I hope she gets it together and comes back in better form next time.
go to your local video shop and you'll find this movie in the B-grade waste of time section, it should be right next to Gladiator or some other crappy Russel Crowe Movie.
What next?
Let's hope that she gets a better script next time)
You can read the plot like a book and expect what's coming up next.
No mention is ever really made of the preacher man's dead friends from the last film...he kinda just forgets them and moves on to our next bunch of misfits.
I look forward to the next sequel in the 3-part trilogy about Anna Carter.
Almost all of the dialogue is designed to set up the next flashback.
A fat, bloated string of nonsensical set pieces that sees such indulgent turns as acting roles for all of Landis's director friends, it lurches from one meaningless sequence to the next.
Made on what looks like the worst/cheapest camera available in the shop, with actors the director seemingly chose because they live next door/didn't demand payment, "Champion Killer" fails to deliver on any meaningful level.
So after the initial disappointment of the first Final Fantasy movie, which seemed to bare next to no resemblance to the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy: Advent Children has released itself to a warm reception and, now, a dedicated fanbase.
Folks maybe before your next movie you might check out the geographic and socio-political facts, eh?
Actually the show was mentioned to Jay Leno once and he said " what a stupid name for a show, whats next run run its Monday.
It was basically a bunch of mostly random scenes throughout this lady's life and you wonder what is going to happen next to her.
I'll look forward to a next season of 24, but I'll pass for another film.
The REAL next big thing is here (although I would like to ask the real next big thing what he is doing with that biker bag slung over his shoulders throughout the movie).
Nothing is left to the imagination, let alone the intelligence of the viewer as the film moves boringly forward from one tiresome expository scene to the next.
Sorry Ms. Armstrong, better luck next time.
Take one gormless girl, add two competing handsome hunks (one home, one away), mix in a land of franglais where the locals say "good morning Madame" without a single sub-title and you wonder why the heroine had to know any French to become a spy... the kind of spy who keeps saying "what's your real name" while breaking the next person's cover and rushing up to warn the next safe house as the Bosche may or may not have got there before her.
Pretty much the next day, Tilo is handing Haroun a wedding gift.
However, this is not made at all clear and the next time we see Tilo she is in her spice shop greeting a number of stereotyped types with trivial, boring dialogue.
as usual, being a big hellraiser fan i was looking forward to the next episode; after seeing hellworld, there is only one conclusion: this time the really f...
What's next, Prophecy: Lancelot the Angel or Witchcraft VXIVX: Couldron of Lance?
A lot of that attitude is a self fulfilling prophecy, we can't do anything for ourselves, don't try, but trust in some higher power for this world or a good place in the next.
By the time she finds it, it's too late -- the squid has his next meal.
The twist here is that she also beds every other guy she sees in an art museum or on the train to her next 'performance'.... as it were.
You can guess what happens next.
It almost made me puke and I woke up the next morning needing an aspirin.
I'm a huge fan of really bad movies (HellGate, Texas Chiansaw massacre the next generation, Troll 2, and Slumber Party massacre 2 have all made it to my collection and i love watching them) but this movie is too boring..maybe if it was a 15 min short it wouldn't be so bad...not a movie that trys to stretch itself for an hour and 20 mins...the ending was a crap fest also.
This even though she lived next to a lake all that time!
This was my first Spike Lee experience, and I have to say, I now understand why I'm laughing when comics make jokes such as "That makes about as much sense as a white person's script in a Spike Lee movie" ***SPOILER ALERT **** I thought it was hilarious that the first white man on screen kills himself, and the next white person shown is a complete and utter witch.
The next thing you know, he has lesbian women knocking at his door daily, five at a time, offering $10,000 each per impregnation.
The development of these people is as far as your next bus stop to Plainville, even the Robert De Niro look-alike and his greased-up hair looks too pastiche, tooÂalready done.
The movie may have salvaged itself if they didn't try to also make the main character, try to talk like a ghetto person one minute, and then a respectable, sensible person the very next.
The only thing the movie had going for it (and I suppose why many people liked it) was a lot of over-the-top violence that left you constantly anticipating what laws they were going to trash next.
See, the next night, the same group of students get locked in the theater and begin getting picked off one by one by a mysterious killer.
The screenplay is the worst part of this film, as it lurches from one premise to the next, missing all the important bits that would have made a number of different stories possible.
The Russian Revolution was reduced to "Some riots are happening in Petersburg", with the next scene being soldiers arresting them.
Which brings me to the next problem.
The next good thing about this film is that Telefilm Canada, our federal cultural agency whose business is the development and promotion of the Canadian film industry, had the good sense to provide funding support to this small indie production.
No, this isn't THE next big swedish movie.
but next to the really lame X-Treme Fighter, these come off as the work of Tron or Dreamscape.
Story-wise, the plot is incoherent and really badly paced, meaning one scene doesn't relate well to the next and there's the clichÃ©d, stereo-typical angle of the dead mother and father and son struggling to bond sub-plot.
At several points I asked myself how the film could get worse only to find that the next scene eloquently answered my question.
The two that once seemed chunks of rankest Velveeta now blossomed like the sweetest of Edams next to "Sunshine."
How did we get from one situation to the next?
But not everything was a disaster here, at least special effects were OK and there are some funny moments.I only hope that Fantastic Factory gets better monetary and artistic results with their next film"Darkness" directed by Jaume BalaguerÃ³, the author of the very interesting "The Unnamed", I trust in that project which has good actors in it such as Lena Olin or Anna Paquin, on the contrary this adventure of Filmax in fantastic genre will have a very dark future.
The climax and resolution of the film leave you spent, unsure of what to feel next other than anxious, a little "mad", and exposed at the same time.
Our pure-hearted heroine is unconscious in bed one moment and then necking in the shadows with Naschy the next, madly in love with him.
He followed them from one city to the next, I can only think he must have been a millionaire disguised as an uncultured and stupid yob.
The fact that it seems to go on and on forever doesn't help, and while I am as nostalgic for the late 1970's as the next guy one can at least take heart in the fact that human kind effectively evolved beyond a state where movies like this are possible.
Any vampire movie with the line "Vampire hookers... they'll suck more than your blood" in it is worth putting next to your copy of A Polish Vampire In Burbank on your schlock shelf.
It felt more like an essay than a movie; rather than chronological development it was as though a point was made and evidenced and then moved on to the next point - I much preferred the chronological growth of the characters in the series.
It didn't leave me looking forward to the next episode so, if it was immediately canceled, I would not take notice.
The next morning, POW!
Run away you stupid kid, who hides next to a fire place?
The passenger next to him notices John's fear of flying and gives him this advice: "After you get where you're going, take off your shoes and socks and make fists with your toes."
He takes the head of the company, Takagi, up to the next floor where they work him for the access code to the main computer.
Can I grow attached to this character, or will he die, or will the next episode forget he existed, will this storyline be dropped or will his entire personality be switched around?
There are many flaws with the script, but off the top of my head here's one: They build up Adam as this super powerful/influential guy and beside the healing ability they don't even explain how, and then he gets easily killed to make room for the next big villain.
The next hour is filled with tedious scenes as we get needless character development when what we want is to be scared.
I might watch a couple more episodes to give the show a chance, but unless the writing improves I'll hold out for the next Aardman film, thanks.
As ridiculous as it is to have us believe that four of the most beautiful humans on the planet (Gershon, Corbett, Garner, Bruckner) live next door to each other in a trailer park, the casting of Justin Long takes the cake.
He goes to the Nakatomi Corporation building which is where Holly works to see her and be there for his kids who he hasn't seen in a while, but during the time there he has abit of a fight with her and she gets called to give a talk, anyway John is in the bathroom insulting himself in the way how Bruce Willis does, and he ends up taking his shoes off (the person who he is sat next to on the plane says the best way to get over flying is to take your shoes off and walk bear foot and make fists with your toes...personally never tired it).
Words cant really describe this film, you really have to watch it, but the film does leave you wanting more and does leave you wanting to watch the next one in the series.
OK, well, maybe they'll wrap it up in the next 15 minutes.
i did not watch the rest of the film until the next evening.
There's also enough twists and wrinkles thrown into the story to keep the audience guessing as to what's going to happen next .
I suppose in any case that much of Herriot's humour comes from exaggeration and choice of words, and that's probably next to impossible to render on screen...
He dressed like Sparrow; walked, talked and acted like Sparrow and just might be the "next best thing" but not quite Sparrow!
Sorry I lied Blackbeard isn't "the next best" at anything, the pirate that was at my third birthday party was more of man then Blackbeard.
This movie could however use an actor who really took the movie to that next level, but I'm sorry to say that no one even came close.
Hell, she's like Brando next to these people.
I mean... what's next?
I was always taught that any narrative, be it a movie, book, play, even a piece of music, has to have a beginning, a middle and an end - this dreadful excuse for a movie had a beginning...and then it waffled for the next hour or so until the woman we sort of guessed was the heroine, ran off into the night.
Well, let's just wait for the next Pauly Shore venture with American Idol, Ruben Studdard.
And the next time I'm eligible I would be over 70 years old and would get an automatic exemption should I choose.
In the next scene she offers him opera tickets!
However, if the planet keeps on warming up, and rainstorms continue getting worse, who knows whether in the next twenty years you will be building ships in your garden in Dakota?
There, he tells Bart his next assignment is to retrieve a scientist who's built a 'peaceful death ray'.
And fans of "Mystery Science Theatre 3000" will seek out this film at all costs for their next Bad Movie Night showing.
The movie drags on and on, passing from one person to the next in this small Texas town, doing their bit before the camera before it passes them over and travels on to the next.
From here on the movie takes very lame twists and turns, it wasn't even fun to predict who would die or what would happen next because it was so predictable.
Over the next few decades it would develop a small cult following and after seeing it for myself I can see why.
After journalist Wainwright (Sarandon)persuades a reluctant Madden to allow her to ride in his race car during the event, the next half hour or so consists of the two leads engaging in a stilted and repetitive dialogue about what to do if Wainwright develops motion sickness, interspersed with reasonably well-edited race footage.
Think about this sentence next time you watch it this shitty movie you'll lol forever.
The next scene was at the Bingham's residence, and they were all holding babies!
There are also already some typical Bergman postures, with one woman talking intensely and the one next to her staring vapidly past her downwards, seemingly lost in her own inner world.
His next movie was Monika, so this one can be said to commence his golden period.
Is she going to order a pizza next?
Well until my next crap movie peace
A "water-cooler" entry-- I expect people all over the country were talking about this tense 30 minutes the next day.
It's due to expire some time in the next 3 months.
You planned on surviving that bomb blast and getting catapulted up to the next car all along, right?
What IrÃ¨ne did next I suspect would have made a far more interesting few days in September than those we witnessed from the 5th to that fateful day in 2001.
The budget as probably next to nothing and it shows.
He constantly bickers about how he hates sponge bob and Pat and yet he still lives next to them.He's very pretentious and is very sad all the time.Every time I look at him he's gives you this suicidal mentality!!
At least next to JGar's performance, it doesn't stand out too badly.
The book was cool and even made me put it down to go online to find a photo of the Last Supper to check for myself if it could actually be Mary sitting next to Jezus.
However, that book wasn't half as controversial Ã³r interesting as the Da Vinci Code was, so that doesn't bode well for their next project.
At no point in this opening 15 minutes does Tom Hanks question what people are telling him, he just believes them, does what he is told and moves onto the next stage.
It was like watching a computer game, with the main character being told do this, do that, don't go here and quick come this way, by supporting characters just to progress onto the next level.
I thought Christopher Scott Cherot was the next Spike Lee, or John Singleton...if he continues like this he will be as memorable as Mattie Rich, and if you don't know who he is then that's what I am talking about.
Old feelings still there, what will happened next??
I hope his next film about Brian Boru starring Leo diCaprio will be much better.
ISLAND OF THE ALIVE is a very entertaining bad taste horror comedy , maybe not a classic like Peter Jackson`s BAD TASTE but still fairly good as the film opens with a woman giving birth in a New York taxi cab and a cop trying to shoot the new born baby , while the next scene features the knowingly stupid line " It took four bullets before it died - That`s some baby " , and of course there`s scenes of the mutant killer babies ( Done by stop frame animation , none of this CGI rubbish )going on killing sprees , and I haven`t even mentioned Michael Moriarty doing a great Al Bundy impression .
The next chapter, doesn't start where the last one finished, it starts some time after, giving us a little mystery on what happened.
In the very beginning we see the president being shot with a dart then the next we see a woman talking on her cell phone.
In the very beginning we see the president being shot with a dart then the next we see woman talking on her cell phone.
In one scene they were standing up talking and in the next scene they were dead.
And this explains why a not so good looking, next door looking guy like Tom Cruise, who can't act, gets the lead in movies.
The only logical next step to is televise executions.
Although the drama is of course not the most important part of a musical comedy, if it does not help to motivate the songs and does not create any suspense about what will happen, then the audience is just tapping its feet waiting for the next musical number.
It opens with Melissa (Laura Prepon from That 70's Show) waking up next to Carlos (Matt CedeÃ±o) the day before her wedding.
The doors don't open back up until six a.m. the next morning - can they make it through the night?
The first 15 minutes were pretty cool, but then the next 20 minutes were deadly boring.
Leave the real acting to the real actors next time!
I love vampire and zombie just as much as the next guy, but this movie sucks.
The first one you see absolutely nothing, not even a reflected flash in the car window that he is stood right next to!
Then he explains he has decided to make a Kevlar breastplate to protect his heart and the next minute it's in his hands!
It also had a look like it was filmed exclusively using security cameras, which gave them an extra bit of annoyance as one moment you can't really see what's going on because you're too far, and then the next not seeing it because the camera is shaking like mad.
The mostly B-side, late 1960s, early 1970s music is omnipresent, and I was always waiting for the next tune to come along.
See this one for yourself to find out what happens next.
Better luck next time.... and I truly hope there is a next time for Mr. Bellott.
British authors used to do something in this style (sometimes even in darker mood like Loach), American kids are too infantile (but still beat adults...), Italians are too mature (because of social context), Czechs forgot that they have children (and were among the best in 70's), so only French authors can stand next to Scandinavians.
The guy next to me left 45 minutes before the movie ended and I wish I had done the same thing.
For all of you complaining about changes from the book - do you really want to know what happens next in every scene?
It wouldn't be a little more logical to kill the husband and in case next his sister to inherit from her?
Another woman yelps because she sat next to a snake.
That's right, he leaves her in there and doesn't appear until the next day.
There is a rattlesnake next to the man with the gun.
Bullets ricochet off and split the wooden bars as our 'hero' is casually sitting back next to the detonator.
It was at fairly close range, but it turns out Ron was only wounded and after being dumped into a lake with the getaway car, he swims away and the next minute you see him without a scratch.
According to the scientist in the film (a miscast Ann Turkel who pronounces most of the scientific language incorrectly) they are evolving rapidly and need to mate with human women in order to take the next step in their evolutionary process.
I watched it the next day and had that same feeling again.
Balding, who shows plenty of charisma in her next film "The Boogens", is completely wasted in a thankless role that gives her little more to do other than stand around looking cute in spite of ridiculous looking clothes.
His body is discovered the next morning, Lieutenant Sandy McGiver (Cameron Mitchell) & his partner Sergeant Manny Ruggin (Avery Schreiber) are on the case.
Unfortunately for both me & Silent Scream the negative aspects of the film easily outweighed the positive, better luck next time chaps.
Better luck next time!
What to do next?
Brian Dennehy is their leader, Cobb, who smiles wryly in that Dennehy way and never kicks it into the next gear.
The film is of the slow build variety, but that isn't the problem in itself - the problem is that there is never enough going on to keep the audience wanting to see what happens next, and therefore the film does drag on far too often.
But the choice of music (too much) overwhelmed scenes that could be more intense without telegraphic music that announces what happens next.
The cinematography wasn't even there and the moments it was, it was easy to see what was coming next.
My friend sitting next to me asked me if it was written in crayon.
Girls like that are everywhere to the point that they ARE the modern "girl next door".
How anyone, gay, straight or vegetable, could find the foul-mouthed, insecure, nasty-minded "leading lady" attractive is something that I will spend the next 15 seconds wondering.
The direction is appalling - there are so many scenes where you can see the actors freezing waiting for either the next line from one of the other characters or their director to yell "Cut".
It is linear and plods along as if the writer didn't know what to do next, I fell asleep about 3/4 of the way through the movie and had to finish watching "the riveting climax" the next day.
I enjoy a good high school drama as much as the next guy, and I'm quite willing to hold my nose a little bit with regards to originality and believability, but unfortunately, with this movie, the stink penetrated my best nose-blocking efforts.
And Robert Downey Jr., an actor I love, does the best he can with the material - but he does fall flat in several scenes, particularly a horrible scene involving him waving a gun around next to his pool.
The next they're playing f***ing Scooby Doo.
The poorly edited pictures that were supposed to give hints as to what would happen next, where done in two different mediums and did not make any sense.
The combination of absolutely no talent and next to no budget calls for disastrous results.
I guess it's not company policy to take movies off the shelves because sure enough, the next time we went in it was still there.
While I enjoy low-budget gore as much as the next guy, this one was almost unbearable to watch.
Does your audience want to see what is going to happen next?
If you look at the rating percentages, there are next to no 8's and 9's, which is a very good and reasonable score for a movie that is as good as some say it is.
Of course, my friends and I were break dancing outside (with or without cardboard) for the next several months.
Chapter one at least leaves you hanging & shows a preview of the next chapter.
What followed the initial amusement was 90 minutes of boring hell as I debated whether or not to go over to the next theater and see what was playing there... Titanic sounded preferable at times.
For all its Technicolor and A-list casting, it's at heart a B-movie writ large, from the era when Saturday-morning horse opera serials were standard fare and big-budget Westerns were just taking off: the next thirty years would produce some classics of the genre, but this isn't one of them.
As a vengeful zombie of sorts, Sam shambles around just enough over the course of the next 90 minutes to kill his fair share of the cast.
I give it another try in the future, but I'll make sure next time I'm intoxicated.
And be sure it won't resurrect in the next 3 days.
At times you could barely hear the people talk, I had to constantly turn the volume up for one scene, and then back down for the next.
The acting is quite simply atrocious, the plot and dialogue (when the cast remember the lines) is just awful and minimal in the usual way of teen horror flicks the story is just there to get to the next scary bit....sadly they seemed to have forgotten to put in both a story or any scary scenes.
And next time hire a composer who knows that writing original film music is more than trying to create suspense by using diminished chords or pounding low piano keys.
One minute it's serious, one minute it's slapstick, the next...who knows, it's just completely confusing.
I found this movie in the bargain bin sitting right next to Wild Things 2 and Death To The Supermodels for $2.99 what a fool i was to actually think that this could be good instead i watched in disgust as poor acting stereotypes ripped of the storyline and script from the 1st one.
It just seems like something that would happen too fast (Sebastian becoming the male version of Katharyn) and I just don't know where they would go with the next episode, since it wouldn't be leading to the 1999 Film (Which the newer ending is directed right towards.)
Betty is such a crazy wench that you never know whom she might attack next.
This film is possibly bland and predictable next to other Westerns that have stood the test of time (Giant, Hondo, How The West Was Won) but it has some good aspects and was a beloved Western in its day.
And Flynn should have kissed her in the last scene when she agrees as a new bride to take the next wagon train west so he can clean up another lawless town.
It was also extraordinarily fortunate that Agent McGregor (Hemingway), who had never attempted rock climbing in her life before this trip, was so instantly adept at it that her next climb was a two hundred foot vertical climb without tether.
But he doesn't live the piano man's life and I guess there is supposed to be some conflict, but many people have talents they don't take to the next level, etc.
The next biggest thing in his life besides his family is his girlfriend who he shows absolutely no respect to.
I hated this idiotic "parody" movie, and I hope Bob Saget lays low for the next 40 years.
They did make the movie bearable though, kept me going to the next bright spot.
The brawlers smash through the wall into the meeting of the Lady's Temperance Society next door.
She really did look funny, laying there nude and muddy, because I knew she was next and the thought of her being anesthetized in that mud pack was hilarious!
The kid then goes back inside, deliberates over this with his parents for about 10 seconds, and the next scene is the family saying goodbye to him.
In the next scene, she is on the side of the road hitching a ride, and the car that stops has the other guy in the band SHE JUST SAW ON TV sleeping in the back seat.
Another advertisement for Western enlightenment occurs when a snake bites one of the kids and his brother cleans the wound; Railsback insists on taking him to the hospital so he can receive competent treatment; when he asks the nurse how the kid is doing in the next scene, she goes "I have no idea - but I cleaned the wound."
How Harry and the others will even know what to look for in the next movie I haven't the faintest idea.
How can anyone pull off the next movie w/o actually setting up any key plots needed for it?
How can Harry complete his mission in the next part if he never actually saw any clues in part6?
At the moment i don't even feel like to trust to go see the very next and last one.
it is easily the 2nd biggest moment in seven novels, next to the climax when Voldemort is killed.
It plays a big part in the next movies!
What, am I just supposed to believe that they get married out of nowhere in the next book?
How are the trio meant to move from place to place in the next books?
MASSIVE SPOILERS AHEAD  So, not only did they destroy the capodopera that this movie could have been, but they also didn't set up the next movie/s.
Because not only was THIS movie bad, but it's set to ruin the next ones as well.
The only slim ray of hope (because hope springs eternal) left for the next movies is that they include what they missed out in HBP at the start of the first seventh one.
It is absolutely a horrible interpretation of the book and I hope that they look at all of the mistakes and gaps left for the next movie and fill them in with more than humor (they are supposed to be in the middle of an all out war aren't they?)
The way that the plot moves isn't very fluent, and usually just jumps from one scene to the next; which can be irritating.
Here's exhibit A in crappy dubbing - these guys ignore all syntax as they lurch around waiting to pounce on the next lip movement.
All we need to worry about is that the next time, we don't send in any asthmatics and we can be sure that the operation will be a tidy success--just like Afghanistan was (with certainly no errant bombs and no mis-information).
Bond should kill a guy, make a glib joke, then look for the next scumbag that needs killin'.
Anyway we wandered into the theatre next door and picked up Star Trek.
And fans of Lopez will hope he finds a better script for his next project.
Using nothings from the original film (not the same characters, not the same style, not the same comic timing), this film is one that you have to watch alone, not standing right next to the original Broderick vehicle.
You'd be much better off seeing the anime (which is excellent) or maybe watching "L" when it comes out next year, because the same actor is in it.
I would rather watch the grass grow for the next 4 years than have to watch this again.
She goes from crying to seducing him, and he lets it happen with obvious results...  One of the main characters is Zoe, was bitten by a Vampire, but as long as she takes these "experimental pills" she got in Mexico City, she's fine, although her body temperature is below room temperature...  Guard outside of monastery where hero is staying the night is killed by vampires, hero leaves the next day.
Here's hoping that Scott Reynold's next film, _When Strangers Appear_ is an improvement.
Sarah Polley reminded me her next movie - My Life Without Me - all the time.
Thanks to Marc Cherry, we will be living with these dumbfounded housewives for the next few years, unless people get their brains checked, which is unlikely to happen!
The show needs to end this season or next at the most.
If DH were a magazine, you would find it in the grocery store checkout line over the tic tacs and next to People Magazine.
Not in this movie - the scares are safe enough to guarantee that your little sister and her friends can see this on Saturday night and not have to sneak in from "Ice Princess" next door.
I found myself being bored more than anything else and waiting for the next scary scene to shake me awake.
I'm really disappointed by this episode and i'm hoping that the next one will be better....which should not be so hard!!
People appear and disappear at random, they run from the beast in terror and the next moment are chatting quietly.
The next problem is that the plot is as boring and predictable as the actors.
Somehow he travels back in time to the next day he last remembered, and finds himself in the same hospital after being involved in a car accident ( this he learns in course of the events).
The dojo is right next to a liquor store, but nobody seems to mind.
Hopefully they'll get it right next time.
Maybe they should pimp Xzibit's teeth next time: there simply isn't enough gold and silver glittering in that damn mouth of his.
What's next?
Bette is supposed to be planning the next issue of her magazine around a June wedding and using a typical family for the June issue.
In a pre-Code, Davis would have simply said, "Well, look me up when you're next in town and we'll hit the hay.
I'll be expecting Jackie Chen's next performance, and I'll also try to avoid the production from others in the crew..
At the cinema I was sitting next to some teenagers that obviously was waiting for the great battles, and while waiting they were talking and "play fight" with each other.
I keep looking for the next sleeper hit and I keep reading the reviews given by extras on the set or others involved with the movie saying it was the greatest movie ever made, blah, blah, blah.
I hope Pepe Bojorquez's next film proves to be more engaging and less clichÃ©.
Having revisited POLTERGEIST just recently, I was startled watching this sequel in just how far it deteriorates in overall quality from one film to the next.
About the only thing it has in its favour is the fact that the people who made it did so with next to no money (supposedly), and did so for the sheer joy of making it rather than for commercial gain.
Most of the more spaceport-like locations are so undetailed that it makes the next problem look suspicious indeed.
I certainly hope that what Panicstruck Productions makes next is an improvement.
Boring fight scenes where it was obvious the actors were waiting for the next move of their opponents.
The next thing is the characters.
I know I sound sexist in this next comment but I'm really not.
Eventually we became joking among ourselves - "hey, maybe something will happen in the next scene!"
Happily, Laura Linney-- proving the old adage that what doesn't kill you makes you stronger-- earned an Oscar nomination for her work in her next project, giving an extraordinary performance in an extraordinary film, `You Can Count On Me,' which was also one of the best films of that year.
On the next morning, I plugged "DIL CHAHATA HAI" again & then again.
Preity and Dimple play the next most prominent characters in the movie.
Cheap melodrama, flat and bombastic characters, ridicule script lines a real person would never say, and everything is so predictible - you can always guess what happens or what will be said next.
The next scene, she is in love with him.
I got the feeling several times in this film, that when the writers reached a crossroads as to where the plot should turn next, they just said, "F*ck it.
We expect the next scene to show us one or more children in danger, but we don't see them again for days.
I have to admit, that first season of Monk was really amazing - original, interesting, entertaining and I was always looking forward to the next episode.
When you think of all the great series that have reached these shores from the USA, it is an insult to the American people to think that they can actually enjoy this rubbish, and can't actually wait until the next episode is aired.
The worst part, not only they have made ''infomercials'' in the show (adverting products in the show) but yesterday a character openly invited the public to vote for a certain candidate in the next Mexican presidential elections.
You can use this film as a base towards improving on your next.
The host Mark Taylor a large man in dress suit which tell about what you will see next and say TO MANY times: What you are about to see next is shocking!.
The next star is Saif Ali Khan who never really proved himself as an actor.
Let's call this movie growing pains and wait for the next one.
THEN, next episode another person falls in the water, comes back and the cycle continues, nothing new really happens in the first few episodes.
The next infuriating thing is the incredible lack of any balance regarding the Bush presidency and what has really been done during his Republican period.
He's hit from above, exactly from some upstairs floor of a building in Chicago, during a night in the next year.
And next year more will be killed and on and on.
But that's what makes it great; you never know where the next scene might lead you.
In one scene she's waving hello with her generous bust; in the next - a crucial one involving PL's character - there's patently no trace of her nor does anyone ask.
The story is just not good enough to keep the audience interested what's happen next.
The next time I watch the show, I'll restrict myself to seasons 1-6, which were magic of the first order.
"He learned too late that man was a feeling creature and because of it the greatest in the universe..." ...next time on Biography!
(http://imdb.com/title/tt0113526/) Well Roshans, hope to see an original movie next time around!
Trumpy is small in one scene, huge in the next.
Something comes to earth and lands in the woods next to a cabin inhabited by a high pitched boy who has a thing for animals, his mother and some old cranky guy.
It manages to be obnoxiously preachy and sticky sweet one moment, and then violent, offensive and stupid the next.
- "no"  - "it's something we learned about the marabantu, they move clockwise in 30Â° angles"   - "you mean we're next?"
"you mean we're next?"
When you're being attacked by the black dots while standing next to a riverbank and the firetorch doesn't work properly just jump in the water!
There were several places where the music did not transition smoothly to the next scene or even within the same scene.
We are asked to believe that one day she is perfectly lucid & signing contracts & the next day she has no cognitive abilities except those of a dog.
The next tedious hour involves Billy trying to convince the police that his teacher is the murderer while the teacher zeroes in on Billy.
game where Billy tries to convince Shaft that his history teacher murdered the hot blond next door.
Which is what might work best about the film: Any community that has hookers wandering the streets, satanists butchering them and hot blonds moving in next door who don't mind being ogled by their horny neighbors can't be all that boring of a place to live, I guess.
1) A plethora of disgusting characters including the boy not wanted next door Shahid Kapoor, the horrible, sickly hunk Sunny Deol ( save them, someone!
I mean i thought he was the next best thing.
OK I'm not gonna go through each actors performance individually so I'm just going to describe the next 7 in 4 words or less.
It's next Christmas and the family is going on yet another McCallister clan vacation.
So the next day while Kevin was enjoying a limo ride across town, Tim Curry discovers that the credit card Kevin used to check in was stolen.
I'll tell you about Home Alone 3 next time.
Ayesha Takia, who managed to spark interest with her role in 'Dor', does nothing with her role leading her to quickly becoming the most un-interesting fairly new talent of the next generation.
When Kevin McCallister comes out Duncan's Toy Chest store then also Marv and Harry come out Duncan's Toy Chest then Harry say "So where to next" then Marv says "should we go to the Central Park Zoo" that was hilarouis.
the original home alone spawned 3 extra movies, this being one of them, the next one being a colossal make, the one after that a colossal failure made only for TV.
However, next time, please take some additional time to conduct the proper research on proper wear of Navy uniforms.
Aside from that, the movie protrays Arab customs rather poorly, on one side, the director of the movie is keen on showing Arab rich people sitting on the ground and eating with their hands from one big plate (to somehoe portray primitivity) and forcing Fonda and Kristofferson to do the same (which doesn't happen in real life, they give guests plates and spoons if they need them), but the director makes a bigger slip of showing them shaking hands with Fonda and sitting right next to her in the dinner.
A bunch of teenagers rent the house next door for a night of debauchery.
They fly around in one shot, then worry about falling in the next.
Each of the original 3 films made me want to see the next one in the series; this film made me NOT want to see the next one.
Sorry George, maybe next time.  
What shall we dis next?
Okay, I've seen it, but the next time I watch it I'll have some liquored up friends over for some solid laughs.
The film does have its moments and from time to time begins to develop relationships between the characters, but the director seems determined to keep rushing on to the next unremarkable action sequence instead of allowing the viewer any kind of emotional engagement.
I didn't take this loosely the next day, first of all I speak Spanish and the language was not an issue, secondly, if two beers are making me so incompetent, AA in my area will be my next google search.
So I decided to give the movie (and me) a new chance the next night.
In a proper world all profits would be given to charity and the people involved would be horsewhipped for about ten minutes and sent off with a warning that the next time the punishment will be much worse.
The writers need to definitely try harder next time!
The next hour of the movie is these people sitting in a cabin talking with random images spliced in here and there.
I have yet to watch Manos : The Hands of Fate, that flick is next on my list but unless you want to brag that you have seen the worst movie in existence do NOT watch this, its a real character building flick.
You see Mars and Earth were once next door neighbors so the Martians made it to earth, burrowed underground for millenia.
The next part of the movie will bore you to tears as uninteresting people mull around a boring cabin for the rest of the film.
George and Gwen Kellerman, two hicks from Ohio, are flying in so George can accept a job at an interview the next morning.
Now, this next statement might only convey that I've been spoiled by living a nice, sheltered life in a first world country, but the reason this doesn't work is that misanthropy is only funny when people are randomly slaughtered left and right (Robot Chicken).
This film is about a young Ohio couple, George and Gwen Kellerman (played by Lemmon and Dennis) who are on the way to New York City for a business trip that George has the next morning.
First, when they are on their flight to New York, the pilot says that everyone on board will have to go to Boston (after much time consumed circling over the big city, due to weather conditions), they lose their luggage when they arrive at the Boston airport (and try to find it in a panic, while hurrying to catch a train), they hustle by cab over to one station to board a train, but Gwen has to go to the women's room, but can't find it due to hurrying to make the train (the one they board has no one on but a cleaning lady, and they miss the one they were looking for, which was next to the empty one), then they hustle to another station to get on board one and try to get something to eat on a car with almost no food, they arrive later on at a transit station in New York and discover that all of the transportation services are on strike, so they walk in the rain to their hotel, and Gwen breaks the heel on her shoe while walking before they arrive, only to discover that their room was given away to someone else after the 10 pm deadline, then they walk with a man who helps them find another room (only to rip them off by robbing them at gunpoint, taking George's wallet), then they try to go to the police station to report the guy who scammed them, then go the armory by the police, only to get their route foiled by some liquor store robbers, they get dumped in the park and mugged by a stranger at 4 am while sleeping under a tree (George's watch was taken while he was sleeping), then they find Cracker Jack on a bench for breakfast (that a dog steals almost immediately, which George breaks a tooth on, causing him to whistle on his spoken S's), they get chased by a cop on horseback for an assumed problem with a child in the park, and more funny situations to come.
Okay, don't get me wrong, I love computer effects as much as the next guy, but there is such a thing as TOO MUCH!!!
The majority of people who liked this casting probably just liked seeing Sam Jackson meditating next to a poorly animated Yoda (SHAFT AND YODA TOGETHER IN THE SAME ROOM, MEDITATING LIKE BUDDHISTS!
This is a voice of a person, who just finished watching the second season of Rome, almost at one go, and grabbed the opportunity to see "what happened next" - this film conveniently takes off where Rome ends.
The second is when the prop gun spends an entire scene floating in water next to the actors.
Likeable stars, not very likeable movie(better luck next time??
In one scene there's ships on the sea, the next they're gone.
Despite his planning ahead, it looks unlikely that George will be at his interview with the company President at 9:00 a.m. sharp the next morning.
I hope they can afford a tripod next time The miserable acting is barely saved by the hard porn This is not a film IT IS porn There is no lighting.
In another wonderful scene where sex becomes comedy, Anna and Johan start to make love, while Frank is asleep in the next room.
Suddenly the plot seems to be there only to introduce the next sex scene.
The final nail in the coffin is the change in personalities of the final act and as predictable as the coming of next year will have you shaking your head.
I am probably being harsh, but just like all kinds of white rappers showed up after Eminem took the world by storm, so has some other wannabes trying to become the next Tony Jaa, (even though his success here in the states has at the very least been limited) Granted this kid did O.K.
You could have put Richard Petty next to Julia Roberts in that puff fest and still made mega box office).
I saw a clip from the next Looney Tunes movie and it is even more Muppet looking than this one
Draven) & Jayne (Allison Lange) decide they want to take their friendship to the next level & start dating, however local jock, bully & tough guy Darren (Cameron Zeidler) isn't happy about the nerdish hippie Will dating the hot Jayne & starts to make trouble.
Don't know if i'll bother with the rest of the shows next week!!!
The interesting framing of many scenes held my interest for ten or fifteen minutes, for the next 100 or so I found myself wondering, "Why should I care?"
I give it a "1" and file it next to "Ishtar."
And there was next to no chemistry between him and Ferrell.
--Death Screams, or House of Death as it is known here, is one of the most absurd horror films I've seen next to Drive-In Massacre.
The next thing we notice is that nearly all of the actors' voices seem dubbed.
Hopefully, just like this film was a tad better than his previous "Everybody Loves Sunshine", Goth's next film, the Chow Yun Fat starring "The Wretched" will be a tad better than this.
The woman next to me slept through the entire film and by the time it finished, I could not help thinking she had the right idea.
I found rebecca to just be simply ridiculous she delivered her lines with the expressiveness of dried paint, she tried to be the quirky yet cute girl next door, then the dark broken stoner girl, roles few can pull off.
Anyone else watch something else because anything beats watching this crap for the next 90 minutes.
This movie was so bad, i thought i was infected with the T-Virus when i had a strange urge to eat the brains of the people next to me in the movie theater... but they wouldn't mind, they were watching the most brainless movie ever.
To set up the next movie in the series - a completely unnecessary task, as the film has already made it clear that there is absolutely no help for the next sequel in terms of quality.
The Charmed Ones official web site has announced their budget has been cut for the next season, meaning the stars will wear no clothing at all and will substitute old copies of "Bewitched" episodes for new scripts.
The action jumps, unmoderated, from one scene to the next, often losing a sense of dramatic causality.
Please, for gods sake, next time rate such kinda work at 85+, or better 100+.
The next half hour we get a bimbo, who we're supposed to believe is a park ranger, the only park ranger who never wears her uniform top.
For the next 30 minutes we get 100% soap opera.
I am also ready for the next movie if there will ever be one!
I hope the next one will be good as the rest!
Alas, the very next scene after you see Gedrick's plane explode, they cut to a military guy saying "No, the kid's dead and buried..." thus removing all doubt that the entire rest of the picture will be without him.
I sat stunned for the next 10 minutes, mouth agape, missing several key plot points while I sat there thinking to myself, "They really killed him?
This movie continues to be the only movie I have ever walked out on...I watched up to the point where his fly buddy that is up there when he gets killed sits down with the Russians to plan the attack to take place later in the film and then I couldn't take it anymore...I never saw what happens next, nor do I ever care to find out.....
Still it is at least better than the next two entries.
Now, I like cute dog tricks as much as the next person, but this movie takes the cake.
The rest of the movie is catapulted into a world where dream states and reality exist almost as one, and you have no idea from moment to terrifying moment what the hell is going to happen next.
With the action scenes, the extras just sit up waiting to be hit and are poorly put together in a way that you can see Stallone's next move as he wins the punch-up from a beaten position.
All they wanted was to get to the next piece of the...  Story: The entire story of FFVII is laid out in a straight line, with nothing resembling a twist along the way.
Every event progresses directly into the next exactly as one would expect.
They plays clips from Monday night Raw on how the next match/ love feud came about.
Clips of the events leading up to the next event are shown Match 6) Triple H beats Eugene in an alright match.
I won't give away the ending but let's just say the Tall Man is temporarily disposed of until the next sequel comes out, although the dream element that's supposed to encompass the whole sequence of events in the film, is a big negative against it.
Repeatedly, the person whose name is unexpectedly about to be called next happens to pipe up with some exaggerated utterance, on cue, right before being named.
This film had some funny lines in it, but for the most part is one of those films you won't remember any of the lines from the next day, and a month later will have you wondering if you saw it or not at the video store.
It's a gripping, savage sequence that reminds one of the opening in "Jaws", as Silverstein probably intended, but what does he give us next?
Now, I do hope Caro will be directing again and with a better budget and more freedom over his uncompromising style, making this one just a trial step for better materials next time.
After a while, it just becomes tedious waiting for the next victim to go off alone.
I just think they were the stronger actors and a next possible movie would be better off using them as the focus.
That's the worst thing, it's stupid and shallow, and very lame, but it's also really funny, and you end up stuck to the screen waiting to see what happens next!
From the gas as well - as she is sitting right next to the stove.
Now hold on, I'll say that one more time: Her MOTHER dies next to the stove without noticing the gas leak, but her FATHER not only notices the gas, but he notices the gas IN HIS SLEEP and WAKES UP!
The end of the movie made absolutely no sense....it made my head hurt and my girlfriend still has a confused look on her face the next morning ;) I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for examples of no talent....otherwise...curl up on the toilet with a nice magazine and you'll probably be more entertained.
I kept watching and waiting to see what muck was going to appear on the screen next.
The programme begins with Longford appearing on a radio talk show, which in itself is a warning sign for what's coming next.
Bravo guys, here's to another feature, I can't wait to see what you come up next, let's hope its even shorter.
Does your audience want to see what is going to happen next?
So what does this supposedly intelligent scientist do next?
Lets get our hopes up for the next one the First two were great!
The film does have some positives though, the special effects/gore is above par and done very well, and it's fun to watch the cute "Eiko" prance around, I'd like to see her in more films, hopefully in a more serious role though next time.
If there's anything I have to say, you can't fall asleep through a movie like this, because you can't wait to see what ridiculous thing will happen next!
It kills jaws,flicks off a helichopter,does the disco,and gets killed by annoying soldiers that stick thier gun barrel right next to the lens of the camera all with out making a noise mind you.
As the next scene begins, "Boys Beware" begins to erode in its coherence.
Ever since seeing her in 10 Things I Hate About You, I've been anxiously awaiting Julia Stiles' next film.
The next time that we see him, Monk has turned into an Orson Welles type auteur and is making Shakespeare movies.
Oh, yes, at least, the soundtrack is worth buying, even if the movie vanishes from your memory the next day.
Better luck next time guys!
Overall the best thing thing I can about Demonic Toys is that I thought it passed 80 odd minutes without to much pain but there isn't a whole lot here that impressed me & I'll have probably forgotten about it by next week (or at least I hope I will have).
I wouldn't sit next to him on the subway if he looked like that.
But perhaps the critics are being a bit unfair by measuring it next to films like "American History X" and "Romper Stomper".
If you put it next to a highly-produced Hollywood film like A.H.X, then sure this one will look sick in comparison.
Or if you put it next to a truly fantastic piece of cinema like "Romper Stomper", a film that actually played in art house cinemas around the world, it just isn't fair.
One plot line is deadly serious, another is romantically charged, the next is played for laughs, and on and on it goes.
The kidnapping takes place so that Hartman's character can stall his next flight long enough so that the bad guys can steal some gold, money, potatoes...who really cares?
However this movies sets where so cheap and the plot line was so bad that you honestly will have trouble remembering what happened in the movie the next day after seeing it.
But with such crap writing and such carefree characters, it's just a lot of waiting around for the next death scene to occur.
It goes from one scene to the next without anything remotely interesting or scary happening.
Well, you can guess what happens next at the morgue.
Then the next flashback which is a bit longer and I'm sitting there thinking "Yes I've seen the first Boogeyman!
Then the next one comes up and I figure screw it and fast forward through it.
The acting in this film is so hilariously atrocious and the mummy so cheesy that you just might have to rent this the next time you have one of those 'bad movie nights' with your friends.
Orlando Jones is the music director of a college band department that has recruited band's "next big thing," a drummer out of Harlem (Cannon) who faces the usual growing pains while feebly attempting to prove that the band members belong on the same level as the jocks...  Before you start chastising me for knocking the band and all the times we had in high school, I am only saying that band members are not on the same level as jocks, but they ARE athletes at the college level.
Jones meets with some resistance as he attempts to deal with "the next big thing," both from his boss, his peers, and the section leader of the snare drum section.
I'm a drummer myself I'm gonna be in Marching Band again next year and this movie had no point to it at all, I mean I know he can't read music but you can't be in band if you can't read music.
For no reason characters say things like, "I wonder if we'll go to the moon in the next century" and "the 1900s will know no war.
Steven Chow's next movie should be a horror film called "Revenge of the CJ7s" and it would be about cute fuzzy dog aliens avenging the death of the first CJ7.
It's kind of fun also to see how the scenarists managed to leap from one implausible, contrived plot development to the next - but that's a secondary matter because most of these films were beyond belief.
There are a few moments of genuine tension immediately after Lisa's death, but thereafter the film simply descends into gore and mayhem; the only tension is that involved in playing a game of "guess who will be the next to be killed, and how".
Perhaps there will be a ROLLER BLADE UNIVERSITY or the like coming out in the next few years!
The characters are paper thin and the plot lurches awkwardly from one yawn-inducing scene to the next.
When she meets Mark's wife Kay Trevor (Glynis Johns) and his son Brian (Martin Stephens), she is invited by Kay to stay with them until the next morning.
Years later, the host's daughter returns to her long boarded-up family home to discover someone is killing off the dinner guests, making everyone wonder who will be the next victim."
The only mild laugh was from Jonah Hill as a student who sits next to Ben at the library.
There ARE a few good moments - the wall of time flashback, the ending - but most of it is just so bizarrely wrong that you just go on watching to see what comes up next.
The Sheriff goes out in a very small boat and looks about a bit and comes back (if internal continuity is to be believed, the next morning) having found nothing.
She claims she's a descendant of Zeus, he doesn't care as long as he can sell his next script.
Andie MacDowell's sinusoidal career moves on, this performance being on the good side of average (her next will invariably be on the bad).
Here's hoping for a better effort from Brooks the next time.
Trevor Howard plays the old chief ready to move on to the next life, but the Great Creator seems to have other plans for him before that event takes place.
He simply wanted to be rid of Anne, to beget a male heir off of his next mistress.
To date, this is the penultimate feature from director Lee Madden, whose next film, Ghost Fever, was even worse.
Other round-eyed Caucasian relatives drop by to visit, there is intrigue and romance under the jungle canopy and next to the photogenic ruins, and at some point the panther emerges from the teeming forests to claim the only white woman in the cast.
One minute he's an art critic who admits to smoking pot, the next he's driving full speed out to meet some people at a drug deal to save a temper-prone, "sensitive" kid's life.
For their next picture 'Wilt' ( 1989 ), Mel and Griff sensibly hired Andrew Marshall and David Renwick to adapt a Tom Sharpe novel.
The plot is a weak and empty bus that serves no purpose other than to drive the movie from one fight scene to the next.
Some examples: fight in the snow, dividing the film in chapters, the kill list, the cartoon (images in Lady Snowblood, anime in Kill Bill), the extreme education both the Lady and the Bride had to suffer (and while we're comparing: after seeing "Lady Snowblood", Beatrix's education looked like kindergarten), the big fight in an establishment (okay, the opponents weren't masked, but the next scene was set at a masked ball)...
What's next, George A. Romero remaking 'Dirty Dancing'??
I'm sure they'll do better next time.
A group of survivors seem to have no fear confronting a cadre of marauding flesh eaters in one shot, but are ostensibly paralyzed at the appearance of a single ghoul the next.
From one monotonous conversation to the next, 'Full Frontal' is nothing more than an exercise in self-indulgence.
Is the next Soderbergh film going to be about the bowel movements of Hollywood heavyweights?
Occasionally the pistols disappear in one frame and the next he is firing an Uzi, with as much enthusiasm as a stoned teenager playing "operation wolf" on an arcade.. Baldwin gets, NO-KILLS in the whole movie, in fact he is so far on the back burner it makes you wonder why he was even included in the film?..
The movie seems to be pulling in at least three directions at once; one minute it's a buddy movie, the next it's a shoot-em-up, and for brief spurts it's a supernatural thriller.
The next night I watched "The Last King of Scotland".
Maybe the girlfriend moved in with them next.
The monster can take physical form and obeys Lombardi's every command, and his next command is to kill Timothy!
There's none of that belief here, probably because the cast of movie veterans knows they're on the downgrade and can look forward to little more than the next Social Security check.
I made the mistake of starting to watch rather late one night, and found that my eyelids were drooping so badly that I had to stop the tape halfway through and continue the next day.
The next guy to die is one of the faceless black actors and yes, he's blown up by his bomb, so 5 are dead and we're halfway through the cast with 2 sets of alliances going (Vinne Jones & the Japanese guy, Stone Cold and the husband of the dead Hispanic woman).
All the way through, every next action or scene is predictable, so I rewinded almost half of movie.
This movie isn't trying to be the next Fletch Lives.
I was somewhat insulted, but when the film began settled for enchantment which was sufficiently strong to keep me around when the second installment (I think there were only two, but this was 20-odd years ago) came along next night, when I also learned that the picture would be replayed throughout the promo which allowed me to make a tape of it.
And in the courtroom, one second, he is fooling everyone with his acting, then the next, he becomes a complete dimwit w/o the ability to improvise through anything.
at which I spent the next five minutes laughing.
You can find out the answers to these questions the next time "The Deadly Look of Love" airs on your local station.
We're not in that spirit invited to care for the Danish mother and her husband, and we follow them, I don't know, for the next 50 minutes!
The movie has no nudity, very little swearing and next to no violence, blood or gore---how did this get an R rating?
Then the 4 college students are next.
We kept on guessing the movie would show what 'it got' in the next 5 minutes, and we kept repeating that to ourselves every 5 minutes, but when the movie ended it still had not happened.
The next day, he comes back and they shoot him again.
The next day, well, the robots kind of defy their masters and refuse to obey.
The next time, his hand is hanging down.
Even the "surprises" in the film aren't clever or they are completely wasted in the next scene.
They went from acknowledging the drug in the previous episode and with no backstory or character development, they simply demolished the creator and sole pusher of the drug before the opening credits finished rolling on the next episode.
The star,Kathy Long,is no beauty to look at.She seems like many of these female martial arts B-movie types who do movies like these,they look beat up and have next to no sex appeal to them.Not to mention her lack of acting skills which need no mentioning anyway.
Maybe next year.)
The first being that after a while, it was almost entertaining watching for the next goof.
There is one good side to this movie however and that is it can be used in video classes at universities to show an example of what not to do when making a movie of any kind, for example, don't even make a movie that is so boring people can tell by looking at the actors faces.2 : spend the extra money and get a wardrobe so the actors can change clothes 3: don't use archive footage and if you absolutely must use archive footage don't get footage that doesn't make sense, like a single car exploding next to a body of water doesn't make sense when matched with an explosion or accident of two cars in a land locked area.
There's even another car visible blowing up right next to the BMW.
It becomes much more serious when the next victim is obviously human, and in a much more deadly trap, and they are trying to access anything that will lead them to the creator and killer, but it is "untraceable".
We the audience obviously see the killer, Owen Reilly (Joseph Cross), and takes a while for them to realise it is him, but when they do, after about one or two more victims, including Jennifer's good friend Griffin Dowd (Colin Hanks, Tom's son), Jennifer finds herself the next, and eventually last victim of the deadly traps.
The most terrifying part of Untraceable is not the scenes of suspense or gruesome torture; but the image this film left me withÂthis could be the next step in societies demand for "reality" entertainment.
As soon as he hung up without passing on the information, my movie brain said he is the next to die, and my professional brain said if he dies it is her fault for being a terrible leader and manager.
I'll have to try that next time.
Several small Nevada towns, Tonopah, Goldfield, Beatty, Indian Springs, and Pioche, are literally next door to the Nevada Test Site, and they haven't died off from cancer either.
and how many times can someone be the one like think of something new every time someone says oh I'm the last immortal at the end of the film then there's always another load in the next one its just pitiful.
I know, I know - hear this one guys - a leather clad S&M weirdo that talks like he just sat on his balls and makes next to no sense and we'll... we'll call him something big, like - what about The Guardian?
Draven) & Jayne (Allison Lange) decide they want to take their friendship to the next level & start dating, however local jock, bully & tough guy Darren (Cameron Zeidler) isn't happy about the nerdish hippie Will dating the hot Jayne & starts to make trouble.
It is a short film that will be easily forgotten and I doubt it will be redistributed when the next line of Blair Witch 2 products come out.
The black and white photography is astonishing; there is a particular scene of the young couple running through the forest at high speed that is extremely beautiful; at times, the scenes are so realistic one wonders how they did this (did they actually put the actors next to a real forest fire?)
What's next?
One meet Chuck is talking to a guy, the next you see some man bring a naked women on top of the table.
the whole movie bored the hell out of me, while versus was so great and crazy, loaded with anticipation for whats to come in the next second all the way through, this is just lame....sorry, i cant tell you to go see this in the cinema or even rent the DVD, i really cant.
Independently, the two set out to unravel the mystery of Apartment 1303 while trying not to become it's next victims.
I wish he would have followed the goofy beginning to it's logical next step (A spoof movie of Asian horror would be great if done right) but Oikawa instead elects to follow paths already forged out in J-Horror.
The victim sees something horrible off-screen and then the next scene shows them falling off the balcony.
At least with "The Grudge" you never quite knew how the next victim would perish.
Mandy Moore just looks like a girl next door & she is the only one who tried to act here apart of Robin.
Young lovers Ben Murphy (John Krasinski) and Sadie Jones (Mandy Moore) have just made plans to take their relationship to the next level and get married.
I kind of forgot what happened next.
But before the unit can plan next strike, Ivan takes revenge, striking against a bank and the American mess hall.
I hope DEJ productions make a better film next time.
Scenes of the father running from one locale to the next are dull and repetitive.
Then a woman Lazenby is supposed to meet in a theater is strangled by the killer and nobody else in the theater notices it until Lazenby sits down next to her.
If not, I'll spell it out for you Â it's an incredibly bad movie with one ridiculous set-piece after the next.
So next time Junior's running wild and you want him to settle down, plop him down in front of this film.
I'm guessing that I'll be the very small minority on my next statement since everyone but me loves this show but the only show I can compare it to is How I Met Your Mother.
Still it did give me the opportunity to stand next to Mad Frankie Fraser at the London Film Festival and notice how small he was.
Until next time.
Rogers next meets Gabby's lovely daughter Dale Evans (as Susan); she is atop the stallion "Golden Sovereign'.
Maybe next time they'll get V right.
Now, I next to never cry but at the end when Jacey decides to let the Coopers adopt her son,Charley, is so sad but yet happy.
(Please note that the next comments on the movie are stretching the truth to the limit.
For once it wasn't a film of being pregnant, it portrayed what came next and I think that was a smart move.
Then, Gunter of Burgund had two brothers, both of whom were quite intelligent young men who ruled Burgund together, not just one lad barely out of puberty, who just happens to *sneak* onto the ship they sail to Iceland with, just so he can get some more screen time, because he had to be introduced to the public for the next Harry Potter movie, in which he will be starring as Cedric Diggory.
Then when I saw that tonight TCM was highlighting Danny Kaye movies and that "Wonder Man" was on next, I rushed over to IMDb.com to read the reviews on it since I had never seen or heard of this Danny Kaye movie before.
Hope his next giallo film has same grit his former giallo visions have portrayed...
The story meanders hopelessly from one ridiculous scene to the next.
What next?
He fells in love with a singer named Christine (Argento's daughter Asia) and decides to get rid of anyone who stands in her way to become next leading soprano.
What a total let-down!What a huge disappointment!I still can't believe that Dario Argento was responsible for this Hollywood-influenced piece of garbage.It's simply a romance with some splashy gore thrown in.All of Argento's trademarks are gone here:no cool camera angles,no Goblin music,no playing with colors,no black-gloved killer,no bizarre dreamlike sequences,and worse of all,absolutely no suspense.The direction is very flat,the acting is horrible and the characters are not interesting at all.The gore scenes are well-done,but the film is extremely boring.All in all,"Phantom of the Opera" is pretty hard to sit through since it is so lame and unscary.I wouldn't be able to watch this trash again.I only hope that Argento's next horror project "I Can't Sleep" will be really worth watching.Avoid "Il Fantasma dell'opera" like the plague.Better watch "Suspiria" or "Deep Red" again.Not recommended.
The next thing you know he will be playing some bald white guy sucking on a lollipop.
Freddy has a huge tattoo on his right arm...next scene, it's missing...no, there it is again...wait, it's gone...it's back, again...Hilarious!
Perhaps he can be Yoda in the next Star Wars film.
The acting is so good and the filming, timing, sights and sounds are so well done, that I forget I was watching a movie and felt that I was sitting next to over looking over the shoulder of the person (actor) in the scene.
I had received that episode of The Sopranos through my rental queue and Kundun was due to arrive as the next disc.
Our Patty the award winning actress, who got her acting skills from the Wide Eyed Screamers Acting School, keeps her eyes wide like saucers and lays there under a table screaming bloody murder while bits and pieces land next to her.
I hate his movies, but I always buy them thinking the next one will be a winner.
Miscast (I think only the supporting roles seem right) and horribly abbreviated this film plays like a greatest hits version of the story with everything geared to getting to the next key bit.
The Princess is not even there next to him, even if her father was just killed.
The story is rushed quickly jumping from one thing to the next without any plot development so the viewer is left constantly wondering what is going on, one second our main character is a naive farmer, the next he is suddenly a fully experienced warrior with absolutely no evidence showing exactly where he gained this experience from.
I had hoped they would take this great book and make it the next big fantasy series.
If you are waiting for the next chapters to come out then you must find watching paint dry and grass grow exciting.
I'll be waiting for the next 2000 chapters, but he calls it "hip-hopera".
earth 2 has some serious problems explaining things(and sci-fi is mostly about stuff you can somehow explain... as its called SCIENCE-fiction) and the story wont keep you longing for the next ep.
Hathaway mixes hard-won documentary-style footage with alarmingly transparent studio crap as Hayward wins over natives with her "big magic" (I'm going to ask my GP for some "big magic" the next time I see him) and Mitchum acts like an insensitive oaf over her dead husband, just because she won't immediately sleep with him.
There was no story, the characters were not developed at all, the acting was bad, and each scene had nothing to do with the next.
One can only ponder what next for Mickey, perhaps a starring role in Ishtar II?
", and trying to figure out one scene while it moves on to the next.
You'll see characters go into one location, no explanation as to why there there, and then in next scene they're at a different location.
the next film coming that i have heard of is "cars"with little cars that can talk and can controls themselves if you can believe this you can believe a lot of things.
Better luck next time."
Michael Dudikoff is a poor actor, but when compared to David Bradley he almost seems like the next Laurence Olivier, Steve James returns but ultimately this sequel is far too awful to dig up any entertainment value in this garbage.
The next point is this split-screen editing.
and then a moment later, before the next reel started, "WHY?"
The end give's us a nice little hook to see the next one as they mention Ryu and the Street Fighter Tournament, but if the same writer and director are to do it, I rather save my money and avoid watching it, especially if Charlie Nash (Chris Klein)will be in it.
The next day Maggie sees an advertisement on the window of a sex-club where a hostess is wanted.
Mr Delbert Mann is as entitled as the next person to have a pop,much as fellow American Mr Mel Gibson did many years later,but he was taking the p*ss a bit using big name English actors to do it.
Sinners in Paradise was next up in my DVD set.Featuring an intriguing cast and the inimitable James Whale as director, I thought it might be worth a good look.
Emmanuelle Beart is one of those paradoxical European actresses (like Penelope Cruz, Fanny Ardent, Emmanuelle Seigner......) - kind of ugly/beautiful, one moment their acting sucks (Mission Impossible, Manon des sources), the next it's sublime (A Heart in Winter, L'Enfer).
Comparing Cary Grant to Warren Beatty (in terms of this being a remake) is like putting Berlioz next to Madonna!
Against a blizzard of doomsayers, Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White, Pinocchio, Bambi, Peter Pan and Mr. Toad.
It sounds like a nightmare - you should marry in next 24 hours or lose a mighty heritage.
In the scene on the pond, it looked like the priest was being attacked by a furry bird, and you could see where the actors were going to walk next because the mike was leading the way.
If I were giving an Oscar to Mommie Dearest, It would be for the beautiful silver dress Faye Dunaway has on... to take Christina's rancid, awful meat to the freezer, just so she can make the little snot eat it the next day.
One second people are one thing, the next moment another, for no reason.
For Stephen Rea, look forward to his next Neil Jordan film.
Cue next anonymous hyperbolic scathing.
I will have serious words with her next time I see her.
This Mexican guy was working next door, but he somehow decides to move in with the main character.
He suddenly shows up at their back door (after a "scary" flashlight scene), and the next thing you know, him and the guy's wife leave to go to the hospital.
Shortly afterward, both he and the Hispanic handyman from next door, who has pleaded to be be given shelter in this man's home as his own is too far away to safely get to safely, finally finish sealing the house, his wife arrives home.
The handyman from next door decides that he has to get home, no matter what the risk, despite his earlier stoicism in the face of this episode - implausible.
That next morning, Sarah awakens in a daze and soon she's feasting on rare meat before graduating to human flesh.
pointing at the "friendly zombie" sat next to him in the jeep  mena's character "he's a vegetarian"!!!
Zombies throwing themselves at the car, everyone screaming, but the one I am sat next to?
Abel Ferrara - director of "Ms .45", "Bad Lieutenant", and "King of New York" - directed and stars as a struggling New York painter living a "Three's Company" lifestyle with two babes in a rat-hole apartment complex while desperately hoping to score some rent money with his next big 'masterpiece'.
Then a punk band moves next door and plays music at all hours of the night.
Ferrara himself stars as Reno, an unbalanced painter slowly going crazy due to financial troubles, the noisy punk-band next door, demanding employers and housemates, and non-stop images of the pauperized city.
Someone shouting from the top of a roof several houses away is as loud as someone standing next to you.
As easy as you can say beginner's luck, she manages to bring back her son and gets him ready for the next day of school.
One supposedly funny situation after the next that the boys find themselves in, barely connecting to form a plot at all, let alone something overly funny.
Is it just me or should they start labeling what you get to see in a movie and who you get to see it on right on the box next to the rating?
Why are things a catastrophe one minute and all fixed the next?
For out of work B-listerers like Steve Guttenberg and Crystal Bernard I can understand this as the next logical career choice.
SAURON is the next big problem.
A king turned evil sorcerer from the dark ages is conquering civilizations and he has his eyes set on the Emerald land next.
Tough luck, guys - hire better scriptwriters next time.
Here's how the whole thing SHOULD'VE begun and ended:  Director: I have this really great idea for a film about a dragon spear and a guitar and lots of red-eyed zombies- Studio Executive: Thankyou, next.
Or, even better:  Director: I- Studio Executive: Thankyou, next.
One can only hope that if Mandy Moore wishes to be taken seriously as an actress, she'll accept a better script next time, because she's not a terrible actress.
There's one good bit where a couple of characters are musing about who could be responsible for the neck-bite deaths and the next words we hear are 'Count Dracula' as the maid shows him in.
She is ludicrous in the role, and the idea of her editing novels was a stretch that no act of imagination could make remotely plausible -- the only thing you could imagine her checking on her Blackberry was where the next high school pool party with the cute guy was taking place.
It is predictable, so you don't need to pay too much attention to figure out what happens next.
Most of time the only thing happening next is a clichÃ© or a scene in which the film tries to make the viewer cry.
Completely lacking in humility, he offered us the following: "I hope...no, wait...I KNOW you're going to enjoy the next two hours."
Better luck on your next flick.
It is rare you run across a film where you could care less what happens to the characters or what will happen next on screen.
What's next?
You even feel it will work out for his mates Andy and Charlie as they trudge off at the end in the cheerful knowledge that they can start afresh chasing girls the next day (i love the way Charlie doesn't say a word thru the whole movie, goes along with Andy's silly schemes and eventually gets the last word).
Bob, Bing, and Dorothy land on a supposedly deserted island, but spend the night in the swankiest hut ever built, and Dorothy romps in a man-made lagoon the next morning!
Everyone in LA is infatuated with the lead character Jackson, even the "guy next door" who stalks him at work.
In the next scene, Jolie carries his son to another doctor for treatment!
Kirk Douglas has played some pretty rotten people on the screen, but even the cold blooded bank-robber/killer he played in his next film, There Was A Crooked Man, had far more going for him than this one.
However the dreams & visions won't go away & Jake discovers that those he has tattooed are dying is mysteriously circumstances & strangely their tattoos have grown, Jake finally comes to the conclusion that an evil Samoan spirit is using him to kill those Jake has tattooed & since Jake tattooed the love of his life Sina she will be next unless the evil spirit can be stopped...
The IMDb says The Tattooist had a budget of about $3,000,000 which I find hard to believe as next to nothing happens, where did all that money go?
Cheap sets - an "airport lounge" that looks like the set of a cheap office where some equally cheap 70s show had just been filmed, the "aircraft" with impossibly wide expanses, giant square door, "hundreds" of passengers of which we only see a handful and sometimes the cabin seems empty, the TWO, yes TWO stewardesses, disappearing passengers (Danny Bonaduce stops appearing in the cabin half way through) a cockpit where nothing ever seems to happen except hilarious radio exchanges, a plane that takes off and in the next shot is shown landing (different models, different colour schemes even used in consecutive shots of the supposed airliner taking off), not to mention the impossibly ridiculous "script".
This is not the kind of film that you could watch and not discuss with someone, IMDb readers, you are my shoulder to cry on for the next few minutes.
Hell, the Snoop Dog video that Taa-Dow (the black monk) was in looks like Oscar winning fare next to this dog.
The cabin would be almost empty in one scene, then the next scene, there would be someone in every seat.
And TV3, how about a Coleman Francis marathon next Sunday?
He seemed very tranquilized (yawn) until the "hahahahaha, I'm a killer and you're next" bit.
Will the Black Dahila murder be solved, will the good guys prevail, will Josh Hartnett learn to act, will the scenery hold up after Aaron Echardt's chews threw the movie- acting docile one moment, then out of control in the next-- find out when you see the Black Dahlia.... on video of course, after your friend buys it.
I suppose next it will be "The Return of the Black Dahlia".
Maybe they came back the next night, but I don't think so.
The craft service was the best -- I gained about 20 pounds during the shoot -- and they put the food right next to the medic station.
Also, when they figure out that the terrorists will next target Ron Silver (because of a certain bill that he sponsored), Brosnan goes over to his house - but instead of questioning Silver about who might be against this bill, who might want him dead, he just yells at him to stay away from his wife.
After perishing in an auto crash, a newswire photo flashed across the globe featuring Jayne's blonde wig next to the crushed car's right-front tire.
The predictability of the entire plot was just sad, I mean I could guess exactly what would happen next.
A little girl is killed by one of the villains and her blood spattered body is found on the big wheel of the circus the next morning... huh!
The plot such as it is is strange in that there are no vampires next door even though plot synopsis of the movie says there is.
Some major continuity moments happen when the film jumps from day to night suddenly & some of the scenes ending & the next one beginning make no sense either.
Draculas Curse lacks any descent acting - in many scenes the actors seem unsure of what their next line is which makes me wonder if this film was properly story boarded.
If my daughter hadn't been in the next theater watching a movie with her aunt, I would have walked out and gone home.
One minute people are dying, next there having rough intercourse.
This movie was so bad that I was cringing with every scene, but at the same time I was compelled to see what happened next.
Do yourself a favor, the next time this one's on: Change the channel.
Correct me if I'm wrong but wouldn't a tidal wave travel outwards from an eruption and trash the island next door?
Her next reality assignment is = How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days.
Only Lady Diana approaches the level of a person being elevated to veneration when in real life they were next to worthless.
The next paint-by-numbers HK-flik characteristic: the ol' you-wanna-pull-your-hair-out "why did he do that stupid thing" thing.
First of all, anyone who claims that he or she didn't find this head-scratcher confusing must be the next freakin' Einstein!
(Sorry, Mel, better luck next time!)
Not only does the film suffer from rehashed and lazy gags, Brooks' direction lacks coherence and is oft-times merely cursory; there are wide shots, reverses and close-ups which serve no purpose, camera blandly flitting from one unnecessary shot to the next, not merely misdirecting our eye, but searching for subject matter to fill the frame judiciously.
Andie(Kate Hudson) is a beautiful young woman that works for a women's magazine called Composure and for her next article, Andie has to write about how to lose a guy in 10 days.
Once the forms are signed Dracula travels to London to take up residence in his new property which is situated next to a mental asylum run by Dr. Jack Seward (Harvey Korman) & as Dracula introduces himself he notices Lucy Westenra (Lysette Anthony) a friend of Seward's daughter Mina (Amy Yasbeck) & takes an unhealthy interest in her as he changes into a bat, flies into her room while she is asleep & drinks her blood.
It's up to Van Helsing to save the day & Seward's daughter Mina who Dracula intends to become his next victim...
All of these youngsters are the stereotypical brainless morons who are hardly adverts to become the next Einstein!
Brilliantly acted and completely riveting to the viewer, "In a Child's Name" will have you on the edge of your seat, anxiously awaiting what will happen next.
I sure hope Menjou's constituents were watching this movie and sent him packing post haste after the next election.
The production values of this film are the next best thing.
In the next scene you see the woman has now appointed herself queen, treats the people even worse, and has a crown made of twist ties.
It's a stinker and it is so obvious that even my wife could guess what happens next.
One does not know that Beth spent a great deal of her time next door at the Lawrence's and was such a beautiful piano player.
Gosh, I wondered what would happen next.
My advice - the next time you feel the urge to view a movie of this calibre, make some spaghetti bolognese and put it on your head and do your best impression of Axel Rose.
The story gets so repetitive that we know exactly what will happen next: person goes out in search of missing camper in woods (alone of course), stumbles over body of last person who went out searching (alone) and promptly gets whacked by Madman Marz.
And how many times can various actors be standing next to an exploding mortar shell, dynamite, and hand-grenades and just get tossed about thirty feet and then walk away without a scratch?
There is, though, one reason to check this out during one of the 1,265 times that Sci-Fi will re-air it over the next 5 months: 'The Dance' scene must be witnessed to be believed.
Elwood waited until the next morning, when the warden finally came out and told him the awful news: Jake had passed away.
Mabey make some real characters next time.
What happens next is like a long and not particularly good talent show or perhaps a poor man's version of a Judy Garland/Mickey Rooney musical!
It's not 10 minutes of screen time between when she seemingly rejects anything but a career and is next going on and on about wanting to do nothing but darn Hayden's socks.
Her great intensity was constantly used to make her the most lethal of the three greatest actress (Davis comes next with THE LETTER and THE LITTLE FOXES, but with a bland iciness that rarely breaks until the end).
It was suspenseful and I always had the feeling of trying to see around corners to find out what was to happen next.
Though I must remember that trick next time I accidentally erase one of my answer machine messages.
All in all 'The Woods' is a fine horror and I eagerly await McKee's next movie!
I  enjoy looking at beautiful women as much as the next guy but at  least let it be in an entertaining way.
The action races on at a pace fast enough for the voyeuristic, dim-witted viewer to be thinking always about what happens next rather than the rubbish that has just been shown.
However, when she told us we were going to be watching SELENA the next day, all the girls who'd seen it seemed excited.
A sure-fire blockbuster and next in line to be re-done by Hollywood.
Here, he plays Duke Anderson - a career criminal who has just been released from prison and immediately begins plotting his next job - robbing the six wealthy residents of the apartment house in which his prostitute girlfriend (played by Dyan Cannon, in a role that accomplished little except to give a sort of logical reason why this place would be targeted) lives.
Whether it's Organized Rhyme, his own "The Tom Green Show" both pre and post MTV, or his first forays into film, "Freddy Got Fingered", "Road Trip", and 'The Chad' in "Charlie's Angels", I look forward to watching what he will do next.
Yet this potentially moving and engaging stuff *is* just padding, stuck in between very occasional action scenes as long, loooonnnnnggg vignettes which are then either just left behind or just magically resolved: e.g., after 20 minutes of closeup on the oldest girl's first 48 hours of stages-of-grieving, we jumpcut to some action, and she is just next - and last - seen frolicking off on a tricycle at her new home, daddy's loss just no longer to be at issue, and the part just as suddenly becomes an 'extra'.
I find Ethel Merman as likeable as the next person, and her semi-grating voice much more endearing than annoying.
The next few years are touched upon briefly as Molly and Terry add three children to their family, as well as their act; the toddlers hit the stage with mom and dad almost as soon as they make their entrance into the world.
It is merely written over, waiting for the next idea to spark and be done away with.
You can just FEEL his dad right next to the camera, paying off the director to keep him in this film.
For about the first thirty minutes I could not stop wondering what was going to happen next.
The next hour and a half left me with a sour taste in my mouth, bored, and wishing I was watching a different movie.
Klaatu is taken to makeshift hospital where we learn that he was walking in a 'placenta' suit one minute and then the next minute they are marveling about how he was 'just born'.
This next bit is even more shocking.
In some situations he is shown as extreme--using an alcohol wipe to open his own medicine cabinet door, for example--but then the next second he is touching people and objects willy-nilly and not appearing to be bothered at all.
When some students, including Marcy, simply vanish, Heather believes she will be the next one.
Mr. Lucky McKee, please do not wait for another four years to release your next movie.
I currently live in Franklin County, TN, and even poorer southerners who live in cities like Cowan or Decherd do not resemble in the slightest the extreme versions of Southerns found in this film, so if planning a trip to the south to see the southerners sitting on their front porch playing a banjo with a hound dog next to them, save yourself plane fare and don't bother.
You search the "script" for your next line, and it hits you...you're in one of the worst films ever made.
Do yourselves a favour next time you want to watch this stuff turn it off and pick out a movie doc like 'When we were Kings' now that is art
Here's to hoping McKee has an easier time getting a release for his next film.
If you want the message of the movie it is "life is a hellish cycle of rushing from one appointment to the next so be sure to stop and talk to the crazy homeless people".
Instead, we have to suffer through inept doctors, screaming family members, Jesse White somehow sold to us as a romantic lead and a whole LOT of drawn-out scenes with Jimmy telling stories of an imaginary rabbit to people who can't decide from one minute to the next if this guy should be locked up in a nuthouse or deified as the Greatest Man Alive.
This movie made me cry upon thinking of it the next day.
If you can sit through this movie without killing yourself or someone next to you who may have been involved in the selection process, then you are person who has a will of steel and should not be wasting his time watching movies but teaching some sort eastern Shinto religion.
What happens next and how everyone becomes happy in the end isn't really anything I want to discuss--I just want to never see this film again.
I love animals as much as the next guy, but to see people who take their love of animals to such extremes just made for a bad movie.
Neither their credits not this film make me think that they'll be the next big thing anytime soon.
This woman is now totally unbelievable as an actress and casting her as some girl next door character just doesn't work anymore (especially when you see how difficult it was for the makeup people to hide the bags under her eyes).
A homage to Sam Raimi, Tom Savini and the great zombie-king George Romero; done on a next to nothing budget.
Better luck next time.
I have seen many movies throughout my life just like the next guy.
I kept it on just to see if I could keep guessing what was going to happen next, I was usually right.
In one scene a police officer swears not to tell the authorities that the he had an accident with the Kellys in which he was wounded, he was pretty happy and swearers not to tell, 1 second into the next scene Ma Kelly is standing for trial.
Sometimes he'll address the audience, with lines like, `Not much will happen in the next few minutes.'
Who knows she could be in the next blockbuster, these days you never know.
Anyway, to cut a long story short, our hero and his new found pal next wind up working together at a sewage works, during which time they manage to save the life of a local mafia boss (a strangely benevolent chap at that) when he is attacked by his own cronies who are attempting to overthrow him.
The father dies and yet there is no funeral, no goodbye, no closure: cut next scene mother getting hammered again, brother moping around depressed.
The "Amanda Ray" character is not so lively the next morning and looks sort of like she was in the deep freeze for the entire night.
So next we meet a lawyer who seems to wanna help Fletch (do they do that?)
The next time it aired on TV I had the VCR at the ready.
I sat watching the film knowing that it was 19 degrees outside and a magazine editor had just informed me that my review of The Pianist, which I wrote for them in November, wasn't going to be in the issue he just took to the printers and he doubted whether it would still be relevant for the next issue in May.
I'm sorry, but if your Mom and her boyfriend are even starting to diddle your fiancÃ© there is a problem and no amount of next day apologies are going to make it right.
I hope she will do this before starting her next project, otherwise her films must be shown with a refund policy.
I couldn't find my interest in his skimpy story if I had a civil war ree-enacter sitting next to me.
First, Rozema gives us a feisty, spirited Fanny Price, who tells off Aunt Norris and Sir Thomas, who accepts Henry Crawford's proposal, and then rejects it the next day (a la JA herself with Harris Bigg-Wither).
They all do a good acting job and I still - the next day - feel quite a bit about the film, as you can see.
One of them is enough to make your ear drums bleed, both of them is next to intolerable.
Perhaps for his next movie Bob Odenkirk can make a feature about a group of alarm clocks.
I mean, one minute he (Boothe) is at her throat, and the very next minute he wants to "canoodle" with her!
To be fair, this isn't Wishman's worst film; that remarkable honour would go to her next film, a remake of her earlier flick Satan Was A Lady (And they say Van Sant's Psycho was unnecessary)!
Maybe the next time around Sajid, you should put some real efforts into making a movie and stop PLAGIARIZING!
But please guys, rent some decent equipment and lighting next time, OK?
I suppose I can trade this in next time I go to Half Price Books, but should I really subject anyone else to this?
If delivered faultlessly this could be funny but as it was next to unintelligible due to bad sound, a lisp and an actress tripping over her lines, I felt more like crying than laughing.
Sandler plays Michael Newman, a family man obsessed with work to the point that he has next to no time to spend with his family.
He gives himself a tan using the tint, he revisits old childhood memories and he torments the child next door.
It comes off as a mini-series, where you have to watch the next film to find out what happens.
I especially liked how deniro and his partner (police officers) were approaching a red right during a conversation, and in the next cut were driving down the road somewhere else.
The movie jumps around, has no flow, and seems as if the director didn't what scene to use next.
At no point in the movie was I curious to find out what was going to happen next.
who seek to "normalize" homosexuality (call me crazy, but I don't think Spacey's character is ever intended to be seen as the most normal guy on the planet), and then rants on in the next paragraph about how the movie lacks "climax," and therefore he's "frustrated" and "unfulfilled."
Her face subtly changing from sad bewilderment to becoming absorbed in the new film is an emotional high only bettered by the fact that she puts her ukulele on the seat next to her; she realises she isn't going anywhere and this new film might just be all right anyway.
Deanna tells him (and us) how she met Gene...they were sitting next to each other at a symphony concert.
What's next The Blues Brothers Country Club ?
Be warned, next you'll see, "Blues Brothers visit the Muppet Babies on Ice."
I'd be interested to see this director/writers next film, hopefully they'll have a little more faith in themselves and a little less need to keep the volume so loud.
I felt that if you jettisoned the rest of the characters and started over with these three, you'd might be able work out a plot that would not send you to the lobby to check out the posters of what is coming to the theater next week.
It's a low budget film with low budget digital effects and quite simple plot, reminding us B Movies in which actors play flat, monsters are unable to fright even the children, nobody cares about what it's going to happen next and everything is silly but entertaining.
That joke about the marquee listing the title of the next supposed sequel being called 'Unmasked part 26' probably didn't make sense in the alternate version called 'Hand of Death' either, and it does make for a really anticlimactic (and abrupt) ending.
Fonda (aside from his hideous acting) takes a .44 slug to the gut and rides out of it, then he rides out the next day without bleeding to death?
The last scene, which is badly edited (notice people walking about during gun battle, then gone in next scene, snow on ground in a drought season, etc), was absurd.
The intro states there isn't any type of vegetation on our planet any more, yet a couple of sequences later the characters are playing cat- and-mouse right next to a crystal clear lake surrounded with beautifully green plants.
The movie would have us believe that someone could get away with betting that a shot could be made on a player's turn and then being able to take the next shot because the player bought his opponent's turn and therefore the subsequent shot was still his.

He went downhill fast from here but "amoung other things", he still looks good next to Alexis.
If I have anything good to say, David Gant was pleasantly over the top as the mastermind behind the whole project, there's a nice pair of breasts, and the theme that is revealed in about the last fifteen minutes of the movie in a tossed-off manner of the fallacies of love & trust was pretty neat and I'd like to see it implemented in a good movie next time.
some of his films are really good, and others like "embryo" and this piece of drek should have been left to the next generation of actors.
However, 'everybody else' must have liked it because the cast stuck around for D'Amato's next Caribbean offering, PORNO HOLOCAUST (1981)  OK, I admit I was turned on by the hardcore threesome between Manlio Cersosimo and the two Dominican whores he had up in his room, but the rest of the film was totally un-interesting, horror-wise or sex-wise.
in a handout which i picked up in the cinema the director confesses to the fact that after each days shooting she then went and wrote the screenplay for the next days filming!

I thought Bad Santa looked like Mother Teresa next to this guy.
The move jumps around from one pointless poorly shot scene full of characters one doesn't care about to the next feeling rushed and without focus.

You really just don't care about what happens next.
When the critics claim the movie have substance that the audience could not spot and decipher and call us stupid for being oblivious, I say the true design of Lost in Translation is that it is an introvertible proof The Emperor's New Clothes carry a valid allegory that apply to Sofia's vapid, utterly worthless filmflam that, next to Corey Haim's 1989 video diary "Me, Myself & I", might serve as an ideal audio-visual torture device.
I just don't want anyone to waste their money; if, after this, you still feel some strange curiosity to buy and watch this movie, remember that you will never have back the time spent watching this, and will hate yourself for that for the next year at least.
What would you do next?
Every character is in it for like 5 minutes and than disappears out of the story again and the next character get introduced.

At times I get the feeling the main characters don't know if they are going to be filming the next episode.
The suspense builds logically from one step to the next, with an absolute minimum of contrivances.

With the help of a girl who lives next door, Ben uncovers old skeletons in the family closet and a tragedy that occurred many years before.
It amazes me that she even bothers with films like "The girl next door".
That is the next layer of "Across 110th Street" that could be used in any film studies class across the nation.
Overall, "Across 110th Street" was a violent, loud, and turbulent film that was laced with clichÃ©s that were forgotten by the next scene.
Thierry and Charlotte are funny the next day discussing the tape.
Its biggest coup Â that is, apart from the rigorous yet effective compression of the source material (thanks to extremely fast transitions between one scene and the next, characterized by admirably mobile tracking shots!

She starts to piece together the puzzle and must stop him before he claims her life next.
While the camera shots in this movie are often not clearly focused and the editing is poor with harsh cuts that should have been faded to black or into the next scene, this movie isn't half bad.

What will Jack do next?
Alternating one with the other, we experience what they do upon each meeting or journey, hearing their thoughts as they anticipate the next rendezvous, knowing how the one feels before seeing what the other felt at the exact same time.
I love this movie & often wish that my family could live where they did.I first found out about it when I was little from my mother- it's a good mother/daughter movie.I don't own it yet but will very soon so my daughter can watch it.I hope that she loves it just like I did (still do) The are some sad parts in the movie where it shows how Collins mother died & the garden was never open again.It took a little girl with a kind heart to win over her uncle-in-law in order for him to let her have the key.To me this movie says that anything is possible with love & care & that children are brilliant,not only do they learn from us but we can learn from them as well.I think that the parents that are too busy & have way too many things going on in their daily schedule need to take time out to watch this movie & do something with their children.There is a plot of land next to us here where we live that I want to make a garden out of & I want my kids to help with it (: thanks mom & to all mothers everywhere (patting myself on the back- I'm a mom too (:
As you play the game, as you're walking around, you're terrified as to what might happen next.

I had a lot of fun watching Resident Evil, it was very high action and kept my heart racing on what would happen next.
It did an excellent job establishing characters without too much unnecessary background, developing them just enough to make you want to know what they'll do next, to make you care before the sudden and gruesome happens to them.

Now when the next couple of scenes contain about 25 instances of people being hit with things, and three fart/poop/gross-out jokes, any substance the film actually had is washed away - or shall i say clubbed to death by blunt objects.
I don't remember, I was to busy watching and waiting for the next joke.
Meanwhile, the teenager son Robbie and the young daughter Rachel of his next door neighbor and crane operator Tom Ryan (Craig Bierko) are spending the weekend with their loser father.

But, the "man" can kill mammals and send them in to get the blood he needs to "advance to the next stage."
Then there's the fact that this is a movie from a time long forgotten - a time when smoking cigarettes on screen was accepted and normal, when the PC brigade wasn't around and you could light up whenever and wherever you wanted - these guys go through pack after pack - in the car, in the office (god forbid..), and Boyle even lights up while his colleagues are having lunch right next to him.
Mimi and Oscar's relationship encompasses most things; from BDSM to urolagnia and right the on way through to the notion of knowing your once female lover, now full time carer, is in the room next door with another man; keeping you in a sort of cuckolded state of helplessness.
I wish it would be seen in every cineplex in America, but the next best thing is to see it on DVD or television in its shorter form.

This was Powell's next to last feature picture as an actor, it should have been the one he went out on.
What happens next is beyond Annie's wildest imagination; their goal to raise money for charity is smashingly successful, and the calendar girls become overnight celebrities in their modest little community.
Not only did it win awards,it won over the Audience so props to all involved I can't wait till the next one comes out.
Not only did it win awards,it won over the Audience so props to all involved I can't wait till the next one comes out.
I had thought they had forgotten him for a long time, then they finally came back to him, and he was next to death.
The next thing - she was drawing the Earth on her wall - need I say any more?
Coming after a couple of stories , one of which is considered to be a modern classic ( The Impossible Planat/Satan Pit ) while the other ( Love And Monsters ) is one of the most radical pieces of television produced Fear Her was never going to be all that well received , but its Luke warm reception is to do mainly with the fact it's a very dull predictable story   If you watched the " next time " trailer from the previous week then you'll know in advance as to what the story is about and therefore there's no suspense .
don't knock the guy who comes up with some crazy invention.... his next attempt at the same gadget could sell a million !
And then there's Jennifer "Eternally Easy on the Eyes" Connelly who, yes, has her usual charms (both of them), but who manages to bring a degree of wit, grace and sincerity to the "girl next door anyone would die to get with" role that's rarely been matched since.
I have to start my review with some kind of reasoning for why I have given this movie an 8 out of 10, as i will proceed to give it a raving review... Its the directors first film, and as his first film I have reserved the 9 out of 10 and 10 out of 10 for his next two films (pending he keeps putting the same amount of passion into his future work).
Rather than risk going so far into how impressed I was with Thomas Ikimi's "FIRST" cinematic effort and end up looking like a groupie ... all I will say is I am counting the days until the release of his next feature and with Ikimi's discovery of a rare diamond in Joe Holt, the wait for his next offering also seems endless.
Filmed at three locations, Gallup-New Mexico, Red Rock State Park-New Mexico & Kanab-Utah, Carl Guthrie's photography really utilises these locations, one moment it be a beautiful sprawling landscape, the next the rocks are enveloping the characters to portray the tension and confinement of their emotional and physical journey.
One second the people are alive..the next...their head is on the ground.
next thing you know they're in the woods "fighting" or in other words grabbing each other and hurling their bodies around.
I think, because of the low budget, it had a reality factor of 'too close to home for comfort' as if it was all taking place in the next town and pretty soon all these creeps were gonna come over to my town and mess with me.
I also had to laugh when Naish describes the obvious lunatic Chaney as harmless to some guests, then sends him to chop people up in the next scene...but we knew that.
When one-half of the famous movie dancers, the Tobius', announces she's pregnant, the studio is talked into launching a Scarlett O'Hara type search in colleges to find a partner for the couple's next film.

Alex next finds himself in prison with the sentence of 14 years for his murder that night.

this is a great movie and i think it will be considered a classic the thing that pisses me off is that Marris isn't in the Hall of fame most people who don't know much about him think he only had that one good year when he broke the record but he was the MVP of the 1960 season and he played well throughout most of his career he should be in the hall of fame without a doubt there's four people that aren't in the hall of fame that should be shoeless Joe Jackson isn't there because he threw the world series even though he played excellent and Pete rose should be in there to it doesn't matter what he did off the field its what he did on the field that counts Marris is the next person not in i already explained why but the most shocking person not to be in the hall of fame is frank Robinson what the hell happened there
Otherwise, the next special may be, "It's the Last Hoorah, Charlie Brown."
This first episode of "Monk" and the next ("Part 2," originally released together with it as "MONK: The Premiere Movie") are essentially everything that television should be.
I never knew the film was a comedy before I began watching, so you can imagine my surprise when one innocent character after the next stumbled upon a brutally murdered corpse and react in the very least expected ways possible.
I am now totally obsessed with this Mexican American director Alfredo de Villa and look forward to this next movie.
Clearly one of the best current directors with influences of Antonioni and Tarkovsky, he curiously reflected that his next film would be happier, curious his sure touch for the darker reaches in everyday life.
I was 19, in the Marines, stationed in Hawaii, and liked... no, make that LOVED this movie so much, I saw it 12 out of the next 13 nights.
one that keeps you watching purely to see what the hell they'll come up with next.
next time when you see a movie about bees and humans.

This, like I said made me angry but this next part took the freakin cake; the plane gets struck by lightning and everything fries.
After being a huge fan of Neil Burger's first big movie, The Illusionist, I was very intrigued in seeing his next film.
With the movies twists, and turns it will leave you glued to your seat waiting to see what happens next.
I can't wait to see what he comes up with next.
A movie that makes you smile, and even laugh for a moment, and makes you choke with tears the next,a mesmerizing movie that shows how, even some Israelis, who choose to see the reality as it should be seen, turn against their government for its brutal and discriminating acts against the Palestinians.
The plot here is muddled, and it follows a young woman who, after witnessing the murderer leave the scene of the crime, finds herself as his next target.
A series of brutal and bizarre killings takes place.When Mara witnesses one of the murders the black-gloved killer starts terrorizing her-she turns to her boyfriend Lukas for assistance.But will he be able to uncover the culprit before his girlfriend becomes the next victim?Antonio Bido's "Watch Me When I Kill" is an enjoyable giallo,albeit heavily influenced by Dario Argento's works,especially "Deep Red".The film is an above-average effort filled with enough suspense and shocks to satisfy fans of Italian horror.Surprisingly effective murder scenes are another reason to check this film out-in particular,the muder of Fernando Cerulli in a bathtub,set to opera music,would make Dario Argento proud.The performances are pretty good and it's nice to see Fulci's veteran Paolo Malco in one of the main roles.8 out of 10.
It takes about 30 minutes sometimes to roam the landscape to find the next Colossi.
Better luck next time.
This movie is about the real people of America - the stars could be our next door neighbors as well as the icons we admire.
If I was still trapped in CT I would consider going to the next tournament.
The adorable canine loves doughnuts as much as the next man in blue but truly is talented at sniffing out trouble.
Poe's story had already been turned into a film by Roger Corman as he directed Pit and the Pendulum (1961) staring Vincent Price although this 90's version has next to nothing in common with Corman's flick other than the title & even that was changed to The Inquisitor for it's US DVD release, the script by Dennis Paoli is pretty good here, the character's are better than one would expect with Henriksen obviously having fun playing the part of Torquemada as he's a character with some depth even if not a particularly likable one although I'm not sure about that silly hair-cut.
Into this sick micro-society comes a rather homely man, Louisan--the next unsuspecting victim.
At least as good as Caro and Jeunet's next film, which is often put above this, the City of Lost Children.
Highly atmospheric, the french duo takes the cinematography (by Darius Khondji) to the next level mixing techniques and showing a whole range of influences that go from German Expressionism to 40s modernism, resulting in one of the most beautiful looking movies ever done.
It's the way that the yellow-ish buildings look next to the dark skyline, and the way that the film uses darkness and smoke to make it more horrifying (see roof sequence towards the end) that gives this film the finishing touch to it's already distinct style.
They're both great movies, but it's ridiculous to stand them next to each other because they're so vastly different.
As a teenager scoring one success after another she was given pep pills to make her work harder and longer followed by sleeping pills so she could get some rest before the cycle repeated itself the next day.
All I would like to say is better job next time.
Maybe I'm being a touch harsh on it as I've seen far worse but I'm fed up of wasting my time with crap like this, having said that I'll still be stupid enough to be the first in the queue when the next low budget piece of crap gets released.
One minute, you're up, the next, you're down.
Brother and sister as parents of the next line of twinsÂ and, all suffering the same family curse.
for the next decade until I discovered in late 2001 that Carousel Film and Video (as they now call themselves) still owned the video rights to "J.T."
Of course, I'd tune in the next week and get to watch it.
For anyone who may come across this one, if you haven't seen this film, rent it, buy it or see it the next time it's listed in a directory.
I wonder what writer/director Rian Johnson will be up to next.
We can't wait to see what this wunderkind does with his next project, Looper, which "is set in a present-day world in which a group of hit men are sent their victims from the future."
All that said, I'll still be lining up for tickets ASAP when Johnson's next film comes out.
Most of the movies coming out over the next few months are simply product, attractive, eye catching, and ultimately little more than 90 minute advertisements for the sequel.
He delivers characters we want to watch and situations that unfold with diverting, entertaining results, even as one might never fully believe what will happen next.
I'd put her on an early shortlist for Best Supporting Actress at next year's Oscars.
into the first reel this reviewer craved the blissful relief of an untimely death before the next zoom-in close-up of Peter Spelson's heavily lidded psychotronic stare!
the actors aren't up to much, most look like they don't know what to do next, and are reading off the sheet.. totally unbelievable.
This movie can only be an excellent "berceuse", something to go to sleep in 10-15 minutes if you don't mind having to start over the next day to this where it goes.
In the next year the Blues Brothers came out and featured a car chase in the exact same place.
Montage between the two is brilliant; every scene makes you longing for the next one.
What is strange about this movie is that we have big stars like Cybill Shepherd, Richard Dreyfuss and Jimmy Smits appear as extras in the movie, next to lesser known actors who are the leads.
In fact, if you look up the word in the dictionary, you will see his face next to it.
The story had the viewers demanding for what came next and on the edge through out the entire movie.
This did not exist, and let the viewer instantly connect with the characters as if they were sitting next to them.
You always wonder what might happen next despite the fact that writer-director Silvio Amadio lays the cards out on the table midway through regarding how Dorothy was killed, detailed how it was accomplished, letting us know that Nancy might be in grave danger because the murder was so well orchestrated.
I found myself rooting for the two young heroes immediately and readily drawn into their adventure and wondering all the time what was going to happen next as in any good story and at the credits, I wanted to stand up and cheer...great work guys...this one is a WINNER!
I wish you great success and can't wait to see your next film!
The next day, Shep and Charlie must work together to find a traceable freeze gun, but they must soon deal with the bounty hunters.
But I enjoyed it all the way through, and ended up renting it time and again, until finally a kindly old gentleman working a video rental store next to my dad's restaurant gave the VHS tape to me.
The inspired casting of Tab Hunter in the warped lead qualifies as the film's masterstroke; Hunter's blandly handsome boy next door persona makes for the perfect front for the severe dementia bubbling just underneath the surface.
I actually watched Black Dawn the next day and while Seagal was doubled for all his fight scenes the movie was much funner to watch than MFJ.
Beginning in the 1960s, many of them in Roger Corman's raffish moviemaking academy, a number of directors who would later achieve prominence made their bones in horror schlock and soft-core porn; Hanson would wait until the '80s to do his next film.
It looked like it would cave in after the next storm.
I hope Seagal takes note in his next few films, but thankfully I see there will be little chance they are as bad as this.
The sudden death of family caretaker Joseph (Don S. Davis) prompts a phone call from John to Christy informing her that the funeral services will be held next Saturday.
(I need to remember that one next time I'm in a bar.)
The much publicised erotic element only really rears its head for a torrid 25 minute period in the middle of the film when Anais goes from one lover to the next.
After this role, however, I have no doubt that if she keeps her head on straight, she's the next great actress of her generation.
I am looking forward to Brougher's next film - hopefully she will get a wider release this time.
Young stockbroker bets with rich young banker he can make more money over the next 90 days.
They've already killed CBS FM what's next?!
You can never tell what is going to happen next whether he be riding a camel or the whole, triangle shirt-waist factory inspired, building fire minus the locked doors and the slaves actually running UPSTAIRS.
I don't know if you should buy it at first sight, but I do suggest you rent it, or watch it next time it comes on TV.
There are like 5 orcs in the whole movie, and they get killed and yet come back for the next scene.
i picked up a copy of this movie at an old Italian owned video store, completely unaware of what i was about to witness for the next 90 minutes or so.
Lubitsch's suggestive fade-outs and closing doors will appear as antiquated as 19th-century daguerreotypes next to the modern standard of painstakingly photographed aerobic coitus.
One of the most enjoyable movies of the year, or next year, or the entire decade I expect, is the hilarious and endlessly quotable Design for Living, directed by Ernst Lubitsch from a play by Noel Coward, starring Gary Cooper, Fredric March, and the always fantastic Miriam Hopkins.
All in all, this is an entertaining western which I would not mind, if ever on DVD, purchasing and placing right next to my cherished copy of the original.
As a man who usually keeps his emotions to himself, the ending was tough going while on a plane full of people I would be seeing for the next 15 or so hours!
So the next time I see something out of the ordinary while out in the open; I'm going to explore it, observe it and embrace it.
He has a great scene when he wakes up in the village only to see his son, Tomme, sleeping peaceful and embracing his girl, both practically nude in the next hammock.
Tomme's father spends the next 10 years trying to find him.
I just wished the director would shoot on 16mm or digital video next time.
The next thing you notice is the toytown quality of the sets, reminiscent of the castle in Les Visiteurs du Soir, the whole town, interior and exterior looks as though it never needs sweeping or cleaning.
Both of these fine actors left the screen in the next couple of years.
It's one of those movies where you know exactly what is going to happen next, with a lot of "secondary scenes" (by this I mean scenes that don't add up to the storyline, they're aim is to get you the most bored as possible), and did I forget to mention, it features some very, and I mean VERY lame actors.
You can be certain Mr. Eisner won't take credit for this one, even if he did have anything to do with greenlighting it, in his next pseudo-biography of egomaniacal lies.
I've never been on the Disney ride, but the movie has made me very curious about it, and will probably make a trip to Disney next year.
It's chilling to read the next title, "At the Shop the New Foreman Weeds Out the Old Hands," and then to watch while a cold-hearted gent with a bushy black mustache does precisely that: he struts about the carpentry shop, singles out each elderly employee, fires him, and puts a younger man in his place.
The next they're defending their fortress from the massed ranks of French infantry, engaging in bloody hand to hand combat as the fires of battlefield immolation roar around them.
series of 1969,I felt the next best animated Scooby Doo shows were the ones made between 1976 and 1978.
Up next, disaster called Scrappy Doo!!
The next day Paula says they should go to the police & confess, an idea that Marcos is not keen on saying that the police will never believe them because he is poor & cannot afford an expensive lawyer.
The wide, open landscapes of yet to be developed land and the minimal score add amazing scope to the loneliness Marcos (Vicente Parra) feels, and mirrors the loneliness of his newfound friend that lives in the high-rise literally next door to his little house.
The story focuses on the two workers Dante Hicks (O'Halloran) who works at the convienate store next to the movie rental store with Randal Graves (Anderson).
So now he has to serve a bunch of rather annoying or excessively weird people, with occasional help from his friend Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson), who "works" in the video store next to Quick Stop.
His friend Randal (Jeff Anderson) works next door at a video store, but sporadically closes it to hang out at the Quick Stop.
Mike was cool, there was enough plot to see you through to the next starlet and there were some genuinely funny moments.
The next best thing is the Harper's Weekly wood cuts of the Civil War that appear behind the opening credits.
Meanwhile the next morning Susan regains consciousness & also heads for the Gothic looking castle.
A doctor suffers a minor car accident, then, strangely enough, a young lady has a car accident right next to him.
This next bit contains spoilers.
In my opinion, she's the next Julia Roberts.
The film is worthy of smiles and laughs throughout, with an especially funny moment which rippled through the audience in laughter for many moments into the next scene.
I call the next scene the forging scene.
Other than a cute girl (Sarah Roemer) who just moved in next door, the teen notices a man (David Morse) who acts rather suspiciously, and might be a serial killer.
You see a kid whose gone through a lot of emotional drama that shows hes real held back from his mom and then totally trying to make the best of what can only be described as a hellish situation ( house arrest ) He scouts his neighborhood and finds a psycho path next door, pure gold.
The plot was so predictable, with villains next door getting away with just about every accusation a young boy could throw at him.
Sees no other than Ned Flanders - the next door neighbor doing suspicious things... murder is in the air...
I was never bored and at times actually wondering what would happen next because I was so caught up.
But he's in luck when a hot young girl moves next door, they quickly develop a peeping tom type of relationship, they spy on the neighbors, but when they see the neighbor across the street on a date, but the date "never leaves the house" and they want to prove him as a cold hearted murderer, but is he?
WAAAAAY too many shots of the "hot" girl next door doing Yoga, slow-mo swimming, sun bathing, and your teenage angsty stuff.
Serving as great comic relief is Kale's friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) while the new girl next door, Ashley (Sarah Roemer), provides a romantic interest.
As the film went on, the tension got so high that I was literally on the edge of my seat rubbing my hands together because I was so anxious to see what was going to happen next.
I can't wait til the next Jay & Silent Bob flick...
Of course the running gags and themes that present themselves from one movie to the next make this a real gem.
Congratulations to the Ubin Twinz - can't wait to see what they churn out next.
My suggestion to the producers....try making a documentary about something worth watching next time and hire a different editor and sound person while you are at it.
We don't see this reality for the next week or so of his life.
The Hollowood remake is set for release next year - you know how they don't like those foreign language films - and expect it to lack any of the honesty and soul of the original.
I had no idea what was going to happen next and the revelations both visually and in the plot twists are astonishing.
In this one, the pair have been living in a cheese factory and, having eaten enough cheese for the next two thousand years, decide to end it all, by leaping into the mouth of Claude Cat, their dupe in the Oscar-winning MOUSE WRECKERS.
Brings in his office environment, confusion do people really know him there?, then the clown jacket where he imagines his wife picked it up for him, running off home to get the next flight hong kong to free himself from all the dilemma in his life >> well thats his vacation, thats how he imagined his vacation to have kicked off, freedom from his confused and stressed life.
As for Joan Crawford, she wouldn't have said what she supposedly said about her performance in Rain knowing in the next generation there would be a musical version with a dubbed Rita Hayworth singing with the island kids.
Lighting is used extremely effectively, making the viewer wonder what is coming next, or perhaps what might be being missed that might be essential.
For the next 30 minutes, the film revolves around how the children survive on their own, and how they support each other (one of these methods being 'mothertime', where they have sÃ©ances in the garden as they try to contact their dead mother).
But things get even stranger as Marc is to have lunch with Agnes at his parents the next day, & his father has called to remind him, only to have Agnes tell him that his father's been dead for some time.
Dumbfounded, Marc has a troubled sleep but goes to work the next morning, convinced that Agnes and their so-called friends are out to get him, for some unknown reason.
The next (real) scene, we see Marc, unshaven with many weeks growth, wolfing down noodles at a local restaurant.
The next morning, fortuitously, Agnes suggests he change his image, more or less in keeping with his prior dream, and so he does.
Pay a bit more attention next time.
Saw this in the theater when I was young and went back the very next day to see it again.
The next time you're at the video store looking for some light, funny fare, check this one out.
Quaid presumably lives in an old trailer waiting for the next National Lampoon "Vacation" movie -- but he brings it off brilliantly.
Would put it right next to my copy of "One Touch of Venus".
Movies like this did him in (though he would bounce back nicely the next year in "Hooper" with Burt Reynolds).
One shot will be all blue-ish, the next, coated in ugly green hues, the next two will be fine, but different contrasts of light and dark, then the next one will be a hue of green with really queer "lightning" in the sky.
If you want to see a quality, lighthearted, funny and fantastic 40s-era movie, then check this one out next time it's on TCM.
The former love of his life Andrea Beaumont with her father comes back to Gotham as Bruce Wayne falls for her again, however there's trouble stirring in town as an unknown and mysterious villain called The Phantasm is killing off gangster members one-by-one and The Joker (voiced by Mark Hamil) is next on his list as Batman must find this mystery killer or still be romancing his love.
This is in my humble opinion the second best "Batman" movie next to "Begins" which is number one for me while "Batman (1989)" is number 3, this is one of the best animated movies of all time and truly captures the dark essence of the character from his DC comics roots.
Also, The Joker (Star Wars' Mark Hamill) is trying to find 'Andi' to kill her before he is next.
This was my next step and I must "confess" that I had never watched this movie before, now I'm really glad I watched it.
Luke Skywalker voices the Joker and I still stand by the claim that he should have been cast as the joker in the next Batman movie.
Life holds much promise as Victoria (Ginger Rogers) stands beautifully gowned in her wedding dress next to her chosen mate for the big moment of saying "I do."
The good guys are always totally good, and the bad guys are always totally bad, and no matter how much physical contact they have, they never show even as much as a bruise in the next scene.
Then "Barton Fink", "Raising Arizona", "the Big Lebowski" and "the Man Who Wasn't There" belong in the next class.
and skip your next comedy bad.
So please next time you think NO WAY!, don't be Lazy!
So when the sequel 'Cinderella 2 Dreams come true' came out( and I was a teen ) I was eager to see where the writers would take us next in Cinderellas life,unfortunately I was very disappointed.
I have to admit that before watching this one with my 2 year old daughter, it seemed virtually certain that I'd be doing a great deal of groaning and yawning for the next hour and fifteen minutes.
The script was also very straight forward, carrying the viewer from one situation to the next without having to work out where things were at that point in time.
I could guess what was coming next at almost every part of the movie.
When she's found dead the next morning, he takes it personally.
The next day, the movie opens in a theater near you... and it turns out to be one mediocre dog doo of a flick that's begging seats in the "dollar theatre" a month later, only to be forgotten by year's end.
With no real depth behind the characters and a long, boring and downright confusing story, it all becomes just scenes connected together because people that we're in the last scene are in the next.
He is taken in by Georges Poussin who hopes to make him into the next Mozart.
We travel through 400 years of history and music, to end up in what you might think is the end of the story of the Â«red violinÂ» but in fact, takes you to the next chapter.
I can't wait to see his next movie, if he ever plans to do one, but the challenge to surpass Â«The Red ViolinÂ» is quite big.
If we were to really analyze the morality from each owner to the next, we would find that morality was not really the wave of fortune the violin was riding on(it was stolen from a grave for crying out loud, not to mention almost burned for simply being... a violin).
this movie, like a book of short stories, can hook you once and annoy you the next.
The acting was nothing special, but I will give the writer a bit of credit, sometimes you are left wondering where he will go next, but for the most part the film manages to remain entertaining.
Better luck next time.
The leader is played by Harvey Keitel, who is given next to nothing to do.
Where is he, what's he doing next?
Jason Yee could be the next action star he really has what it takes.
I can't wait to see his next film.
I can't wait to see his next film.
I hope Hollwood producers are paying attention because he is the next action star, just look at him!
He proceeds to his apartment and the officer enters the apartment next door.
Sooner he discovers that the next door apartment is actually empty and he is haunted by the ghosts of the deceased family that was not helped by the neighbors.
There's bloody fingernails on the piano keys and rumbles in the walls and a mean-looking cop next door who enjoys beating his wife and little girl.
It's when Bobby decides he can no longer put up with the abuse he is overhearing next door and reports it to the cops, only to have them respond to a completely vacant apartment next door, that things go from odd to friggin' strange.
Overall, I love Lipstick Jungle and can't wait to see the next episode and read the book.
But once the first episode was over I couldn't wait to watch the next one, and it's continued to be that way!
I love this show and look forward to the next season.
I hope they haven't shut down production and I get to see the next season.
The series definitely has some potential and i look forward to enjoying the next seasons.
Just a warning: the pilot leaves a bit to be desired, so watch the next few episodes before you make a decision.
This gave it an unpredictable pattern on who's going to get it next.
It's filmed in such a way that you start to feel like you're right in the midst of the terror, right next to them, and you can't take your eyes away.
Afterdark Horrorfest are the best B-Movies I've ever seen.It has it's crappers(The Hamiltons, Nightmare Man, Crazy Eights), but they make up for it with wonderful movies like Mulberry Street.This is yet another great movie in the Afterdark Horrorfest 8 Films To Die For series, and I would say probably my 4th favorite out of all of them.It was really well executed for a B-Movie, as are all the Afterdark Horrorfest films, and I couldn't help but be so sucked into the story plot and suspense.It may have been just a little retarded, funny even, and they left some things unexplained, but hey, I was expecting less, and got a lot.Overall, MOST of all the movies in the Afterdark Horrorfest films are great and VERY underrated, and I hope for these movies to be more recognized than what they already are, which is not recognized hardly at all, because they are some really spectacular movies, and I'm looking forward to the next set that comes out.
Mulberry Street was the next stop on my ride through Horrorfest.
His next film, "Happiness" about three sisters and their lives... and how adulthood is even less as mentally unbalanced as junior high school.
Vi, stricken, gets hammered, lights up and... well... let me just put it this way... after having her last story ripped to shreds by the professor, her next story is certainly something of an improvement.
The start of the movie is perfectly fine, we're given a lot of back-story about how Ember came to be, and how a box was passed down from generation of mayor to the next (very well filmed scene).
Being his second film since the short animation that got Gil Kenan his career, and being such a step up from that, I am hugely excited to see what this fledgling director will be coming out with next.
The possibility of the next three movies is very slim and that means you and I are going to have to read the books to find out what will happen.
Better luck next time.
This movie will no doubt become one of those titles that the next generation discovers by chance who will pour upon it the real attention it deserves Âstrangely much like the box in the movie Âhow ironic!
So she jumps in, swims around for about 30 seconds then gets out and just sits there, She heres something in the bush, so she turns of the tape to look around, next thing you know a gun is being pointed straight at her head.. and BANG, her head falls into the pool, and the start credits come up, Not to bad for a beginning, But after the credit the storyline is about a bunch of filmmakers that set out to an island to make a light hearted comedy, But the actors that the producer's have set up aren't really what you would call Great,,, or even Good.
However, in a time of desperation, two citizens Doon Harrow (Harry Treadaway) and Lina Mayfleet (Saoirse Ronan) go on their own quest to try and find an exit from the underground city, which doesn't go down well with gluttonous Mayor Cole (Bill Murray) who just wants his next meal in peace.
Deciding upon a lifespan of 200 years for their city, the key to salvation was locked away in a metal box to be handed down from one mayor to the next until the time was right.
You'll never know what its gonna happened next.
Everyone is secretly calculating another and planning their next move, both in the game and outside the game.
I watched this film when i was about 14 and spent the next decade hunting for it after it became deleted, i recently came across it and watching it now i can appreciate it in its silly 80's glory!
The girl that falls for the dumb jock instead of the guy she SHOULD have fell for, and Noah Taylor is a genius portrayal of the "boy next door."
As the wildcard, we never knew what he was going to do next, and both our characters and our audience were scared of that.
I only hope that the next time someone uses the name of our country in the title of a film or any artistic work, it be with the purpose of honoring it and not as a commercial gimmick.
Worth mentioning as well are the actors and actresses that make the cast of the film, virtually unknown in Colombia, but with a great potential to become Colombia's next generation of exportable talent.
Let It Be started out as a documentary about The Beatles recording material for what was to be their next album.
You come back the next year and, rusty and out of practice, just don't have the same teamwork as you did at the end of the previous year.
I do not recall how this series ends but now I have the complete set of episode to delight along the next days.
All in all, Looker would probably not stand up next to today's movies, but it has a charm about it.
Lenzi doesn't give you time to catch your breath before your off to the next action set-piece.
Similarly, we know next to nothing about the baddies played by Saxon and Sullivan.
The first few are usually policy oriented, the next one or two is about the politics and the number one is a Keith Olbermann written special comment or a puff story on celebrities or something very stupid.
He's one mischievous kid and whatever trouble he doesn't get into here is saved for the next film.
Doris, Gordon, and Billy all appear in the next film along with her parents Leon Ames and Rosemary DeCamp and maid Mary Wickes who always has a sharp word for the goings on.
So far, all attempts to make the extinct Megalodon into the next big monster (a la T-Rex from "Jurassic Park" or Bruce from "Jaws") have failed miserably.
It goes next to Deep blue sea and shark attack 2!
You just never know what is going to happen next and the characters are mostly unpredictable.
The dead painter's daughter was played chockful of feminine intuition by Martha Vickers, next step for her was the cute Big Sleep.
When the front office at RKO Pictures informed producer Val Lewton that Boris Karloff had been procured to appear in his next suspense film, he wasn't entirely pleased.
But ancient animosities were aroused and the entire Peninsula lay waiting for the next international incident, which obligingly took place 10 months later at the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo.
The heights of lunacy are reached in the last third when one ludicrous plot-twist trips over the next.
Metro's answer to the gangster movies made by Warner's is exciting film fare.The film marks the beginning of the Powell-Loy partnership which made legend in their next pairing.Gable's portrayal of a sympathetic gangster is just as good as any of Cagney's at Warner's.Great comic turn by Nat Pendleton as Gable's not too bright henchmen.
Better luck next time.
She, predictably, doesn't quite reciprocate and even demands an apology, and her boyfriend reveals himself to be a flaming eunuch in disguise, so what happens next?
He sits down next to her.
First thing next morning he rises, studies her room, and spends a moment on straightening a nail in her wall.
Now that I'm older I wonder where time went, one day I'm a kid sitting on the living room rug watching Charlie Brown the next day I'm in my room hearing the advertisement on TV for the Charlie Brown Thanksgiving holiday special.
But before wandering off, next fifteen minutes got right to the business of introducing me to more sane and insane characters and their functions in life.
had me mind scrapingly perplexed as to what would unfold next.
The day of the race Dink meets his mother (he or she doesn't realise it), Linda, who has the horse "Blue Boy" next to "Lil' Champ" in the stables.
In The Champ he gets to combine the two, one minute the swaggering pugilist, the next a devoted father.
I felt as though I were sitting next to Monet, watching as he effortlessly splashed brilliant watercolors across his canvas.
The next time I bite into a pastry Madeleine I will recall Andre Morell's defense!
I was surprised to catch pieces of this on cable, laughing so much that I had to look up the schedule to catch the whole movie the next time it was played.
I hope the next time they bring three lovely latinas together on screen, they will support them with a decent plot, well rounded characters and make them perform their tails off.
I'm really looking forward to his next picture.
I am on the constant lookout for her next concert.
Short, blandly handsome Jason Carns, a seemingly ordinary and unassuming nice guy next door type gone horribly bug crazy wrong, gives a frightfully plausible performance as lowly security guard Eddie, who gets his twisted deviant carnal kicks by pretending to be a Los Angeles police officer who joyfully browbeats, manhandles and elicits unpaid sexual favors from street hookers while wearing a fuzzball uniform and driving around in a phony cop car.
The hotel is next door to a monastery that served as a torture chamber during the Inquisition.
The lack of communication - even if we live in rabbit cages - one next to each other - but not really together?
The only heebie jeebies I got from this was seeing that they have a sequal planned for next year.
As a scene ends it always seems to tell what is going to happen in the next and this is rather annoying as well.
Also if my mother-in-law had treated me like that when I was in labour and then tried to kill me with a lethal injection I would not have stayed in the house even for a dramatic denouement the next morning.
I'd catch it the next time it's on the tube.
Expect to find LIGHTHOUSE in years to come referred to as an overlooked classic and expect it's Director to be on the forefront of the next wave of horror.
Not hooked but enough interest to keep me going...same with the next one...and then when I finally got to the part when the little Jang Geum became orphaned and out-shone the other little girls in the palace in her determination and diligence, that is when I really got hooked, which brings me to a suggestion ... watch the first 3 episodes in their entirety.
When Emil Bruckner arrives, he immediately makes a blunder when he describes his plane trip seated next to a fat Jew.
Well...i rented this movie only because i needed a second movie to rent at the video store and this one promised a dollar back if returned the next day...now i know why..they knew no one would want to keep this poor excuse of a movie in their house for more then a day.
It kept you constantly leaning forward in anticipation of what would happen next.
On his next trip to the future, he discovers a world in chaos where social order has broken down.
