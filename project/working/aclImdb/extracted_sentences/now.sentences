and Grammy shouldnt Doris Day be in the Hall of Fame by now ?
Etting knows she owes him - now he has to be big enough to let her pay it back.
Perhaps I just hadn't seen her at her best until now, but after witnessing her show-stopping Zigfield Follies number here, I'm a believer.
He's an uneducated kid from the slums who made it in the rackets, but feels terribly inferior around all the show business creative types that his wife now by necessity has to associate with, where ironically due to his drive has pushed her there.
The only movie i can think of right now, that is worse than Zombiegeddon is probably Zombiez.
But in fact this story of living dead could have been much better filmed in the hands of more talented director than Robert Zemeckis of whom I can't remember having seen any good movie till now.
It's now obvious that she, too, has used the formula!
Also, the use of film manipulation and special effects is excellent for its' time in this movie, and is still easily appreciated even now.
When Medeline becomes a out of work actress and her husband-Ernest is now touching up and putting make-up on Dead People.
Seven years later, Helen is now an obese, depressed woman, and is arrested and placed in a mental institution.
Ernest, now an alcoholic and miserable in his marriage, has been reduced to working as a high-end mortician.
- but when she sees that Helen is now a svelte redhead, she balks - and their reunion is one of dripping, beautiful venom, the highlight of the entire movie.
I must have seen this film about 15 or so times now.
Also Rompetechos is now a "facha" (Francisco Franco-supporting nostalgic), which in the comic books never was.
I saw this show on local TV and am now going to purchase a DVD copy as its an excellent library addition.
I liked it when I first saw it in '79 and I like it more now.
Well, I don't think so now!
It was as if I had heard about this place and these people but now I was transported in time.
As a portrait of life in New France (now Eastern Canada) in the early to mid-1600s--when Samuel de Champlain was the leader of the tiny French outpost of Quebec--this film is virtually flawless.
Set during the First World War in 1917, this version of Edmund Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson) is now a Captain of the British Army on the Western Front.
The tone is radically altered, Blackadder's sarcasm remains but it's not funny now, well at least not in the same way as it was before.
It is at this point that Blackadder Goes Forth becomes more than just a comedy and completes it's brilliance as it now touches the heart as well as the head.
The movie is on TMC right now, chugging away in all earnestness, well-meaning and clueless as how to show really real reality.
Therefore I now look to Asia for my horror because thankfully they still understand that while the genre must progress, it must also still scare.
At thirty seven she brings her family back to her childhood home in hopes to turn the now abandoned house into an orphanage for the handicapped.
And now, "The Orphanage," from acclaimed Spanish producer Guillermo del Toro, creeps its way into their ranks, while still being a genre-defying film.
I now ask what it is that all three of these films have in common?
I can't think of a better nation making movies right now; the Spanish are doing everything right and this film just adds to bolstering that argument.
We are led into this world, discovering the relationships between our lead roles and the vague past of the orphanage that once housed our heroine and now is about to become her home for special needs children.
The orphans now haunting the establishment are only trying to play a game.
IF Someone's p***ing you OFF right now in your LIFE, this movie is your THERAPY!!!
Aside from the hilarious action that takes place, the film has a nice underlying tone of the gang comically bonding with the now supportive gas station employees as they teach each other to stand up for what they believe in and cooperate to take down what soon will be slew of opposing gangs waging war on the gas station!
Now, she has the upper hand for HE is dependent upon her and she gets to use his words against him, repeating some of the same lines that he gave her, only now there is an ironic twist in them.
I am 51 now and have never owned a Harley, but over the years, more than a few have commented on my even temperament and controlled response to volatile situations.
At least, that's how I describe it now.
I used to watch this show as a young teenager every week and now I'm watching it every week as a young adult and I'm still loving it.
I've watched it when i was a child and now as a young adult again.
I'm so glad that they are now playing the series back on Belgium television.
I thought it was the best series around i live about 3quarters of an our away i use to go with mum after School every 2nd Wednesday and meet quite a lot even the 2 old cogers :) one who lived in Minyip nice chap :) herb Krause very nice to have a chat with the old Emma Garage is now a Internet Cafe , the 2 milk bars have now closed down.

They are showing re-runs here in Sweden now again, and I can't be happier!
And seeing Blondell and Lyon with the leading lady are such a treat that I'm now curious if they did anything else together.
Granted Data from TNG is great but it eventually gets old but Voyager's doctor -- now that's creativity!
Not only is Picardo such a great actor but the premise setting for his expansive, self growth, as a doctor, self realization now that is science fiction at its best!
Not many people will want to watch Marie struggle to accept the fact that her husband is 'gone' and that she is now alone.
After seeing Swimming Pool (my first Ozonic experience - his first American-language movie), all of his previous films and now this one, I've come to the conclusion that Francois Ozon is a truly brilliant filmmaker, someone who is capable of foraging deep, DEEP under the surface of things - as only a Scorpio can - to convey what is nearly non-conveyable in films: psychological state and motivation.
If you are a fan of rats (or LAWYERS who are the next best thing, hahaha, OK I'm shutting up now), I would highly recommend watching Of Unknown Origin.
Forget the "rat pack" it's the XR4-TI Crew's time now!
Also in pre-Abu Ghraib world people could be happy at the realism of the level of abuse that both parties experience, but we now know that a lot worse can and does happen.
The imagery has now become an instant classic in similar veins that did for the Alien creature.
He is always in top physical condition and this along with his smoothness, is ideal for his role as the ex - ops boy who becomes a collar and tie agent - a job that requires different values and he now uses the men he used slog in the trenches with.
This is in fact a ruse, as Dillon, Dutch's former team member who now works for the CIA, actually wants Dutch and his team to go in and destroy a guerilla terrorist camp who have vital government information.
I still can't believe my eyes when I see the camouflage effects; it blows me away that even now in 2003 it could sit alongside the FX seen in TODAY'S films with no shame.
The first few episodes it was a little slow (and I mean little) but it started to pick up speed and it snowballed and its just each breath-taking episode after each other now.
Buffy is gone,Angel, Dead like Me, and Charmed, now this too!!!
I now they all are about demons and chosen ones but I would gladly watch Hex over and over than watch a marathon of Charmed or Buffy.
I would still like to now if Ella finally gets her revenge and her and Leon finally get to have a normal relationship.
Lets get that out of the way right now.
Tommy has lost his girl, lost his job, and now doesn't really know what to do.
Other cast include a younger and thinner Anthony Lapaglia of Without A Trace fame, Mark Boone Jr. who now appears in the FX series, Sons of Anarchy, and a special appearance by Samuel L. Jackson.
I said it years ago and I'll say it again now, "F*ck you, coach!"
Written , directed and starring Steve Buscemi it feels like one of those indie projects actors come up with now and again to increase their cred with major Hollywood studios and I`m guessing Buscemi ploughed much of his own money into the project so maybe I shouldn`t be too critical   !!!!
Haunting, powerful, extremely well directed and acted, a real sleeper that should have been nominated for awards seeing the crap that mostly is nominated now days.
Are we now asked to ignore it because Serb civilians have also suffered?
okay first of all what happened to the bad ass Kalina she is now an old whore who is aways calm but in the second game she was evil twist did whatever the *bleep* she wanted she didn't care who she hurt or how it was done she would do anything to save herself.
next is the prince himself he was sissified since the second game now he is stupid and who ever voices him should burn inf *bleeping* hell!
You may still wield two weapons, but now the choice of the other one... sword, mace, dagger or axe... affects the way you do so, in the range, force, etc.
It was of special significance that a Georgian has made such a film because Stalin even until now possesses a status of icon in his home country.
I've already reviewed the original; now, I guess I should say something about this unfortunate, unnecessary sequel.
Now, that you're hooked, now would be a good time to try out the sequel that never was.
I really like the first Basket Case back in (1982) as it was very Gory also really funny and a lot of Fun  And now they are back again and this movie start from by showing what happened at the end of The Basket Case, Soon start from the ending of the first movie  The twins are now main headline on the news , Granny Ruth and her Grandaugter are watching the news and know who these two are, as they rush to the hospital, Duane and Belial break out of the hospital after he killed one of the doctors.
Duane now feel like a normal person, wants to be a normal person and wants to leave but he ends up getting seen by the Reporter and now he has to stay has he as put the rest of the Freaks in danger of being found out.
Buy it now!
My crew and I have over the years, made 12 films shown all over New York State and Connecticut(though now I live in Florida--near Disney World where the real aliens live and work, LOL)
He was roundly criticized for this at the time, but of course now virtually every film is electronically edited.
There are also some harsh scene cuts now in the film that weren't there in the original (including one extra bad one where the music is abruptly cut off).
If the DVD version had been the original release back in 1982, I wouldn't be writing this now.
Sadly, what's left of it can't even do that now.
I have to start by saying that I've had this film on videotape for so long and have seen it so many times that I believe the tape must be damaged by now.
As it is 2010 now, he still sits in prison and will remain there for quite awhile.
Right now it is only available on VHS.
It is such cases that prove that jury justice is maybe good in many cases but there are a few cases where it is the worst possible system, and that is why the death penalty should be gotten rid of, and that's why we should make sure the defendants, now sentenced culprits, have access to all possibilities and opportunities to appeal the decision and to have the best councilors available.
But you can't argue what you CAN see in the film...  Now let me start by saying that I won't go into details about the case (in which novelist Michael Peterson was found guilty of murdering his then wife, Kathleen; the case is now up for appeal, by the way).
I could comment on the dubious role the judge (allow everything, no matter if it's relevant; if it can hurt Peterson, bring it on), some media (ignore what's been said on the trial, ask silly questions and make up a story of your own), the police, medical examiner Radisch and some of Kathleen Peterson's relatives (I understand their grief, but what her sisters did was preposterous) played here, but enough for now.
in my mind this is a fluffy,light movie,but very entertaining and fun to watch.Basically,John Wayne is stranger in town who agrees to help the men get a new road built.the workers have been continually threatened and harassed or worse,by a gang of outlaws who don't want the road built.there is no law to speak of in the town,so the gang has pretty much done whatever they please.until now,that is.this is a pretty standard western movie,which follows the general formula of westerns at that time.however,i think it it is well acted,exciting and fast paced.it's a pretty short movie(less than 90 minutes)but there'a lot jammed into the short running time.if you're in the mood to simply be entertained,you might like this movie.it's not an epic,like many of John Wayne's movies,but so what.i think "rainbow Valley" is a strong 8/10
Just keep in mind that choreography was not then what it is now.
From now on ill going to love my special s0meone Very much and ill never do which can make her mad...
do you wanna come out, and play the game, it's never too late" for like a year now.
I can only imagine what a relic it is now.
of ill-repute who somehow once ended up in a Mexican jail for 2 years and is now on the path to recovery when a couple of bank robbers kidnap and use him for a heist.
Hawn is an attorney and ex-wife of Chase, and she's now married to DA Charles Grodin, who's about to be made Attorney General of the state.
Being thrown from a moving car afterwards, a bruised Chevy makes his way to his ex-wife, Goldie, who, of course, is now married to the county d.a., played wonderfully by Charles Grodin.
The technology is now dated in it but most older films have that problem.
I must say that I now evaluate everything she says and does in a different light.
i first saw 'master of disguise' when it came out on DVD in early 2003. i remember it being funny, but now i see it as being kind of silly.
The child, now seemingly fully grown into a teenager, brings his mom the thumb cocoon, which she lovingly turns into soup, before helping the boy's father to perform some kind of Frankensteinesque experiment.
From there we flash forward years later to find out that one of the guys killed had a wife and son who are now being taken care of by one of the guys on the hunt.
This is just a movie that was made in 1992, and wasn't good enough to show in the states, but now since Jackie is famous, and has done good in his other films, they snuck this one in.
So this pretty much sums up what it is; A failed experiment, hyped with the now very popular Doom 3-engine.
And now, after 10 years in the making "Prey" is finally out.
So now i have a question.
"The Fury" has gotten better with age and can now be viewed as one of DePalma's most satisfying thrillers.
Truth is, it has now been about a year, since I last saw it!
It might not have dated that well and the premise of the film might be considered ludicrous now, but it doesn't stop it from being an exciting adventure.
All I can say is get this now if you like your comedy a little weirder than normal.
went on to have his own talk show called "Man to Man with Dean Leaner" , he plays Moss on the "IT Crowd",played "Dixon Bainbridge" in the Mighty Boosh (Pilot) instead plays now "Saboo".
All of these guys (Julian Barratt) as "Padre" who stars as Howard Moon in "Mighty Boosh" now.
They all play on one another's projects now.
All my horror films now come from Korea or somewhere west of Hawaii.
Good night my Rottweiler is being very passive aggressive with me so now I have to go.
"Duke not the look, we agreed never the look" , and now he is pretending too ignore me.
If, like me, you had not heard of this before coming across it somewhere online then do catch up with it now.
That is, until now.
Channel 4 (and E4) are now for the first time running six episodes from the series, and Garth Marenghi has said he is willing to be personally held accountable to God for the consequences."
Its set up as if the series was made in the 80's and was banned and is now eventually being shown.
This film, which provides equal importance to hens and donkeys as it does to human characters, is as real as they come and yet so removed from the values of Hollywood's screenplays, then and now.
Even now when I watch it on TV, almost everyday I always get up and dance.
I think that Kevin Bacon was the best Actor to play Ren Mcormick in the movie which now I OWN LOL.
Kevin Bacon is responsible to all the "Dirty dancing" in the movie as the leading actor and in a rule that evident gave him his big breakthrough and chance to become the high respected actor that he is right now.
Who stars as the lead Ren MacCormack, a Chicago teen who comes to Beaumont where drugs, alcohol, and dancing have been banned and his now divorced mother trying to find a job.
The soundtrack was excellent -- I still remember some of the tunes now.
my 20 month old son loves footloose he first watched when he was 6 months old and now watches it 2-3 times a day its fantastic and dances every time its on and follows the steps that they perform he knows footloose is about to start as soon as the paramount picture comes up on the screen.
), now he tries to organize a dancing ball for his class and fights against his law.
-"Moment I regret now"- Christopher Penn's dance sequence to "Let's Hear It For The Boy" (although it's a great sequence in the movie) -Kevin Bacon's speech to the council was possibly the greatest speech up until that time in cinema history.
Yes, it's definitely a teen flick, similar to "Dirty Dancing", and aging a little now.
There's adorably cute Tommy, a dark-haired young man, whose first sexual experience was with gorgeous Maria, but then they got married, and he started wanting every woman he saw on the street, and so he and Maria got divorced, and now he's just trying to get a date.
There's Ashley who was seduced quite young by an older man, and now here she is a waitress in a coffee shop, going nowhere fast with her life, and involved with a married man, a dentist named Griffin.
In addition, I would have liked for the cast members to talk a little about what they are doing now.
This is the first silent drammatic film my kids have thoroughly enjoyed, (until now only preferring silent comedic standards by Keaton, Chaplin, and Harold Lloyd.)
I now own a DVD of it.
This movie just really touched me in a way that truly surprised me and is now one of my favorites.
Beautiful Thing, Stonewall, Grief, Priscilla, and now Get Real, one of the best films (gay or not) that I've seen in ages.
The Toxie sequels are kind of on the same lines as this...but back on track now with Toxie 4.
Overall, it wasn't really that bad and who knows now that HIGHLANDER is off the air here......
Right now there's a DVD out with a few of the stories edited into movies, but I wanted to see it in its original form.
For example in Broken Lullaby there was a seen where our heroine was shot at now she was understandably upset and as a result got close to our Mills and Boon man and one thing led to another if you get my drift.
and finally, the truth dawning on her, that it's Rajesh, whom she had wronged unwittingly, but loves him now deeply, the movie is a passÃ©.
You may be surprised of details you never knew about the man, stirred by memories of that season, or finally get some clarity as to how our current political culture arrived to the place it is now.
Sure, he's gotten sort of doughy in recent years, and is now in that awful TV show, but in this movie he is just so damn appealing: the most expressive eyes, those succulent lips.
That's what we wanted then, that's what we hoped for in our leaders then, and that's, oddly what we still want so desperately in this perilous world now.
And it's as appropriate now because we are again locked in a front page war that was so similar.
I can now look forward to seeing him in THE PIANIST...he is awesome.
That's the kind of movie you watch without too high expectations and then it totally blows you away, and you can't turn it off, and at the end you wish you could know what's going to happen now.
As of right now, we have nowhere to go but up!
Just because a film has big stars and is pushed as a "hot new release" in a video store doesn't mean anything (goodness, haven't you learned that by now, folks?).
It used to scare the crap outta me when I was young, and even though its not that scary now I still love it.
He's dead now, but I'm sure Saddam Houssein wouldn't have been impressed.
The watcher is now the watched, distinctions and hierarchies have been abolished.
She has been the host of reality shows(such as American's Next Top Model) made her own show, (the Tyra Show) made a music video, (shake your body) and now acting?
I loved hearing Steven Tyler at the very beginning of the film sitting at his mansion complaining about how his record label calls him to tell him his song that was worth a million dollars is now worth 12 cents...cause every ones downloading!
She cannot forgive her mum for leaving so soon, and now as her father becomes more and more close to one of his female co-workers, she (Lohan) becomes more and more resentful and starts to exclude herself for the things she normally loves the most.
Some might argue that this is his most anointed work, especially given the numbers that most lower income minority households now are single parent households and that translates more than likely to often being led by mothers.
Drew Johnson's heart is up on the screen and it's something we need right now in American Cinema.
The opinions all seem to stay the same, in thinking that music has lost its flare.. but seeing all those big names from back in the 60's, 70's and 80's to now, makes it all worth it.
He had the opportunity to point out how lucky he was, being dropped in the early 80s, and now enjoying a hugely successful career more than 20 years later.
Madame La sends Ariel, now a trusted prisoner, on a mission in a small dinghy.
It turns out that the killer is a shape shifting alien criminal with psychic powers, and that she (the blonde) is sole survivor (the medical officer) of the prison ship from which it has escaped, and which is now crippled and in orbit around the Earth.
Then there's Kareena Kapoor (credited as Karriena Kapoor, in her first pair up with SRK and looking more voluptuous than her skinnier self now) as Kaurwaki, the princess who together with the king-in-waiting Prince Aryan (Sooraj Balaji) and their trusted general Bheema (Rahul Dev) are in hiding because of a plot from someone in the democratic senate out to murder them to take over the throne.
The song sequences of the movies now try not to have spatial and time warps and transportations, and for a film back then, it's still a technique (if you will) used to put the romancing characters in far out locales and situations.
I gave this movie a 9 out of 10 initially, but I now gave it a seven.
The muscial accompaniment had me, at first, shaking my head and thinking "what in the world"...but now I can't imagine the film without it.
The score is compelling and I now own both the DVD and the soundtrack, lol.
Years from now, film historians, critics, and fans will remember this film as a landmark, an unparalleled achievement.
Sad to say, Samuel L.Jackson, as cool as he WAS, is now a hack, collecting a paychecheque for any movie that pays him to utter any variation on a sentence that includes the word 'motherfucker,' and sneer every second line of dialogue in that now clichÃ©d semi-yell he trademarked in Pulp Fiction.I saw this movie for FREE and still regret the two hours of my life I will never get back.
Well, right now I'm upset.
American pilot radioing to a Japanese pilot he's shooting down: "Don't look now, but your Zero's showing."
It had English subtitles and it was in PAL, but since I own several PAL movies, I now own a portable DVD player that plays all regions.
Like his previous film, Park now approaches another social topic (AIDS stigma/prostitution) obliquely, by bringing taking those issues and wrapping them in a well wrought melodrama.
Being an AD&D player for many years now, I was still let down by the rudimentary knowledge the producers seem to have about D&D.
Someone mentioned that he seemed to be a spellcaster now, but I disagree.
It now really is like the game, sure to provide lots of geek moments where viewers try to guess which spell is being cast or what magic item is being used.
Luke Goss tries his best at villainy but Blade II seems a very long time ago now, whilst to under use Miguel Ferrer is tantamount to a treason of cinema.
For me the most important part was the ending of the movie, when the Hungarian national anthem plays (pictures showing to very different places) and I turned to my friend (who is a born Canadian) watching the movie with me: "You can understand now, why we have tears in our eyes when our national-anthem plays... And he understood.
1956 means something for everyone who has at least a little percentage of Hungarian blood in his/her veins... either you were here afterwards and saw the aftermath, either you live here now as young and have the same needs, feelings for freedom, or you're living abroad and were raised on stories about Hungary and how your family had to live, run through the border while they were shooting at them... Or you've heard about the story, you know someone who's Hungarian.
Scarlet Dawn casts Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. as a Russian baron rudely displaced by the forces of the Russian Revolution and now has to fend for himself in a world not terribly hospitable to former aristocrats.
They marry and settle down with Doug now reduced to washing dishes.
To me the twists in this story can't be seen ahead of time, with just hints of foreshadowing, one is now taken along for the ride...
Doesn't mean that he has to be incredibly clever and know all the tricks in the book, now does it?
This single father is struggling with his own demons, persuaded that until now he has screwed up about everything in his life, beginning with his marriage ... he's trying real hard to be a good father, as well as a good cop, that is until this killer comes along and threatens all he's been fighting for to preserve.
Having read this, I now understand why this film re-created the atmosphere so successfully.
Not anymore now, but I fear it is still a step too big for me.
Movie goers maybe a little more jaded now (Me included) but this movie still holds up.
I slapped on headphones and put the DVD in the Macbook and set sail for a better time's stony realms...I read comments saying "If only this movie were made now, it would be so much better, blah blah blah," and that's the biggest crock of horsesh*t I've ever heard.
If it were made now, it would be slicker than slick, void of soul, with the wretched music of our age providing the soundtrack.
Worse, the bad guys now think he's their buyer.
Although the BATF has been the BATFE (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives) for several years, now, it's referenced only as BATF in the film.
A bit dated now and heavy on music but none the less and interesting offering from this classical comedy team.
This will be my fifth, and right now my last, comment comparing two iconic movie comedy teams-Laurel & Hardy and Abbott & Costello-when reviewing either team's pictures.
Okay, now you're wondering why I mentioned Laurel & Hardy at the beginning (other than for comparing Lou's and Stan's boxing scenes).
Unheard of now, of course, but there you go.)
Recommended, an antidote to now and to me always a joy to behold and hear.
A rich young man and his former and now very resentful working class chauffeur are not only in the same company with the comedians, they're vying for a pretty girl who seems attracted to both.
With some film from the Louisiana maneuvers, at the time the largest combat training exercise in Army history, the thin and predictable plot develops to the singing/marching end as the now ready recruits prepare to take their places in line units.
it really should be, especially if you consider he fact that joysticks is now available on DVD.
i now own 3 copies on VHS, with no vcr.
now repeat after me -- "buzz is the cola that we drink, we must have it, come and get it-buzz!"
The three Poirot TV movies starring Ustinov are now available in a three DVD set.
Lyddie is one of my favorite books for quite a while now, so when I found the film on video I decided to get it.
Mardukas tries now and then to get Walsh to open up and tell him about his past.
It turns out that The Duke embezzled a few million dollars from the Mob, and now that Eddie has bailed him out of jail he needs to get his money before the Mob can locate and eliminate the Duke.
He is now a bounty hunter based in Los Angeles.
His boss was the one who bailed him out, and now unless he can get him back in L.A. in the next 5 days, he will forfeit the bond and be placed out of business.
He escaped from his bail bondsman and is now on the run.
I have seen this twice now and still there are elements which I cannot yet explain, but they're not so important as the things this film gives and has are already visible to me.
Films like Dr. Lamb (Danny Lee, 1992), City on Fire (Ringo Lam, 1986) or Red to Kill (Billy Tang, 1993) would not be as powerful as they are now without the usage of haunting colors like blue which bath in fog and mist, usually the light, or should I say darkness, coming through windows.
In fact am going to watch it again now
Badly underrated on release and still unfairly under valued even now, 'Midnight Run' is actually class-act film making, the narrative impeccably engineered and the acting uniformly excellent throughout.
Robert De Niro is Jack Walsh, an ousted former Chicago cop now working as a bounty hunter, who is determined to bring in bail-jumping accountant Jonathan Mardukas (Charles Grodin) who embezzled millions of dollars from nasty Mafioso Jimmy Serrano (Dennis Farina).
DeNiro is (Jack Walsh) a self-righteous ex-cop so unpopular with the Chicago police department, now wanting to make one final 'midnight run' that'll pay big so he can buy a nice coffee shopÂ  He is hired by an hysterical bondsman to find and bring back a former Mob accountant called Jonathan "The Duke" Mardukas (Grodin) who has stolen $15 million from the Los Angeles mob, given the money to the 'unfortunates of the earth.'
Tony Leung's bad cop performance is a class on its own, particularly when he finds out that he's been set up and is now in an untenable situation.
If you need a laugh now, you may want to tune in.
Jann Wenner deserves special mention even though he's probably playing himself considering he was then the editor and now owner of Rolling Stone Magazine.
The Massacre was Griffith's last two-reeler before he moved onto features (which Judith of Bethulia could be counted as), and there are some good examples of how he is now adept at balancing out a longer story.
I caught it on TV a few days ago and I can tell you that I now have an answer for the next person who asks me what's the worst movie I've ever seen.
I have so many old friends who i keep in touch with and miss, yet when we're together it's obvious how different we all are now.
ah now i remember, speed is the main motto of this movie.
A sublime movie within a movie after you see it once and the ending you have to watch it again, the first time you see it tells you a whole new movie now that you know, you watch it again and see it from a different perspective.
Oil need only be above $30 a barrel (they're about double that right now) for shale extraction to work on a large scale.
If you think it will last forever, then you would be in the company of Texans, Russians and Venezuelans that thought their fields would last forever and now sit on barren land.
If you think "Blood for Oil" is just an anti-war slogan, you will be surprised that the major conflicts going on right now - Darfur and Iraq - are about oil, not religion or ethnic issues.
Those whom the documentary "A Crude Awakening" fails to awaken now, to the fast approaching consequences of peaked oil depletion, at a time of unprecedented, and ever growing demand, just may not be awakeable, or won't likely wake up before it's too late.
And these are the reasons why.... And we've ignored all the symptoms...... And all the indicators...... And now with the best will in the world we will probably still have a huge decline, before things can get better, if they ever will......
He is faced with what is truly important to him and must stand his ground now like he never could before.
And I am watching it on Hulu now.
Where the hell are we gonna have lunch now?".
I approached this movie with some skepticism: although France is to be commended for being pretty much the only country in the world right now that still produces films based on the works of Agatha Christie and releases them theatrically (the British Poirot and Miss Marple series are still running, of course, but they're made for TV), "Towards Zero" is directed by Pascal Thomas, whose previous Christie adaptation, the 2005 "By The Pricking Of My Thumbs", was about as dull as a film can possibly be.
Wenham is also good - after appearing in various bit-parts, his major break came in THE BOYS, closely followed by A LITTLE BIT OF SOUL and MOLOKAI: now, of course, he's a household name.
Buy this movie now, you will not regret it, but watch it with a lover because watching it while you're single will make you jones too much for the real thing and that could be depressing.
Despite a slew of good reviews (The French tend to favor a nought to three star system), three maximums, six 'very good', in four weeks in Paris it's only racked up one hundred thousand admissions and last week was down to six thousand in five salles which means that the ruthless French distributors will yank it any minute now.
This guy is responsible for killing a lot of people, but now he quickly grows a heart.
The craziness and drug infested 60's, had now become the distorted 70's, and the vision of America had become perverted.
Their idyllic tryst is short-lived, however, when a gang of bikers burst in on them to treat a wounded member of their partyÂ   Watching SHANKS (which is the puppeteer's surname, by the way) right after Robert Hartford-Davis' CORRUPTION (1968), I couldn't help but be reminded of that film's analogous last segment (right down to the 'dreamy' coda); here, however, Castle has a trump card up his sleeve when a biker steals one of the doctor's electronic devices and fools around with the zombified 'servants' Â the puppeteer, on the other hand, re-animates the scientist who, together with the servants now back in his control, beat up the gang.
The score is great, especially the ending music that I have been listening on my ipod non stop for a few months now :) It's by Ootsuka Ai ( Renai Shashin).
Anyway the discussion leads to another discussion about shop with the basketball coach, who states that shop never helped him, yet it did since he now has a ready made hobby of building giant recipe card boxes.
The special effects, good for the time, are undeniably ropy now Â has anything aged quite as badly as stop motion?
Demanding kids may find the creatures disappointing but now that I am older I can appreciate the fine work that went into realising them.
Harryhausen's puppet work possesses a tangibility that CGI is only just now coming close to emulating.
Living in Buffalo as I do now, there's a bit of humor here that non- Buffalonians can't appreciate.
I picked up cable -- it's as lousy as I remember with the same B-movies you would expect, but with 355 channels now instead of 99.
I despise Goldie Hawn usually, and I found her very funny and touching in this movie as a supportive wife who's sacrificed her career for her children and now hopes to "suck the marrow" out of life.
Makdong's family used to own acres of farmland that are now covered in ugly apartment buildings and now they get by selling eggs to the residents.
Where were they until now?
The acting was so bad, I could have thought I deserve an Academy now.
SIL design and special effects were good for 1995 situations...But now for 2007 movie (I think its all about the budget I don't know) I didn't expect that...It was utterly, awful..I wish I could give "0"...
I didn't realise to now Roger Croamn was involved.
I was lucky enough to catch a free preview screening of this masterpiece of slap stick kung fu genius, and i feel that i should now pay the theater anyways.
It's great that Columbia Pictures/Sony Classics gave this movie a US release with only minor cuts (which, now that I've seen the uncut HK version, should have been left in).
I watched Kung-fu hustle a few times now and bought it on DVD and cant wait for his next movie.
Well now Game came out with Stop Snitchin Stop Lyin the DVD/CD.
Basically, the film chronicles rapper The Game ( I will call him Mr. Watkins from now on, because that's his real name) as he goes on his "world tour" (now that I think about it, I don't think he went anywhere except for Norway and the U.S., but what do I know), and tries to find 50 Cent, so he can try to get him to explain why he ratted out a member of the group (I think that's what it was).
Along the way, Mr. Watkins explains his life story to the audience, gets arrested in North Carolina, meets a veritable group of fans from all over the U.S., and tries to dispel the rumors of his breakup with 50 Cent and the "G-Unit" (to which Mr. Watkins now effectively calls the "G-UNOT").
In many ways, it's groundbreaking...foreshadowing the confluence of horror and comedy that's so popular now (i.e.
I had no interest at all in "Revolutionary Road" but will see it now just to watch his Oscar nominated work.
A memorable yet haunting monologue given by Son is when he blames his cold-hearted mother for the violent rivalry within the family: "You taught us to hate those kidsÂand now look what's happened."
I've been watching David Gordon Green's movies this week and now this one - and they both attended the same school and I suspect there was a lot of Malick-like influence from the professors.
I did have some reservations about Joel Grey who I thought didn't quite have the style (some Broadway shtick crept in now and then, of course.)
Luckily some of the episodes are now on DVD.
Sadly for Macauley he is a victim of his own weaknesses and has no choice other than to be sucked further into a dark plot that has already murdered 50 of his fellow Americans and now seeks the assassination of the greatest General in the Army: Patton.
Patrick McGoohan has now left the building.........
PIE IN THE SKY might best be described as a collage of Brigid Berlin then and now.
He reminds me of rural great-uncles and aunts long dead now, products of the 19th century, whose unpretentious outlook, practical energy, and egalitarian respect for the perspective and dignity of others (including animals) made them universally liked and respected.
After watching "The Mummy" twenty times, Arabia now seems both exotic and happily familiar.
If you ever craved adventure without it resorting to comic book formula, this is your picture - at least for now.
Ever since I was 6 years old (now i'm 15) I loved Viggo Mortensen as an actor, poetry writer, etc..... and i still do love him.
We don't have enough of this kind of movie now.
King Aragorn is now the Lord of the Reins.
It's actually a pretty standard war movie, though the score is exciting and memorable, and the combat scenes, though dated now, are pretty well done, considering this movie was shot in 1953.
because of this i can now thoroughly enjoy seaweed from the Chinese, along with my fond memories.
It may be what we now call noir, but the twinkle in Welles' eye also lingers, suggesting a gris texture.
If they chose it I could have my childhood Madeleine experience, and others would have another Welles film to compare with the finite now available.
Sure they talk their heads off in this movie but they talk about interesting things.I can't right now recall the exact tenor of the conversations but...
Former Broadway writer and now actor, whenever he can find work, Wally Shawn was very apprehensive at the news of his friend Avant-Grade director Andre Gregory inviting him for dinner that evening at a swanky upper East-Side restaurant to talk over old times.
Times of late have not been kind to the two with Wally not finding anyone to accept his plays or give him work as an actor and Andre now going through a serious and almost suicidal depression.
Both Andre and Wally agree that opening up one's mind by letting out what one feels deep down inside of him, or her, and not being afraid or embarrassed in doing it is the bases of man going forward and improving the broken society that we all now, in the 1980's, lives in.
The very interesting film ends on an optimistic note as a now less skeptical and far more optimistic Wally says it, on a cab ride back home as the movie ends, from what he learned from "My Dinner with Andre".
Andre had been a close friend and colleague of Wally's, but now Wally was trying to avoid him.
What is there when people, intellectual theater types, wouldn't go near certain plays years ago that now they go to and say "oh, that was pretty good?"
All he used to think about was art, but now the only thing he thinks about is money.
The viewer is now in a place of choosing the role.
Harold Dunlap now has to find a way to kill Mike, get out of town as soon as the bridge reopens, and stay clear of Jean Maxwell's easy-going virtue.
I understand Ms. Whirry is doing "legit" theater now.
Its adult nature is full nudity and soft focus, with plenty of interesting outfits and people doing what is now seen as swinging.
And I watched it again just right now.
This movie was the first German movie that i had ever seen but i must say, that it was worth the $8.50 i paid for my ticket.I have only studied German for 3 years and i thought that i should try and see at least 1 German movie before i travel to Germany in December.The German wasn't very difficult to understand it was just some of the slang that tripped me up a bit.Some of my friends said that it was definitely the best German movie that they had ever seen.the educators was well worth going to and praise must go to the wonderful actors/actresses especially Daniel bruhl.after seeing this movie i cant wait to see any new movies with Daniel bruhl.this movie is definitely worth seeing and i now know how good German movies really are.
On a side note, I hated the grainy-ness of the film...weirdly I actually watched a film print of the DV transfer, so it might look better on a Digital Projector, & I also had the experience of watching the film burn through, which rarely happens now.
The tycoon defends himself, saying he works 14 hour days: at first he wanted to be able to provide security and good education for his children, now he thinks buying new things makes people happy.
And in the end the 60s generation did change society by making the personal political, even if the communes are now only rose-tinged memories in the back of the minds of fat cats now running conglomerates.
There's an amusing pattern of repeated visuals that change meanings as we see who is now next to whom, who is asleep and who is awake.
The conclusion goes in very surprising twists on bourgeois ethics that leave some questions about who chose to do what to whom when and who is now "a good liar."
The three young people, Jule, Jan, and Peter (Stipe Erceg) feel that now they're "blown" they must kidnap the rich guy and take him to a cabin in the mountains, which of course they immediately do.
Needless to say the slide turned quite successful since he now earns over three million a year.
The story of the mÃ©nage Ã  trois vs. 'free love' also shows that young people then where even more radical than they are now...
The movie is essentially about three friends with seemingly no particular direction in life other than petty political activism now and then.
Anyway..bottom line is they OWE her one now.
There's only one reason why I don't like this movie right now.
IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE has been the top of my list for all time favorite movies, now I AM SAM has moved in right next to it.
And though I have a pounding head right now, I feel like I'm the luckiest dad in the world!  
I saw the film a few days ago but now i am thinking about pla, most girls have nothing to change - they must work in bar because they are the money-maker for her family.
Up-to-date: But now there are different statements about pla.
Some people say, she is alive and now outside of thailand, other say she get killed by people of this business and other one told me she get dead by car-accident.
Without the Top-Down Hierarchy in Thailand essentially Stealing the money via the Banking systems (the same way it is now being done in the US)Thai people would be some of the richest in the world.
Cale, who tells that he is 65, obviously looks different than he did years ago and the film's photography seemed to let you catch that young musician's face from the photos it showed in the aging face of the man as he is now.
The DVD has now been released in the USA, on 13 June, 2006 and has been available as a region two DVD in England, Germany and Australia since late 2005.
In reviewing African-Americans on film in chronological order for Black History Month, we're now at 1936 with the first all-black production for a major studio since Hallelujah!
Why haven't they been caught by now?
And now Kurt Angle.
I've watched this a couple of times now and it gets worse the more you analyse.
Like Freddy used to say, "You are all my children now."
Freddy now seems to be able to interfere with others through the power of dreams, not the just the person that has the dreams, and it comes across as contrived and tacky.
Freddy doesn't really have much breathing room as far as his capabilities go at this point but now (Part 2) he can get into a body and become real!
Freddy Kruger is still very much alive, and not only is he still haunting people's dreams, but now he is trying to get into the real world through the body of Jessie Walsh, a teenage boy who can't figure out if he is really being attacked by Freddy or if he is just flat out losing his mind.
The story is set five years after the events of part one and now the Walsh family have moved into the house from part one and the son of the family Jesse begins to have the nightmares that Nancy from the previous installment was having.
I have been watching this film series for many years now.
He is an old pedophile and after having recaptured some existence through the dream of a girl in the first film, and having thus gotten a couple of boys in his bag through the desire of the girl for these boys, now he moves directly to the main target of his desire : he wants to possess a boy from inside, he is a gay pedophile and Jesse, to defend his sanity in this invasion, will have to react against this gayness that is imposed onto him and kill the boys and men Freddy desires.
So now i tried to post this message and i have to go to ten lines thats weird because the last post i did didn't have ten lines and it posted, so i guess here we go with the tenth line here!
Jackie is good, as a lawyer who is now a convict.
!now very few bolly wood movies have no songs in it!
Any time I get a couple hours, I pull out the now well worn videotape and enjoy myself.
God I am so glad that a DVD is now available.
In order for the events to unfold correctly (from Tidemans viewpoint) he must delay the ship or (speculating now)the ship would go back to December 4th 1941, they would miss the rondeview with the survivors of Sen. Chapman's yacht, and he would miss meeting Miss Scott.
The crux of all these "time travel" stories, whether an inexpensive 22 minutes within a half-hour TV presentation, or an expensive, A-list big-screen offering like this one, presents the same dilemma -- whether to use the ability now at-hand to stifle some occurrence and save lives, etc., but alter the future in so doing?
If he survives now, he might well become the one who would succeed FDR in 1945, having supplanted Harry Truman on the party slate in 1944.
Now a film, (or more usefully), a series, where the ship doesn't go home but instead stops the attack and then deals with a crew that has to come to terms with living in a past where their irrevocably rewriting history... now that would be worth watching.
And few movies have gotten more assistance than the producer, director and cast of "The Final Countdown," now available on DVD,a sci-fi recruiting spectacular that features - on loan at taxpayer expense - the huge carrier U.S.S.
He returns only to find that his son has become the very man he once was, and is now trying to forget.
I'm so stoked to see Terrence Howard finally get the respect and attention he's having now in Hollywood.
Ving Rhames is one of the really under-rated actors out there right now....and Jim Brown is rock solid as the man who finally forces Animal to take a look at himself.
As for Willie's speech, evidence now suggests it was written in the mid-to-late 20th century.
Back at home he now must struggle with carving a out a new life while trying to figure out out how to save his son from ending up like him, or worse.
I can tell you right now that was a very funny film.
We know the rules by now: camera on the shoulder, no added light, no added music, and all properties to be fond on location.
I may now be misleading you, because I didn't at all think this was a bad film and it gripped me from start to finish.
The plot of "we're selling corpses to a dog food factory, and we now have to deal with a handful of dead cheerleaders and their coach, and the witness we clubbed to death" was pretty interesting, though the idea that any valable company could sustain itself on the mortuary of a small country town, or would find that a cheaper worthwhile means of acquiring meat, especially given the obvious legal and moral dilemmas, is absolutely moronic.
But if you like variety, and need to decompress from the above choices now and then, fire up the bong, and open the six pack, and take the dirt road off the mainstream highway to CHEERLEADER AUTOPSY.
I love 'killer car' movies (as people who've read my other reviews will no doubt know by now) so as soon as I read about this film, I just had to see it.
It's like your screen were divided into two parts and you can see what's happening now and what happened beforeÂ   The scenario of the film is pretty nice too.
I think I need a meeting now, just writing about it!
Bring it back, bring it back now!
I find many subjects now are taboo and we are not allowed to discuss them anymore via the media.
I don't fault how things are now or were then.
I find many subjects now are taboo and we are not allowed to discuss them anymore via the media.
I don't fault how things are now or were then.
That rating will most likely go up after a repeat viewing now that I know what to expect.
It's about living absolutely in the present, in the here and now - with the past irrelevant and the future unknown.
I am now convinced Monte Hellman is one of America's most unjustly overlooked filmmakers.
I've seen this on TV and in art cinemas a couple of times and I'm glad to hear I can now get the DVD.
Long out of circulation because of disputes over music rights, Two-Lane Blacktop, now available on DVD, is one of the most original and compelling American movies of the twentieth century.
They are like many of us, skimming along on the surface of life, reminiscing about a goal that once seemed real but is now just out of reach.
Numerous films are shot this way now, including the last two Star Wars films, Once Upon A Time In Mexico and Sin City.
I'm loving the Turner Corporation for creating the "Boomerang" Channel where Quick Draw, Babba-Louie and the Zoro-ish alter ego of Quick Draw, "El-Kabbong" now has a home.
Starts off with a bang, okay, now she's in training, alright, she's an assassin, I'm still with you, oh, now she's having this moral dilemma and she can't decide if she loves her boyfriend or her controller, zzzzz.... Oh well, back to Gamera!
The last stand of Cook and Moore.This seminal work from aussie director and music video legend Mulcahy is a fitting epitaph to the disintegrating comedy partnership of Pete and Dud during the recording sessions for what would later become the ad naeseum album.The film is by and large a torrent of swearing, drunken verbal abuse,and generally obnoxious behaviour documented for public consumption.If you are a christian,a woman or a person of high moral value look away now.
The villains are his old friends in the royal demon slayers, now dead and seeking to cross back over into the world of humans.
have it on now this snowy fri in dec ny-nj area.
i'm actually watching this now on a cold snowy NY NJ morning,afternoon actually now.adiÃ³s.from: GOOD Moms Fight DYFS www.MYSPACE.COM/BRINGCEEJAZZHOME as our advocate group filming movie documentary for HBO review as well as Lifetime.This movie is best and i love it each part even the horrible sad parts as it hits home for me as well as few of my other team of advocates.People like Gracie should be rewarded fully 24-7 love her and her will to SUCCEED continuously.love her.
But, now, I hope to.
I am sure the people who this was based on are now happy but that did not happen over the stroke of the judge's gavel like it did in this film.
Every now an again Lifetime has a movie which is not just a "tearjerker" or "chickflick" but a good story.
Having now wasted a glorious Saturday afternoon (during Calgary Stampede week no less, when I could have been doing something REALLY enjoyable), I feel immensely cheated.
I personally like it, I'm actually watching it now and would recommend it to others.
Instead it turns out that in The Adventures of Don Juan, not only is our hero still swashbuckling up a storm and almost as handsome as ever -- let's not forget, ten years and many events have now elapsed since Robin Hood -- but he is also man enough to laugh at himself along with the audience.
But now and then the film gets a little bogged down with some palace intrigue until the picture's famous set piece - the brilliantly staged sword-fight on the magnificent palace staircase.
The Rabbia or righteous wrath of the title is mostly also left to viewers back then or now, and maybe it didn't get rooted.
I'm in Germany now and have been in Europe for the past 4 years, and I have seen many areas that resemble the terrain in those shots.
And now, Sharon TateÂshe is probably the one reason to watch this film.
If you watch it now keep the remote handy to fast forward and check if you still give a damn about the twist in the end, I know I didn't.
Environmental concerns seem to split people right down the middle, at least here in the U.S. You have those who side with oil companies and feel there is no reason to change, at least not right now.
With first Wendigo and now this, he should be on everyone's cinematic radar- having demonstrated a unique voice, a refusal to do things the way others do them and delivering two absolute masterpieces in a row.
It seems as if director/writer whatshisface hadn't thought the whole thing through and just decided to go ahead with filming because the topic of global warming is so trendy right now.
So go, go now and watch this movie you won't be sorry you did.
And now I can see what others saw in her, for _Gasman_ is the best short film I have ever seen.
By now Flavia knows about Rudolf's sham.
His response is to regard Massey with wonder and amazement at the level of hatred directed at him, now realizing the true extent of the duke's malice.
And now the film is finally released on a double-feature DVD, containing the inferior 1952 scene-for-scene remake and looking and sounding far superior than my scratchy, faded, and fuzzy VHS.
So now I wish that the duel between Colman and Fairbanks was staged almost exactly like the one in the 1952 version.
(They are now available on-line.)
Considering that this is a bit of a silly clichÃ© and that he did THE MASQUERADER several years earlier, this makes THE PRISONER OF ZENDA a bit less original than I'd earlier thought, so I am now scoring the movie with a 9 instead of a 10.
She tries to figure out what is going on, whether she is dreaming, hallucinating, or what, but eventually realizes she is now a Jew in a concentration camp during world war 2 like it or not and she has to let fate play out.
And of what it could and should be, now and then, even today.
It shows what vapid morons the characters are if they couldn't realise they were right for each other all along and now have to drag their innocent spouses and offspring into divorces.
Russell Crowe is one of the best actors working now, and Salma shows that she has a real talent waiting to come out to play.
It is said that Finona's baby brother is now being brought up by the silkies, and there is some reason to think she may be correct!
Not so in France, however, where the film is TOTALLY unknown, a strange state of affairs for a country which is only now trying to atone for its treatment of its Jewish population of 60 years ago, whereas in most other countries, all that is past history.
They had previously lived on the island of Roan Inish, but are now living on the mainland.
It's been a few years now since this was filmed and at the time there were big issues about the United States involvement with the Iraq war and Madonna own thoughts are aired.
The great difference between these two docu's is Madonna herself, and it is really great to see that the same egocentric woman who shocked the world by touching herself on stage has grown to be such a tender and caring person who now uses the "shock-element" to make a difference in the world.
I'm a die hard Madonna fan...I mean literally obsessed so i've seen, heard, and read just about everything shes ever done unfortunately i wasn't able to view this film when it originally premiered because of work but thankfully i caught a late night showing of it last night on VH1 hopefully they plan on showing it again cause i'm definitely looking forward to repeat viewings...now i have to say cause its only natural that people will be comparing this movie to "Truth Or Dare" after all they do share some similarities...like they're both documentaries for a Madonna tour..oops sorry but thats where the similarities end...the person Madonna has become is nothing like the person from TOD not that she was a bad person the but her life has changed so much...she's finally experienced some success with her acting (Evita)..she's finally won Grammys(something that should have happened long ago)...shes discovered a newfound spirituality...which i think has a lot to do with the changes i observed...but most of all and most importantly the biggest difference now is that shes a mother...and wife...2 roles that i know lot of people thought she'd never play...but she is and with great success..after almost 5 years of marriage her and Guy act more like close friends than husband and wife and it is truly beautiful to see her interact with her children...even though we don't get to see too much...but i think what was most touching was seeing how more open she is about her emotions and how much kinder she is and ultimately how much happier she is...i thought this movie was beautifully done hell i think the cinematography is award worthy...and there were a couple scenes when she was talking about peace that made me get a little choked up...particularly at the end when she went to Isreal to give a speech about that very subject...well i have to say the biggest difference between the 2 films is that TOD is for fans only...IGTTYAS is one anyone can enjoy or at least learn something from whether fan or not so check your local listings and when it comes out on DVD don't just buy a copy for yourself but for everyone you know
Amidst the funny visuals and average effects,(what can we expect from the technology in 1970s and movie-making is not that much better as we have it now) the movie wants to impart these things and I believe this what makes this film worth seeing and truly a classic.
But now there is almost no plot at all, just a couple of scenes with heavy bantering (sometimes somewhat funny) and some very unstructured criticism of the McCarthy era.
So now she lives in this big house all by herself (with a strange long-haired cat the girls call Snowball) and when the girls arrive, things at first seem idyllic, but then change as the girls start to meet with odd fates, one by one.
I saw this when i was 10 and i liked the movie.now as a adult i get the more adult humour.the cast list is as big as any all star cast.and most were at the height of there careers.the Stunts are first rate.if this was made now it would be fake cgi,instead of death defying stunt work.
McClure is a has-been race car driver who now teams up with Victor Prinzim and his alter ego, Captain Chaos.They drive around The United States with an ambulance.They're also accompanied by the creepy doctor Nikolas Van Helsing and a blonde they call Beauty.There are many other wackos in that race, including two entertainers dressed as priests.Burt Reynolds is terrific as J.J.The great comedian Dom DeLuise, who passed away this year, is brilliant both as Victor and Captain Chaos.Farrah Fawcett, who sadly lost her struggle with cancer last summer, is a real angel as Pamela Glover, aka Beauty.Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. make a great team as the former race car driver Jamie Blake and the scam artist Morris Fenderbaum.You gotta like Roger Moore as Seymour Goldfarb, who thinks he is Roger Moore.The American football quarterback Terry Bradshaw plays Terry and country singer Mel Tillis is Mel.Bert Convy is the welthy executive who drives on a motorcycle as the other half of the newlyweds.Milton Berle's nephew Warren Berlinger sits in the back wearing a wig.There's a lot of fun stuff in this movie.You laugh every time when you see the appearance of Jack Elam.Roger Moore's James Bond routine is hilarious.You know, the guy from "The Fly Who Bugged Me".The fighting scene is a riot.It's always hilarious when Captain Chaos appears, and this time he shows them hooligans.In the end we see some bloopers.We see Dom DeLuise laughing hysterically.They sure had fun making this movie.
OK so it's dated now, and probably isn't very appealing to todays generation, but this is the original road movie epic and is crammed full of cheesy gags, road rage, fights, great characters, sexy women, sexy cars, and even the odd super hero (Dun Dun Darr - it's Captain Chaos) Oh i forgot to mention the all star cast - Burt Reynolds, Dom Deluise, Farrah Fawcett, Roger Moore, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jnr, Jackie Chan; Oh!
Upon first viewing I laughed out loud, and I still do, so many times I have watched it now!
I truly believe that this series accurately describes what our future looks like - and every time I hear a news item stating that 'scientists have succeeded in linking this and this computer programme directly to the human brain' or 'more and more shops are opening up in Second Life' or whatever, I now constantly think: we're one step closer to Ghost in the Shell.
- Tachikomas - which have been fully restored and are now stated as active members of Public Security Section 9.
In spite of being made in colour, all but one of the episodes exists now in monochrome.
These animations were done out of lack of care or lack of sobriety and now someone wants to painstakingly recreated that?!
I see it was made in 2000, but is more relevant now in this post 9-11 world.
Oh, yeah, Ivan also had a dog that lived in the closet, and he kept kicking the closet door every now and then to shut the beast up.
I loved it then and I love it now.
Morality seems dated now, but story is still lots of fun if you're into the beach.
It's a relaxing movie and you can play it on a loop on your DVD machine (now that it's finally on DVD) and I bet you won't get tired of it.
Back in the 70s i had to have seen all those party movies , for example, The Van and The Gas Pump Girls, and lifeguard was so much of a breath of fresh air along side of those others, i grew up hanging out at redondo beach and Hermosa beach California which is where this movie was filmed, in fact on ricks tower u see the letters HR i believe that stands for Hermosa/redondo and this is also 1 of the beaches that mike love and Dennis Wilson of the beach boys used to hang out at as they lived in near by Hawthorne, I have this movie on VHS not available on DVD yet, and I watch it at least once a month, as i live in new york now and this movie brings back some special memories of my fun days, i even love that song time and tide in this movie, and watching him drive to the beach in his stingray passing all those very familiar businesses, wow, well if your nostalgic then i don't have to explain the feeling.
With everything now gone I saw this film not once but two days in a row.
The ghost of this now murdered friend seeks out her one true friend (locally anyway) Cosmo Topper.
The absolute funnest scene comes at the very end of the movie where the murderer is now a ghost and appolligises for drunking Rochester into the water.
Anyway, it is great because of the newness of John Wayne and his now famous facial antics, which we love, and Harry Carey who was John Wayne's idol in real life.
This movie is now available as an econimical set of John Wayne DVD's that just became available.
For the third and final Topper film, Roland Young is now shed of the Kirbys from the two previous films and he and Billie Burke are now starting on a needed vacation with Eddie Anderson as chauffeur and Patsy Kelly as maid.
Of course that magnet for the other world Cosmo Topper attracts ghosts like moths to a flame and of course the now other worldly Blondell enlists him to find out who murdered her.
Thorne Smith is just now beginning to be taken seriously as a writer.
It's possible there now for someone to attend something like 50 or 60 shows for a month - one every evening and a number of breakfast or matinÃ©e performances - and never see the same one twice, with additional ones available if one wishes to begin a second month.
It will be a befitting award for the great actor now approaching the sunset of his acting years.
Set in the here and now, the film is about skeletons in royal cupboards and illegitimate royalty.
VVD has a goldmine of a storyline here but he fails to mine it: we could have easily seen more of Big B's doubts about dharma, more of Saif Ali Khan's uneasy steps on the path of palace intrigue and treachery, more of Dutt's feeling as a scheduled caste DSP involved in outdated monarchical madness,more of Shroff's agitation as the king's younger brother - the story now is told in such a way that it leaves you guessing too much at what the characters would be going through, so that at the climax you recognize: this would have been a heart-breaking tragic scene of more then epic proportions, if only you would have felt more...  So,all in all, a good performance and a great visual tour of Rajastan - but not the brilliant movie you can easily understand it could have been.
He appears to say that was then, in the past, there's no time for that; let's simply watch how their karmic debts are collected now.
Every now and then, there is a moment of stillness, which one wishes would be held a few seconds longer for the mood to be savored.
I just finished watching this movie with my friends, and I am actually angry right now.
I, in turn, worked damn hard through all my life and have been eraning six figure income for 3 years now.
I'm going to watch Eric Bernt more closely now.
Otherwise, the picture is just a pleasing and old-fashioned revenge tale, adapted from a now forgotten novel, and set in the Ozark Mountains at about the turn of the twentieth century.
Betty Field is his spunky love interest in what would now be an Amy Madigan part.
Enhanced by Philip Glass's haunting music score and a magnetic performance by Tony Todd (it has now become his signature role) as the titular being.
Which Helen does and now her life turns into horrifying nightmare, which teeters between reality and myth, as she gets closer to the truth about the Candyman.
He injected himself, and is now immune.
The Omega man may now receive renewed attention as a result of the current and third re-make of the original story from which it derives, "I Am Legend".
Whereas The Omega Man, using the story as a vehicle, developed it into what may now be read as an uncannily insightful analysis of latent undercurrents of late twentieth century culture.
Seen from today's perspective, Charlton Heston's depiction of the isolated, besieged man of science, Dr Neville, seems eerily evocative for the embattled minority of us who cling to the ideal of scientific truth that is now under attack.
As in The Omega Man, we now see the mass media that is a product of science used by that media's own opportunistic elements to generate a hostility to science that they can then play to their own advantage.
A far-fetched fantasy adventure at the time of it's making, The Omega Man now seems to have uncannily anticipated the major political themes of life in the early Twenty-First Century.
The hot black chick that gets down with Chuck (which again given his far-right politics, the scene now gives off a different vibe).
Many comparisons are now being made between Will Smith's 'I Am Legend' and 'The Omega Man'.
For me 'The Omega Man', even with its faults and the fact it is now nearly 40 years old, still stands above Will Smith's new version.
Some, however,we learn, it takes longer and they wind up as light sensitive,albino zombies, with the now insane- "Matthias" the guru of at least the Los Angeles area ones, battling Robert Neville, the last plague-free man on the planet.
However, now, with both fears of Avian Flu, and the threat of terrorists gaining some kind of viral agent and unleashing it, the film has a new relevance.
Even now when I watch the film, the bleak feeling which runs as an undercurrent throughout, never ceases to move me with the tragedy of the ending.
Anthony Zerbe is tremendous as the family leader as is the now deceased Lincoln Kilpatrick as Zerbes sidekick.
Quick-paced & tense with good supporting performances from Paul Koslo as "Dutch" & Rosalind Cash as "Lisa" Dated now it is, but still stands the test of time as a truly great 70's sci-fi & if you haven't seen it, then you are in for a treat.
In typical rock-em, sock-em Heston style, he battles the bad guys in a not to shabby, but now somewhat dated sci-fi adventure.
I don't remember any big fuss about it in 1971, so I guess it won't be an issue now.
Today (06 September 2006) I have watched "The Omega Man" again, now in the original language.
Unfortunately, Warner Bros. has continually delayed the release of OMEGA MAN on DVD - 4 years now counting.
Here's the last man on earth watching huge mobs of people crowd up the world that is now empty.
He's arrested for something and taken to the local jail, which was apparently a prison at one point, but now the upper two floors are abandoned.
When Gabe and Tom are having lunch and Gabe tells Tom that the four of them were to grow old together, watch each others kids grow up and cry at their weddings, now that is friendship.
On the contrary of "Sex, lies Â", Andie is now surrounded by a terrific cast.
More importantly, they realize that they haven't had the need to communicate solely with each other until now and they have no idea how to do it.
Up until now I've enjoyed everything coming out of Studio 4C I've seen, and thats a lot.
predates most of our great spectacular films of the 1950s by many yrs (Ok, we had silent films King of Kings & 10 Commandments & some other De Mille Films, Sign of the Cross etc) but this mythological setting was unusual for the times... Cant wait to see again.. Massimo Girotti whose work I know from Senso & later Medea is excellent... rest of cast were not known to me & also not aware of director, Blassetti.... now I am !Will look forward to viewing The Iron Crown again,.and other films by Blassetti..Thanks again TCM !
I have now bought volume 1 & 2 on VHS.
But it is so inexcusably heavy-handed and one-dimensional that I now wonder why I bothered to watch it until the end.
Speaking of now ex-husband Soames, she says "I feel sorry for him,...he's a very poor man".
Sharpe's Flash (an old Sharpe meeting with a young Flashman), now there is a thought!
For now I enjoyed this movie a lot and surely wasn't disappointed.
A deserted lieutenant from the British-led Indian Army, Dodd is now styled a general who is leading the forces of the young Rajah.
Hopefully we will get to see some of the other books that haven't yet made it to film produced now.
You have these every day objects, all coming from a motel room that now doesn't exist anymore, and each of them have weird powers, ranging from opening any door anywhere to boiling eggs or putting people to sleep.
So far, there is also the absence of the droll, overused idea that aliens planted things and are now watching us like some sort of big lab experiment.
First "Battlestar Gallactica" and now "The Lost Room."
It's like Gotham City, only brighter, messier, and of course, without the Dark Knight, now instead, having Black and White play vigilante, Batman and Robin style.
And now I can add another movie to my list of all time faves.
One of the first scenes: A band of street musicians, are setting up their trade now forbidden by the army, in a truck, near the local graveyard in outer-Turkey.
And the abrupt end, which we cannot elaborate here, thanks to spoiler policy .... Every European and US-citizen should go see this movie, since it seems to give a realistic picture of Turkey even now.
I have been a fan of Dakota Fanning for a while now, and I think she does well in almost everything she does, but I don't think it would be possible for her to do any better than she did in this movie.
For 19 years now, this movie has been my standard by which to judge all terrible films.
We should appreciate the freedom we have now.
She was supposed to marry Austin as one time, but got amnesia and only now remembers what they once meant to each other (gag).
Brick Bardo (Tim Thomerson)teams up with Judith Grey (Tracy Scoggins, from Demonic Toys) to destroy the demonic toys who are trying to bring Satan back to life (Or such nonsense) also on-board is Ginger (Refered to as Dollchick played by Melissa Behr reprising her role from Bad Channels) now Brick Bardo must save his girl and destroy the toys and must not fail.
In the second and most compelling 'chapter' of the movie, Harry (now played by the utterly talented Josse De Pauw) grew out a fairly intelligent adolescent, yet he still hasn't experienced physical love due to a severe (better make that EXTREMELY severe) case of acne.
The film vanished from sight,  becoming an instant cult classic - much written about but seldom seen and now reappraised as one of the most underrated films of the 1980's.
With Reflex Action, he has truly proven now to his critics that he can do it all, and well.
The direction shows style and promise and an attention to detail I respected then and respect now.
But his spirit does not rest, and he now wanders the earth, traveling through time, killing (almost) every living thing he comes across.
What's positive about the "Incident at Roswell" is that those in charge of finding out what happened, then as well as now, will never let it see the light of day.
If you're not familiar with the Roswell Incident (who isn't by now?)
I mean it was 1967, Ed Wood even had nudity in his films by now.
The director later interviewed the boy, now a grown man living in California, and he said the accident happened on a Tuesday and he woke up late Thursday.
So, since those tough old birds that were married in the 1950's (and my Mom was one) paved the way for you young girls, you can now be judges, jet pilots, doctors and ice road truckers.
Its ideas about women seem repressive to us now, but given the attitudes of the time, it was actually fairly advanced.
With many records destroyed by the Nazis as the Allies swept through Europe at the close of the war, it is now very difficult to estimate how many homosexuals were arrested.
These are painful memories, all of them, and all the more so because the Holocaust has been increasingly downplayed over the past few decades--downplayed to a point at which some few now attempt to deny that it ever occurred at all.
Until now I was in the dark.
This documentary centers on six emotional accounts of the most elderly and frail survivors of the concentration camps who, up until now, have repressed their stories.
Co-star Daryl Hannah, who plays Madison the mermaid, became herself a huge star from this film, but now times have changed in her film career, which has faded during the 1990s, which is sad.
The sequel was called "Splash, Too" and starred Todd Waring as Allen Bauer and Amy Yasbeck (movies "Problem Child" 1 and 2, "The Mask", "Pretty Woman", "Robin Hood: Men In Tights", and TV's "Wings") as Madison Bauer, now married from a Neptune ceremony.
Only now she's a beautiful grownup mermaid (wonderfully played by a perfectly cast Daryl Hannah).
And they used to make them a lot better than they do now.
I simply can't judge it that way For me, it was a childhood classic, and now is simply a classic in its own right
Strangely popular one-dimensional Tom Hanks plays it straight against various odd-ball individuals including his huckster brother, acted by the continuously upstaging John Candy, with a little pythonesque humour supplied by a female employee who has had a bump on the head and is now in the habit of wearing her clothes out of synch.
Years later, now a man (and played by Tom Hanks), another trip to Cape Cod brings dejavu: Hanks falls off of a tour boat and is rescued by an all grown mermaid (played by Daryl Hannah).
I used to watch this movie as a kid and occasionally when I was in my teens but I watched it again now (im 24) and I must say its an excellent movie, which also has a very good story line, and one you can relate to if you have been in a relationship where your asking yourself many questions about the person your with and things that do which don't make sense!
In the early 90's , vertical skating became yesterdays news - and street skating was now becoming all the rage.
It was a great documentary for those of us who used to skate and now just hang around.
With a great soundtrack, excellent original resources and unparralleled access to the sports biggest names (many of whom skated with Gator and are now owners of Skateboard companies), Stoked is as much a look at the Eighties and the gluttony of the times; some made it through unscathed, some profited nicely, and one at least is going to be in jail for some time to come!
Not overlong, it still seems a little slow now at times but it's probably because unlike in the mid 70s when this was considered unique , so much else has been seen.
This staple of Italian life and joy, the family table, now becomes Mateo's nightmare when he learns of Alvaro's death.
I still don't now if these twins are conjoined or not.
That's my life right now.
Before this movie I never cared for Alicia Silverstone, but after this I appreciate her a lot more...especially now that I know she created it.
I now thank those friends for the good and true word.
I know, you want to see it because the cover shows a hot female body holding a machine gun, and because it's been out of print on DVD for years and now there's a certain level of mystique about it... but I'm telling you, there is absolutely NOTHING here that's worth looking at!
The character names have changed (except for Orville Ketchum, now the janitor, and through the majority of the film practically a zombie), the goofy synthesized piano music is back, and the cleavage is as prominent as ever.
When I was really young, even though I saw the caricatures of Humphrey Bogart, Peter Lorre and Edward G. Robinson - plus the scenes from "The Jazz Singer" and "It Happened One Night" - I couldn't interpret anything from them, but of course now I can.
Too bad it's not on video now--it should be taped!
Much later, around age 200, he has had further "modifications" which now results in his aging, and wearing out, along with Portia.
It is amazingly now regarded in some quarters as a proto-feminist tract.
I loved this show as a kid and now am taping all the episodes on TVLAND!
Obviously too much time has gone by for a sequel to be made now, though I can picture one that begins right as Nikita ends.
and they were each assigned very hazardous duties, but I took them all away from all that and now they work for me.
Charlie's opening monologue has now undergone a complete overhaul.
So, we now know that Barbara has zero self-esteem and is stupid.
But, only a short time later, she shoots Bellamy when he learns the truth about the baby and Menjou (who is now the governor).
Even the best directors turn out a clinker now and then and Capra was learning both his craft and his message at this time.
Instead the lowlife creep gets blasted by his now totally hysterical, from him beating her up and about to expose Roberta, wife Lulu.
Lulu now old and with her deciding to keep the truth from Roberta, as well as the widowed Mrs. Grover, to herself and alone in the world does whats best for everyone.
No doubt that animal right organizations now days would do anything to ban this movie from being shown was it made today but truth is that this is a pretty harmless act.
If the Drop Squad really did exist then I'm glad they did but if they didn't I couldn't be more disappointed especially since we need them now more than ever!
We didn't have a problem when we where in the forefront, so why would it matter now if we're in the background?
Despite his occasional appearance in the films of major directors like Max Ophuls, Jacques Becker and Jean Renoir, from the 1950s onwards Jean Gabin seemed content to rely simply on his effortlessly charismatic screen persona and elevate an apparently interminable succession of old-fashioned potboilers which, while undeniably enjoyable in themselves, now seem like a regrettable waste of this monumental French film star.
that I actually found myself laughing out loud many times, particularly when both leads were locked up under "arrest" in adjoining cells and touched hands through their respective windows -- now that is cinema!!
Portraying a Polish-Catholic Concentration Camp survivor now living in Brooklyn 1947, Meryl Streep admirably keeps a haunted look in her eyes--and in her forlorn smile--throughout all the fabricated histrionics of this Alan J. Pakula "prestige" picture.
Sophie survived Ausschwitz, drinks to much and is completely dedicated to Nathan, who now and then gets terrible moods.
I've read all the comments prior to posting this, so now what I am saying will sound a lot more different than everyone else.
Watching the once happy elderly couple, now battling family issues/ health problems (which is the main drama driving the story where there are numerously scattered human interest subplots), but also the changing neighbourhood of Coney Island as young jive talking hoons run wild (which populates mainly the beginning and ending but still feels secondary) is engagingly passionate in its ups and downs.
Come on now.
It is a wonderful glimpse into the lives of lesbians in the 50s, in many ways different from now - the hidden=ness and secrecy, the butch femme culture - and in many ways so the same - who was going out with who, when, how they fell in love, broke up, wove their lives and made family of their friendships.
I am viewing: Forbidden Love, now on LOGO- NYC, still NO captions!!!
It's hard to believe that an up-dated newer (closed caption) version is not now being shown on LOGO!
Up till now, I thought "First Spaceship on Venus" had a lock on interplanetary travesties, but now I know better.
The mission to our sister planet now becomes a fight for the survival of the human race, as the crew must try to save the Earth from destruction," according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.
The story, which until now has had a rich dramatic arc, soon descends into forced comedy when Keiko's mentally-challenged mother shows up doing flamenco dances and Keiko's former boyfriend returns demanding her mother's money.
It was worse than the film version of A Chorus Line and, up until now, I thought that was the worst adaptation of a musical.
Yet when all of the forces collide in the climax of the film, Takuro realizes how much of his past is mixed with fantasy/nightmare and, equally, how much his present is dependent on his interaction with Keiko (now pregnant with Dojima's baby), the priest, his sci-fi friend and the forces who would destroy Keiko and his quiet existence.
What is sad in some regards now is the realization upon seeing it again that the era of life portrayed here is now gone from the collective American psyche to some extent.
MY SON JOHN is even worse now...
He's quite a bit older than his brothers and made a good academic record and now is a big success in Washington.
Frank McHugh reprises his role from Going My Way as Father O'Dowd who apparently has left the mean streets of Hell's Kitchen New York and Barry Fitzgerald and now is pastoring out in the red states.
Unfortunately it's now out there.
Boasting that the only reading that matters to her are cookbook and Bible, she makes him swear on it (the Good Book, not Good Housekeeping) that he is `not now nor ever was' a member of the Communist Party, as if the House Committee on UnAmerican Activities had convened in the homey kitchen.
Yes, some of the topicality is now flat as are some of the jokes, but with Stubby Kaye, Peter Palmer and Stella Stevens in the cast, who cares.
Imagine,...a terrible cartoon with abysmal production values is now seen by some as a classic?!?!
And, by the 1960s, lousy quality cartoons were now the norm, so Yogi Bear was a pretty successful cartoon--along with other totally uninteresting characters as Quickdraw McGraw and Huckleberry Hound.
And he has a girl name Cindy who loves him but Yogi doesn't love her back, thats so funny.I wished they never stopped making "The Yogi Bear Show", the people back then and right now will miss the show.
What she seemed unable to understand that this sort of demands which she had been known for back in her prime was supremely out of style by now, and for an actress of her stature to assume she could throw her ego around just because, was pushing it a little.
The fawns are now rambunctious and argumentative, at points even fighting with each other.
I had my mum but was without a father so I could relate... And now I am a step-mom for two children who have lost their mom, so I can now relate in otherwise as well.....
Maybe the animation is computerized now and maybe the DTV Sequels are not going to hold a candle to the original art from the hearts of incredibly talented artists under Walts guidance, But Bambi II is much better than many of Disney's other Classic sequel attempts to make money on nostalgic baby boomers.
Bambi's father takes care of him now, after the death of Bambi's mother.
And now, Bambi 2 filled that hole.
That was one of the most wonderful things about the first movie ...even more than sixty years after it's release, the songs were so well written that they sound just as good now as they did then.
And now we get to the heart of the movie.
So now the British cleverly set false rumors that British warships are just beyond the horizon and ready for battle.
If, he thinks, he leaves harbor now he faces a strengthened British force and will probably loose.
This movie feels like the filmmakers meant for this to be a drama and at the last minute decided to play up some horror aspects since that genre is popular right now.
Tut, tut, tut, oh Vinny what rubbish have you got yourself into now?
I thought it was appropriately funny for anyone - I was 11 give me a break- but looking back now yes i would watch it again.
The 2007 Cadillac Seville now called simply "STS" is in the starting price range of $50,000.
One is a movie where you leave saying, "I don't under, wait, yeah, of course, now I understand!
Unlike the two men, she has no buried intention to compensate for or hold on to days gone by, not just for the reason that it's upsetting, but also because she is altogether here and now.
I have never had a favourite movie before but now this has become it.
Indeed the stories don't go to deep most of the time and that is the appealing part of it, but now and then people have a need for extra emotions besides humor.
All Ladd now has to do is go to this huge ranch and "claim his natural birthright".
The problem is that although Ladd is a hothead with a checkered past, he's too decent to keep up the ruse--though Keith is now angry enough to eat hornets because he was counting on this big payoff.
(It was Mae Clarke who got the now famous "grapefruit in the face.")
Howver we also learn that the evil Poelzig, who is also a satanist by the way, has "married" the now grown daughter of Werdegast.
This film is now available on DVD as part of a Bela Lugosi boxset that mostly stars Boris Karloff - his way of getting even, I guess.
But I have seen this film more than ten years ago and things change and now Nikita is not that cruel movie anymore.
And here starts spontaneity - what to do now?
And to add an extra cherry on top of the sundae, we're asked to believe that even though he was a journalist, went to war, then came back blind, now he is suddenly a brilliant pianist who knows every note of every song Jenny is going to (lip-synch) sing, even though it's a new show with new songs that the public hasn't heard yet -- songs that he already has memorized (because Jenny's former MD, who could not STAND her, "teaches" Mike the songs).
Then, when Jenny learns that Tye isn't going to come to the party, she tells her agent (in the privacy of her bedroom--which looks like it was lifted off the set of "Twilight Zone") to get everyone "out" of her apartment "now."
I really don't know what anyone was trying to "say" with this film, but trust me, whatever it is, it can't possibly compare to when Joan orders "Lobster Newburg and coffee" -- now THAT is saying something (even if it's pathetic)!
The couple thanks the hospitality of their eerie host, but they don't know that they are now pawns in a death game between Werdegast and Poelzig, a death game between two rivals that started many years before.
Maybe now it finds its audience, it certainly deserves that.
Needless to say, when this was announced for DVD release, I was ready to leap at the chance of finally being able to own and watch the film Â but, as many of you must already know, my joy (and that of many another fan, I'm sure) was short-lived when it emerged that Universal had issued a Pan-and-Scan version (which I can only imagine now how this ruined its detailed widescreen compositions)!
Colossus is the new defense supercomputer that is trying to take over the world, and Dr. Forbin is the man who created it, and now must stop it.
Of course there's much alarm between these two countries that they now have these two seemingly out-of-control computers calling the shots, and meetings are held to decide what to do.
Given the power to destroy the planet and the peoples it was meant to safeguard, now threatens all with a maxim, "I was created to prevent war.
The Baron, is now a scientist,Dr Charles Forbin played by Eric Braeden.
The movie is 35 years old now but it is still the most intelligent and accurate portrayal of Artificial Intelligence ever put on film.
#3: I now hate CN!
Not all cartoons like now!
and Lugosi not just shooting Karloff when he has the chance, the creepiest thing in the whole movie is that after marrying Lugosi's wife, Karloff now sleeps with his step-daughter.
It looks like some radioactive disaster has happened, so all the dead are now back to life, and they are looking for food - human brains.
Tom Savini has always done an excellent job by doing make-ups in horror movies, and now he shows himself as a very good director (make-up is another important aspect in zombie movies, and it was done well in this one).
Okay, I stop ranting now.
I have now for the last two months or saw seen all of the films that are related to this series and this ends up as the second best.
George Romero has gone above and beyond any other horror director in cinema history and Tom Savini is a welcome addition to the zombie tradition (now if he would just get back in the director's seat).
The only-downside is Elite should have wrangled an isolated-score function (which should be on all horror-films where the materials-exist to do it), as the original-score is very hard-to-find now.
In updating this story, some changes are inevitably made: it's now in color, and the violence is more graphic and explicit.
Notably the character of Barbara is no longer a gibbering vegetable but now much more balanced.
Morand, Philipe Nolret, who now works for Interpol finds an important link to both the Warsaw and Paris killings in the brutal and recent murder of a German prostitute in Hamburg.
I am the son of a now retired Air Force colonel, and  believe me, rebelling officer's children is usually a figment of  Hollywood's imagination.
Sorry, I'm talking about America now and not the film.
This is complicated by the fact that she now has a fiancÃ© who does not know what she does.
One of the characters we've been following remarks that these damned Spaniards and Italians he now has working for him in his factory don't know how to make Volkswagons.
As for all the comments about non-German actors portraying Germans and speaking English...I would think that everyone would be used to that by now, after 80 years of sound motion pictures!
Sadly, it appears that it is now difficult to find.
Yes I think I can now be considered one of his fans.
Another great thing were the sets that were wonderful and even now 70 years later they still look very modern.
If we were in 1930s maybe we would laugh....But now, it felt disgusting.
It is now in DVD format with excellent soundtrack and special features.
I had not read Akunin before, and went right out and bought the book - and am now reading Statskii Sovetnik to prepare for May.
Rishi Kumar originally was supposed to marry Roja's sister, but after Roja's sister confessed to Rishi Kumar, that she is in love with someone else, but cannot marry him now, due conflicts between their families.
Settlers and developers -- including the officers of railway lines -- who believed they owned land in Arizona now learnt that Reavis was their landlord, and the rent would be very expensive.
However, when one of his ex-victims (who is coincidentally now one of Dr Sutton's patients) tells her what sort of man he is, she dismisses what's been said and totally ignores the warning.
Standards and practices in psychiatry and psychotherapy have changed considerably since "Whirlpool" was made and anyone watching it now will need to make allowances for this and also suspend their disbelief at a couple of the plot's more bizarre twists which come over as much less credible now than they may have seemed at the time.
Like I said very poor taste   Other highlights of the show include Dr Fox giving a scientific lecture that paedophiles share an identical nervous system to crabs ( " No one knows this but it`s a scientific fact " ) Labour MP Barbara Follet giving a public warning about equipment paedophiles put on their genitals while surfing the net and Kate Thornton warning viewers that paedophiles can send gas through the internet which makes young children suseptable to sexual predators including one victim " Who was once a shy innocent child and who now has the sexuality of a sixty year old Colonel " .
Mr. Moreland was a native of Monroe in my now home state of Louisiana.
These movies combined creative ideas with special effects, and are now lodged in our cultural memory.
As my 10 year old pointed out, it was a rehash of the animated dinosaur movie (series now) "Land Before Time".
What's fantasy and what's reality is now indistinguishable.
Disney, a master in both animation and storytelling, is now lacking in a new story to show.
And the theme of the 'artist' or sensitive type holed up with gangsters is now legendary - reworked in films as diverse as Performance, but perhaps best with Bogart (again) as the good-guy in Key Largo.
Enter Alan Squier (Leslie Howard) who has those "book-smarts" and has been around to places like Paris and wrote a book but is now at a crossroads in his life - just the moment to meet a very curious-minded girl like Gabrielle, who, as happens in movies of the period, gets smitten with the guy immediately.
I enjoyed watching The Petrified Forest and have seen it a couple of times now.
But it's now four years after the end of prohibition and the real gangsters of earlier Warner Brothers films (including Bogart as a thug, along with Davis, appearing briefly in the great pre-code 1932 film, Three on a Match) are mostly gone from real life.
The result was almost bound for success, and though the movie is known now mostly as Bogart's breakthrough movie (his earlier films had him typecast as a second-string villain), it is really not Bogart who dominates it, but Howard.
She is now unhappily married to a selfish man and has no identity of her own.
Having just viewed "The Petrified Forest" for the fourth time, I'm even more in awe now of the film's powerful story and the director's deft use of it's principals and supporting characters.
He strikes up a friendship with Gabrielle who admires his cultured manner and love of poetry much to the chagrin of would be boyfriend Boze Hertzinger (Dick Foran) a has been football player who now pumps gas.
Joseph Alexander is a menial and Slim Thompson really rubs it in to him, telling him the day of liberation has come for some time now.
It is hard to believe now but there was a time when, if you were a 'Dr.Who' fan, you kept quiet about it.
It would be impossible to make a biographical film of Ms. Earhart then or now without some included elements of myth.
And is her own human nature now taking revenge for her toying with the emotions of her admirers?
), but I think it shouldn't have been part of this movie, because the situation of the woman, her husband (if he lives), her child and her lover is far too serious to just pop up for a moment now and then as a side story.
It supports the story, but may seem a little late 80's every now and then, but never the less it sounds good.
See it now!
A little puzzling now and again the film nevertheless moves well against its sleazy background and constant sense of mob menace.
And every now and again one of the girls pops a nipple.
His escape involves a light jog and a bus ride (you heard me) and then he's back at his club to watch the girls do their show, blissfully unaware that the mob now intends to kill him to cover up their tracks.
It is included on the DVD for the now defunct Film-Fest DVD series, Issue 3 (along with some other good shorts)
I like movies like Silence of the lambs (even if it isn't as thrilling and suspense now as it was when it came out) or Kiss the girls.
this movie was well-acted,skillfully shot,and attractive without having that disgustingly fake,over-polished look that everyone seems to use now.
So if I provide my understanding here and now, I think that would detract from the pleasure of unraveling it for yourself.
Wallace Shawn has a brief but important role as a fellow agent while Stephanie Miller, now a national talk show hostess, is a stitch as Shawn's reality-checking personal assistant.
We are now into Season 3 of this series and any Christie purists still watching at this stage should know exactly what to expect - Christie 'spinning in her grave' is a very over used phrase!
There were some inspired bits of casting: Jane Seymour as the ill-fated, hard-as-nails matriarch; Alison Steadman as Kirsten, the faithful maid (Yes, Shirley Valentine's gal-pal is now playing a middle-aged Swedish maid!
Not now.
As someone who has been dancing all her life and is now a dance teacher and a writer for a dance magazine, I must say that this movie SUCKED!!!!
Especially if you are anti- a lot of contemporary modern crap that's out there right now, you'll die laughing.
Written and directed and produced and acted by Lisa Niemi the story involves the return to the boards by three retired dancers (Lisa Niemi, Patrick Swayze, George de la Pena - all three are dancers in real life) to pay homage to the gifts of a highly regarded yet now dead choreographer.
20 years ago, when we were coming up through the ranks, it was a lot different than it is now.
After all these years and now having teen-age daughters myself, I haven't forgotten the impact that a first major crush can have on your life.
As a teenager I related to everything Jessie felt, and now looking back on my own years, they were some of the most memorable!
I bought it and watch it every now and then when I want to escape to a simpler, less complicated time, with slumber parties, "Teen Beat" posters on the walls, vinyl records scattered about, slurping on NON-diet sodas and talking with my friends about boys and music and boys!
(He is almost 17 now and I can't wait to show him this) Thank you Thank you for listing it on here.
Looking at the cover photo now after all these years makes me laugh.
I bought the movie just a couple of years ago, and now from time to time, watch it and fall in love again!!
Even now!
Maybe if I saw it now with grown up eyes, I would see it differently, but I doubt it.
Every once in a while, I find myself singing it - even now.
When I saw the movie in 1979, before they gave television shows or movies parental ratings, I am thinking now that this movie is actually pretty risk taking for its time.
I remember watching this movie when I was 13, and now that I am older, for some reason I just HAD to have this movie on DVD.
The film is definitely '70s but not in a super-dated cheesy way, in fact the outfits Denise Miller as Jessie wears could be current now!
One thing that made me love the film then as much as now is not taking the clichÃ©, easy, tied-with-a-bow but sort of let-down ending.
OK now it's plot hole time, why couldn't they just phaser the time machine so that neither one could get through?
....but maybe he appreciates the friends he has in the Peanuts gang a lot more now.
Even now I still get choked up at the farewell party and Chuck's sad song when Snoopy leaves home.
I laugh at all of the funny scenes like the re-occurring "No Dogs allowed" signs that appear every now and then.
I'm 21 now, and I'm still watching this movie over and over.
I liked the part when Charlie Brown said "It took that rock 5,000 years to come to shore, now your putting it back".
I wish things were a lot simpler now as it was then.
I first saw this film as a boy in my early tens, and even when I watch it now it has lost none of its ability to endear and -- in particular -- choke.
"Peanuts" managed to speak to me when I was a child and it continues to do so now that I'm an adult.
Nice simple effects at times, like mixing the images of "back then" with the soundtrack of "now".
Describing two plots (one in antiquity, one now) and using the same actors, and a series of flashbacks to get his point across, Claude Lelouch uses his traditional style in a confusing manner which will make the film beyond the understanding of many.
We meet the same group of people then and now, with grand passion, bullfighting and Gipsy Kings thrown into the mix.
Very civilized settings are ravaged by terrorist bombs, which may have seemed novel and exotic in the 1950s, but unfortunately seems quite common now.
And now, in 2006, I find the webpage, and it contains more EMMANUELLE movies than I previously thought.
Don't wait three decades for someone to proclaim this a masterpiece and one of the most significant "windows" into the early 70's, and for it to be shown at some film festival alongside TAXI DRIVER--score a copy now.
I am now waiting for the next film,H2O: Trojan horse.
Then suddenly the predator decides that now, unlike the past five minutes, is a really good time to strike.
I have been neglecting my reviewing duties and so haven't gotten around to doing one for the finale until now.
After months of speculation, we now know what the Demon was looking for in Sam- a leader of his demon army.
The story is good but the way it was handled....I cringed when an intelligent actress like Kajol is made to do those heavy-duty unrealistic emotional scenes so associated with Bollywood that we thought its passe now.
Because of inefficient and always loving characters our ancestors we lost our great India now also we are doing do same mistake and we going to loose our India one day.
The next 90 minutes were worse than the first 90.. i never imagined that could be possible but it was... i ceased to exist as an individual after that movie and now roam the roads of New York like a homeless bum..
All that remains now is for the girl and boy to get married and remain happily ever after.
now for AAMIR no words can describe this man's awesomeness.
Kajol has been blessed with sublimely expressive eyes, and now that she has acquired more life experience, they register even greater pain.
It's good to know that now a days, when the movie running time is too short, its OK to show clips from previous parts of the movie.
That's OK now.
The special FX that are used in the ending of the movie would have been a shame in the early 80s, now they're not even funny anymore.
Every now and then he would get a little angry.
(Other great shows include: Kung Fu: The Legend Continues, T and T, starring Mr. T, and My Secret Identiy, with a 13 year old Jerry O'Connel)  All the actors in the show are local Toronto/Canadian actors, (now they do national tv shows and national lottery/car dealership commericals) so this was probably the only chance they got to be seen on television sets around the world.
Fleeing to Mexico, they meet up again with Marvin who takes them under his wing now, to show them how to do it right.
I've been a Joan fan for a while now, so when I saw the laser disc for this movie I got it right away.
But Mehta ought to know by now that it's the content that does the talking eventually.
Yash raj has given us great movies but something is missing now.
Plus, Madhuri Dixit (now a mother of 2 boys) certainly did hold back in her acting, as she is known as being a bold, confidant type of female character.
The movie is fantastic.An excellent comeback from Madhuri after 5 years.The story is brilliant.It opens when Dia a dance teacher works in USA with her family.One day she gets a call that her dance instructor is dead.And wants her to come back to Ajanta.She comes back.The old Ajanta is being converted to a shopping mall.Its now dia turn to save this.At the end she does a few dances which attracts peoples.She wins their hearts.An enjoyable family movie.Madhuri was superb.Divvya was superb.Konkana was superb.Kunal looked hot and was awesome.Irfan was superb.Akshaye was wonderful.Ranvir Vinay add humour and were funny.Direction is wonderful.Cinematography is excellent.Chereography is wonderful.The music is faboulous and superb.The lyrics are wonderful and so is the picturisations.A must see Rating-10/10
But that simply isn't Madhuri's style now.
It was a script she approved because she felt it was most like her life now.
I can now say that I think the movie should sweep a lot of awards: It deserves Best Screenplay, Best Musical Director, Best Cinematography, Best Choreography, and Best Supporting Actor and Actress (Kunal and Konkona, of course).
Everyone brings their A games, A standing for amateur, really, unpolished doesn't even begin to describe what's going on here, but out here in Exploitation Country, flaws such as screwed up lines should be expected and embraced, if you didn't know, now you know.
I can see it now...he and and his friends are sitting around playing Nintendo and drinking Kool-Aid and one of his chums says  "Hey, you remember the time your new Mom showed us her breasts for money?That was great!"
It's a classic boy meets girl movie with that dash of "damsel in distress but is now hardened and tough due to life being so rough and who now finally meets a man who breaks through it all and understands and loves her for who she is" - as far as romantic comedies go- it was better then I thought it would be and even gets the heart strings welling when Ed Harris tells her "this could hurt"...The story itself can be at times almost childish, but in the end that's part of it's charm.
Although Nikhil Advani started off in the backseat, it looks like from now on his job is in the director's chair.
They now make perfect sense (in the same way that the songs of KKHH also improved after watching the movie)  The look of the film, the humour, the choreography, the set direction, the cinematography, the everything of this movie are outstanding.
W0w, This movie is great, I watched just bit of it when it released, It was real sad, that I couldn't finish it, but now after about 1 year I determined to watch it no matter what, and I really loved it.
Naina is heartbroken but now Aman embarks on a noble mission of bringing Naina and Rohit together .. because Rohit loves Naina and Aman wants to make her happy .
I'm off now to pursue a career in international assassinations.
This is one of those movies that 5 years from now you will see on WTBS in the middle of a rainy Saturday afternoon and you will think, "hum, I don't remember that one".
And now I'm off to buy the soundtrack...
HE is absolutely Fantastic...i wont stand a word against him... now comes SAIF....... God for some years we did think his days in Bollywood was over.. NOW see how brilliant actor he has become......... he is just Magnificent...such a superb comedic timing...he is really talented this man... JAYA Bachan..... SHe is PERFECT..... she puts life and SOul to this character... she plays the IDIOL mother to such Perefection that i bet every viewer were going like "why don't i have such a understanding mother" in their heads..... and the rest of the cast is totally fabulous.... they are so good that i for times believe that this movie could have been totally different if one of them weren't their... like JIYA for instance....she made me cry... Dadi she made me angry... Sweetu and her SIS mad me laugh.........  all in all this is a Perfect Romantic Comedy for the WHOLE FAMILY(really hard to find in this generation)..........I wouldn't change a thing about this movie.... 10/10 I hope you feel the same....
It's a real delight to see Isabelle Carre building on the success of her breakthrough role in Se Souvenir des Belles Choses and earning co-star (Holy Lola) and now sole star billing which she more than justifies.
You may have Celtic blood, but may be lacking some of their recessive DNA markers and only have Anglo-Saxon DNA markers because you had relatives in what is now England from 800 years ago.
I'm not a Mormon now, nor ever have been but I sat down to watch this video out of curiosity.
Rebecca is now attempting to make her big comeback in the movie role as turn of the century serial murderess Belle Gunness "known as the Black Widow of the the America Heartland" who killed 42 people in he early 1900's.
We also see the ghost of the real Belle Gunness, Loana Prvelescu, pop up every now and then in the movie giving Rebecca tips and advice in killing off her cast members in the film.
"Shall we settle up now otherwise it just gets nasty" LOL
And now, I'll never know what happens next.
In fact, I'd say its much better then the garbage they try to unload now (A show called 24 comes to mind).
The Sopranos (now preparing to end) is the very peak of adult television and drama.
Above all stand two actors, James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano, and Edie Falco as His wife Carmela... as for Gandolfini, he fits his roll in a way that words cannot express, if you haven't seen him as tony yet see it now!
The "gangster" genre is now a worn subject one that is too often subjected to parody.
We've been totally spoiled now.
It should be a subject in school :) I saw Sopranos when I was a kid, but I was too young to stay waked until the episode ends, so now I bought the all Episodes in DVD format and I am watching all episodes at home before and after dinner and I am getting addicted, like I did with Prison Break.
With TV now competitive and often poor The Sopranos stands tall above the rest as America's most original and compelling drama.
Hollywood has used romance as the drawing card to fill the seats for message movies for almost 100 years now..."Hearts of the World" comes to mind.
Secondly it is now perfectly clear to me, why Ms Jolie has chosen to adopt children from Etiophia and Cambodia.
Never mind that her efforts are short-lived and that she abandons the now motherless child to suffer the cruelties of a prolonged existence alone.
Instead of debating the film's merits we should be out there doing something right now.
I am appalled to see that the overall IMDb rating for this movie is only 5.2 (edit: now down to 4.9!
Later edit: Ah, now it's up to 5.4 - still abysmal.
Oh, and now it's up to 5.9 - going the right way, at least!).
I wondered why so I searched on IMDb, most comments are mixed but I reckoned I should give the movie a watch but couldn't get hold of the DVD until now.
Fourth down the line comes the lovely Jennifer Connelly, now an academy award winner, and rightfully so.
Reading through the reviews of this film, it's clear to me that the general viewing public (the folks who don't get this movie) really does like its action films to be big and dumb, and that they have been fooled by Hollywood into thinking that: a) "science fiction" is the same as "sci fi" (it's not); and b) "science fiction" is now supposed to be analogous to "action flick" (thanks for nothing, James Cameron!).
Despite(and maybe because of) Matrix sky high hype right now, my thoughts drift back to this overlooked classic...but a little on Neo and gang first below...
I never thought I would find myself agreeing with a Russian terrorist but now I have.
Senseless, waste of time, starring wooden Harrison Ford who has been playing the same role, since Han Solo and Deckard of Blade Runner, now for 20 years.
Of course, at the time, people obviously considered Hollywood a smart career move, but if we now take a look at Petersen's Hollywood films, I really think he should have stayed in Germany.
Sure, he wouldn't have the money that he's having at his disposal now, but remember: DAS BOOT had a rather infinitesimal budget and nevertheless managed to thrill, enlighten and entertain millions of viewers.
Cheer as President Harrison Ford takes on the baddies all by himself Â "Right now, he's our only hope".
I feel much better now!
Brody Harms is now in the running for the "worst actor to ever be put on film" (or video in this case as I believe it went straight to) award.
Now, most things that i liked as a child i can't stand now but i do still like this.
i liked it as a child and i still like it now at 25. probably one of the few things that have stood the test of time with me, i usually go off things very quickly.
Thsi is one of those movies that was at some point in my earlier childhood that i was obsessed with.I mean this was my favorite movie at the times.Now ill go back and look at this, and obviously I don't love it as much as I did, but I still like it a lot.This film is just so good, and so enjoyable that I can see why I liked it the way I did.Well, now that i understand the film more, i realize that there was some stuff that was not really necessary, and it was a bit to long, but its still a good movie.This movie is just so much fun, and good that its very lovable that anyone could find at least something they liked.Every now and then ill watch this, and remember why I fell in love with this great and funny movie.Overall its a good movie that can be enjoyed by anybody, and is worth a viewing from.
I know it's a fantasy, but it just looks now so stupid it's almost beyond description.
He's been given a name now, by Buddy Hackett who plays Jones's mechanic.
Alyssa arrives at his door, against instructions from her boss, just in time to untie him and they escape once again, but when they run to Alyssa's boss for help they find that she too is on the take and it seems that the happy duo are now left to bring the story to its conclusion by themselves.
Well, now that the ice is broken, the lovebirds are constantly stealing a kiss on the corner of dirt roads, or in sleazy taverns filled with environmental terrorists and would-be competitors in the Anthony Quinn lookalike contest, and all of this romance is pursued with the same nonchalance you'd have with your best girly on the streets of London.
I guess you know by now that Sandra did a dimly lit nude scene, and this is a rarity in her career, but she has said that she had her essentials taped down for this scene, so I don't know exactly what we are looking at.
I've seen Hotel Rwanda and now this film about the genocide of the early 90's in that country.
The handful of British and American survivors pick up the captain of the U-boat, now sunk, that torpedoed their ship -- good old Willie.
Im thinking about it now and I still feel my stomach drop when I imagine myself in Shand's shoes.
Derek Thompson had had a minor role in Yanks, and this suggested he had a bright career in films, but he ended up playing nurse Charlie Fairhead in Casualty, and has now played that part for 23 years!
Helen Mirren is now an international star.
Jack (Alan Ford), one of Hoskins' crew, went on to play boss Brick Top in Snatch Pierce Brosnan's 007 is now played by Daniel Craig, who was xxxx in Layer Cake, the latest brit-gangster flick to attempt to wrestle the title from TLGF...
But the final drive away,with Brosnan holding Hoskins at gunpoint is now justly famous,holding on Harold's face seemingly endlessly but ingeniously,with all number of expressions telling us so much.This aspect of Hoskins' performance may be it's most impressive,despite being wordless.There has been a problem in some of Bob Hoskins' film roles since;undeniably a very fine actor,Hoskins however has sometimes fallen into the speech patterns and mannerisms of the role that made him a star into some other parts he has played,much to his detriment,though this has mostly been the exception rather than the rule.
The audience gasps at the word IRA, because now he has to confront a powerful and well organized rival.
So,the movie is really about a man who lost his soul in his lust for power, and now deludes himself that he can hold on and justify his power for eternity.
As the film draws to a close you can see that Shand is now resigned to be punished for his sins.
Very much in the tradition of the American gangster films of the 30s and 40s, this movie centres around a bravura performance by the central gangster (Edward G Robinson/James Cagney then; Bob Hoskins now).
Interesting also as a historical snapshot of a period in London's history (the redevelopment of the Docklands) now gone.
Incredible to only seeing it now!
The Berry rifts are still fast and furious but there is now an air of cynicism that was absent at the creation.
who are now dead, and he does have a point.
The Beastmaster himself, Marc Singer (presumably having now lost his telepathic affinity with animals and subsequently washed up and looking like a right scruffy old sod here!)
I saw it on a plane with English subtitles, and am now searching to see if I can buy it on DVD with subtitles.
The film is chock full of character with names like "Marc's Trick," "Hot Shirtless Guy" and "Hot Clothed Guy" - I'd rather receive a hot glue enema than sit through this a second time, but this film does raise so many questions: Why do people see movies like this when there are so many quality films out right now?
Trouble is I can't remember what they are now.
I was a little afraid that I wouldn't like the character of Marc in this sequel (he was played by Ryan Carnes, now famous for his role in "Desperate Housewives" as Bree's son's boyfriend... in the sequel he is played by Brett Chukerman).
Meanwhile Kyle's ex Marc (Brett Chukerman) finds this out and now HE wants to get Troy into bed...  OK--I HATED the original "Eating Out".
So begins his investigation, finding a list of "The Friends and Enemies of Carlotta", and he is now trying to find this Carlotta.
The humour is typical early-Martin which you either love or hate (I'm in the former camp) and as ever Steve's not above a little vulgarity to drive out the bigger laughs - for instance his hilarious re-organising of passed-out leading lady Rachel Ward's "out of whack" breasts or his answer to Lana Turner's "What are we going to do now" question as she enters his bedroom - "Kinsey, cover-to-cover".
Finally, now here is a movie where everybody seems to agree on the same verdict.
This is mainly considering the fact that the comedy movie is something now I virtually never go to the movies to see unless it is like a comedy/something other than comedy movie like Zombieland.
The world is changing and now we do can make differences and are not that desperate.
I own to Season 1 box set and I make my friends watch it and now they realize how great of a show it is, but it sucks it's canceled.
I cannot believe that they took this show off of the air and I can't believe I'm just now discovering it!
But every now and then I will meet a kindred spirit, and their eyes will light up, and they'll join right it!
Before Judd Apatow was famous for directing great films such as "The 40 Year Old Virgin" and "Knocked Up" and before producing "superbad" and other comedy films, he made the TV series "Freaks and Geeks".I used to watch this show back when it was on during 1999 and 2000 but I was young so I didn't understand all the references and jokes.Watching it now I understand all the jokes and find the show to be an interesting and accurate portrayal of high school life.The show has all the high school cliques such as Geeks,Jocks etc.There is also a good mix of comedy and drama.The show also jump started the careers for many of the cast members such as James Franco(spiderman) and Seth Rogen(knocked up).If you can find this show anywhere like in syndication or something, watch it!.
And now I'm sitting here, disappointed that I will NEVER get to know how Freaks and Geeks could have continued.
I believe, wholeheartedly, that if this show was aired now, it was have a massive viewing audience.
Set in 1980 in Michigan (although there's not a lot of difference between the show and the real life high school experience now), the show follows the "freaks"- ie.
I assumed by now there would be over 1000 people on this subject and was shocked there are less than 200 so far!
NBC used to have the best stuff around and now...I don't make a point of setting an hour aside anymore because one thing in the lineup is that worth the time.
Alas, the cast is now the better part of a decade older, and have moved on with their careers.
The problem is, the wife now hypnotizes the specialist and gives Charley the chase!
Well now I'm sure I've uncovered an earlier example of this bizarre phenomenon.
Time ticks, and now they have to tie up all lose ends, which is not as easy as two teenager want them to be.
IMDb's television series pages used to be pretty accurate, now a lot of stars show as limited guests on their own shows.
antonio baderas is high in my list of today's most promising directors and this film shows the perspectives he has as a director.. any way you should go see this movie and don't let its rating stop you from watching it because it almost did it to me and now i realise how i would have regretted had i not rented this movie instead of an other
I now long for an English translation of the novel.
If you are a horror B-movie fan and you have not seen this flick yet go rent it now!
A DJ kid wearing sunglasses and a cowboy hat (as does Mr Slim in the 'Rockafeller Skank' video) asks another DJ 'can you do a solo performance, i need some time off right about now, funk soul brother'.
and Â now here's the most shocking thing I could imagine in a satire on gay values Â he sleeps in PAJAMAS!
I thought perhaps America was not ready for that, but after seeing the "admirable" qualities of the beloved Sopranos I now ask-Why not?  
THe film is nominally one of those disaster movies, like San Francisco and The Hurricane, in which a rambling love story pads out a now antiquated special-effects-laden finale.
Since NBC owns Bravo now, maybe they'll continue new eps.
Update-4/29/07: The Cajun boy that starred in this film, J.C. Boudreaux, is now 73 and lives with his wife of 55 years, Regina, in a FEMA trailer in the town of Sweet Lake which is south of Lake Charles.
Well that's the bad, and now the good, the effects are the best catastrophe-movie effects I have ever seen BAR-NONE!
After the 40 minutes the movie moves outside as the survivors struggle to travel across what is now a truly alien earth.
She was as good then as she is now.
I own the movie now as an adult and still adore it!
The love story between Natty and Harry is so romantic, and the independent spirit of a young girl was rare in movies back then and is still rare now.
And lastly, what good is a large handful of fully-fledged wonderful scenes if you are not going to juxtapose them with something, instead of dishing them out every now and then to keep our interest?
There is nothing wrong with that by itself just as long as producers are honest about what they are doing and the audience members do not walk away from the film thinking that they now know the true history of an era.
I was particularly impressed on how the creators captured Aquaman's (A.C.'s) underwater life.....IMDb lists the pilot under 2006...It's 2007 now...I hope they didn't drop the show; otherwise, the channel's executives have their heads up their asses.
The cast seemed to work well together, it's too bad that Justin Hartley is now on Smallville.
Of course, only the pilot is available for viewing now...but it does leave you with many unanswered questions, hoping to see the rest of the story play out.
I didn't watch the BM show till just recently now that it's in reruns and I LOVE it.
I'll conclude now with the not-too-deep (but still very pertinent) observation that Kellita Smith, the actress who plays Bernie' wife, is really gorgeous.
Notice that movies that used a lot of slang that were made during these decades are now either unintentionally funny or unbelievably inferior.
The first season is far more immune to this flaw, yet the later ones are the one I'm referring to right now.
I started watching this show in 2006, probably the last season it was in production, and now enjoy the reruns every night.
This leads to all sorts of comedic escapades and because he now finds Myrna Loy irresistible, Powell sets about wooing her afresh as his new/old self (hence the title of the film).
Precisely in the Monastery of the `EncarnaciÃ³n' a chamber organ was found more or less when this film was being made: lost for over 400 years the `organillo de la Teresita' was discovered in an underground vault; it has now been restored and is the oldest working organ in the world.
People make better films than that now with their mobile phones.
Unfortunately he has never again done something as good as Aniki Bobo, his first real film, and now that he's at the "reverting back to a child" age he probably never will, still he deserves respect.
If you dont stop to smell the roses now they might end up on you!"
:p I have noticed that more and more movies about weed and that stuff is coming now, and this was a good one!
now you may be thinking this is just another senseless weed comedy that goes no where, but in fact you are wrong.
So move on now.
Curly turns to Professor Quackenbush and asks, "Pardon me, what are we eating now?"
Even though it now looks so dated, I mean, no dot coms, facebook or cell phones here, the meat of the story holds true now, as it did in '84.
Nobody knew then or knows now that these things had happened to me.
Im glad I finally found the name and now I will look for its next showing on bravo or IFC.
Michael Dudikoff (in an effectively humorous role the same year he kicked off his B-action career with "American Ninja") and John Stockwell ("Christine", "My Science Project", and now a director of motion pictures) play Marlowe Chandler and Phillip Hammer - a couple of real dicks!
For some years now he has been by himself as his partnership with Tommy Chong ended.
This show made kids use their minds and imaginations as opposed to most of the cartoon or mind numbing shows that are on now.
I wish I could find some toys and memorabilia to buy, all of the shows that were on when I was little were so much better than the majority of stuff now.
It is indeed a pity that these very talented comics are all but forgotten now.
Sort of spoiler coming up now...
In the picturesque 1930's English countryside "I Capture the Castle" tells the story of an eccentric family in a decrepit, murky and leaky old castle that is now a shadow of its former majestic self, as is the father of the family.
Jump quite a bit ahead to a now remarried Mortmain who lives in the still unrestored castle with his new, young, artist wife, Topaz (the beautiful, funny and accomplished Tara Fitzgerald) and his two teenage daughters, an appropriately mischievous little son and a sort of retainer in farm clothes, young Stephen.
The family is now, as the English say, "on their uppers."
Like Star Trek's "Let That Be Your Last Battlefield," which I also used to think was obvious and beneath me, this one now wows me.
Perhaps it's because what was once so obvious about what "might be," to a young person (oh the evils that await us in the near future, yawn), now virtually IS.
What was once totalitarianism in other places is now happening in the United States of America.
Moving on..the shrunken head billionaire (Who I'll call Southern Shrunk-Head from now on because of his annoying Southern accent) orders some Chinese food (the box of food is tiny too, to match his tiny head) and gets angered at this one security guard because the electricity goes out.
The clown faced and the small-headed dude were kind of silly characters, now I know why small-headed dude wore a mask, because his head is too small.
It's sad but unsurprising to me that the American economy is in shambles right now.
Its totally up to date with any metal music out there now if not better.
Also that house they filmed it in, i've seen it before and it was my dream house, but now i'd be too scared to step into it so i guess the movie was somewhat effective.
He leaves and she still looks for, everybody now, the swarthy Mediterranean type with one heck of a schnoz.
I first saw this movie a year after it came out, it was 1989, i was 14, and i have never been so scared in my life, I've just watched it again, and while its still scary i am now 32.
Its main thread is an interweaving of extensive interview segments with several sets of ardently religious parents, including former House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt and his wife, those of a young man from a long line of Lutheran pastors, and the parents of the first openly gay bishop, and the son of an endearing old church-going couple, on the subject of their personal experiences raising gay children, and we see the perspectives on those stories through interviews with those children, now grown.
Other variations are either just as heartfelt or they complement what the rest now see themselves has having been before they realized what being a Christian truly means.
Wes Craven, Francis Coppola, Stanley Kubrick and now, Martin Scorsese, have all made heartwarming human interest stories and f____d in the head descents into movie madness.
Well, in the past year or two, I've had my eyes opened as to the time and effort it takes to make even the smallest of movies and there's a movie out now that will help everyone to understand the independent film maker and what it takes to make a movie on your own, it's called Horror Business.
I am watching this movie now and beside myself at how poor the casting was in this film, it is terribly and terrificly acted by most with maybe the exception of Tina's sister, a virtually unknown actress, maybe the actors have no comedic timing, but Pare specifically makes on camera acting mistakes I haven't seen since on camera acting 101, she is unbelievably plastic and lacks any emotive qualities whatsoever, there are no layers or dimensions in her character structure whatsoever her likability is nil, I'm watching a train wreck by a director who should've taken more care with his film instead of just collecting a paycheck which is what this film looks like
I will now list reasons for your time & effort to source this feature: 1.THE most ludicrous dialogue ever committed to film 2.Hopeless action/fight scenes that don't even look rehearsed(Comic genius) 3.The cop who's story is being filmed acts in a supporting role 4.No films like this will ever be made again(Un-PC) 5.Duvall has THE worst undercover costume ever(Wig & tashe) 6.The main villain is called "Sweet William" 7.It has possibly the most ridiculous chase scene ever with a bus-load of innocent civilians dragged into one mans vendetta & after all the effort to chase him, in order to kill him, they just thump him in the gut and leave him alone!...I could go on forever..."the learning to shoot with his left hand" scenes are pure gold, as is the "Until they kill me" line delivered with possibly the worst Brooklyn/Irish hybrid accent you ever heard.
"Badge 373" occupies quite an important position in the "Cop Movie" pantheon.It has obvious similarities to "The French Connection" but lacks TFC's sheer energy and inventiveness.It broke new ground in showing the cop / hero as a distinctly unpleasant person - something "The Shield" has made a virtue of.Your cop could now be dirty(Dirty Harry wasn't actually "dirty" was he),unprepossessing,inarticulate and amoral.Mr Robert Duval created a pugnacious objectionable ignorant cop we aren't supposed to admire,but one that we can believe in.He has been corrupted by the world he moves in and works by its rules,not those of respectable society.He is a wreck of a man,like "The Bad Lieutenant".
Being a slightly big comic book fan at the time (even bigger now) I took a peak at these weird looking comics.
I've put if off for a while now, but I put it in last night, and I was immediately brought back to that same type of infatuation with drawing.
This documentary, apparently now 11 years old, will leave you wanting to find out more about this family.
Which makes him a great story teller as well as an artist that now enjoys accolades from museums around the world.
With the movie fresh in my mind I want to put out this message to all the people who have made depreciating statements such as "what is Crumb moaning about, he's famous now", "the Sixties weren't really like that", "it was just two hours of whining, rambling and unjustified complaining" etc.
Maybe now is the time for her "revival."
(the other one is the now forgotten DANGEROUS).
Of course 2 million dollars is nothing for a movie budget today, but back in 1938 it was the equivalent of what would now be about 40 million dollars.
There are several astonishing moments: the wedding night sequence with Shearer and a somewhat frigid but endearingly shy Robert Morley; the costume party and blind man's bluff game with Shearer and Reginald Gardiner which becomes deliciously provocative; and of course, the final scenes with an imprisoned Shearer who has by now aged so severely she is barely recognized by lover Tyrone Power.
I so enjoyed the movie that my plans for tomorrow have come to a screeching halt, as now I plan on going to see the 2006 Marie Antoinette.
It is lavish, staggering grandeur that perfectly represents the golden days of Hollywood and I am sure it still will attract and amaze the viewers many years from now.
I just saw this on Turner Classic Movies (TCM), and from now on, Norma Shearer is the face I will put on Marie Antoinette.
The casting of Norma Shearer in the title role -- one of the perks of being married to Irving Thalberg who had had this movie in production for more than a year before its release in 1938 and was in many ways the person above Louie B. Mayer -- is a bit of an irony since she at the time was considered the Queen of MGM, now its Widow, at the height and end of her acting career.
We're now able to see her talent for ourselves, thanks largely to Turner Classic Movies, and Norma Shearer's star is rising again.
This is indeed so terrifying and real it tops a scene like the one in Clockwork Orange with the assault on the writer; it's somehow even more shocking when its in an apartment in the now, with hoodlums as random and sadistic as the ones here.
I guess by now you could call this movie a "classic."
Most people want justice, and they want it now....which is what this movie preaches.
Bronson as well as director Michael Winner and writer Brian Garfield touched a raw nerve in "Death Wish" with the American people in big cities under siege like no other movie ever did before and, now some 30 years later, after.
Nobody can doubt now that Charles Bronson's "Death Wish" was not only a major milestone in films about urban crime but also a major milestone in what the public thinks about crime and what's best to do to stop it.
The criminals in the film are not overly sympathetic either, most of them clearly hippies or other social undesirables, probably hooked on drugs from their "free love" days and now stuck in the bitter reality of narcotic dependency now that the good times are over.
This film alludes the life of a brat from Nagoya, problem teenager from a dysfunctional family, to the life of a former movie actress from the 1930s who is now suffering from Alzheimer's disease.
So it's a perfect ending for Elizabeth--her unattractive, preachy first husband is now permanently out of the way and she can look forward to a more satisfying marriage with the handsome and agreeable Lawrence.
Until now.
I do not know how many times I have seen this movie along my life, maybe ten times, but it still attracts me and now I have just seen it for the first time on DVD.
It flows, it jumps, it's liquid, now it interrupts jarringly.
There is much to admire in this film and thankfully it now has a DVD release with a commentary by the Director and star.
Strange that he won the Peace prize for his work with DNA, but let's push logic aside for now.
A year later, Fonda returns and Davis is ready to apologize and pick up where they had left off--only to find out that Fonda is now married.
Thankfully Warner Brothers has released "The Late Show" on DVD (now if only Fox could release "Harry and Tonto" on DVD).
They obviously can't do it right or they'd have it down by now.
Fonda goes north and returns after a while to New Orleans with Margaret Lindsay who he is now married to.
She won her second Oscar for Best Actress in this film and as her aunt who occasionally gives her a reality check every now and then Fay Bainter was named Best Supporting Actress of 1938.
go see it now!
It's always hard to figure out where the movie exists in the Godzilla canon (there are basically four eras: The first two movies, the movies after that up until the initial series ended in 1975, then the revivial in the eighties that began with Godzilla 1985 and ended with Godzilla Vs. Destroyah, and now this film), but it seems to begin another era of G-films, with no apparent links to any of the other ones, other than the original movie Gojira.
Also, with Olivia's (and now Chloe's) popularity, the movie would surely be a strong seller.
Julia is a widow, who resides up in the mountains with her two daughters, but now low on cash she does her best to sell cakes during the Xmas holidays.
Let's put it this way, my girlfriend and now wife both love dogs.
With 3 kids (now 16, 13, 11) I have seen a lot of kids movies over the years, this one is pretty funny!
Filmed pretty much all on location around Los Angeles in a stunning verite style by Bert Glennon, the film has some truly stunning nightscapes with some very inventive lighting and tells the tale of Steve Lacey(Gene Nelson), an ex con, but a good guy at heart, who is now married to the stalwart Ellen(Phyllis Kirk) and is successfully going straight.
May I bang my head on a wall now?
Not so bad it's good-just so bad like "Can I kill myself now?"
I know it was inevitable, but now they should make a Candyman 4 to end the story, cause it's a shame that THIS CRAP was the end of the series.
The hoary old storyline involving the ex-con, now going straight complete with lovely wife, drawn into, 'one last job', is not the most appealing but do not be put off the super little gem.
This begins to affect Joe badly, especially as it seems that one of those who tried to help with the balloon, Jed, has now developed an obsession with Joe.
This is a terrific film and now available on DVD in a great print.
So it's not so surprising to see it now adapted as a movie.
Go see it now.
They never forgave the betrayal by Douglass, and soon they managed to make the woman's suffrage movement lily white (and rather racist towards the former male slaves who now - theoretically - could vote).
The lesson though was now burned into the heads of the woman's movement - don't ally yourself with other causes.
Yes, there were places like that, Seymour says, now it is less out in the open.
Nelson plays Steve Lacey, an ex-con, now married to the beautiful Kirk.
What Ghost World also holds is mountains and mountains of culture all dating way back to the 1960's Bollywood films and the 1970's underground music which is so satisfying to see now as so many people my age don't comprehend or care for, they prefer trash that MTV spits in our faces and know we'll love it and buy but the thing is, because the majority is rather culturally inept and likes anything dating from 2001 to modern times, leaves the other types left out, where do they go?
Once a minuscule farming suburb of the state's capital, it's now a breeding ground for new subdivisions, factories, stores, gas stations, trailer parks, and businesses.
By now half a dozen Holmeses have caught a veritable busload of Jack the Rippers, not to mention Holmesian imitators like The Alienist or From Hell, so to make that plot work one would need an especially novel and surprising solution for the great detective to unravel.
I just watched the Comfort of Strangers- now that's got a thin plot.
She was the second, and now Holmes has been brought out of his bored lethargy.
I'd add Rupert Everett to the list now.
"What will you do with yourself, Sherlock, now that your Boswell's away," Jenny asks.
And now, it's time you left."
It has taken 3 years for The Grey Zone to arrive on Australian shores, and it has now gone straight to video.
Great to see this kind of film out on general release in British cinemas and now on DVD.
Now, Cap has been out of commission for fifty years, and the Red Skull is now a mysterious, Corleone-esque kingpin.
All this combined with the fact that the Skull is responsible for the deaths of JFK, RFK, and Martin Luther King, and now he plans to use a brain transplant to make the new economically-aware U.S. President his slave.
Feeling he has failed his country, plus realizing his old girlfriend is now old with a family of her own, Cap is a determined, meloncholy hero with nothing to lose.
The Red Skull watched the slaughter of his family as a small boy in the 1930's, and this tramautizing event that led to his transformation into the monster he now is has bittered him over the centuries.
A lot of boring stuff happens as Steve America is carved out of a block of really authentic-looking ice in Alaska; meets Bernie who's now supposedly 66 (I must say she ages extremely well!
My brain hurts now.
I wouldn't want to spoil the film's ending for you so I'll just leave this already too long plot summary now.
Can he stop the Skull now?
The skull is still around and he now looks like a guy with a bad sunburn and he is trying to kidnap the Pres.
As for those of you who share my affinity for comics and bad movies but can't seem to get their hands on this gem, I can only tell you that it's been out of print for more than a decade now and your best bet is to find it at the next comic con in your area or at a flea market that sells bootleg tapes (ditto that for the Fantastic Four movie from '94).
The chase is now reversed as he tries to get back to Confederate lines before the Yankees catch him.
Johnnie races to the general store, which is now a makeshift recruitment office.
She is now their prisoner.
I am embarrassed to admit that I am 23 and this is the first time I've seen this film, however now that I have I will be certain to go out and purchase any Buster Keaton film I can get my hands on.
I was now directly under the concert, hanging out and digging the situation.
So now what to do?
I went to the scaffolding climbed it slid over on to the curtain rod, and now I was center stage directly above the concert.
I have three used T Shirts, a little small for me now, that came in sealed bags and two mint Programmes and a mint Live Aid: The Concert book that came out very shortly after the gig.
*swoon* Oh, what I wouldn't do to go back there, especially since some there that day are gone now.
Those eyes...and she has nude scenes one, too: now that she's about to turn sixty, I'd love to see her reaction watching this one again.
A film about a young ex-cop and now drug abuser and dealer, Paris Pritchert (Peter Facinelli), washed up just shy of 30, working for his dead father's partner, a hardened, corrupt cop.
I now see that it is not available on DVD, so a tape is OK.
And now after seeing it again (it's been YEARS since I last saw it) I can understand why Leonard Maltin and his cronies would say it "takes a wrong turn in space".
everything about this movie shouts quality the effects are superb and even now the basement lab seen with the small ball is visually stunning.
Well up until now he has always defended it and said it was his most personal film, so shame on you Joe for caving in and I for one will quite happily endure this for many years to come.
Watched it again on it's first run on VHS and now I own the DVD.
And now fifteen years later, I still believe it.
And now fifteen years later, I still believe it.
I'm older now, so maybe it's just nostalgia, but if you're into the whole 1980's retro thing, this belongs in your collection with the rest of the Disney-ish buddy movies.
In fact, whenever I see it on now I still enjoy it.
in fact, i understand the ending a little better now.
For years, this old place has been catering to the best Hollywood has to offer, but now, it seems that the "Arms" has been caught up in controversy as well as strange hammering sounds heard in the night.
I'm curious has to how the final sequence was suppose to be played since the scene as it stands now is a bit silly with Jane suddenly better.)
While Tarzan has already made up his mind in keeping Boy with them, the scheming relatives, with the exception of Sir Thomas (Stephenson), now being held captive, have other plans.
This film is now sixty years old but doesn't seem dated or tired.
He'll probably track us all down and sue us now.
Any interest in the movies' characters is SOLELY provided by Krya Sedgwick as the wise-cracking, potty-mouthed sister of the lead actress..can't place her name right now.
Odd to term a 1995 film as an 'older movie', but SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT was rather dismissed in its initial release as a bit of fluff: looking at the film now reveals a tight little message movie garnished with a fine writer (Callie Khouri - 'Thelma and Louise', 'Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood'), and first class director (Lasse HallstrÃ¶m - 'Casanova', 'An Unfinished Life', 'The Shipping News', 'Chocolat', 'The Cider House Rules', 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' etc), and a cast that has not only grown in importance from the time of this film but has also become acknowledged as the creme of the cinema.
Not now.
He is picked up by two Hispanic students from the US (America Ferrara and Jesse Garcia) whose attempt to transport Carlitos is halted at the border - with the little Carlitos hidden under the seat of the now towed away car.
I hadn't seen Kate del Castillo before and will now look for more of her films.
Go see it now so you can recommend it to everyone you know, as I have.
It's just nice to see her beauty - now preserved for ever on DVD.
This is such a tremendous piece that now I must go try to find the original book.
The decision she made years ago to cross the border has now drawn another line between mother and son that she knows may one day be too thick to be erased.
Things are very different now.
Very young guy confined to wheelchair by hysterical paralysis mixed with partial traumatic amnesia produced by the parent-killing car wreck occurring years ago when he was a child meets but of course doesn't recognize young chick who drove the car that caused the accident and is now obsessed with the idea of becoming a paraplegic like him aka like the kid in the car she crashed into.
If you are in your forties now and have been exposed to the Sopranos, by all means see this movie if you missed it originally.
He is perfect as the ex-gangster, who now is in the witness protection program.
While I would've never--not then,probably not now,either--thought this to be anything of great work,it's still a blissfully wonderful comedy.
It's then that Dick and Linda board the plane thats leaving for Cleveland and out of the now wiser and far more confidant, thanks to Humphrey Bogart, with women Allen Felix's life forever.
Humphrey Bogart now knowing that he's no longer needed as Allen's guardian angel then goes back, by disappearing into the cold and foggy night, to Hollywood and movie heaven to the music of "As Time Goes By".
Diane is very pretty in this movie, although I think now she looks rather cruel when she is serious, but man i liked her dresses so much I hardly noticed her acting (sorry, can't help it as a girl).
What we have here is a series of slasher murders being investigated by a very angry cop, he's been on leave for a while since his daughter got killed and now he's back and he uses lots of 4-letter words and goes right into ballistic without even working up to it, whew!
This, of course, is to take nothing away from Irene Dunne, who is first-billed, a talented actress and a genuine box-office draw, but, with the apology of hindsight, it's not Dunne for whom I'm watching this film {just out of interest, this was my eighth Astaire/Rogers film Â now I need only to track down 'The Gay DivorcÃ©e (1934)' and 'Carefree (1938)'}.
While John falls in love with fashion designer Stephaine (Dunne), Haines reacquaints with childhood sweetheart Lizzie Gatz (Rogers), who is now, for show-business purposes, sporting a fake European accent and the prestigious title of Countess Scharwenka.
Regardless, it's a surprisingly involving movie with a mature perspective on love and war, a curio sadly forgotten today and well worth a look now.
If you are thinking about watching this, I suggest you get it now because it's worth every penny.
He's arrogant, he's self-absorbed, extremely egotistical, oblivious to his own failings and glaring incompetence, indulgent in pampering himself with metrosexual treatment every now and then, has an eternal (1) grin and (2) crush on Leila, and never stops torturing his poor alien subordinate Kif who (1) does the real work all the time, (2) gets credit none of the time and (3) takes the blame every time Zapp screws things up (which happens quite often).
The Simpsons looks like it's going down-hill as of right now.
What they are doing now is just completely opposite of what Futurama has done in all of its seasons.
We are now at a time where every cartoon is to childish for an adult, or to mature for a child.
As you know by now, Futurama takes place in the future, so there are robots, aliens, one-eyed aliens that look like regular humans, people from Mars that look like regular people, one hundred sixty year old men, and much, much more.
All of the parties involved now have to decide what course of action to take which will forever alter their lives.
It does now.
Although it's wonderful to see these stars together, it's sad to realize they're all gone now, and that young Harlow has been gone for 68 years.
It should have a real remake except most everybody that was there is probably dead by now so all you'd get is more Hollyworld hogwash.
She suspects that he realizes his true identity now and he realizes that the son she bore is his.
But if anything the movie has actually gotten more poignant over the decades since it's creation: We now live in a world where middle eastern fanatics do indeed shape global events & have shown themselves capable of inflicting apocalyptic events.
if it were remade now) would be really good.
I watched this only about a month ago & really, most of it now escapes me (except for the all-important secret code).
This lead to what is now known as the "Kansas City Massacre" that cost the lives of a number of FBI Agents who were taking Lazetti, who was also killed, to Washington to testify.
I suppose it would be a sin for me to give away how Harry Lime reappears, or even give away the fact that he does, for that matter (though by now I am sure you realize Orson Welles is in this movie and therefore turns out to be alive).
"The Third Man" is a flawless film of intrigue and suspense, a summit of perfection within the genreÂ It is one of the most literate thrillers ever madeÂ It is superb1y acted by an ensemble working in an understated, effortless styleÂ Its cinematography includes some of the best black-and-white work ever doneÂ Its score of haunting zither music is still remembered, instantly familiar to anyone who ever saw the film, and now thorough1y identified with most people's impressions of ViennaÂ Finally, the direction by Carol Reed is exemplaryÂ Rarely has a motion picture represented the collaboration of so many exceptional talents... "The Third Man" may be the greatest film made in Britain since World War IIÂ   The night city terrain of "The Third Man" is unique: occupied postwar Vienna, baroque, bombed-out, decadent, patrolled by Jeeps containing representatives of the four occupying powers, an American, an Englishman, a Frenchman, and a RussianÂ  Corrupt, world-weary people hang about its fringes: the overly suave Rumanian, Popescu; the frayed violinist, Baron Kurtz; the atheistic collector of Catholic antiquities, Dr. Winkel; Crabbit, the tired head of the Anglo Cultural Center; and Anna Schmidt, the Czechoslovakian girl friend of Harry Lime, an obscure actress with forged papersÂ   Moving among them are three extraordinary principals, Holly Martins, a typical Greene creation; a hack American writer; a used- up second-rater; Colonel Calloway, a Scotland Yard type, chief of British Military Police; and Harry Lime (WeIles), the corrupt two-bit racketeer, a fully immoral, totally unreachable villainÂ   These characters wander through rain-slick night streets, in and out of shabby cafÃ©s, over the rubble of bombed-out buildings, even into a terrain vague dominated by a huge Ferris wheelÂ  The Vienna of "The Third Man" is a vast city that seems emptyÂ Its streets are always damp, and water rushes through a system of sweet-smelling sewers underneathÂ It is a world of slinking cats and biting parrots, of people taking advantage of each other without pityÂ   "The Third Man" meets the test of complexityÂ The characters interact, their stories conflict: A man who is supposed to be dead turns up alive, there is a question of whether two men or a "third man" carried off Lime's "body," there are conspiracies, deceits, and double crossesÂ   Reed owes debts to Fritz Long for some of his ideas: the geometrical shots, the montage of evidence, Welles' whistling, etc., but Reed has his own original visual style, particularly his use of a slightly tilted camera to produce so-called "Chinese angles," employed to project danger, foreboding, a twisted universeÂ He is also capable of providing suspense in the tradition of HitchcockÂ   "The Third Man" is unique in the genre for its realismÂ Despite the complexities of plot, the characters are understandable, dimensional, emotionally genuineÂa tribute to the fine ensemble playing and special, low-keyed acting style that is the cinematic equivalent of Graham Greene's writingÂ  Carol Reed was knighted for his excellence as a British filmmaker, and for a body of work that is notable for its good tasteÂ It is this taste, of course, that works so well in "The Third Man," but which has destroyed some of his other films, such as "Our Man in Havana," which require a certain amount of excess to make them workÂ
I never thought much of these guys before, but I now have a much better appreciation of their work since seeing this video.
"A Perfect Murder" is an excellent example of this, as the number of devious characters is increased and the body count is higher, and the denouement which in the original saw a wily police detective resolve matters now has one of those endings in which the heroine puts herself in danger.
Michael Douglas, trying to avoid being typecast as the rich business tycoon he has played a lot of recently, is now a rich business tycoon who tries to kill his wife.
I really don't want to give away any of the story line so I will stop now, but to all fans of Vincent Perez.
But beneath that, there is genuine genius here, the dialogue, humour, acting, eroticism and, most of all, the send-up of the church (it's a shame Islam cannot be so mocked, for Islam now is as insidious as the Church was in the 1700's) is a sheer delight.
In fact his last line about just wanting "to go home now" (spoken to the spectral Viet Cong in the mist after the battle) shows his disillusion with the war.
Like mentioned before, the make-up effects also looked really convincing and are now part of the movie its legacy and status among movie lovers.
It was, indeed, obviously a labor of love, but now, we at least have SOME idea of what the audience saw in 1927...here it is, 2006, and I thought that for it's time, it probably WAS frightening.
The mother finally escapes from the basement, captured in a beautifully executed shot of the former matriarch, now a savage beast, tinted red in the foreground while her stern-looking portrait looms in the background.
His veins now coursing with evil, he covets both his sister and Daniel's sister Christina (Rosario del Pilar), to whom he becomes an aristocratic predator, demanding total servitude from his new vampiric bride ("You are my lord, I am your slave," Christina says most tellingly on her short-lived honeymoon).
And, Breen--who doesn't want to wait until he's discharged in Kentucky, to make a fresh start--now has another reason to stay in Alabama.
Ralston is the daughter of Hugo Haas who plays one of Napoleon's former generals who is now leading a party of French exile settlers who have settled on land granted to them in Demopolis.
Films now are so message-conscience and so full of unappealing, gratuitous nudity and sex, that it's fun to relax with a film that suggests much more than it shows and does it with style and a wink of the eye.
John Woo is a respected director of Hong Kong action movies, who has now turned to Hollywood mainstream.
In which case, you may as well toddle off right now.
I now attribute this movie as my start into movie loving and becoming a connoisseur.
All prerequisites for movies of this type and saying all that I'd usually be complaining by now.
If Travolta attempted this movie now instead of when he did - it wouldn't work.
Chances are anyone else than Travolta in Broken Arrow and you'd be reading a completely different review right now too.
This movie came out in Belgium in 2003 but I waited to see this wonderful movie until now.
I first saw "C'est arrivÃ© prÃ¨s de chez-vous"(Man bites dog) about ten years ago and I was amazed by the whole thing.The darkest humor ever,sick violent scenes,and of course,the Man himself.Poelvoorde plays a violent maniac but he's funny and charismatic at the same time.Fast forward to 2005:I realised there was a new movie with that guy that I've never seen in another film.I didn't know that much about Claude Francois,but I had to see Poelvoorde in another role.Here he plays Bernard FrÃ©dÃ©ric,an ex-imitator of Cloclo.He stopped his "career" in show-business when his wife,VÃ©ro, gave an ultimatum.So now he has a boring job,9 to 5, a son, a "normal" life.
All together now: "Alexandrie, Alexandra", "Des Magnolias Par Centaines!"
My mom was a big fan of the original, so she taped the new series when it aired and I loved every minute of it.They need to put it on DVD now so everyone can see it that hasn't watched it or wants it in their movie collection like I do.
I can't say enough wonderful things about this film, so I'll stop now.
Even though I'm male and got attracted by the promise of frontal nudity, I now find this film strong for totally different reasons.
However I now recall a 1987 direct to video movie filmed in Australia where a bunch of outback lowlifes terrorize a woman then decide to hunt her like prey.
Jittlov can do with 5 million dollars what other filmmakers do with 50 million, and with all the poorly conceived, ineptly produced drek coming out on DVD and on TV, the world NEEDS filmmaker's with the talent, vision(s), and attitude of Jittlov more desperately now than it ever did.
He now cares for his mum in the family home(featured in the film) on welfare, The Hollywood machine chewed this guy up and spat him out(maybe he should of stuck to math language?!).
In this second film version of the hit play by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur The Front Page, New York newspaper reporter Hildy Johnson (played by Pat O'Brien in 1931) is now a sassy, confident woman (Rosalind Russell).
They're divorced now and Russell is fed up and decides she wants a home and children and security and Ralph Bellamy is going to give her all of that.
Also, as the story is now twelve years older than the original play, certain changes occur in Walter's political views.
It is now generally believed that this is the best of the film versions of THE FRONT PAGE, and one of the funniest films ever made.
I can safely confess now that I hadn't ever seen it before, but that's no reason for you to make the same mistake: Go buy/rent it NOW!
In reviewing the achievements of African-Americans on film in chronological order for Black History Month, we're now at 1940 with the entry of The Proud Valley, considered by star Paul Robeson as his favorite.
It's the best Crow movie 'til now in my opinion.
yes you read that right I love these movies the only reason I haven't watched The Crow: City Of Angels (1996) is that I cannot find it no matter where I go this villain is one of those "I want him to die" villains I also had never ever heard of these actors (which they were very good) besides Kirsten Dunst which we all know from Spiderman (this movie is way better) now the plot is The third entry in 'The Crow' series follows Alex Corvis, who was framed for the murder of his girlfriend and is executed.
Bootleg copies of the (now long out-of-print) SGE release have been passed around fandom like pieces of the true cross, and the popularity of the film, as well as it's creator, only grows stronger.
Will we be talking about a "rockumentary" film twenty or thirty years from now featuring performances by "N'Synch", Britney Spears and Red Hot Chili Peppers?
I too would like to view this film to see if it "holds up" over time or would be as laughable as "Action in the North Atlantic" which is only shown now because it has Bogart.
But I'm certain that Warners now owns "China's Little Devils" and hopefully we may one day see a video release of this basically forgotten gem from WWII.
The high rating I give it is based ENTIRELY on what a 9 yr old boy would have rated it back then, but it's all I have right now.
Their father is Fenton Hardy, formerly of the NYPD and now a famous private detective.
The Disney channel used to run all these old shows, but around 2000 just surrendered and now run their new shows on the cable network.
Watching it now I was pleasantly surprised by the high quality of the performances by the child actors; especially Campbell and Kirk.
So now the gold and pieces of eight all belong to Applegate.
The chest is here but wait...now where are those gold dubloons and pieces of eight?"
Elfen Lied has nothing to fear now, it still probably can top this.
There are FOUR of them now.
NOW.....I now return you to your regularly scheduled 'blind hate.'
I'm watching this right now, and it's decent.
Breaking again into a young woman's apartment in order to satisfy his now out of control and inflamed libido Tony ends up getting caught when she escapes from his clutches.
A few years ago, I find myself travelling through South-East Asia, at one point trying to piece together a baffling series of events that resulted in the genocide of a third of Kampuchea, or Cambodia as we now call it.
His work, unlike my simple desire for knowledge, would provide momentum for confessions and now a war crimes tribunal.
Executions followed three levels of torture at S.21, a school building in Phnom Penh converted into a concentration camp (and now a memorial visitors centre).
One of the hardest things, even now, is these perpetrators see themselves also as victims.
The small town where it is set may now be as obsolete as 25 cent gasoline.
Is it less relevant now?
Seeing American Gaffitti now is a curious experience.
She was fooled by idiot Cruise the first time, now she is fooled by a 10 year old.
The film takes place in 1962 California, a pre JFK assassination which showed the innocence of youth crusin' the streets and talking to buddies outside of their windows as they drive; now, in today's world it's a bloodbath.
Terry who thinks he is a reject is now proved that he is a man as he cruises the streets with the girl on his arms, and just trying to prove that even nerds have their moments as well.
Thirty years from now, people will still be looking back on this and remembering how much of a superb film it was, and how many fine films it inspired!!!
Incredibly stupid game shows, which try to force people to call and to give money for nothing, like for example: "Yes now you can win even more, tell me when do you have birthday!...
Moritz Bleibtrau (now definitely laying claim to being the most interesting actor working today - just look at his resume for the last 9 years) gives a tour de force as Reiner.
I can see this film challenging the majority of so called masterpiece films in the theater right now, probably putting most of those films to shame.
Each event in the mini-series seems timeless and not easily forgotten, as I write this now, five months after I last saw THE CORNER, all I can think of is a shoot-out in the latter half of the story.
I would really like to know how DeAndre is doing now.
I love the book as well as the series It couldn't have been done any better I really felt these people's pain.Does anyone know how Fran DeAndre Tyreeka or DeAnte are doing now.
The most striking moment comes when the most focused-upon couple, who've previously experienced sexual problems, talk to each other after a bout of now satisfying sex and tell each other that they are now "real" - two less "real" people you'll have trouble finding in the history of the cinema.
The Language of Love is little more now than a historical document, and a testament to how self-deluding the experts in pseudo-sciences can get as they pretend to serious encouragement of a healthy loving sex life whilst adding to the creation of a culture of voyeurism and conformity.
now i only wish that i had gotten a chance to see this limited release movie in theaters.
The fact that we now know that the real threat of invasion had already passed by that stage no one knew for sure at the time that such was the case.
With its timeless tale of the power of the ordinary person it is a film that speaks even now.
In fact, the immediate threat of invasion had, by now, abated.
My DVD is a little faded now.
You're already paying for the actors, you have the crew, etc... now how about a decent story!
Leatherface character is now a legend in horror movies.
Actually.....I kind of want to hurl right now just thinking about it.
Why did they make leatherface to where he came from another family, he is just as psycho as the rest, now there is the thought that maybe they raised him to be psycho and he may have been OK if they hadn't?
From the Texas remake, till now, the scriptwriters successfully figured out how to turn the real antagonist in the movie into a lame blow-hard, but Ermey makes the most of his paycheck, plunging into the horrible dialogue, encouraging Thomas to do the horrific until there's no point of return.
Andrew Byrinasli or however you spell it, is cool now because he is the first person ever to play Leatherface twice now, go Andrew.
Fast forward to 1969, where little Tommy is now 30 years old, face covered virtually all the time with a dingy blue scarf, and of course he is employed at the local slaughterhouse where he's referred to in usually hush tones as "retard".
The little town down in Texas is now a ghostville USA because of the plant closing and the only inhabitants left are the deranged Hewitt clan (sounds just like Michigan under Governor Granholm-LOL).
I for one am glad that movies like TCM the beginning come out now and again to the same Criticisms that should be praised rather than scored, but then again i am of a generation that applauds the blood, and Gratuitous violence and dreary depression or horror, instead of going eeewww thats gross!
Looking back now, in 2005, it still holds up as entertainment, and sleazy entertainment at that, but the ending is too routine, insulting and oh-so-typical of the genre; it's the "trick 'em at the end" leg-puller where the murderer is revealed to be the most stupid of characters and you can't believe the film's ended on such a low note.
We are introduced to a character, Frank Keller, that just achieved 20 years in service, that can't see really something after the retirement (that is what he hears of a lot, about the retirement) and that not long before he had a divorce (one the guys from his job is now with his ex-wife.
Now, I have seen only De Palma's Scarface and Sea of Love (just yesterday I saw it for the very first time), I think Pacino is just f****** great as Tony Montana and just good as Frank Keller, never really great, he entertains just like the film itself and certainly this performance is extremely far to be one of his best (from the IMDb biography of Pacino: "It marked the second phase of Pacino's career, being the first to feature his now famous dark, owl eyes and hoarse, gravelly voice").
I do not know how many times I have seen this movie since the release in the movie theaters, then on VHS and now on DVD.
There was "Dead Calm," "To Die For," "Cold Mountain," "Eyes Wide Shut," and now this.
First caught this back in 2003, own the DVD now and still impressed by this indie flick.
Too bad Martha was part of a non-artistic scene and now she isn't considered for her acting skills but for her slutty attitude and physical attributes.
It is extremely unfortunate that more attention was focused on the now infamous bath scene between Kidman and Cameron Bright.
The complaints here really are saying that WE cannot see a drastic difference in appearance, which we could expect now.
One explanation points at something that began almost innocuously -- a seed -- but has grown to such size that it is now using computers as a way to filter its way through and walk among us.
Do we have to worry now.
For a while now, I've been trying to find Kiyoshi Kurosawa's Korei (aka.
The so-called opera scene will be, years from now, considered a seminal moment in her career.
I didn't think Kairo was scary in the slightest, the whole internet thing was laughable & as for scary you should see some of the penis enlargement pop-up ads I get, now that's scary!
I've watched it twice now, and it's just as good the second time around.
I felt my skin crawl so many times, and the movie has been haunting my thoughts for days now.
But, Sam insists that he's committed to Hunting now and that what the brothers do makes a difference in the world.
Every now and then to spice things up, Kosugi puts in an appearance and it's no coincidence that these episodes are the best of the series which sans his presence is somewhat pedestrian at best.
In the first part of this "movie" comprised of episodes 9 and 10 from the 1980's action series, "The Master," that dynamic ninja duo of Max Keller (Timothy Van Patten) and John Peter McAllister (Lee Van Cleef), find themselves in a pickle as McAllister, aka The Master, is framed for attempted murder of an old war buddy of his, now an intelligence officer.
He remember Lee in all the spaghetti westerns and would laugh that the villain of the cowboys was a good guy ninja now.
*** Some spoilers from now on *** The movie is a total mess.
On the eve of World War II, Brent who is now a big time industrialist meets Welles who is now in his Kessler persona.
It is very hard now to see Castro in New York City addressing the UN.
So, come on, all you others you think it sucks, please speak up now :-)  Guess I'll have to check out Wikipedia to find out what this guy really did.
If it would have, Soderbergh would have became a persona non Grata back in the states by now for having made a Marxist propaganda flick.
We see Che being interviewed by CBS TV reporter Lisa Howard, Julia Ormond, about how he and his good friend and now Cuban Premier Fidel Castro, Demian Bichir, were able to pull off the impossible!
The movie switches from high contrast and newsreel-like black and white to vivid color as were shown the circumstances that lead Che, as well as Fidel, to the exalted positions that they now occupy.
It's in the Sierra Maestra's where the revolutionaries gain in strength by recruiting the local peasants, who have no use for Bitista, into their now swelling ranks.
It's now the late fall of 1958 and Che-now Fidel Castro's right-hand man-despite his acute asthmatic condition, he's always falling behind and passing out during the fighting because of it, ends up leading his men to victory in the final stages of the Cuban Revolution.
The movie "Che" tries to be neutral in what it wants us to think of Che but comes across a bit disingenuous in overlooking, or air brushing out, most of the serious accusations of lynch mob-like show trials and summery executions, of members and supporters of the now ousted Bitista Regime, by Castro & Che's out of control guerrilla army that-in early 1959-were floating around at the time!
But now, you can only view the film only in two volumes of equal length now, and this review is concentrated on Part One otherwise subtitled as The Argentine.
Now, he returns to those roots with recent projects The Good German, Bubble, The Girlfriend Experience and now Che.
Why Che Guevara, and why now?
Of course, the icon that I refer to is quite obviously Cuban revolutionist Ernesto 'Che' Guevara here played by Benicio Del Toro, a figure now embellished upon the memories of those with slightest interest in political history.
Granted, focus is shifted every now and again to set up part two's inevitable centralization upon Che himself, but for the most part, Part One remains more as a wide-angled view on the movement in which Guevara was part of.
A sometimes bitty, sometimes brilliant hand-held epic that succeeds in its failure to fall into the consumer culture camp that's exploited Ernesto 'Che' Guevara's image now for so long.
The bookies might as well pay out now.
So now they are part of the growing revolution, but the two men seem to have their ups and downs on who really is in-charge here, as the Mexican peasant actually relies on the European cowboy most the time.
This is the second best game ever only beaten by Final Fantasy VII me and my brother disagree now again he thinks that Final Fantasy VII is the best game ever which I agree with on some points but, the ending for this game is the best.
The first sex-horror film!claimed the tagline.Well for that matter,Murnau's "Nosferatu" came first.Claude Mulot's script is thin,mean and lacks humor and substance.A poor man's "les yeux sans visage" indeed.But it manages to retain some -minor - interest.The castle where a lady who was disfigured in a fire (Duperrey) is waiting for a doctor who will give her back her beauty;but this man's methods -blackmailed by the lady's husband - are illegal to say the least for he needs warm young flesh,well you know the score.We never see the lady's horrible face ,only her eyes -like Rosemary's baby- ,and there's a lot of camera taking first-person point of view.Two sinisters dwarfs appear now and then .Claude Mulot sometimes manages to create a dreamlike atmosphere,but once again,his script is really half-backed.
This is the second best game ever only beaten by Final Fantasy VII me and my brother disagree now again he thinks that Final Fantasy VII is the best game ever which I agree with on some points but, the ending for this game is the best.
Now, this doesn't pack too much of a punch because every movie in the world does this now.
So on one hand, you have a little blonde kid saying "Great, we have a team full of (insert racial slurs here) and now a girl!"
An on form Walter Matthau stars as Morris Buttermaker, a now washed up ex minor league player who, prompted by a financial carrot, becomes manager of a multi-racial team of Little League misfits.
A former minor-league pitcher (The late Oscar-Winner:Walter Matthau), who is now a pool cleaner and he's also a grumbling beer-guzzling man.
Matthau is good in the lead, O'Neal is amusing as Matthau's former father figure and now coach.
Even though I would've hated him if I'd known him in school, I now admire the spunk and tenacity of Tanner.
Watching this classic again now that I am well into my thirties reminds me just how bland and painfully sanitized movies of today are.
Coaching the team is ex-minor league pitcher Morris Buttermaker (Walter Matthau), now reduced to cleaning pools and drinking himself into semi-consciousness.
I identified with Lupus, which is probably why I winced through the movie watching it in a theater in 1976 and embrace it now.
Both are now deceased and I finally took a view at the DVD this week after not having seen it in more than 2 decades.
What was inappropriate for 1976 is now intolerable, and deservedly so.
Buttermaker is a has been baseball player and now an alcoholic, he is given the job of a little league coach for the Bears since no other fathers are taking the job.
I had first played this game in the year 2000 and i thought then, what a great game, now, almost 7 years on i still think it is one of the best RPG games.
The children's use of even mild profanity would never be permitted now in a "family film," and the wonderful scene at the end would certainly send the Thought Police running for their placards and boycotts.
Darn if my timing isn't just SO coincidental with the Eliot Spitzer mess, but no one here looked anything like 'Kristen', Ashley Alexandra Dupre, or whatever name she might be using right now.
If you have never played this game, go out and get it now!
I hope John and Mike can find a distributor to get the film into the hands of people who can be impacted by its beautiful message---and now that the epilogue will be more grand than the last time I viewed it, I can't wait to see it again!
As a former supporter of the notion of civil unions I now realize that is simply a term of appeasement, not a term of equality.
After time you learn to accept and forget the want to say in front of your loved ones and the world that you are gong to marry the man you love and be able to legally call someone your husband though that is what I call my boyfriend now.
I hope my partner and I will soon be able to marry here in California and I am now going to be more proactive about making that happen in part due to the inspiration I gained from watching this film.
It is a worthy addition to the Final Fantasy family, and i'm looking forward to conquering it (on disc 4 now)
I was in Boston while that was all happening, and I'm kicking myself now for not participating in any of the rallies.
I've been a single mother for 14 years now, and my son is generally viewed as quirky and shy rather than disabled: only time will tell how well he will do in the world.
And now I'm 14 yrs old now.
Squaresoft's (now Square-Enix) highly anticipated "Final Fantasy VIII" released in February of 1999 in Japan, and later in September 1999 for the United States and Europe.
While the characters in the Dr. Kildare films are quite likable as is the dialog, a major problem in some of the early films in the series is that Kildare just doesn't behave very logically and yet the films work out in the end (sort of like Curious George, now that I think about it).
There, he finds that his dad is working himself to exhaustion because a nearby town has lost their doctors and so he now has a ton of new patients.
To try and explain it right now is very hard, not because of a complex plot or difficult scenario: but because whatever I say will not compare to how much of a masterpiece it really is.
It's definitely un-flawed, and people are now starting to realise exactly what's so good about the 8th chapter in the Final Fantasy saga.
Melissa Gilbert plays an ex actress now married to a prominent producer.
I feel they should have changed the storyline and made her a has been successful movie star trying to make a comeback, utilise some of her character acting abilities and explore the insecurities of a women who had it all and now faces a ageist community like Hollywood which remembers stars for their more famous roles, like Charlie's angels "closer to half a century ago".
At one point this was basically my favorite movie, but now it's just one of my favorite movies.
Martin Brice (Redford) now goes by the alias of Martin Bishop.
Fast forward to the nineties and Hershberger has now grown up to be Robert Redford and heading a security firm under an alias.
Before long Redford and his crew are in conflict with his former college prankster now all grownup and played by Ben Kingsley.
Of course, some hacking techniques are commonplace and outdated now, but it is still engrossing to see these acts in action.
Back then, to think that a chip that can control the world was preposterous, but now, with almost everything microchip-controlled, and the ubiquity of the Internet, that thought is not too farfetched.
Seven years have passed since this movie came out, which is a long time in the gadget world in which this film is based, but none of their equipment or techniques (except a brief glimpse of a now outdated version of Windows but that's REALLY nitpicking) seem out of date; it could still be today.
Anything made now would have to be far more glamorous and unrealistic.
Now we come full circle so to speak , we've made Baattle Galactica again , Star Trek in Dec , and more are coming out , Land of the Lost and V: The Second Coming , so why is Hollywood afraid of remaking Space:1999 , with today's technology and the use of more nuclear devices , doesn't it seem more real to remake Space:1999 with a possible return flight to the Moon , call it Space:2020 or Space:2112 the future is now people , it's here before us .
The three Beverly Hills cops also reprise their roles here but the Lieutenant (now promoted to Captain) only has a couple of scenes and it is really totally unbelievable that Murphy's character and the Captain are discussing going on a fishing trip (could you even picture Murphy with a fishing rod?)
All the episodes are now provided on shiny DVD's for the enjoyment of all who remember or have come to like the series over it's 30 years existence.
Written and directed by people who should've known better, "Doctors' Wives" was considered pretty heavy stuff in its day (the first time it ran on network TV, there was a "parental discretion" warning preceding the movie), but its 'raciness' is now rather quaint.
That is to say, any audience of its day, since it's now a fascinating freak of unspeakably wretched period cinema, way more fun and thought-provoking for what it gets wrong, than what the same year's highly regarded, and similarly set, "The Hospital" once seemed to get right.
That one, from the over-rated Paddy Chayefsky, was a deliberate satire of medical professionals that now seems smug and obvious.
Twenty years later in the unfolding story it becomes indeed a razor's edge on which to tread when former wife Elizabeth again encounters John, who is now known as Erik Kessler, middle aged, graying, and has difficulty getting around.
But now, after nineteen years of their estrangement, reality has set in for both: Elizabeth has a family to care for, a present obligation which takes precedence, and John too has the responsibility of a young adopted daughter, Margaret (Natalie Wood).
John, now known as the elderly Erik Kessler, talked of the future's promise that lay ahead for Elizabeth, of how she had a good life in the present and was needed by others.
Nevertheless, as I look at it now, I see it as a charming film from another era.
You know the drill by now.
Bruno Mattei is dead now, which probably means that this was it.
This being from 2003 and with certain laws now in place, I actually didn't expect to see ANY real animal violence, so I was surprised to see one scene here where a lizard has its throat cut and is gutted.
Flynn was a tragic figure, a larger then life adventurer and lover who 's reputation, after death, naturally, was smeared by a several books, now proved to be false.
If that doesn't make you want to rent or buy now, let me mention it has a wonderful plot.
Eventually he loses his job, his car is repossessed, and now he lives with his social deviants in a cheap, run-down apartment in a bad neighborhood.
Since this is now out on DVD, none of you have any excuse for not having seen it.
It looks a shade dated now (20 years on), but still packs quite a punch.
The senior Dawson, now nearly insane with grief, launches an all-out war against Golgo 13, employing the most vicious and lethal professionals that his bottomless coffers can procure, including horrific ex-military sociopaths, crooked intelligence officials, and an unspeakably terrifying monster of a man who rightly goes by the moniker "Snake," all while Togo hops the globe carrying out other "jobs."
He now carries bigger weapons, talks with more confidence and wants to go on Foley's adventures.
Today I have watched "Identity" for the second time in less than two months, now on DVD.
I've seen The Emperor's Candlesticks twice now and I'm still trying to figure it out.
At the time, it might have been cutting edge but now, it's more of a documentary.
They are now the status quo, and anyone who isn't aware of this merely needs to tune in to Bill O'Reilly for the latest pablum bought and paid for by the PR spin machine.
20 years from now people in Russia will watch this movie, having a hard time to believe these types of movies were popular in Russia.
Reunited with his "brother" from the original Brat, played by Victor Sukhorukov, Danila runs, shoots and blows up things - now THIS side of the Pond.
Though it's about an opera star who meets an old love (now a produce man), singing is confined to a few dramatic moments, including the climax.
What are they up to now?
hey buddy I'm rooting for ya, what are you up too now?
Stuck in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean some 1,500 miles from the nearest land, the African Continent, Holmes has to now choose those who can help make it to shore and those who are just dead weight and have to be thrown overboard in order for the rest to survive.
"Seven Waves Away" now ranks among one of my favorite films of all times.
It is a real film about honest events and the truth behind humanity, it speaks further truth now, and would make for a great re-interpretation if not Hollywood-ized too much.
I haven't seen the cartoon of Dennis the menace, but saw the movie as a kid and thought it was good back then,but watching it now i have realized how boring it is.
With a cast that included Walter Matthau, Christopher Lloyd, Joan Plowright and Lea Thompson, I was sure this would provide laughs for me now as an adult, as well.
Murphy again makes the most of culture shock for comic effect, and the easy rapport between Murphy and Billy (Judge Reinhold), now a cheerfully over the top Rambo-esquire figure, is still the centerpiece of this series.
It should keep fans of the cartoon amused as well as thrill young kids who may not have ever heard of Dennis before now.
Everyone is friends now after the events of the first movie.
A New York City now long vanished became an active part of the supporting cast.
Connoisseurs of period mystery should especially treasure THE PENGUIN POOL MURDER for its location shots of some now vanished (or at least radically transformed) Manhattan landmarks - most notably the then New York City Aquarium (long before the institution decamped to Brooklyn).
The building at Battery Park, at the tip of Manhattan, has since lost its roof and interior to be returned to its original (now landmarked) form as the actual battery (a fort - "Castle Clinton") which protected New York Harbor in the early 1800's.
The Park contains - directly in front of the former Aquarium - the most eloquent and complete memorial the tragedy of 9/11/01 could possibly have: the "fractured globe" which originally sat in the Plaza between the Twin Towers - now with an "eternal flame" at its base.
I wonder where she is now.
Man, now isn't that just an honest shame?
The ravishing Nathalie (Sarelle - she'll later star alongside Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct) is the sole survivor of one of the maniacs' nightly attacks and now they're after her.
It's also educational for me, we watched it in high school two years in a row, now isn't that awesome?
And now, an excerpt from the film,   "Skies, huh?"
I almost swallowed my tongue, spat out my drink twice almost peed myself and watched it so many times I know the script even now 10 years on I still laugh it my friends eternal Harry and Lloyd...
For all of you that say this movie is not funny, you must be crazy, this is the best comedy ever, with the best performances in the careers for daniels and jim carrey if you haven't seen this movie yet go out right now and movie i promise it wont dissapoint
Hard to believe that they apparently had a hard time raising money for this, but now it seems to have all been worth it.
When Czechoslovakia was loosening up ten years later, a number of quality movies were produced before the Soviet crackdown, and now that China is, if not being internally liberated, at least sliding sideways into the global village, we're beginning to see some admirably done Chinese films.
Right now, they don't get it.
But I am so happy that I now know the name of it.
On the micro level, the writing has dashes of clever insight into human interiors: a sigh from master Ali, Muharrem's employer: "now I am the idiot's secretary" , and the order's counsel Rauf's revelation in "take this watch, brother; it keeps time precisely; it is made by the heathen".
The authority he is endowed with now makes him haughty and difficult to deal with, while his accumulated frustration increasingly throws him into literal fits.
This could have been far far worse and due to the few stylish scenes and images in the film, it is not too impossible to sit through, and in fact, I've watched this two times now.
I've seen this film only twice now but I like it a lot, despite Stockwell's somewhat goofy performance as a low-key but "sinister" Wilbur.
An ex-street-thug, now turned priest, is the main suspect in a murdercase, in which a girl gets killed by a mad painter.
It's not like the garbage thats over hyped now a days.
have been conducting a torrid affair of their own for a number of years now.
Ever the gemutlich gentleman, Welles keeps his cards close to his vest, even when talking about the "situation overseas" with the strapping lad he now realizes is his son, who wants to enlist in the Canadian Air Force.
Last-- you come to the Police teams and the unexplained problem of dead homeless people-- and now you have a Mystery.
It's now 35 years later and Neeley now a retired L.A police chief is found murdered in his home with it made to look like it was some kind of mob hit.
Having just seen a "restored" theatrical print a couple of months ago and now having seen the new DVD, I can say that it is virtually flawless.
The last remaining Battlestar (Galactica) is now in search of the lost 13th tribe, from it's known origin, which split from the original group & has no known location.
THE LOST WARRIOR: I liked this episode, with Apollo (Richard Hatch), stranded on a planet due to his viper running out of fuel, and finding himself pitted against a Cylon (called Red Eye by the planet locals) who was also stranded on the planet, but with memory loss, and now being commanded by a local gangster-type on the planet.
If you don't know the history of the show by now... ABC canned it, despite well above average ratings.
Then there's that long dusty road at film's end, leading off into a great unknown that Alyosha must now travel.
As a feminist, I feel that I should be deploring this movie right now.
The finale makes you think "I hope Violet will have a really better life now".
Seeing it now I could feel the nags and the amazement when experiencing Malle's audacity.
Actually, now that I think about it, I think I like the fact that the film allows me to be disturbed on my own rather than hitting me over the head and telling me how I should feel (as Hollywood always does).
The film had only been available in Germany and Russia before now.
But now they're asian!
A step-brother and step-sister can marry, so can two first cousins (now people of the same sex can marry), but not a step-parent and child.
A supposed war victim and gone for years after his marriage to her, Wells - despite now having a beard and aging a bit - would still be recognizable (at the least, audibly) to his former wife.
But now they face the reality of losing the war and with it losing Earth and humanity itself.
From the great Malcolm McDowell as Admiral Towlwyn(he played the bad guy in Star Trek:Generations), John Rhys-Davies as Paladin(hes playing Gimli in the LOTR movies right now), Tom Wilson(Biff from Back to the Future)as Maniac, a up-beat pilot whos a fan favorite.
should try to find this game now and buy it.
In conclusion, even though it can also be seen on Nick at Nite now, I strongly recommend you catch it before it goes off the air for good.
Meanwhile, the boy - now 11 and living in an orphanage - runs off to New York City somehow figuring that magically, through hearing music, he'll meet his parents.
I am now seventy-nine years of age.
This show is easily one of the very worst shows I have ever seen in my entire life and as much as I want to say it is the #1 worst show ever made I'm not sure that's true because there have been some other awful shows but right now I can't think of anything I'm sure is worse than Comedy Inc.
I now live out on the streets, typing this review on a laptop I fashioned out of some old pizza boxes and dead cat hair.
I'm now off to the park, where I plan on mugging and raping some innocent jogger.
Welles, crippled, aged, bearded, wearing thick glasses and sporting an even thicker accent comes to town to work for Brent, never dreaming that his former wife is now Brent's spouse.
Amos Poe has some kind of Alt -street cred, although now I can't remember for what.
I understand now (I already liked it a lot) what a massive achievement Ghost Dog is.
I have longed to see this series again and think 26 years is too long to have to wait ... the series now belongs to that era of classic video-taped programmes that we no longer see.
Having greater exposure to the entitlement attitudes of privileged, self-promoting families in politics and history, I now find the salacious aspects of the Borgias' story not only likely, but an intriguing part of the psychological whole.
Enter Anthony, a 28 but younger looking gay man, who's been a member of Act Up but who is now more interested in spending his time with affluent gal pal Izzie and perhaps getting into the pants of some college boy when they crash a campus party.
When you look back on the movie, you do realize how everything fits in together perfectly, now that you know everything, although it might seem a little bit muddled halfway through the movie.
Being away from my own home, I can relate to the importance of letters which later became phone calls and now emails.
Michael Dudikoff is one of those "actors" in Hollywood that makes his living on B grade action movies that don't have any story or fun what so ever.The same goes for "Crash Dive", a totally inert flick that borrows heavily from "Under Siege","Die Hard" and so forth.The acting is horrible as is the story.Come on,a middle east terrorist group (that contains Russian speaking Germans WAAHAA) that invades a sub marine and then wants to destroy New York or Washington to rule the world.The same old story told without any humor.I'm starting to feel a little sea sick now...  At one point I was cheering for the terrorists,I mean who would put nukes on a sub.Then you're begging for total destruction.Dudikoff is no action hero and he wouldn't be a good terrorist either,he's below that.
And now, the story is set in a contemporary urban setting where Red is a sexy adult nightclub entertainer.
It worked then, it works now and will work tomorrow, precisely because Avery had that most overworked and little understood word-genius.
Since then, I've gone on to check out more of the Japanese 'Pinky' genre and I can now say, without doubt, that Lady Snowblood belongs on the absolute top of the pile!
It is definitely the best movie I've ever seen and I pop it into the DVD player at least once a week now that I own it!!
I have yet to meet anyone of either sex who hasn't become a fan of the movie after watching it, and even my cousin Guy, who's a bit of a modern-day Neanderthal, throws out a Lady Catherine quote now and again.
And now, finally, it has come to the screen!!
(The advent of Emma Thompson and the 2005 movie now proves otherwise.)
At the ball, Jane Bennet becomes close with Charles (much to her mother's delight) and Elizabeth seen to be a little taken with the imposing nature of Darcy, but his aloof nature and continuous rebuffs, plus a harsh commentary he makes of her within earshot hurts her deeply: her pride has been hurt; hence, from now on, she will have nothing to do with him.
I am not sure how many times I have watched it now, at least 5, and it improves with each viewing.
But now on to the casting.
It really shows the difference of then and now.
Its not deep, exciting, or pompous; but its funny and completely different than the formulaic junk being churned out right now.
The gimmick of a living anachronism is a powerful one indeed but to someone like myself who was raised on reporter movies of the 20s, who saw Cagney, Raft and Powell play these kinds of roles, using the same slang and expressions, now so out of date, I literally howled with delight.
For the scoop on Hannity and Colmes and Fox and the now almost totally right-wing media in this country; see "Orwell Rolls in his Grave" and "OutFoxed" Rupert Murcoch's War on Journalism.
The movie which attracted little attention when it was released, now has world wide audience thanks to Tarantino giving it credit as inspiration for Kill Bill.
So now, education with members of the opposite sex!
With the old line "Big 3" networks News Departments now having shown to be less than honest, the whole nation has turned to what has come to be called "alternate" news sources.
Hannity and Colmes has been a staple of my news intake for several years now.
Josh Kelly is a young apprentice assisting him and Bianca Lawson is a former student, now a journalist wishing to follow along, working on an article detailing their progress.
I saw this movie title on SyFy just now.
When they have already a killed a girl in a bikini who was doing the right thing now moving and staying 'out of sight'.
I have very little doubt these antics used to go on but now they are left as a part of history.
After seeing "Lady Snowblood", I now have endless respect for Toshiya Fujita's spectacular exploitation classic and actually a little less admiration for QT, since he blindly copied the entire concept of this film and even took over the ingenious narrative structure.
After seeing the movie in its entirety I feel I now have to ask did anything go right ?
An obvious inspiration for Tarantino's "Kill Bill," the film is certainly deserving of a wider audience, and thanks to the widescreen DVD from AnimEigo that I just watched, with excellent subtitling, crisp images and many fine extras, that audience now has a chance to discover this winning entertainment in a perfect form....
throughout the whole game you think you know who she is but in a second you find that she's a MAJOR character from the first game and the movie now all grown up.
However, my favorite of the series now has to be Silent Hill Origins thanks to a vastly improved combat and movement system.
You now play as Heather, a teenage girl not afraid to speak her mind.
The lead now turns her head at nearly everything you can interact with, which at best takes getting used to, at worst is an annoyance.
You now see the elevator as its moving, another of the countless eerie situations in these.
this movie is now one of my favourites, up there with the Hellraiser series, Mothman Prophecies, Wishmaster, Carrie, Event Horizon and Jurassic Park  again, it is such a hell of a shame that people are ready to spit on this film, when it does deserve a helluva chance  it is just aces  
Basically its a you did it now you pay for it kind of story.
Go and see it now, you won't regret it.
A tragic, now late, slow guy from work somehow occupies my vacation-vacant condo and hits it off with my garrulous but uneducated father.
City living makes sour cynics out of teenage optimists (I'd count myself in until now), and this one is a lesson of keeping the best of yourself throughout life.
Those that now rent the public airwaves should be jailed for not abiding by the laws they are to adhere to when they use the public airwaves.
He should do what he is doing now...show them to the world.
Don't miss the fine performance of the King's mistress (Alice Eve/Miss Frayne) who knows exactly why and how she got to where she now happens to be in the King's court.
I will not make the same mistake twice and now I will have to buy it for my collection!
While "Shakespeare in love" showed this drama from a female point of view, "Stage Beauty" deals with a man whose life falls to bits and peaces when a woman plays a woman and achieves a change of law which now allows women to act on stage.
She is a full success and so sets the wheels in motion: A duke has seen her performance, a duke who has connections to the king and soon the law is changed: Women are allowed to act on stage now.
"Stage Beauty" succeeds beautifully in what any good period piece does, whether set 300 years ago or 300 years from now.
My favorite scene is the one where the two of them are in bed, and she's asking, "who are you now?"
I think she's one of the most interesting actresses of her generation and here you enjoy her enormously when she's on but her character is now a blurry dot in my memory.
The gentle role-switching from "man" to "woman" (in alternate parlance, "top" to "bottom" or "dominant" to "submissive") leads to a passionate confusion in which, if you'll notice, Ned tells Maria (astride him) first that she is the "woman" - "And now?"
she says, kissing and caressing him - "The woman," he says - "And now?"
Theaters shut down during the Protectorate now reopened and the die-hard, dour Puritans either doffed their somber garb and decamped for more favorable vice-free venues or joined the fun.
There are quite a few units available to all three sides, in spite of further increase in efficiency... engineers are removed, it's now the sides' main infantry unit that can take over buildings, and it's no longer instantaneous, to give a quick example.
Bottom line, we live in the here and now, making the best of bad or less-than-ideal life circumstances, and that is where this family seemed to land.
And by now, it makes sense!
Something a bit different then just having your average day killer going around killing teenagers, though I don't mind a dose of that every now and again.
Which by the way is a film I strongly urge anyone who hasn't see it yet to do themselves a favor and go and rent it right now.
Our little friend Park has an eye for torture, I see, as now it involves a movie director and his wife tied to his own house-like set, a disturbed extra putting him through physical and emotional turmoil.
The focus on the stage lighting and the levels of truth and deceit make it an interestingly post-modern look at spectatorship, as now these characters are forced to look at each other take up and remove their costumes in a twisted dynamic.
Dumpling - 7 out of 10 - Id never heard of Fruit Chan before I saw this film and now I'm interested to see what else he has done and I'm excited to see what he'll do next.
Its a bout a director who has recently learned some things about himself and his wife and now his personality is split in two; one wants her dead and the other wants to remain faux-happy and continue with his life.
The competitive relationship with her twin-sister eventually led to unwanted murder and now the unfortunate girl comes back to haunt her.
The message it puts out is just as true now as it was then.
Excellent short story, and now I'm thinking whether I need to see the extended version.
Nevertheless, this is a great little horror movie, and now I'm very hyped to watching my new DVD of Park's "Oldboy".
Harry was about to break the case wide open when he got former militant Black Panther leader and now Man of Peace Big Ed Mustapha, Albert Popwell, to finger the terrorist group leader and where he and his gang of terrorists can be found.
A now totally distraught but brought back to the real world Father John, finally seeing the light,tells Harry that The Peoples Revolutionaries are holding up, with the kidnapped Mayor, in the now closed Alcatraz Island.
A lesser actor would have taken this kind of success to the bank by now, while possibly allowing the character to slip into caricature rather than being concerned with keeping it real and convincing.
A well made and entertaining film, `The Enforcer' keeps the `Dirty Harry' series alive, well and on solid ground; in retrospect, it seems a shame now that Eastwood waited seven years to make the next installment, `Sudden Impact,' as with the dreadful `The Dead Pool' in 1988, it all ended with barely a whimper.
Eastwood laconically pulls it off with dominant ease and certain authority of truly delving into this character (as now there's more to that monomaniacal search for one's own justice), as his hands out punishment (against a bunch of terrorists who call themselves 'The People's Revolutionary') and has time to let fly what he really thinks.
Clint Eastwood is now on some dead end assignment in the San Francisco PD because he's once again offended someone powerful.
He's now reviewing applicants for promotion.
In this case something called the People's Liberation Strike Force with those weapons and explosives now start making demands on the city of San Francisco.
Harry Callahan quickly establishes his action-not-words by driving his car through a liquor store window to free the owners, who are being held as hostagesÂ Demoted to the personnel department, he scorns bureaucracy in general and in particular the Mayor's policy of attracting women into the force, but he is saddled with one, Kate Moore (Tyne Daly) as his by now obligatory 'minority' partnerÂ   Insp.
The only problem is that now the plot seems a lot tamer than it was then.
I know this phrase is used a lot, but now it's an understatement.
Grant now has to spend the rest of the movie realising that his one true love has returned and must find a kind, and considerate way to 'dump' his new bride.
Grant can't take it anymore, forgiving her "for whatever happened" and comes back dressed as Santa Claus, looking to get his present now.
So now we have two problems: Nick has to tell Bianca that he's already married, and Ellen must tell the children that she's really her mother.
So he goes to court with Gail Patrick who he now intends to marry after getting the judge to declare Irene Dunne legally dead.
"Noose" also doesn't appear on any of the A&C compilations either, but it is now available as a single on DVD.
I wonder why they bother when surely everybody by now knows that anything with a decent rating and a low number of votes must just be being pimped by the people who made it.
Until now .
I have since dumped the b/f, and changed teams, and am now a huge Jennifer fan.
I don't know if I can say this film is the one responsible for the way horror is now, but at least it helped a lot.
You would think by now that those young people would stay the hell off the back roads in Texas.
Hell, I might even be fooled into renting this again years from now when I completely forget about it.
Bring on the sequelÂI'm ready now!
I'm now sorry I missed "The Escapist" at Sundance which has also not yet been released commercially this side of the Atlantic.
Because it is truly obvious you did not understand the plea to listen to the voices of the children and perhaps together we could speak of peace for it is the children that carry and must live in this shattered world we now live in.
It's a pity it has'nt gained the popularity it deserves now being released to TV only a year after production.
If you are now thinking that a film about the aftermath of a major terroristÂ attackÂ from the director ofÂ Brigit Jones' Diary sounds like a recipe for disaster, then you are partly right.
Not helping matters is the fact that there are no other neighbors for miles, as the three of them are fenced in, both physically and now emotionally by the surrounding hills.
There a lot of parts that tough my heart and make me think about my son you is real miles away from me and the rest of my family so this movie make me real a part of want it means to have someone real away from you and but it hard to real now want it's like to have someone real million miles away from you.
One of the interesting aspects of the film is how it repeatedly disrobes it's women and then places them in harm's way, with this grinning, drooling, slimy alien just a tentacle slither away, and as with GALAXY OF TERROR much of what we now know as Hentai Anime and it's unsavory sexual violence was given root in what we see in these films: Slimy, tubular, disgusting aliens having their way with or just simply ripping apart aggressively gorgeous, sexy women in states of undress or nudity.
I am happy to now own a copy, review it repeatedly and share it with friends.
And even then, it pulled me toward where I am now.
I have been an RN since 1984, and now work as a nurse practitioner.
I hated this show when I was younger, but to see it now it is so cute and many situations come to light and are dealt with in a fun and dignified manner.
They involve a nobleman who often visits a house of ill repute and whose wife becomes ill; a mute street beggar who plays the violin for coins, and who dies in convulsions; a room bespattered and filled with blood, and then slaughtered sheep are discovered with their eyes gouged out; a woman who dies in a locked room with a husband who is perhaps too helpful; a pair of severed human ears placed in a box and delivered to one of the few women who are studying, with great opposition from most of the teachers and many of the male students, to be doctors; a woman of the streets who was given herbal pills and now is vomiting her life out.
Crum advised them all to tell the truth at the hearings -- that when asked if they were now or had been a member of the Communist party, to disarm the committee by answering truthfully.
Just a brief comment for now, of all the versions that I watched of Little lord Fauntleroy filmatisations, this one in my opinion features the best fitting actors if you compare with the book.
Sweet-tempered and beloved, the earnest young child knows nothing of the crusty, fierce old lord in England, or of the wonderful changes about to happen in his own life, now that he is LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY.
And by now, everyone should know that cult classics HAVE to be remade!
It was hard to see how immune they have become to it that now it was second nature and how the black humour of it flowed between the two.
Please, don't ask me what this movie's about, 'cause I've seen it a couple of times now, and I'm still not sure.
I think I'll have to go look for "Cry-Baby" and "Hairspray" now.
".But she has good reason for butchering six people: they all commited a crime that no one understands, like dumping her daughter, eating poultry (because Beverly loves birds),smart-alacing about her dentist husband, refusing to rewind a rental tape, critisizing about her family skills, and witnessing one of the other five crimes.You may think she's insane, but really, she's just expressing things we'd rather hide inside of us.Like, say you work in a store and someone wants to return something but they don't have the recipt.It can't be returned without the recipt, so you tell them "No can do".Then they start cursing you out like you're worthless.Wouldn't you get the urge to shove a bullet in their brain?Well then, you now know how Beverly Sutphin feels when someone decides to be a wise guy.This movie is perfect for anyone who loves to laugh.Plus, the DVD contains the theatrical trailer, a behind-the-scenes featurette, several TV spots, four interview clips, and extra behind the scenes footage.I give this one a 10/10!
In one scene, a future victim of hers is watching Annie and singing along to "Tomorrow" while her dog licks her feet: now THAT'S frightening.
Reno, now a baguette-bellied and aging actor, seems unconvincing in this role.
It is nice to see that after a long and successful film career in the US that Mr Karloff decided to return to the land of his birth and make not only this film, but also others like 'Curse Of The Crimson Altar' which were shown on the big screen in the late Sixties and which are now shown regularly in Britain on television.
I used to know but cannot be sure, now.
Right now I'm helping put together another film on magic and I'm going to be in this one!!
I rented this movie on the only reason that Rachael Leigh Cook was in it, and now i wanna buy it!
and the ending was a twist(i won't say right now)  i recommend this movie for anybody who enjoys movies that don't follow the set pattern of hollywood(the guy gets the girl, the good guy always wins, the bad guy dies, all i good at the end) i AM going to go out and buy this movie(not just because Rachael Leigh Cook is in it, although it is a very good reason to)
junior is your messiah and this flick is unbeatable.......consistantly hilarious and unpredictable, with music from King Sunny Ade + the Sunshine band.....stop staring at this screen, exit the building and find/borrow/beg/steal/pillage/conjure a copy of this movie for your personal viewage or die in the attempt.... do it now........
Joe had found out that these women would not be believed in a court of law, if they chose to press charges against him, because they were already proved to be lairs before so why would not a jury feel that there lying now.
Ann, played by Louisa Horton, is now becoming engaged to Joe's other son, Chris, played with marvelous insight by a young Burt Lancaster.
Sanders played by Leslie Banks is the local administrator of an area of what is now Nigeria and a man who is confidently shouldering the white man's burden as he saw it.
They are swept into it, and far from being the placid observers & peacekeepers they think they ought to be, they now must fight for their own survival.
Characters of the show: Billy- He was a neighborhood boy who doesn't remember anything because he doesn't have a brain, Well, he has a brain right now!
The show uses gross out humour which is probably the only show of it's kind now next to ren and stimpy.
Really gives you a break from the cruddy shows they have now.
Wow I can't believe I put off seeing this movie until now!
Back in the day(early 90's) I/we/they took De La Soul's lead and shunned R&B and commercial rap so I never felt the urge to see this...  ...until now, as I watch the people who used to be plastered to my wall when I was a kid in what appears to be an actually good movie!
Most importantly though are the stars, especially the brilliant Sheila E. who I now have a crush on.
all of the actors are amazing, and i follow some of the actors work now... namely Robert Sean Leonard, Neil Perry, and Ethan Hawke, Todd Anderson.
If you haven't seen it yet, rent it now.
It's not only his character, but in fact every character in the film that does not fully understand Mr. Keating's message until the very end by finally doing what they feel is right now matter how much the opposing forces deny this basic truth.
Then and now, it is considered to be a better film than the original, THE MARK OF ZORRO (1920), which made star and producer Douglas Fairbanks the personification of the Swashbuckler five years earlier.
this is a movie i saw with the 5th floor back in the day when it came out at the drive in .... some of the scenes in the movie stuck in my head some 30 years later until i tracked down a 15.00 copy off ebay... re-watched it and now I'm not taunted to find it anymore but do not regret getting this nostalgic scary cult classic... worth the watch BUT you must keep in mind that you have to put yourself in the year it came out to watch it not the year were in... that way you can fully appreciate the special effects that were 'from' the day not today.. because they obviously don't compare... well its definitely worth finding... pay for the copy not original that can run you 200+ dollars from places that actually still have a few... thats all... enjoy...
A few of them, are gone now, but that is one of the reasons that I loved this now but not when I saw it then....how strange, but funny.
Screams is dated by now Im sure but still good fun compared to a LOT of other bigger budget movies.
In the era of the DVD, when video stores already pressed for space now find themselves in the position of having to clear out mucho shelf space to make room for both VHS and DVD copies of the newest Kate Hudson film, many odd and obscure VHS films that have sat for ages are now disappearing.
Did these now well-known underworld expressions originate here?
At the time of writing this i have yet to have it confirmed, but it's thought that this Bretaigne Windust directed picture is the first mainstream picture to deal with the complexities of organised crime?, certainly the dialogue is now common speak (courtesy of Martin Rackin (Riffraff (1947)), but back in 1951 it surely would have raised eyebrows and intrigued the watching public.
We also see how the mob, now concerned about electronic surveillance has come up with code words like contract and hit to confuse law enforcement.
The words of this racket, like 'contract' and 'hit' are all familiar terms now, but then it was something fairly new.
now CTHD has been mentioned in an earlier review here and while i can (just) see that you can link the two, if nothing else it has opened up more main-stream audiences to subtitles, to compare them is really very, very pointless.
Maybe it is because my expectations were too high that I'm a tad disappointed now I've finally seen it.
In the meantime, the girl has become engaged to a policeman, and the boy has linked up with a band of outlaws and is now known as the Black Tiger.
See it now or I'll come to your house!
And now, in the future, which appears to be the 50's, maybe,it's hard to pinpoint a time-frame in this film, Rumpoey has been promised to Kumjoorn, a police captain, and yet she does not love him.
The spaghetti Westerns of thirty years ago gave new life to a tired genre - and now we have the first Thai Western, a big improvement on Hollywood's efforts.
I've borrowed this DVD from the library twice before, but never had the chance to watch it, until now.
I realize now what I remembered about the film was highly selective.
This movie is now one of my favorites.
The story in this one is that Dennis Quaid plays the now adult son of Roy Scheider, whom played the police chief in the first two films.
As the path taken by Linda (Franka Potente)--one of the younger and central questers--displays, the search for the keys to existential truth, to 'be here now', can too easily alight on answers >that look programmable and can lead to 'false gods' along the path, most unacceptably that of inauthenticity.
If Franka Potente can't play a character unlike Lola, I'm sorry to say I've seen enough of her by now.
DUM,DUM,DUM,DUM.....Just when you thought you were safe from sequels... Comes this second dreadful,horrid,and poorly acted film.Louis Gosset Jr. sports a terrible ghetto accent thoughout the film,probably hoping he won't be recongnized.James Bond Hopeful(at the time)Simon McQuade plays a Costeuo-like Documentary filmaker,Mr.Fritz-Royce who*spoilers ahead* gets swallowed whole by Mrs. Bruce.Bess Armstrong(High Road to China) plays the love interest,but hey, at least she's better than Karen Young in Jaws the Revenge.Dennis Quaid(The Parent Trap,The Right Stuff,Dreamscape) is the now grown up Mike Brody,who with Martin Brody out of the film,is the hero.John Putch is Shawn still afraid of the Deep Blue Sea(get it?
Right now!
(pant, pant, gasp)   I feel better now....
Mike now works at Seaworld and Sean shows up to visit his brother.
When low cost TV sci-fi's are being produced now, with quite acceptable visual effects, I fail to understand that those responsible for the graphic effects would deem this movie "Fit for human viewing"
Nevertheless, adds Owens, "I use to have a full regiment now I've got one troop.
It makes the movie look outdated but that also by now has become part of the charm of these sort of movies.
A wonderful exciting movie that every fan will want in their collection now that it's available on DVD.
Gandhi visits Ceylon, now Sri Lanka.
I have recently spent many an hour watching the feature length films of Charlie Chaplin and have grown to appreciate just what a fantastic film maker he truly was.having now watched 'The Circus' for the first time in it's entirety,I believe that it should be ranked amongst his very finest works.
By now, Chaplin had reached a point in his career where he was a major film star, so of course this movie is much bigger, much more ambitious than the 10 or 20 minute films he was churning out a decade before.
Hopkins was acquitted with attempted murder and for some reason, the genius he is, doesn't realize that once his wife is now dead from her coma, he can be charged with murder.
Now "Fracture" comes along and says now that she's dead we can try you all over again.
Just because you now have a different result doesn't make it a different crime.
And what's this business about claiming "now we have the bullet?"
What a year for him- nominated for his first Academy Award for his powerful role in Half Nelson (which was excellent- go see that too) and now puts on another pitch perfect performance in Fracture.
Any doubts of him I had before are now officially thrown out the window.
Naturally, Anthony Hopkins can do now wrong and 'newbie' Ryan Gosling does really well.
My entire knowledge of the genre is limited to the more famous Miyazaki films, 'Ghost in the Shell' and its sequel, and now the beautiful, dark, tragic 'Elfen Lied'.
Not only does Lucy now have an alternate personality, but this new personality of hers - Nyuu - is essentially a tragically retarded and meowing human/cat hybrid.
The series wants the viewer to sympathize with the life-ruiner Lucy, yet the best they could do is have her witness her dog's death as a child and expect that to be reason enough to side with a murderer from now on?
Overall this is a stunning piece of Anime on every level, check it out now Grade: A+  On a side not, If their is to ever be a live action version of this story, please let Takashi Miike be the one to direct as this is so up his alley
The 3D effects just aren't very good..they might've worked in 1983 on the big screen, but just make the viewing experience now a burden.
I wish they would make more but I guess it would by now only ruin it.
From now on I don't think that I can ever give another movie a vote of 1 because I think it will give this colossal piece of crap too much credit.
I'm not a big fan of Troma's output: I love unintentionally cheesy horror and silly sci-fi, but I just don't get the appeal of Lloyd Kaufman's productions, the majority of which I find to be deliberately amateurish (now where's the fun in that?)
After a short prison sentence, they came back for one final series, which concluded with Wolfie and Ken going to Spain to find Shirley, only to discover that she was now happily married.
She tries to find some love from the family but is too contaminated for a 'respected' society now.
now, so I could not really recommend purchasing this.
And while many shows are now re-released on DVD, Raven stays in the cold for no apparent reason, at least to me.
He also gets two interviews with women who were around when the war was there- one who is given no words for what she says except that her husband was killed, another who had a child with her and who is now traumatized- and somehow this too works even out of context.
In a frenzy of subjectivity this flick deserves a full 10 out of 10, I am ready to die now, thank you...
And I am now suffering from post traumatic stress syndrome.
Olivier Gruner stars as Dirk Longstreet, an ex-circuit champ who is now a college professor.
I know it is what it is; but the acting was probably the worst I've seen up to now.
For some bizarre reason the IMDb jointly lists Ghost Game as a comedy/horror, well I can tell you now that there is no intentional comedy in this film at all & it takes itself 100% seriously.
Back in April of this year I heard that The Worlds Greatest Lover was going to be on AMC and I was like yes I'm finally going to get to see this movie, I'm a big Gene Wilder fan so.....yeah, anyway the only problem was that it was going to come on at 3 in the morning on a Monday which was a school night for me so I asked my mom to record it for me, so when I came home from school I saw it and thought it was awesome, two or three months later I ordered the DVD off of Barnes and Nobles and I now have it on DVD what I had heard from this movie was that Gene not only stars in this movie but writes, directs, produces, and surprisingly wrote a song for the film as well, I think Gene's take on Rudolph Valentino was pretty cool and I think he came up with some clever ideas like "histerical laryngitis" and sticking your tongue out or twisting your words around whenever his character is nervous.
I have more but now i'm really done.
Its probably my favourite movie now.
Let me say it right here and now: High School Musical is thousands of times better than the first film, with improvements in every category.
HSM has never been loved for a strong plot, so it's no surprise that although there's now a new focus on college and the future, it's more than a little misrepresented.
And now they're having a HSM 3 that's coming out in theaters, that should be good;) HSM 2 should get a lower rating than 5.2.
And now High School Musical 2.
But now is the time.
The reason that High School Musical, and now Part 2, are such a success is because 1990'S POP MUSIC IS BACK WITH A VENGEANCE!!!
Instead of risking social status to be yourself, to find yourself, it is now about the dangers of losing yourself, by giving into social status.
This film was one of the made for TV movies that used to be so popular back in the 70's that are almost never seen now.
Warren Beatty did an astonishing job in this film, a little too good now that I think of it.
I think it is under-appreciated and if it were up to me I would have produced a sequel by now.
That was then, this is now--and "Bulworth" is truly one of the better film's of 1998.
Senator who before mouthed the political platitudes and nostrums we get from our elected officials at voting time, now starts telling some uncomfortable truths.
This sharp political satire is even more timely now than it was in 1998.
His comments about the media and how it is controlled by corporate America is more apt now (during the Bush administration) than ever before.
This acid look at politics in Amerca is more timely now than ever.
The worst part about this terribly over-the-top scene is not the silly way Bickford, now stricken with guilt, jumps up and admits the truth (though this is a ridiculous scene), but the way that lawyer J. Carrol Naish is allowed to attack Dunne on the witness stand!
But a local gangster (Cheadle), who also has plans for the diamond, befriends Max and now the twists and double-crosses begin.
He never managed to catch them and now they are retired.
It was entertaining now and then but overall, it was too slow and not enough plot to make it worth going to the theaters to see it.
Max (Pierce Brosnan) knows he can easily clip Napoleon III and make Lloyd look like a jerk againÂ For him, it's more about the challenge and the alibiÂthat's his work of artÂ But he affirms that the two are a couple of retirees trying to enjoy the island lifeÂ   The gorgeous Lola (Salma Hayek) knows that, with Max, they went out at the top of their game, undefeatedÂ They were great togetherÂ But, now, she feels it is the best time to quitÂ For her, now, the challenge is to find joy in simple things, as a life filled with sunsetsÂ   Lloyd was chasing Max for seven yearsÂever since the first Napoleon Diamond went missingÂ That day, he got to the scene, and took a few shots at the getaway carÂ Next day, a bottle of champagne arrives at FBI Headquarters with a note saying, "Aim for the tires next time."
When we had fewer stations that we do now, films like this were still being seen in the afternoons on affiliate stations to ABC.
I've been looking forward to seeing this for a while now, as I am a fan of the novel.
Compared to the made for TV films that are turned out now the ones from the 70's such as this one are vastly superior.
Set in New England as it is if Peyton Place existed it's now in the vanguard of blue state America.
Then as now, gays are not real comfortable in most small towns.
I wonder how I'd react if I saw if for the first time now?
Here's another person strongly urging the release of this obscure gem on DVD, perhaps now, while it's still winter!
Back in the 70's Chiba was the most ruthless martial artist ever and now he is reduced to a sobbing soldier who isn't up to par.
Directed by John Glen, best known for his work on the James Bond series, the story follows Chappy Sinclair (once again played by Louis Gossett, Jr.) who is now flying part time in an air show act, with him flying a P-38 Lightening.
I'm virtually in shock that this movie has received a 7.1 (for now) rating here at IMDb, making it the most over-rated piece of detritus in the Disney vaults.
So if you think only about yourself you would die in that time, hard to say now what it will happend to you... perhaps a day something will fall from the sky and we don't know what it is and for which reason they are falling down.
Bottom line: I can hear this bomb falling right now... Half my theatre left after the 2 hour mark, some before, and that was on opening night.
Those films are always under constant attack for the apparently amoral manner in which they exude violence, and now Scorcese can add the cornerstone of all violent films with 'Gangs of New York'.
For about three months now, I have (on an almost daily basis) passed a movie theatre not far from my home.
Go now.
Kabukiman is one of my favorite superheros now, he is better than superman, batman, spiderman, and so on.
The old mans daughter, Lotus must now teach him to master his Kabuki-powers to stop the evil one from ruling the earth.
He has been summoned by a bunch of freaks and now he's looking for 12-year-old Chris Hatcher.
If you are not from the Midwest (let alone Chicago), or didn't attend Northern Illinois University, or you are not enrolled in a university right now, you probably wouldn't understand the script of this film.
Missing too is the pseudo technical claptrap which lumbers much American SF, then or now.
And now you can: The film was issued in 2005 on a marvelous Czech made PAL format DVD that shows the film in the correct 2:35:1 Techniscope widescreen format with the original, unaltered & un-messed with ending sequence intact.
The good news is Eliza Dushku has nice legs, and now I want a Denver omelet.
Turn back now or know the ending: When the killer is e-mailing, calling,in the house,killing people, all that?
And the rest of the cast, did the director go out the day of shooting and ask random people on the street... "Hey do you want to be in a movie... no just wear what you are wearing right now that's fine... no, there's no script, just say whatever you want."
I'm now interested in watching Part III, if only to find out how Bud Friedgen and Michael J. Sheridan, with a dwindling selection of numbers, managed to keep the series fresh.
The two had only performed together on film on one prior occasion, dancing to George Gershwin's 'Babbitt and the Bromide' in the penultimate act of Zeigfeld Follies in 1946 and now thirty years later these two screen dancers were set to have the time of their lives.
But there's no denying that both these men have a kind of screen charisma that doesn't disappear with time, and having them both onscreen together, singing... now that really *is* entertainment as it should be.
There was one funny scene but I can't even think of it right now.
We're also stuck with actors who are less-than-hilarious: Ed Begley Jr, Jim Piddock, Jane Lynch, Bob Balaban, and a woman who has gotten progressively worse in every Guest film to the point I now consider her completely talent-free: Parker Posey.
Come on now Chris, the embedded yiddish is now no more than cheap schtick that does make Jews like me chuckle but is lost on the rest of the audience.
And now I have to write more lines to fulfill the 10 line minimum.
Whatever the film's shortcomings, it is the smaller details that are purely Guest which make this film a triumph and future classic: Guest's perfect intonation as he instructs one actor to deliver his line as though "Mommy is goingÂ now?
Meanwhile there are now generations who believe the Woodstock myth: That one should follow one's instincts and intuition minus logic minus reality.
Even the more well known Altamont festival took years to be as known as it now is, which still pales in comparison to Woodstock.
There are so many stupid movies out there now, and this one is not one of those.
And now he does it all over again with "Agents secrets", a sharp, always surprising look at the world of spies.
Thanks to Jere Cunningham and Tom Flynn, the world can now enjoy Second String, a delicious TV movie depicting a tale of a rag-tag gang of second stringers (thus the title) who are thrust into the position of starters due to an order of bad oysters.
The relationship between Patsy and Aurora which had been quietly disagreeable, is now full-on antagonism.
Where are the original actors there's no jeff Daniels, no Danny DE Vito, the character of patsy was slim and pretty and smart and sophisticated in the first film but now shes replaced by some heavier actress who just acts dumb all the way through.
Aurora Greenway (Shirley MacLaine- reprising her Oscar winning role) is now dealing with her three grown Grandchildren.
And Melanie (Juliette Lewis), the youngest, is struggling through college because she's going through a rebellious phase and likes hanging out with her sleazy boyfriend, or mooching off Patsie (Miranda Richardson), the now very rich divorcÃ©e.
I have never read the books, but now I really want to.
A scientist who's hired a bunch of what would be called trailer park trash now is on the verge of discovering a lost city with untold wealth.
I haven't seen this movie in maybe 18 years, but I've been searching for it all over the internet for a while now, and finally came across it tonight!
NUTCRACKER FANTASY is weird, but once you realize that this is essentially a Japanese take on the now famous ballet, boy is it fun.
Hoffman story and, to a lesser extent, Tchaikovsky's now famous ballet (snippets of the composer's famous score can be heard on the soundtrack) goes something like this: Clara (voiced by Melissa Gilbert), a pretty doll face of a girl, receives a mysterious nutcracker from her eccentric Uncle Drosselmeyer (Christopher Lee).
I can now add this worthless thing to my worst 10 movies.
I can see the distributors now... "Well we got the rights to this old movie full of simple-minded 70s philosophy that nobody's going to want to see now, but Robert Englund has a small role in it... Now get this, how about we put England's name on a horror-looking video box and re-title it something like, say, SLASHED DREAMS, that will make people think it's like another Elm Street movie?"
You are probably thinking that surely now there will be a terrible price to pay for these two redneck morons as the couple will wreak bloody revenge upon them.
These are two different passages (on pain, and on friendship) from Kahlil Gibran's popular (more then than now, I think) book The Prophet.
The campers continually commit suicide as they decide they'd rather go to hell now then be persecuted.
I half expected Ted Haggard to make an appearance, but the guys are leaving him buried for now.
I doubt five years from now, there will be clips of this year's presentation floating around since there were no memorable moments at all to be found here other than Martin Scorsese winning his Oscar for Best Director.
Normally the comedy of the show is more of a spoofing caliber, it now felt professional and well thought out, with some fun moments with comedians Will Ferrel and Jack Black.
But on the other hand I'm of course glad that he now will always be remembered as Oscar winner-Martin Scorsese instead of 8(+ probably) time Oscar nominee.
Also a last note it was just fine to see legends Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton present the best picture award, and a shaved bald headed Jack now that's wild and freaky!
- IMDb has a silly rule about having to have 10 lines of text before they'll allow you to post a comment, so now I have to ramble on although I've already made my point.
Those days are long gone now.
Fantastic cast : Guillaume Canet, Zabou Breitman (= two directors ), BenoÃ®t Poelvoorde as Lenny Bar (there is a game of words with this name in French so that when you pronounce his character's surname + last name it sounds as if you've said : "the boobs"...Stupid right now but funny during some scenes in the movie...LOL!
No point in trying to be logical now.
At a certain point in the movie, she sees main character Johnny (Harmon Walsh) standing, and somehow his body turned colder than the walls, which seem to be on fire right now.
Quincy Wyatt) "Love In The Afternoon",'57; my family wanted to visit Florida and the Castillo de San Marcos Fort in 1951 where a great scene in the film depicts a fight in this famous fort, now a National Monument.
Okay now let the ripping and spoiling begin!
Apparently the all-powerful "Ice Queen" can be easily defeated by a pool of hot water -- she is now a pile of crappy rubber parts that look like my 8-year-old brother made them with playdough.
I first saw this movie 2 weeks ago(today is 25/05/07), and now I've seen it ten times, and own a copy.
Seen in 2006, now is actually the right time for this film.
Up until now his father and sister go out on the hunt and bring him back left over blood, so they decide it is time to send Dupah out to start feeding himself.
The film was ahead of it's time and I think it couldbe more appreciated now than it ever was as the humor is not outdated at all.
It is now back on a channel called NickToonsters - and IT'S ON SKY!
People who like action movies should be watching this movie now!
Then I saw that Abigail Breslin was in it and I thought "Well I definitely have to see it now!"
And we all need that, especially now...Grady Harp
It was everything I look for in a movie, Hollywood gets one right now and then, most of all it was clean and entertaining.
What Jack ultimately finds is an empty coffin and a source of water, which the survivor's are now out of.
And yet, "White Rabbit" proves its value by laying the groundwork for a lot of the themes that will be dominant in the future: Jack's leader role; the Jack-Locke "man of science, man of faith" dynamic (the dialogue in this scene is particularly well-written); father-son relationship problems; ghostly manifestations on the island (already introduced in "Walkabout", but now made more clear), specifically connected to the characters; flashbacks that go back to the character's childhood; the realization that the survivors will probably have to stay there for a long time; etc.
A woman died this morning just going for a swim and he tried to save her, and now you're about to crucify him?
Last week most of us were strangers, but we're all here now.
Fortunately, they play fairly often now on Turner Classic movies.
Except here the farm boy is a former porn star now reduced to being a fluffer (if you don't know what that is, put your player on 'pause' now and rent the film THE FLUFFER), the 'chicken' is actually not poultry but the human variety, and the 'head' is...well, I think you get the idea.
He works as an embalmer and he's the only person who keeps seeing his father, now a vegetative mount of fat fleshÂ   We can see by these short examples that this movie is actually a little bit mad, but that's exactly its most valuable feature!
Skeletal and insecure, the last of the Balatony's owns a taxidermy shop and takes care of his now divorced and shut-in father, who has nearly tripled in girth.
The second story focuses on a fat speed eating champion who was born with a tail (and could either be the son of the lieutenant or the son of MorosgovÃ¡nyi; which it is not to clearly explained and therefore up to our imagination) and is by far the most boring story out of all three, his character stays undeveloped, we learn little about him, he just eats and pukes, finally he falls in love with a fat woman and together they have a child, so begins the third and last story, as the child grows up to be a skinny and kind of creepy Taxidermist, who lives alone with his now even fatter and bed ridden father and his large mutant cats.
I will warn you all now, this film is not for the faint hearted, you do see graphic sexual images, you do see people vomiting, close up, on many occasions and you do see what is meant by self-surgery with about 2 mins of entrails, blood and guts.
now there's a real intelligent philosophical dilemma that presents itself for all ye pompous/deluded film students).
The third story features Half-Piggy, much older and by now weighing around two tons, looking distinctly like a Euro-trash version of Jabba The Hutt.
I am trying to source 'Hukkle' now as I want to see more by this director.
The interviews on "Charlie Rose" should be included with the DVD as there is no concluding update to learn that some of the participants are now employed professionally as dancers, though we did get a glimpse that Miss Prissy is taking some formal dance training.
I have watched this movie over 15 times now and it will always be my favorite.
(Especially young people residing in urban areas and ghettos for no fault of there own are labeled as "thugs" and "gangsta's" are now being known as "Artists" and "Visionaries" due to them turning back to their roots in Africa).
Then you wake up in a hospital where you continue your work from inside the little house only that you now miss the chainsaw.
The best example of the boring game play is a situation in which ash (you) has to fight against the invisible evil that has followed him into the hospital and that is now throwing chairs, tables and doors on him.
I'm only a very recent Harold Lloyd convert, but now that I've seen a few of his films, I have to say that I like his brand of silent humour much more than Charlie Chaplin's.
The publisher and his staff find it hard to keep a straight face when they meet the author of the "Love" manual face to face and decide to publish it as a funny book entitled "The Boob's Diary" - unbeknownst to Harold who thinks he now has nothing to offer "the girl" (played prettily by Jobyna Ralston).
I've already watched it for almost more than 30 times from now.
While the technology of the 20's in the forms of horse & street cars in the chases seem ancient now, they are never more skillfully employed in a film than they are in this gem.
Because of this I await anything she might now be doing, twenty years later.
However, today the boats are turned Â literally Â and the country is now a receiver of immigrants.
But the repetitive Billy scenes just kept coming back over and over and over, and I've just had enough of typing now.
Their act was well enough known now to make a Marx Outing by formula.
".It's fascinating to read how these brothers grew up in poverty under the wings of Minnie and Frenchie and became the comedy team everybody loves.These brothers worked great as a team.The viewer can sense that.That's probably why we still love them.It's timeless, their humor.You can live the 1940's or whatever decade or millennium, it always works.If somebody woke them up now and they'd be back in the moving pictures, the movie theaters would be packed with people.And the laughter would be heard miles away.
So now we have all the Marx Brothers working at the store.
I've been a fan of BOTTOM and YOUNG ONES for years, since I was 11 to be exact (Im 20 now!!)
Watch it now!
The children are now orphaned and now must be raised by their grandparents who are not normally affectionate towards children even their own son.
Fifteen years passed and Young's now married to Robinson, but the Tong Wars are heating up and he's not giving her the attention she needs.
I didn't get it then, but after reading some of these posts about this film, as well as a recent online interview at Rogue Cinema, I do now.
Anyway, I came here today to find out what he's up to now (after running into one of his producers, Kerry Johnston, recently at a restaurant here in Hollywood on La Cienega - who said he was about to begin filming his seventh film at the end of this month in Wyoming - though I suspected she was purposely throwing me off his trail, as she looked at me like I was a stalker), and, remarkably, IMDb only has this, his first time behind the lens, listed.
Mr. Holden, I'm going to try and email you now (I can't believe your email address is listed here!
); but if you by some chance come here and read this first, I'm eight years older now and have thickened my resume substantially, and am ready for my close-up!
Oh, and "management1," I went and checked you out, reading some of your previous posts, and know now why you were so confused with Larry's film: It's not Battlestar Galactica, and doesn't star your late heroine, Anna Nicole Smith.
When I look at her on screen now I'm ready to do all the things Jim Carrey does in the 'Mask' when he see's Cameron Diaz dance at the club !
I just love this movie because of one character : Lady Une, former OZ soldier and now the leader of The Preventers.
-The movie picks up where the great series ended, there's being peace between the colonies and earth for a year now and everyone is happy with their lives.
This time around the now good Zachs is no longer their leader and he is replaced by a little girl whose more of a figure head.
He needs a new chef and ends up with Mao, a Chinese immigrant who's kungfu-ing all the time but is the most efficient cook he ever had and suddenly people are flocking to his bar because his dishes are actually really good now.
Having now seen it myself, I see exactly where he was coming from.
now the other problem i had with the movie was envy, i envied these people with all their lifelong friendships and so forth and so on.
I think the movie just shows what some little girls, when kids, were dreaming of.I think, few or many years ago, it was common to see little girls dreaming of it and maybe the movie just shows the audience what was once a dream and now with the society,well the wedding is getting a bit something people forget about,the true goal of it maybe.There might be parts of the movie that married people would find funny as maybe it was their case.
Hudson is now a horrible lawyer and an utter bitch.
But since there was a time when I first saw Fulci's CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD and just dismissed it as B-movie rubbish (Hey now, don't give me that look -- what did I know back then?
There's something evil lurking under the city of RomeÂ The acclaimed archaeologist Prof. Lasky and his crew have been searching for a 19 centuries old tomb for many months, but now it seems that the nearby subway construction works have finally exposed the entry.
Lynn, the brawn, and Sue, the brains, now use that technology to fight bad guys.
Is it any surprise that Hollywood now actively courts Asian filmmakers and stunt coordinators?
All but Barabara Bain are gone now and we should mourn their passing.
The best known of these efforts was Spielberg's "Duel," but there were good films appearing now and again all the way up 'till about 1983, which saw the "Day After" phenomenon, following which Republicans put such pressure on TV producers, they never attempted anything risky on broadcast TV again.
To bad there not making more films like that now.
Witnesses describe a woman who sounds a lot like Bain leaving the area just after her now ex's failed flight.
I saw it back in the day and loved it then and now.
And now, I even wonder if it was the club owners who produced the film, because this is advertising as its best.
then there is the whole is - she - my - mother - and - why - did - you - not - tell - me - i -am - so - sad - and - confused issue paired with the i - kissed - another - girl - and - my - gf - is - mad - now - i - need - to - make - it - up - to - her issue... and he still manages to score game winning an game defining goals.
The fact that this film is one big advert for Adidas,now even in the first film there are a lot of Adidas related stuff,but in this film they push it.
So why do we now have some shoddy, artificial, attempt where everything looks more like a version of Pro Evolution Soccer than real life?
In hindsight I think it has enough intriguing elements, also story-wise, to warrant an 8 rating, and that is what I have now revised my rating to.)
I used to be able to sleep at night feeling "The Item" would probably never be seen by human eyes again, but the fact that it's out on DVD now is just shocking...
He seeks the blood of a woman named Katherine (Louise Allbritton) who is obsessed with the Gothic and supernatural, she falls under his spell to be in love with him but her fiancÃ©e Frank (Robert Paige) gets suspicious of what she's become and now must join with Dr. Brewster (Frank Craven) and Professor Lazio (J. Edward Bromberg) to stop this creature of the night and Katherine.
That sorta spoils it for me now, but Doc Hollywood is still a good, clean and romantic view of a small-town romance.
Love the small town movies,I'd Love to live in one.This town used to be small,but now it's competing with Larger towns.Doc Hollywood is a favorite of mine,Because the actors can play small town people,(Like fictional Mayberry.
Watching tonight, I realized I was enjoying it even more now than ever before.
I can even do a pretty good southern accent now myself!
I can't believe she isn't a bigger star by now.
Thah film would be good if it would come 7 years early, now its not good nor original.
A Action/Comedy/Crime/Thriller about a cop Washburn(Jimmy Fallon,Anything Else) who gets his license taken away so when he gets the call that there is a bank robbery.He jumps in a cab but not just any cab Belle's(Queen Latifa,Chicago)cab.So now he is in for a big surprise.
I ran out of things to say several lines ago and now I am just typing to fill the required minimum.
I also think it's quite cool that Mark was actually a technician not an actor who is now a leading DNA expert!
What's even more interesting is that many of the topics of these episodes, some 25 years old, show a great amount of relevance even now.
With the amount of technology which we presently have available to us now, it's amazing that a lot of it has only been available since Quincy debuted on television, less than 25 years ago.
My only reason for bothering with this film is because of the fact that it was a part of the DPP's Video Nasty list back in the eighties, and I'm pleased to say that now I've seen three of the four Nazisploitation flicks on the list, I only have one left to go (the almost certainly mind numbing Love Camp 7).
There's a moment in which Starker says to Lise: "I showed you death, now you can start to really live".
In order to survive, she must now pretend that von Starker has succeeded in breaking her, and become his lover...  With scenes of mass extermination, violent rape, and general lack of respect for human life, Canevari's sick flick is certainly disturbing; although not packed with the the wall-to-wall gore that one might expect, the sheer nastiness of some moments make this one hard to stomach at times.
The film imagines Washington D.C. 50 years from now, and that very prediction of our lifestyle is ambitious indeed; cars which drive themselves, home appliances which operate on voice command, holograms and highways which even run vertically Â the most wild and imaginative concepts are placed together into one single movie, and even though it eventually builds to disappointing level of cynicism and implausibility, it's still wonderful to look at and experience.
As a result of this, murders are virtually extinct in the capital, and the system is now beginning to go nationwide.
Witwer and Anderton come at odds from the beginning and it turns catastrophically worse when the Pre Cogs see a now rare premeditated murder, where the perpetrator is John Anderton.
It gives a sense that without colour in the world there is no emotion and people actions are now based on what a machine says rather that acting on human instinct.
But he's well and truly back now, and I'm happy.
I've seen this one a few times now and thought it was good horror fun.
Absolute and total rubbish, a fly-infested dung heap of cinematic failure...I stayed up late last night to watch this on the SciFi Channel, as I am a huge werewolf/zombie movie fan and I do enjoy a good cheesy B movie(of which the SciFi Channel now obviously owns the patent for:).
The plot was ridiculous(something skulking around on 2 legs is killing deer and other wildlife on a mountaintop;and now it's moving on to humans...so the forest rangers figure it's gotta be a cougar or wolf, since everyone knows they are bipedal predators, right?!)
Save yourself now, and run screaming into the night if this movie ever turns up on your telly or some well-meaning friend/spouse brings this home for your enjoyment:)
But will she be able to convince Detective Gary Merrill (who by now has fallen in love with her) that her assertions are, after all, true?
i can hear the dialogue now  Christian: "We have to come to rescue you from the infidel blasphemers!"
To end on a good note, I like your effort now; I'll love your film after a tighter edit.
Friends at Life Is A Dream Productions, I have now viewed your film, Cast in Gray, many times.
In this dream the man finds his own dream fulfilled, that is, his old life is gone, and now he will pursue his dream, perhaps his passion, for acting.
He has to nurture the unconditional love that is now in his life ON A DAILY BASIS; he will be focused, and his priorities appear to have been totally rearranged (he sacrificed his old self for atonement and redemption of the new).
On the rebound, she marries Dean (whose wife is now dead), much to the dismay of his adult daughter Carol (Geraldine Brooks).
Poor Joan has been turned into a freakish cartoon in recent years, but every now and then you stumble upon a movie that only Joan could play, and play well.
Even now fixated on him, she makes an advance and is swiftly rejected.
To make matters worse, Heflin is now dating Crawford's step daughter following Joan's rebound marriage to Raymond Massey.
Back to the present and in the hospital Louise is now in a total vegetable with her mind completely gone.
She has able assistance by Heflin, who pops in and out and gets involved with Crawford's stepdaughter (Crawford is now married to the widower Massey).
Obssessive love affairs have been a Hollywood staple for years upon years now with varying degrees of success, and here the formula wins.
Mary Louise Parker is also delicious, the acting is great, the storyline very likable, timeless, then and now.
I really enjoyed myself with this Universal outing and now I look forward into getting amongst the rest of their Dracula features.
Another reason to watch is to see its three now very well known stars, 9 years younger than they are now.
Quoting from Hedayat's "The Blind Owl", he says that he left home because of he was weary with his life in Iran and now aspires to be a singer of Persian classical songs, though he drives a taxi to stay alive.
When Mercouer died in 1835 at the age of 26, her mother had her poems imprinted on her gravestone, yet now the letters have faded and with it Elisa's claim on immortality.
Recently there have also been strong concerns expressed about the very relaxed social attitude which, what used to be a conservative Catholic society, now takes towards such social issues as nudity on TV, sex shops and striptease parlours in all major centres.
It was so formula -- I was halfway expecting one of those endings where they give you the summary of what they are doing now.
You know, "Katie turned her life around and is now donating time at the local animal rescue league.
There, I feel better now.
I'd never seen her in a movie before and now I know why.
In all honesty, if I had seen this film in my early twenties (and I'm now almost 40), I wouldn't have appreciated its subtlety on long term relationships.
The truth is, based on the Hollywood mythical marriage created for oh so many years now, everyones marriage is terrible.
When I think about it, Rob Reiner (aka Meathead) has been expressing the thoughts and concerns of our generation for a number of years now.
"Son of Dracula" takes place decades after the first film, when the Dracula's story is now considered a mere myth.
For some seven years now I have been collecting gangster films, read books about the subject and even collected news articles about the mafia and such.
Why is it that the films and the actors from films in the 80's and 90's seem to be so unfunny now that you want to stab yourself in the face with a fork?
Eddie Murphy, Robin Williams and now Mike Myers.
And now here's THE LOVE GURU.
That film now looks like Mary Poppins compared to this one.
He should have just stuck to the animated voices, because his characters now are just lame.
It was a very good film, the audience at Gaelcon loved it as far as I could tell, with lots of laughter and some knowing nods now and again.
Matt and David are like, my heroes now, they're so talented at taking on all those different roles and pulling them off so well!
Just stick to your classic comedy like Hancock's Half Hour, Blackadder, Spitting Image, Mr Bean... Look ahead to 10 years from now, this will just be forgotten comedy!
Occasionally dipping into "new" episodes every now and then has done nothing to disprove this.
See "Little Britain Live (2006)" available now on DVD!!!
You'll love (or love to hate) the brilliant characters and situations created and performed by the freshest British talented right now: Matt Lucas & David Williams.
were the focus now.
Seven years ago, when I was in high school, I was assigned to read and study John Steinbeck's 1937 novella, "Of Mice and Men", in my English class, and it's no surprise that I still remember it clearly now, as it's not a story to forget.
but i can say now, this is one good film i have seen in years because of its light comedy.
and weÂ´ve been talking about some scenes for 2 days now.
They'll never get that little piece of land, they'll never have anything more than what they have right now, and they'll never be anything better than what they already are.
I'm guessing that everybody knows the story of this movie by now, but for those who might not have had the opportunity to see this great movie, it's quite a simple formula.
This is surely Carrey's best work, even now.
The weird twist is the CRazy idea of running the pier as a ship, and takes a while to get your head round this idea, But once you do you can appreciate the film even more, If you don't well you will think the films a load of old tosh... Love it or loath it... i personally love it.. Incidentally the pier used was the Old pier at Hunstanton that was there before the eyesore they have there now, Not too far from me some lovely shots of Hunstanton as well in the film real nostalgia.
Since he was a beginning actor and this was a Grade B-type of production, I didn't except it to be so entertaining, although now that I've watched a lot of early '30s films, I am not surprised.
Instead, his shirttail is frayed and the Levi jacket split along the seamÂ a penniless old man who's now lost his only friend.
Instead, he's been saving his money, and now he has a nice little kitty saved, which raises one of the film's key themesÂa workingman's dream of independence.
Go out and buy this film now and add it to your collection.
*   When one views the two principal characters, George Milton (Burgess Meredith) and Lenny Small (Lon Chaney, Jr.)** entering into a scene or having one of those now classic dialogs, we are viewing a little piece of Americana.
Also, this time, even Jafar - rather tragically - joins in the singing and dancing and the originally great but now tortuously irritating Iago gets not one but two songs.
Aladdin now lives in the palace with Princess Jasmine, and Genie comes back from his journeys or whatever.
Jafar is now a genie, and plans to use his evil magic to destroy Aladdin and wreak revenge.
I've always wanted to fire a 10 000 tonne cannon at this deplorable film and now I get my chance.
I'm not too critical on this point; even without Robin Williams, the Genie (now played by none other than Homer Simpson) does a creditable job.
Just a couple of questions though: The genie's arm-cuffs disappeared when he was freed; why is he wearing them again now?
and Why does the genie spend all his time around Aladdin now when he didn't want to be tied down at all?
The other characters, relegated to minor roles, disappoint: Rajah (formerly kittenish) is now savage, Jasmine contrary, the Sultan no longer easy-going, and the carpet badly faded.
It was one that turned out pretty good, but now Disney is going overboard.
"The Return of Jafar" continues the story of the original "Aladdin": now Aladdin and Jasmine are married and live together in the palace, the genie returns from his vacations, Iago escapes from Jafar and becomes a Â«good guyÂ» and Jafar returns with the help of a new villain (a thief called Abis Mal).
Jafar is now more annoying and not as humorous as in the first one.
I do know, though, that we now make fun of the guy who loaned it to us.
The fact that this movie blatantly steals scenes from other, better movies is not what makes it so bad (but now that I think of it, stealing is one of the crimes that is punishable by death according to the Saints.
Of course, the characters are a bit shallow every now and then and one would love to learn more about their background, but that's only a slight criticism.
Freeman commits crimes that put Reeve in jail, because now he has obstructed justice.
Movie is beneath him now, though.
Schatzberg does best in capturing this now (thankfully) wiped-away street life and porno district along Times Square and in other parts of New York, going along at times casually- too casually perhaps- in getting this mood down.
Years from now, when Freeman likely will get some AFI tribute or something or lifetime achievement on TV, Street Smart might be neglected among his most famous parts but shouldn't be.
What's even more troubling for Fisher is that Fast Black in now standing trial for the murder of one of his hooker's customers.
This would bring his now skyrocketing career in TV news to a sudden and embarrassing end!
Although Freeman doesn't play the type of positive African-American role model here that he is now best known for playing,he gives the character of Leo Smalls, Jr., a.k.a.
I was born in 1952, so this movie is way out of my time frame for appreciation as the year now is 2002 but it does not take much effort to recognize greatness, no matter what year faces the antiquities of its present and its vehicles of success.
Disgustingly mirthful music plays now for about 10 minutes non-stop, the same music being played at least a dozen times throughout the remainder of the movie.
It works too well - his voice-over tells us he's now afraid of losing his cool.
I have now seen it twice and will never ever watch it again for any reason.
Until now, I reviewed it before writing this review and I have to say I hate IMDb.com, and I hate you all for making me re-watch this movie again for the purpose of this review.
And now that he's been released, Ricco discovers that Don Vito (Arthur Kennedy) has also taken his girl.
Diamonds, and collected dues of those benefactors for whom Vito "protects", soon play into matters as does Ricco's old squeeze, Rosa(Malisa Longo)now "property" of the Don.
He owns a soap factory, says stuff like "don't you know by now I hate soap... and men that sweat" and turns his own men into it when they fail him.
After the initial shock, Ms. Vitti decides to kill both herself and her now ex-boyfriend, but before doing so she gives herself a week to live it up, so she sells all of her jewels, checks into a reasonably swank hotel, though probably below her usual standards, and parades around Paris in some very eye-catching outfits.
Dreamworks must now set a different path from that of Disney.
It is amazing to see this era explained without an agenda or politically correct spins that Americans are fed now.
Third, the French now HATE the UNITED STATES.
!buy it now!!!!!!!
Years later that scenario is replayed again, but conducted by the late scientist's now grown son who has become an evil sorcerer.
But like the first one, the graphic depictions of demonic rape is rampant throughout, but now with mechanical rape added on.
The only problem is that now the plot seems a lot tamer than it was then.
Grant now has to spend the rest of the movie realising that his one true love has returned and must find a kind, and considerate way to 'dump' his new bride.
Grant can't take it anymore, forgiving her "for whatever happened" and comes back dressed as Santa Claus, looking to get his present now.
So now we have two problems: Nick has to tell Bianca that he's already married, and Ellen must tell the children that she's really her mother.
So he goes to court with Gail Patrick who he now intends to marry after getting the judge to declare Irene Dunne legally dead.
now, i know this isn't a very good title, but its fun to watch when you get the chance.
Oscar-nominated star of early talkies and 30s films is almost forgotten now.
Marlow isn't that good and Sullivan and Ireland are downright terrible but Palmer was very good and seeing her so young is pretty amusing (she's now best known as Jason's mother from the "Friday the 13th" movies).
It is now Tuesday, roughly 36 hours after the show ended.
His career slowed down after WW II and he's best remembered now for his co-starring role in Some Like It Hot.
But now he has a new mission in his life(sent by God), that is to help his people (The Jews) to not be slaves anymore and go to the Promise Land.
Beneath Still Waters starts in 'Northern Spain 1965' as two young boys Teo & Luis trespass in a town that is being flooded by the creation of a dam, they run wild throughout it's streets but hear screaming coming from the local Church, upon investigation they find several people in the basement chained up including the evil dabbler in black magic Mordecai Salas (Patrick Gordon) whom Teo unwisely sets free as Teo is killed by Salas but Luis runs off... Jump forward '40 Years Later' & photojournalist Dan Quarry (Michael McKell) wants to do a story on the now completely submerged town & the upcoming celebrations by the town that was built nearby in place of it, however the preparations for the celebrations aren't going too well as a boy named Antonio drowns in the lake created by the dam.
Two ruthless boys accidentally saved Salas from a watery death right before the town sunk entirely, and he has been waiting forty years now to seek revenge on the descendants of the previous mayor.
I certainly won't bother to read it now.
I read some of these reviews last night before I watched this film, and now I find it hard to believe that some people were actually unsure as to whether this is a comedy or a horror.
I dunno what everyone's problem is about girls with long black hair now, I expect there are many stories of female ghosts in Asia and most Asian women have black hair, just don't watch them if they bore you, at least they're better at telling ghost stories than the Americans!
It seems that some time back, Tobin had stolen HER husband and now using a rather intricate plot, she diverts Tobin and Brent to her home--planning on keeping them there while secretly contacting Tobin's husband so he could come there and find his wife with another man.
even now, years later, i vividly remember how a gangster boss gets shot up: first, they cut the power and come in with infrared goggles and shower everything in bullets, then the bad guys catch on and put on their own nightvision gear - they are prepared, of course.
With the sudden eruption of great Mexican films in the last few years, we are now being cheated upon thinking all Mexican films are worthy of a good review.
Tigre accepting just to get revenge on the man who killed his friend who is now the police captain.
I loved Mulan, I loved Anastasia even more, and now... Well, I must say that Prince of Egypt is probably the best of all.
Yet after watchng this film I'm now absolutely convinced that even "formulaic" and "predictable" films can be great, provided that they're executed properly and with heart, as it was with this film.
First time I ever wanted to hear what George C. Scott had to say..and now I must watch again to hear him again..Point is this movie is a gentle look at the life of a kid with a few problems that only others seem to have.
In the second, on the same beach, the new wife is masterful with the crab, and this makes Gegauff miss the 1st wife's now - endearing fear.
It has been one of my favorite movies for a long time now and I still am not tried of it.
He has a label for these people now, based on numerous levels of reasoning.
This disease seems to have contaminated Japan as well now, since I really think Ringu 2 suffers from it.
The best element here is the fact that we now have character driven rather than situation driven horror.
Already the subject of a comprehensive TV series ("Ringu: Kanzen-ban", 1995) and a theatrical spin-off (THE SPIRAL, directed by Nakata and released in Japan at the same time as the original RING), the series represents little more than a millennial update of old-fashioned Japanese kaidan, though its ghostly villain ('Sadako') is now a part of the cultural lexicon throughout SE Asia (rather like Freddy Krueger in western society).
This is the sort of thing that classic Western horror USED to do, but now it is more concerned with shock tactics and tongue-in-cheek self-referencing (see "Scream") to bother with good old-fashioned empathy.
This is good quality horror the way it hasn't been made in Hollywood for a good few years now - go with a friend!
The confusing ending also gives us the  return of Sadako (now with the clayface of her real corpse) climbing up the well.
GÃ©gauff's character says clearly: "Earlier, she preferred sublime culture, and now she is wallowing in the mud of human scum".
- The reporter who said he would then never watched the tape being freaked out when trying to erase the tape of the now dead girl.
'Ringu 2' (1999) is now the true sequel to the 1998 original, forget 'Rasen' (1998).
His self-assurance, disarming directness, and engaging and almost defenseless smile belong now to a slave-holder, rather than a man who in his words, was "born to be joyful."
Meanwhile, Masami Kurahashi (Hitomi Sato), one of the two girls from the beginning of Ringu, is now in a mental hospital, the police have the remains of Sadako Yamamura's (Rie Inou) body, they're trying to recreate her living appearance through forensic modeling, and they've located a man who is supposedly Sadako's father, Takashi (Yoichi Numata).
These days, however, it's marry now - divorce later.
It is now back in those two cities before, hopefully, opening wider across the country.
First, there was the big blue meanie in WATCHMAN, and now, a clay one here.
After having watched this film, I now have a favorite Joan Crawford movie.
Until the publication of "Mommie Dearest," Crawford's performance perhaps elicited more praise than now, when it can be perceived as a rare glimpse into the off-screen Crawford household.
Wouldn't want Walter gambling away the company money while drunk, now, would we?
Familiar now, because we've seen Joan spackling her angst all over movie and TV screens for decades, but along with *Mildred Pierce*, *Queen Bee* and *Torchsong*, *Harriet Craig*, at the time, was a new dimension in Joan's personal psychosis committed to film.
From what little I've watched of Ferrara's work up till now - 6 films including the one under review - this emerges as easily the most substantial (I liked his BODY SNATCHERS [1993] but have always deemed it an unnecessary update).
While Chris Penn has center stage, his character in now way had the depth of soul to be the character he depicted with excessive boredom.
I am now immune to offense by violence.
I've heard some people to call 80s 'The Golden Era' and now after I saw this again after so many years I realized why.
One of the greatest Sci-Fi movies were produced during this 'era' and even if you see them now again they will still keep you excited.
With the bad guys hot on their trail and time running out before the pilot suffocates, the clerk must gain the trust and help of the pilot's unhappy girlfriend (Ryan, Quaid's real life ex-wife now).
It's kinda sad now that Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan have broken up because their paring made it all the more special.
Instead of being inside of a rabbit, Tuck ends in the body of Jack Putter, a hypochondriac who thinks that now is listening to strange voices inside his head.
With Tuck and Jack now having to depend on each other for survival, they team up with Tuck's ex girlfriend Lydia Maxwell (Meg Ryan) to recover the stolen chip before Tuck's air supply runs out.
His irresponsible behaviour and heavy drinking was responsible for Lydia breaking up with him, and he wouldn't be in the situation he's in now if he hadn't recklessly gone through with this hare brained experiment.
With Dennis Quaid's and Meg Ryan's divorce that doesn't seem very likely now.
Jack must now work with Tuck in order to stay alive; and it's a great ride.
Most of these were failures - El Topo once considered a cult film, is virtually unwatchable now.
"This problem now really defines the Post-Mod Western.
On the trail of the once stolen and now missing "Nardo Diamonds", police woman Lee Hamilton (Carole Mathews) infiltrates the female members of said gang behind prison walls.
Every now and then viewers would like to see a loving relationship, so we can ohhh and ahhh.
The series begins on a deceptively cheerful note when young Shuzo Matsutani--who refers to himself as Shu, so that's what I'll call him from now on--is making his way home from a kendo practice match when he sees -- wouldn't you know -- a mysterious, quiet girl sitting alone on a water tower.
It is pathetic and saddening, as Carlin now appears to be in the twilight of his career.
We had a gasoline shortage in 2000 and in August of 2006 and now we have yet another gasoline problem.
This was a very ingeniously performed routine that took a shot at all the ills of pop-culture, the morbid curiosity of your average person, and ultimately the extreme human behavior(exclusive to us so-called "civilized" beings) that shows how primitive we really are...  And for those of you that don't think there's punchlines how 'bout when he talks 'bout "scarfing" and throws in the pun, "think of how many kids are trying to pull this one off" Also he touches on several current topics like obesity, stupidity, and consumerism that are just becoming too much of an issue to ignore, I mean the whole "pretty soon all you'll need to get into college is a pencil" is so true, I mean I know that i'm not as "enlightened" or "educated" as I should be and I know that if I had the same study habits/dedication towards school just 20yrs ago there's no way I'd be able to get a college degree but now i'm just a couple months away from graduating college, just going to show that they're definitely lowering the standards, I mean I'm no dummy either, but still, getting into and graduating college is becoming less of a big deal 'cause the best way to help "educate" the ppl is to lower the standards....
Being in Europe now, yes there are obese ppl, but nothing like the "interstate buses" you see in the US, especially in the Southeastern states...  And as for consumerism, while he's touched on the subject several times the "spending money we don't have on things we don't need" is just becoming more and more evident in society!
I liked it so much I went out and bought it and now I watch it every day.
He is one of those exceptionally rare breeds, in any given professional field, who not only improves with time, but substantially so to an extent that you clearly see all of his work until now has been the foundation for the masterpiece he offers us now.
At times I almost wondered if he was returning to a little of the spirit of his act back in the 70's mixed with his now usual brand of old-man brilliant wit and observance of all things in the world.
I'm just not sure after seeing this right off the bat that it's him at his total best, it's almost as if he's in a transition now into a totally new part of his career.
And now oil crisis helps make more efficient cars.
This program manages to include the entire environmental history of the world, but, coming from a future perspective, takes a good look at where we are now from a somewhat impersonal view.
either film is just amazing, an early showcase for Corey Yuen's skill, exploited so well by Hollywood, now.
Personally, I think that while some of his other movies might be more impressive on a purely sexual scale (the now extremely hard to locate FEMMES DE SADE in particular) this one surely stands as his best combination of hardcore sex with a honest to goodness light 'n' breezy bit o'plot.
Granted, it's been over 10 years since I've seen it (though I'm downloading it right now... found it on Sharaza, hence my urge to look it up here), but it quickly became the standard all other XXX movies had to live up to, since (most don't hold my interest for more than ten minutes.
Desiree Cousteau, wherever you are, I'm available now... MARRY ME!!
Nearly all of this stems from Spock's lack of emotions, which one would think the rest of the crew would have accepted and gotten used to by now.
He comes across as downright callous in some scenes - you'd think he'd know by now that you should at least give the appearance of giving a damn about a fallen comrade.
when by chance I saw an episode I now recognize as a third season one; I was puzzled then since I realized I was missing something from the life's stories of these intriguing characters: it was like intruding in someone else's life, more than a pi standard TV-movie... That's it: I believe you're hooked by the believable interaction of the main characters, their likes and dislikes; some episodes are quite 'poor' and unbelievable, but never awful; other episodes are more complex and well shot; but almost always you'll have some fun with them; and finally Magnum's off screen voice is capturing your attention, and make you another close friend worth of his confidence... After so many years, one day I just missed that feeling and I discovered the two first seasons were published on DVD, so now, after watching them, I feel reassured of not being a 'stranger' in Magnum's world anymore....
I enjoy watching the show as much now as I did when it originally aired.
Tom Selleck is a fabulously famous movie star now, but I always associated him with being "Magnum" the totally cool detective!!
He sure lost it now.
My husband and I have been waiting and watching for this film for three-four years now.
Of course they're the poorest demographic in the country, worse than that of other minorities, comparatively speaking, and still are facing repression and other forms of harassment and forced relocation by the U.S. government (now empire).
I must write 10 line at least, but i think my comment is enough right now!
Who in Gods name does this sort of atrocity happen in Hollywood in the 21st Century....this movie needs to "Bee" re-released toot sweet perhaps now the so called insiders will be able to appreciate just what they missed the first time out.
I wish all movies could be like this... as a matter of fact, I think i am going to watch it again right now!!
Had it been produced by a movie theater production company it would have become a huge hit, but unfortunately it will now probably be lost among the TV movie onslaught.
Next thing you know, our hero has been framed for the murder of a prostitute and he now needs to find out who the real killer is before he's locked away.
Do you mean the American Film Industry has taken all our talent so now there's no-one left and as a result our films are crap or do you mean that Americans are making our films huge box-office hits, through their naivety (being conned), and so we keep making the films you don't like.
That my other cousin well her older sister had to do the same things that Thomas had to do when she was young and when i look back upon it now she never complained she was alway the quite one and she was always there for her sister.
So i now find it so upsetting to just figure it out now what she had to deal with on top of her parents divorcing and what so many other people out there who have autistic people in there families have to manage with and they don't seem to make a fuss about it.
Our main, wealthy brother has had a life changing experience and is now looking to bring his family back together.
The external arc is to reunite with their mother who is now working as a nun in a convent at the "foot of the Himalayas".
Francis is the goofy businessman who spends most of the movie with his head wrapped in bandages after getting into a motorcycle accident prior to hooking up with his brothers; Peter is ostensibly running away from the responsibilities of adulthood as his wife is now 7 Â½ months pregnant back home; and Jack is a struggling writer with a propensity for casual sex (he easily beds a stewardess on the train).
'Darjeeling's' trio of obviously privileged sons have been estranged for a year, since their father's deathÂwhich their mother, Patricia (Angelica Houston), now in a convent near the Himalayas, chose not even to attend.
There are quite a few units available to all three sides, in spite of further increase in efficiency... engineers are removed, it's now the sides' main infantry unit that can take over buildings, and it's no longer instantaneous, to give a quick example.
This one the same only now it's from Asia.
SMG's Cindy seems deep until you get to the end of the movie, but I'm wondering now if that was the plan.
They now see right through all the smiling, lying faces of their nasty relatives, and are not exactly forgiving of all their bad deeds and deception.
For part three, not only is Dracula replaced by the much older Rutger Hauer, but he is now 'the embodiment of evil' reaching back as far as ancient Egypt.
Dracula is dead... now the priest has turned his back on god and is the new "king" of the undead.. along with his beloved Julia.. and Luke.. well poor Luke is just alone in the world without a dime to his name..
These are the guys I would get to do the score of every vampire movie made, now and in the future.
That Dracula once handsome and alluring, now takes a worn out and gaunt look.
Although Lizzie is now a vampire, she is amazed at how devoted Luke has been to her throughout the whole ordeal.
He has now turned into a Socialist nut case.
I'm glad this was free to download or made about as cheap as a film from a major filmmaker (and say what you will, like him or hate him, it's your right either way, he is a major filmmaker now in America), because it is a lessor effort.
It's good for one watch, even for those who want it right away, and then to move on along as it's now four plus years gone anyway.
the french would love this movie even now.
In general, the film translates well to tape--the biggest loss are car scenes where two-shots become alternating one-shots, and the squabble outside the diner, a three shot in the theater (inscrutable dude leaning against store shutters), now mostly a two-shot, which really removes a lot of the dry wit.
I've been wanting to watch this film for quite a while now.
i do not know why i have not posted a comment on this film before now.
The good doctor has taken the Elephant Man away from the glares and the scowls of the circus audience, the exploitation that he's had to face, and put him a kinder and more loving environment; only now the scowls and stares come not from the circus audience, but from society's upper crust, who want to exploit the Elephant Man themselves for their own selfish reasons - to impress their friends.
I was 10 years old (now 26) and this film was the first gore horror i laid my eyes on and it's mentally scared me in a way.
Now and again i watch the odd clip of it on youtube and even now it gives me this strange feeling that 'i don't really want to be watching this'..
Burt Lancaster(who I just thought was great, though he battled with the accent just a bit..a minor squabble)portrays Bob Valdez, a former Apache hunter for the Calvary now a constable who accidentally shoots an innocent black man claimed to have murdered the husband of Gay Erin(the beautiful redheaded Susan Clark).
Burt was sleeping but now he is wide awake and woe to those who mistreated him.
His history makes him a very dangerous man, although he now only wants to live in peace.
As many of you can only watch it on DVD/VHS now, let me give you an info.
I have now watched it from beginning to end on three occasions, and it continues to blow me away.
There's one problem - now John's mother has been murdered by a killer John has been tracking in the present day.
They must now race against time 30 years apart to stop this killer before he can kill John's mother/Frank's wife, and several other women.
I have watched it again, now that it's  on video, and it holds up to multiple viewings.
Jim Caviezel ("The Thin Red Line") plays his son, now a cop, thirty years later.
It is about two girls who lost their mother and now live with their father, and they learn the meaning of life by working at the fathers dairy farm!
I also enjoyed Hellcop, who's played by CJ Graham, who was Jason in "Friday the 13th, Part 6" and who is now a general manager at a local Las Vegas Casino.
I've never been quite sure about the final scene of this movie: Lenny on the couch, quietly humming to himself, seemingly at a loss as the camera lingers on him for a thoughtful moment, is he already on his way to becoming dissatisfied again now that he has attained his desire or has he finally found some peace after his battle for Kelly?
A remake with Ben Stiller in the Lenny role is now in the works, soon in the offing.
I doubt your dad will like it either, but if you're a young guy, and have a twisted sense of humor....rent it now.
first by the movie i had to force myself thru right now, as well as by the amazingly high rating it got on IMDb.
OK now on to my rant about Priestly!
I have not stopped talking about it, and they are all now convinced to go see it, when it hits the big screens.
In other words, I want the DVD, and I want it right now!
Maybe now the PTB will recognize what a gifted and talented actor Ackles is.
Friends of IMDb :  i've just finished watching this movie , and i am telling you its one of the best movies i have ever seen ...  i've noticed that there's only 197 votes till now ... is that possible ?
And now, almost 75 years later, One Way Passage can still hold a viewer's attention with its story of some passengers on a last voyage before everything changes.
If, while watching Satyricon you find yourself wandering whether it is going to wrap up finally into an understandable conclusion after which you can satisfactorily murmur `ahh yes, now I got it'.
If, while watching Satyricon you find yourself wandering whether it is going to wrap up finally into an understandable conclusion after which you can satisfactorily murmur `ahh yes, now I got it'.
Encolpio attends the decadent banquet of a former slave, Trimalcione, now filthy rich.
Desperately upset, Encolpio decides to set sail for Africa on a merchant ship owned by the once-poor and bitter old poet Eumolpo, now as filthy rich and decadent as Trimalcione, whom he had once criticised for his parvenu vulgarity.
I've probably hyped the film too much now, but the final scenes in the forest and Sadako's old home are really that good.
Reportedly a free adaptation of the now fragmentary writings of Petronius, the film also makes fleeting references to various scattered works and myths of antiquity.
I don't remember exactly my age when I watched it for the first time(I think I was 11) but since the time I watched for the first time until now I cannot be tired of the story!
Charlie now needs to go to Hell , with Sam's help he gets a car from the 50's and a special gun, to destroy the monsters and save his girl.
The ghost of a New Orleans now lost haunts David Fincher's lyrical adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story about a man who ages backwards.
One need only look at the politically and culturally engaged films of the seventies to see what we are missing now.
The Curious Case Of Benjamin button is now easily in my top 5 greatest movies of all time.
I'm getting off- track now, so let me just say this is possibly the best film of the year, and many years to come.
There's a telling sequence around the middle of the film, where Button, by now a merchant seaman holed up in a dingy hotel in Murmansk, strikes up a relationship with a bored wife of a minor British official (Tilda Swinton).
If you want examples I will be happy to give them, but not now because I really don't feel like it, there are too many to mention without being asked for it.
But seriously how on Earth can you call this a good movie, and Michael Medved must be out of work by now because there is no way any decent movie reviewer would recommend this movie to anyone.
The now famous Ben Stiller, in the beginning of his career, is very hilarious in the role of a cook, and also as Attila the Hun at the table with Hitler and Cleopatra.
go get it now.
Hard Boiled-a top notch action film from Hong Kong must be hailed as a true role model for all action films.It is one of the best action films of its kind where speedy action mixes freely with dramatic sequences.This is something which creates a feeling in the minds of viewers that they are not being taken for granted as everything that is being depicted is serving some kind of purpose.One of most amazing things about John Woo's film "Lat sau san taam" is that its actions scenes are truly unbelievable.They have been filmed with such an accurate precision that they would easily put to shame some of the most accomplished artists whose every stroke is the result of immense patience and concise concentration.Hard Boiled is also a film with a bizarre twist as we get to see some hardworking cops mixing freely with hardened criminals.Although gang violence is a core issue of the film John Woo has not deceived fans of melodrama by showing how difficult it is to lead a life of a cop.The best part of this film comes in the form of John Woo appearing every now and then Ã  la Alfred Hitchcock.
If you're the average IMDB reader, you probably enjoy a good action movie every now and then, but you approach action films with a certain caution and skepticism (I can't blame you, even though I am an action junkie myself).
Just half-a-minute ago the receptionist said i should disappear 'cause i'm not allowed in here, now he really believes April's a pizza-girl and lets me in...
The game has been around for over a year now.
By now, 1926, Keaton knows what he's doing and knows where he's going, and thus this is a pretty clean and well-put together movie.
It could be said that the stage musical actually ends on rather a limp note plot-wise, but this problem has now been neatly licked.
No, for me the whole sex and drugs and rock roll mystique is shot to bits here and I can only hope that the Stones themselves are a bit older and wiser now.
Having now seen the film, it becomes clear that it isn't unfair to figure on why it never seen the official light of public day.
Richards and friends, in now as a clichÃ© today, throwing the TV out the hotel room window), but just rock in general.
I have never heard of this title and now I know why.
He cannot handle the fact that her Madonna image is now shattered for him.
which ain't bad,, i guess i'm used to lots of action , gunplay,, something,, although there is a lot of good ole fashioned nudity in here, i just i would call this movie very disjointed at times and that is being kind, this movie took a few years to make,, and now i think i see why.
Well the boy and mom didn't get the kill, but at least now they are men, well sort of, in a way.
In terms of the 'operatic' plot, it's completely logical; two men have had a go at Jeb, now it's a woman's turn, and the stakes are even higher.
To be honest i didn't even know about Red Dwarf until about five years ago, now i have Series I-VIII (all of them) on DVD.
The only survivors, were 'Dave Lister', played by the enigmatic and downright hilarious 'Craig Charles' (now appearing as Loyd Mullaney in Coronation Street), who had just been placed in stasis for smuggling aboard his female cat (Frankenstein), who then turned out to be the only other survivor.
It's now just a matter of time for the train to pull up and for them, with Baron as the shooter, to get the president in their cross-hairs.
It's still cheesy and low budget, but at least now they have resources to explore other locations and meet new characters.
It is now ten years since the transmission of Season Eight.
Last of the main character's from the early seasons (Kochanski replacing Rimmer for a small time in season 7) is the obnoxious but oddly lovable Cat, who is a descendant from a cat Lister smuggled aboard (Which is the reason Dave was put into stasis and how he became the only human alive) who has now become a human looking and sounding up himself cat mutant who has an odd addiction to fashion.
I've seen Suddenly a couple of times now and found it quite gripping.
I have been begging TCM for a couple of years, now, to please, air this movie.
**SPOILERS** Experiencing nightmares walking in her sleep and missing time since she was 4 years old Judith English's, Markie Post, teenage daughter Katie,Candace Cmeron, is now going through the same things!
She also finds that their somehow connected to what her daughter, Katie, is having now.
Alone and forced to forge an alliance with some belligerent Vikings, Kainan has some work to do...namely, killing a vicious beast called the Moorwen, which had stowed away in his ship and is now wreaking havoc in Viking Land.
Opposing him are the town's sheriff, the always watchable Sterling Hayden, and Secret Service agent Carney, who happens to be friends with James Gleason's Pop, a former agent now retired who owns the hilltop house that Sinatra and company plan on using to carry off their deed (with a high-powered rifle).
Now now.
And as the future king looks bluntly down on the corpses of what had healed ill feelings towards, now giving the sense that he morned that he had to bury his ill feelings towards the deceased with a feeling of loss of an comrade.
Being the mature and responsible grown man I am now, I didn't exactly do that - instead, I recommended it to all my friends and watched it 3 times.
"Outlander" is a great surprise by director Howard McCain - honestly never heard of him before, but I'll be keeping an eye on his work from now on!
When in fact, the "dragon" he is referring to, is a monster from another planet, now hunting the viking populace and fauna of the land.
I realize this is now making the movie sound a little lame: it isn't Lord of the Rings, but it is definitely worth the price of the ticket.
Viewed this film which was called "A Friendship to Die For", and through out the entire picture you noticed a clock in quite a few scenes and I wondered why, now I find out the picture was really called "Tick Tock" and it makes more sense.
'What are we doing now?'
I would love to talk to these early explorers or see what they saw and I admire them for their courage and sense of adventure, and if they still exist somewhere, how funny it all must seem to them now.
This is a very good cartoon that I intend to watch many times more in the future, but for now I will publish these modest comments based on my experience of having seen it only once.
now, especially with all these modern gadgets coming out, kids don't feel like they should earn anything and feel like they don't need to respect anything.
The episode I just watched feature Jazmine who was formerly in foster care but now a full time brat.
MTV has started featuring the children of celebrities now as well.
The Jerry Springer show was the tin standard for all these years, but now along comes MY SUPER SWEET 16 to sink lower into the primordial muck of TV.
While the film's attitudes can seem daring today, it's worth keeping in mind that its message (that weapons are morally neutral tools, which good people can use for good purposes) was as politically correct in 1954 as liberal "guns are bad" rhetoric is now, and in that context a mother's objection to her child playing with cap guns or seeing war movies can be portrayed as a neurosis.
But for now, I'll take being dead broke and happy, if means my ego is in check.
At least now most of us know how lucky we are not to be associated with any of them.
He too served in the military to protect rights and freedoms and now carries on the good fight as Suddenly's sheriff.
Apart from maintaining their incestuous lesbian relationship, the women now also compete for the sexual interest of their male guest, and it doesn't take too long before ambiguous conspiracies are thought up.
Not saying they weren't nuts before, but I'm guessing father wouldn't have approved of everything they're now doing....even though father was a murderer.
As with "Lady Snowblood" (1973) which I put in my two cents recently, they might be at the vanguard of their respective genres at the time, but now, 30 odd years later, they haven't age well at all.
The actors and actresses altogether have managed to make me feel various feelings throughout the movie and i have to admit that i have watched it over 10 times by now!!!
How the translation of Hsia Nu got to become A Touch of Zen, I'll never know - and it's too late to change it now as A Touch of Zen is how the film is known outside of China.
now, i LOVE zombies, & have sat through some terrible films in the search for a lost classic, or even just something remotely entertaining.
What seems like eons ago now, I used to invite myself over to my best friend's house at least twice a week just to play WarCraft.
So now I'll get into the story.
So now these folks are trapped in the elevator.
Horrible things happened back then and now there are movies to show us it all.This is a movie about hope.Hope is still there in the dramatic ending.Hope is seen through the tears.Isn't that, hope, all we need in the end?
I have derived several chuckles and hearty guffaws from reading the numerous digs others have made on the film here at IMDB, and now share a special bond with them.
"I'm going to kill them now (babysitter and her porn-star mother)" Lorenzo says as he arises from bed, then over to his computer where he starts writing.
So now the boys were forced to work for the bitter chef.
Now we all know what happened the last time Stan and Ollie tried moving a piano, and there is a brief reenactment; After moving the piano into the mountains, they now had to brave a rope bridge over a seemingly bottomless gorge.
I was too young to remember the original series some of the early ones i was not even born to see but thanks to one UK TV channel bring it back i am now hooked.
It's only by virtue of UKTV G2 (or Dave, as it now prefers) that I'm able to watch re-runs of this.
I hope it keeps playing on the DAVE channel so others who missed it first time round can see it now.
I would have liked a bit more conversation about his Stateside Filmirage productions (not a single question about TROLL 2; granted it wasn't the cult film then it was now).
Joe D'Amato personifies an incredible period in Continental cinema that has now passed.
But, and now for the review part, poking fun at stuff that happens to everyone every day, or stuff that is so simple, you can't almost imagine how to make it funny, that is another trick.
And thus he delivered a show that is as funny now as it was years ago.
I rented it this week after he died and watched it twice more (up to around 6 or 7 viewings by now).
RIP Richard,thank you for the laughs and joy and now the sadness you brought us all,we will never ever forget you....
PS : If you can, watch the over stand up performance :  Here and now and Live at the sunset strip!
I see that such essence of a festival is now all lost.
I heard varying comments prior to watching this film, and I have to say that I shall always follow my gut instinct from now on.
And now I cannot thank the friend more for showing what I think is the best cinematic production in Bollywood ever.
we say we want different films now but when a director attempts a different film, we absolutely bash it and end up taking out as many flaws as we can.
now where was the city situated, in which era it is happening all this is not important.
Go and see it now!
If you haven't got this game, get it now, you won't regret it.
He is now awaiting trial in at the International Court in The Hague for crimes against humanity for his role with the RUF.
I am so lucky that I found this at a flea market, now all i need is the soundtrack.
Not as corny as it sounds now back then.Every voice is perfect for the characters.
This is a wonderful film - expertly voiced over by Billy Crystal, Gilda Radner and Harry Shearer (of Spinal Tap / Simpsons fame) - full of humour and genuine affection towards sports, animals and animation (which is top quality throughout it should be noted) and as i mentioned before the songs are great - perhaps a bit dated now with the late 70s/early 80s production, but then a great tune never fails to touch you somehow, no matter how it is presented.
Our family found it a favorite when it first came out - and now that I am retired I still enjoy having a laugh at it now and then.
I saw it in 87 and loathed it then, and I'm absolutely sure that it is just as bad now.
Once outside, they both bump into the evil guy, who some how managed to break away from being completely wrapped in web and from the spiders layer and never tells us how, and he blows up to reveal a medium sized spider(think of Eight Legged Freaks spiders, but a bit smaller) and now the scary-o-meter reaches -4.
Good news for all admirers: this film is now indeed out on DVD (2006 release), with an interesting lengthy text biography of the novel's author (Vita Sackville-West) among the special features.
i wont tell u the end because hopefully by now your on the edge of your seat and you will have to by or rent this movie 9/10
I now live in the United Kingdom and have search old Library files for information on this Movie.
I now am going to attempt to get my hands on the book.
I have told others about it over the years and now one else remembers it.
I can see it now in my mind after all these years.
Her daughter is now pregnant (due late 3/2K6) and so wishing her mother was with us to enjoy and experience her grandchild.
I now realize it was the first time I ever heard of this terrible thing called cancer.
I now have a stepdaughter the same age I was when I first saw this movie and I only wish she could view it too.
I would love to have a DVD or video of it to share with the four children I now have.
Her daughter must be about 36 now, and I'm sure she is really proud of her mom.
We both want to see it now, me because I loved it so much originally, and her because I've told her about how great it is, and how sad it is, and how its the type of movie that never leaves you, once you've seen it, it just touches you.
It's playing right now at the Regal in Henrietta, NY and you absolutely must see this movie if you are in the area.
In any event, we took my friend's father, (a cardiac surgeon in the area) to see it, and he was so inspired by the film that he now delivers pizzas part-time on his moped in addition to his surgeon gig.
now there's something to be said for that.
It has Hallmark stamped all over it - it's perfect family entertainment about a man who, in looking for forgiveness, finds that he can't undo what happened, but he can create what happens now.
All-in-all a welcome breath of fresh air in Hindi cinema which has now shown lots of promise with the advent of a new crop of directors and script writers who believe that cinema is not only about endless strings of song and dance woven around opulent weddings and display of wealth, which would be as out of place in middle class India as anywhere else in the world.
But now, with the magic of DVD and the power of digital remastering, you can almost feel as you're there among the other Queen fans.
I've been operatically trained for 7yrs now and am about to go to school for vocal performance and I think Freddie's got a ton of talent!
Having a demonstration that evening of his new invention Houghland puts the people assembled there to sleep with a long and boring monologue about how we can now see events all across the world on his TV gadget without any relay systems.
By now the movie is going nowhere with the cast just standing around looking off screen for directions from the obviously lost in space director.
With the movie finally over we and the movie cast can now all get back to something far more exhilarating like breathing oxygen.
Things get even more convoluted when our team receives word the mine needs the cannon, like, now because some miners are trapped and - cue ominous trumpets - Forster's brother is among them.
Her modest little dreams now dashed beyond repair.
With Nick suddenly becoming the family bread-winner he drifted into a life of crime and worked himself up, over those six years, from petty theft to what he's now being accused of, the murder of a law enforcement officer.
Ahead of it's time, even though very dated now, "Knock on any Door" gets into the background of it's accused killer like a scalpel used by a neurosurgeon goes into the brain of his patient.
The entire movie goes from Nick's trial to his past, through a series of flashbacks and shows how he got to where is is now; on trial for his life.
The film is a further example of how porn films now shot on video, just don't seem to cut it (barring, of course, the way above average output of Directors Micheal Zen, Brad Armstrong, and few others) My Porn Grade: B-
I watched The Trial of the Incredible Hulk on TV a while ago and I actually liked it, I've seen it three times now.
I now have read about the huge price Werner & his people were asking for it.
Then, suddenly, upon leaving the theater it's now 1927.
Brian Aherne plays Booth Templeton, an old-time Broadway actor who's reluctant to continue his career now that most of his peers have passed on.
When he arrives back in the present, he soon has a new appreciation for the "here and now" and is able to begin his career again in earnest.
This is actually a very human story of an actor who has had acclaim throughout his career, but who has now reached that age where his appearance no longer benefits him.
Apparently this concept isn't so new or innovating at all, as the obscure (although less obscure now, with its recent release on DVD) and still criminally underrated 70's gem "Chosen Survivors" thrives on a similar premise.
i would love to watch this movie again, just to see if it has the same effect now as it did then.
A pretty rare film now and just as hard to get hold of but i recommend anyone who enjoys this genre as much as me to do what you can to get hold of a copy.
In the hospital, he's rehabilitated, though he now walks with a cane and limp.
The opening segment of the movie really didn't make any sense until now.
His mother Olive (Stockard Channing) discovers his status, hears about AIDS patients' ability to cash in on life insurance early, and infects herself so that she can take advantage of the early insurance cash to provide a life of comfort in the small time they both now have for herself and her now fatherless son.
One evening, while on his way home, he finds his house surrounded by a chemical defense agency that claims his house is now in the hands of terrorists that plan to make the whole city ground zero.
The grandfather owned a real estate business and now it belongs to Will.
Watching it now, its probably not as good as I remembered it 13 years ago, but its still lots of fun as a time waster.
This doesn't make Wildcats anything more than it is and Goldie's career has continued in this vein with one bright spot now and again ("Death becomes her" had its moments).
Funny that the mental processes of advertising executives was as unfathomable then as it is now.
I couldn't figure out if it's "I did yo mama, and now I'm gonna do you, too" or "Look, we must be sophisticated cause we're showing interracial relationships".
", and now film makers are making non-linear films.
Similar to another documentary The Aristocrats, on which reveals the worlds most depraved and sickening hilarious joke only known to comedians, interviewed comedians and their love of this, till now, secret joke.
At one time it was rarely used, and now in some movies/songs it is used over 280 times.
The story holds strong in that, for the time, they didn't need nearly as much special effects as we use now.
STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning   I'm rather glad I'm now a member of the internet based LoveFilm rather than still renting films from a video shop, because I'd hate to have to phone up and reserve this film.
The hypocrisies and oddities are of course on display, like with the now legendary George Carlin 'Dirty Words' case where the one and only person to report that the segment played on the radio was wrong was on the Decency board in the 70s.
There's also a good segment done on the f word in politics and religion, even in poetry (I'll have to look through Ulysses now to see where it's at).
What we do know is that now the word is held as vile filth by some, while others use it daily.
I now know why it was forgotten.
OK, now here is a ghost story that came way under my radar and turns out to be a superior ghost story with a couple of twists.
After installing a door she finds in the cellar, strange things begin to happen and what were her nightmares are now becoming too real.
Getting her start when her now ex-husband submitted nude pictures of Stacy to Gallery magazine, she parlayed a follow-up spread in Hustler magazine into a trip to Hollywood in early 1995 to make her mark in adult videos.
(Stacy filmed her last adult video in February, and is now selling a pair of female clothing lines, "Good Girl" and "Bad Girl".)
I wonder if Monster.com has any listings for Merry Men jobs -- now with equal opportunity I could apply.   
Of course they hated it but now that they have gotten older, they will actually ask me to sing it but I just cannot master it like Jan Duggan.
Here was an actress, now nearly forgotten, who could easily equal in hilarity even Fields himself.
As a computer guy, I'm now working with several from India, and this struck some chords.
I have been an Indian for 28 years now, and have not seen my culture or country being made portrayed more awfully than this.
An excellent movie that shows just what happens when people, who are used to such poverty, now are in a position to have a little money and what happens when they get it and are not used to the consequences.
Right now, we in India are facing the same issue with the rise of "cheap" workers in the Philippines, who may be doing a good job a few years down the line.
Beyond application to corporate, what the world needs now is people who can shift perspective in a nanosecond and change world views so that the assumptions are smoked out.
- especially since I haven't watched these films for what seems like ages - but I won't be doing so immediately, given that a second set is actually coming in March; that said, of the 10 films included, only 1 will be a first-time viewing for me - THE DAWN PATROL (1938) - but it would still be great to have these childhood favorites readily available on the new medium (rather than in the worn, and often colorized, prints I've had to make do with up till now)!
And now, ten years later (and 24 y/o), I'm doing it again.
it was way back in 1993 when lois and clark aired the first season i was just 3 years old now i'm 17 i can fully appreciate the brilliance of this show Dean Cain Is By Far The Best Clark Kent/Superman and Teri Hatcher Is The Best Lois Lane/Kent it is not only about the man of steal it's also about the romance between lois and clark.
The chemistry between Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher was incredible, something you rarely see on television shows now.
While Lois is still very much her tenacious self, Clark Kent was now a confident, well-adjusted guy and was a far cry from the bumbling Clark of the films and comics.
I liked Dean Cameron, Bil Dwyer and Will Sasso but seeing this now, there is little to enjoy.
By the way ladies... he's married now and has a couple kids so don't get any ideas :P I give this movie a 10 simply because of the utterly gorgeous girl who plays Beth.
When they were over she got a stunning ovation and she confessed that looking back now, she was real proud to have been associated with these films.
Edge is main event caliber now and is great in his heel role, while Cena is not the best wrestler and has received increased animosity from the older male audience, tired of his hip hop white boy image.
If you love what now would be called 'red-band' trailers (the greats ones that don't skimp on the good stuff, be it any of the three B's: blood, boobs, and/or bush), this compilation of trailers for low-budget 'grindhouse' movies is definitely for you.
There's about twenty of them I have to buy now.
I need a cigarette now--9/10.
Some young filmmakers cut their teeth on lowbrow, meant-for-drive-in (now direct-to-video) B-movies with little money and even fewer expectations.
Once they were given bigger budgets and higher quality scripts, they matured into the masters they are now.
I have been a Robert Duvall fan for many years now so when this movie showed up on my DVR I naturally watched it.
something many would never watch on their own, but now that you're there, you're drawn into the story.
I had already submitted some (Seasons 9, 10 and 11 are done) but from now on I will write in order (with the exception of course of the up-coming 7 episodes of Season 13 that thankfully begin airing next Wednesday).
Right now we all know the extremely bizarre biography of one of the characters, of one of the residents of the town of South Park, Colorado, of Mr. Garrison.
This is the very first episode of South Park entitled "Cartman Gets An Anal Probe".It has the worst animation in the series because it was made using construction paper...but we never looked at the animation in this show anyway.Nowadays, South Park has plenty of its humor stemming from current events and politics.I like this, I like all episodes of South Park, but its pretty interesting to go back to a time when it was just funny fart jokes with a simplistic plot.In this episode, Cartman recalls a dream he had where he was dragged on a ship and got an anal probe from aliens.However it was not really a dream and the aliens have come to south park.Cartman just thinks the other boys are trying to scare him though.The visitors kidnap Kyle's brother Ike and now they must go find him.With the help of the school cafeteria chef(played by Issac Hayes R.I.P), they get out of school and try to get Kyle's brother back.Meanwhile, officer barbrady has been investigating why the cows are being mutilated.This episode was originally 26min long.You can find this extended version of the episode on the internet.It makes a few changes, such as Cartman having a father and a sister and an introduction to Nurse Gollum(without the fetus on her head).Overall, its the not the best episode but it is pretty funny and good.
More films about this era should be made, but for now, see this one.
Everyone can see now that the Olsen twins can't act a little bit.
Really now, and did anyone notice that security was so tight, even though Levy's character had a police badge that he couldn't get it, but Jane got in no problem and the security lifted her right on to the stage?
This gives the movie a distinct atmosphere, and already shows the path that MÃ©liÃ¨s was taking at that stage in his career, as that very same year he would start making his now famous series of fantasy films, which would be far more complex than his "gimmick films".
The four old college buddies, now in their forties, try to help each other but have to cope with their own difficulties as well.
Too naive perspective on the "enemy turns friend" issue spoils its own value as a report on the actualities of the Korean War, and it is really hard to dispute that the image of war and peace in this movie is totally based on the populism toward the North Korea which gains currency in South Korea now.
World cinema is far popular now than when i first got into it and i'm not to sure thats such a good thing because there was a time where only the best titles made there way to this country, a time where renting a foreign film guaranteed quality but that changed with the sudden American studio interest.
I've now watched this movie twice in the space of four days.
What now emerges is a band of brothers newly united in a common cause.
The two groups of soldiers are now bound to work together in the fields to fill the storage of the village and they will actually rub off on each other somehow.
A fine movie which addresses a subject that is now relevant in England if not other countries.
While we have previously seen Audrey Tautou playing a Turkish chambermaid in Stephen Frear's Dirty Pretty Things, we now see another critically acclaimed French actress playing the role of Bosnian Muslim immigrant.
I just saw a free screening of this film, which is now called Smiling Fish and Goat on Fire.
This might sound mildly amusing and maybe it was back in the 50's but now the whole thing is so predictable and laboured, with most gags being repeated ad nauseum that the only reaction is to groan.
Now Eddie Murphey at a time was a great comedic talent, but now he chooses all of these bad films.
****END SPOILERS***** The only thing that I got depressed about was that the Star Trek franchise is at a standstill right now, and this reminded me of everything I loved about it
That said, even this Eddie Murphy vehicle can't stop my belief that by now Eddie Murphy should be flipping burgers somewhere.
Unfortunately for them, he was...and now he's after them, determined to give them all his undivided attention...one victim at a time.
I disagree with earlier posters who see this as an AIDS allegory and question, "Haven't we gotten beyond that by now?"
I view it as a weird compliment that gays can now be killed in a slasher film, as main characters in a "pointless" film designed to scare the bejeezus out of you (and succeeding admirably).
I'd like to see a sequel, but I think if they were going to make one, they'd have made it by now... Or, six years later, the psycho killer could have escaped and is hellbent (hehe) on tracking down Jake and Eddie (who are still together and in love of course... or maybe they've split up (over some trivial misunderstanding) and the new danger brings them back together for a bitter reunion... but in the end they realise they still love each other...
Having finally gotten a chance to see it at a regular theater, I now know why.
Actually now that I think about it, this movie is very similar to Jaws, maybe thats why the story line works.
This movie made me realize that now matter how bad things get, there is always someone worse.
Well, the baby crocodiles you see in the closing of the other movie apparently have grown up, and now have decided to pick up where their parents left off, and eat lots of people.
I like this movie now because not only does it show something of New Zealand's past and the possibilities the film-makers foresaw (some of which later came to pass as part of NZ history) but because it is an early vehicle for several New Zealand film-maker's craft.
And from now on, when he battles, it will be on behalf of the Catholic Church.
The final shot is what makes this a dark-tinged romance more than anything else; Vlad and Lidia, walking hand-in-hand through a thick mist, two souls, we are led to assume, that are now spending their eternal damnation together.
Vlad Tepes had the Saxons of Transilvania account for their transgressions against the conquered local Romanian population and it was because of the vengeful literate Germans who wrote exacerbated stories about him that he was later on remembered as the sadistic figure we now read of in the history books.
So now of course this is where Kate Tsui and Simon Yam come in and try to catch him.
It focuses primarily on one character named Smith (played by the now famous Sam Neil).
Another sequel is scheduled for 2008, and now that I've seen all other parts of the series, I'll give it a try (It can't be worse than part 4).
The novel massively boosted my opinion of the great author Â even after having read his entire collection of fascinating Sherlock Holmes stories (which took me a good six months) Â and 'The Lost World' now ranks among my all-time favourites.
Fortunately, more complete restorations are now available, and, in 2004, an incomplete tinted/toned/hand-coloured nitrate 35mm print of the original version was uncovered.
We see: Brontosaurus(or Apatosaurus as it is known now)Allosaurus,Triceratops,Tyrannosaurus Rex and more.
the tall man isn`t exactly 25 years old now is he.it would not be the same if they replaced him with some one else i hope they make part5 the last.
Only problem is, when he left, he went to Boston to become a cop, and now he's undercover and infiltrating his old friends.
Speaking of whiskey, I have been celebrating St Patricks day every year since '95 by downing several glasses of Jameson, and viewing STATE OF GRACE.----now thats Irish.
The first time I watched this I hated it, the second time I loved it, I don't know why, and now every time I watch it I love it, I guess the first time I just didn't like it.
In the midst of this very dangerous situation enters Terry Noonan (Sean Penn), Jackie's best friend from childhood who is now a cop and undercover with the directive to do no less than take down Frank's entire gang.
He soon hooks up with his old friends, including Jackie and his brother Frankie; who is now the head of the Irish mafia.
But the fact that Fellini and Rossellini are stirring up such thoughts among such touching and near-perfect acting and stylizing (there's even a slight touch of humor in the early scenes with Fellini) and not forcing them on the viewer, not to sound catchy about it, is a miracle in and of itself, and one of the director's best films taking into account the two as L'Amore... Be advised though- as of now this film is EXTREMELY hard to find, and only after many months and more money than I'd care to say I discovered a copy on video, so only if you feel a strong urge to see the film (likely, as with myself, from having seen the clips from My Voyage to Italy) would I recommend it.
I'm 25 now, and find myself rather worried at some of the cartoons that are produced these days.
I must've seen it 20 times by now, and I still can't pass it up when it appears on some random cable station at 1 in the morning!
Not a movie to be missed, although the clothes and music are slightly dated now.
While dealing with his own problems of how to tell Nanon he really isn't armless, he now has to contend with the strongman who also has developed feelings for the girl.
It has a decadent atmosphere but it is the twisted second half of the oeuvre that gives to the film, if it is possible, more boldness, darkness and evil, not to mention that it is always a pleasure to check up again and again on this wonderful and terrible circus troupe, surely a collection of the most hideous, complicated and malicious people found in the whole silent world..  And now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must join such a strange and perverse circus troupe.
When Alonzo returns from his ordeal he discovers that Nanon has gotten over her fear of men's hands and now plans to marry Malabar.
For viewers then as much as now, there is also the whole milieu, director Tod Browning's leaning to the macabre and the small time circus.
There may be worse gay indy films out there...okay, not that many, but one or two...okay, one (but I can't remember the title right now).
The angry young man is anything but that now!
'Young' went quite a few years ago (he's a grandfather now, for god's sake!
Two parent that have been there in the boy's first steps and first words now have to be there in his first and only death.
It appealed to me mostly because of it's dramatic story (which playing now, I realize has suffered from a poor translation,)and its imaginative environments.
the film made me question my so-called love for my culture.i guess now i really appreciate the culture that has been handed down.and though i may hate the communist-minded people i like the spirit.
Oh, and now that our list of little complaints is quite long already, I don't think the titular lake actually qualifies as a lake.
So nasty makes me want to hurl, literally made me gag, and is making me gag thinking about it right now.
I hope some others from horrorfest are worth watching, but I won't chance it now (not when you have to pay full price for every single movie).
OK now you have a good idea what to expect if you're forced to endure this crappy little film.
And the ghost of Jodie (now looking like the identical twin brother of Stellan Skarsgard) comes back to offer some suspicious advice.
Since Coscarelli is busy with other projects right now it seems unlikely that the long-rumored Phantasm's End will happen any time soon.
Thinking about it now I am not to sure why.
Often when you manage to catch a hold of things from your childhood they are not as well made as you remember them, but, if it really sticks in your mind they must have got something right other than just glossy special effects we now come to expect.
So his mother decides that now, they have to flee to Texas to stay with her mother.
And now they have mafia, crooked cops, and the FBI on their tail... the chase is on.
On hearing the news, Louie, now driven solely by vengeance on the would be kidnappers, returns to his old turf, but peace & profits are the last thing on his mind, and you half expect him to utter Al Pacino's memorable line "Just when I thought I was out....they pull me back in"  Ayres, although brilliant in his role was probably miscast, especially when you had the best movie tough guy in world playing the lead's sidekick.
Cagney here has a minor role as right hand man to Louie and one-time boyfriend of Louie's now bored wife Doris.
I think that by now you know what you're in for.
Though every now and then, it appears to go a little over-board with the whole racism awareness biz, the show was definitely an anchor point for individuals who felt that they were not equally represented in the pool of superheroes that we know of today.
Hesitant at first the leaders of the crime gangs soon see the genius of Ricarno's master plan in that they now can runs their illegal business's without the fear of being rubbed out by each other.
Louie has his hoods gun Gimpy down and leave his body on the gutter as a warning to the now terrified Midget.
A street-like Justice that he in fact meted out so many times to others is now what Louie Ricarno is to receive himself!
Louie, now hardened more than ever, returns to the city, swearing vengeance.
You know they say that nothing great came out of Fresno; Besides raisins, This was until now with HRH.
We are now watching it on DVD taken out from the library.
As a matter of fact, I couldn't name one now if you asked me.
I have now amended my rating of Drunken Monkey from 6 to 7 - if it wasn't for some very silly things (like, why is the "young uncle" suddenly considered head of the family??
), it could have gone as high as 8 (edit: which in fact it now has).
Edit (may 10, '05): Having seen the movie again, I am now up to an 8 rating.
Sadly, those films are about 10 years old now.
Although it is now regaining cult status for martial arts fans as a fantastic piece of film.
The great thing about this film is that you will never get bored with it - I've watched it over 50 times now and it still doesn't let up.
Dacascos deserves much better than the dross he's been in up until now - hopefully Brotherhood of the Wolf will net him some more major roles.
If Mark Dacascos had played his cards right he'd be where Jet Li is right now.
Ah, now I saw this film whilst browsing as you do, and thought I'd make a comment as this is a favourite of mine.
The plot is about as complex as a glass of water, but forget that for now, this is a film you watch for the action, for the cheesy comedy factor, for the hyper-kinetic, lighting quick scenes of martial arts mayhem.
(3) Box displays a fallen Hollywood star now resigned to doing B-movie leads lying in the grass in full cameo fatigues with a sniper's rifle.
From now on I couldn't help but to compare with the original.
So now they have only one option: commit some crimes to raise money and save for the trip to South America.
John Kerry who was a hero in Vietnam now turned out to be a first class wimp, by letting Bush & the Republicans step all over him, when running for the highest office in the land.
All his life he was a bad guy on the wrong side of the tracks, but now he's going home and he's trying to make things right.
But now the entire NYPD wants Eddie dead, and Mosley is there to protect him.
So under McKenna's pen we go from a brutal crime flick about one man's darkness in the 1971 film to a crime flick still, but now Carter is the Angel of Justice or something and far less dimensional.
Sly plays a bad-ass hitman who is a former prisoner too and he finds out that his brother has been killed and now he is pissed and he will make the killer pay.
Somewhere in Sly's body, Rocky is in there lurking who comes out every now and then to make us cheer.
Because every now and then you may just turn away from the puter' to see what Sly and the boys are up to doing.
Watched this film the other day expecting the worst from a 1930s film but was surprised it was really quite good.Its a story of two people from different cultural backgrounds who fall in love,the biggest problem is he is married,so the relationship is doomed to failure.I must admit i didn't care for the wife at all,as looking at this film from a 1930s aspect a woman always stood by her husband no matter what.This one deserts him purely because she misses her socialite lifestyle in New York,if she really loved him she would have stayed with him.I found her totally selfish,and a 1930s audience probably would have felt the same.When you watch these old films you have to forget your 21st century attitudes,as what seems acceptable now wasn't back then, she should have stayed with him.I hated Frederick and the father he was a pig and a bully who didn't care for his daughters happiness,which leads to a tragic conclusion i wont say why.I was really hoping that Gary cooper would ditch the wife then tell Frederick and her father where to get off and run away with the Polish girl for the perfect happy ending,but alas it wasn't to be.I don't understand why this film is forgotten because it is quite outstanding for its day.
The camera pulls back, and now Vinson is no longer in the room or the scene.
But, as we all know by now, that is the nature of "thrillers."
I first saw it when I was 9 (I'm now 13), and I did not find it too scary.
Only now the lodger has to be saved from the crowd who still think that he did it.
And now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must take lodgings tonight with a Teutonic rich heiress.
These early Hitchcock efforts have been easy to find for a long time now except for "The Lodger", and "Blackmail" which is also part of the set.
These lines are quite interesting now--I wonder if they were put in on purpose or just happened to be written without anyone knowing.
Since then we have seen the tasteless mess that was "Trail of the Pink Panther", the feeble attempt "Curse of the Pink Panther" and now this...apparently Edwards saw a tv-performance by Roberto Benigni, and felt that he had the talent to revive the Clouseau character, but sadly the result is a painfully unfunny chaos.
ThereÂ´s Herbert Lom as Dreyfuss, but he seems fatigued and too mellow by now, thereÂ´s Claudia Cardinale who played the princess in the first Pink Panther movie, but here sheÂ´s supposed to be Maria Gambrelli (from A Shot in the Dark).
Herbert Lom is back for his final performance as Chief Inspector Dreyfus, now more sane and subdued.
Disguise master Professor Balls, played in the most recent films by Harvey Korman, is now played by Graham Stark, a friend of Sellers who appeared in different roles in many of the films.
But the mid 70s ones are fantastic and now this!
For a couple of weeks now my headphone has got a nasty screek which is annoying, but it's not half as bad as the continuous blabber in the most annoying tone of voice I have ever heard.
And I think I will now play some deathmetal albums volume up to get rid of that nasty blabber echo still in my head.
O.K, he is now an academy award winner, but in 1993 a complete unknown.
It seems so campy now, but what a cast!!
I'm glad it's on DVD now; I'll watch it again.
I am now searching for the L.P again to go with the D.V.D.
It is impossible to see now unless you can find someone who can sell you a pirate tape.
the Matthau, but I laughed even as this absurd chapter came to a close...it's a product of an era when not only sex, but laughter and freedom, were celebrated and must be seen in that mindset...this is a movie that people who write certain modern movie guidebooks will never, ever, ever understand...for the simple reason that, in this era, as prurience increases, thus does narrowmindedness, so that we come to forget completely the now remote atmosphere in which such a film could be made.
In the end, Bruce's character is still his old tired self, except he now likes his birthday.
I saw The Last Mimzy and The Water Horse on two consecutive nights, and now I have forgotten many elements of the former simply through watching the latter.
Angus reluctantly agrees to release Crusoe (who is now the size of a draft horse) into the loch.
family film we've seen for decades now.
But when the water horse, he named Crusoe, has grown too big, he and a family friend put him in the Lochness Lake where he is spotted and is now known as the infamous Lochness Monster.
Here she plays a retired Latin teacher--yes, Latin was once taught in public schools, folks--who reconnects with a former student who is now a male nurse.
Anyone who knows anything about the crusades is laughing out loud right now (or is at least giggling a little bit inside).
Having been duly impressed with those two De Mille spectaculars, I had intended to watch this immediately (I got the film around the middle of last year) but for various reasons Â I even had to exclude it from my Christmas viewing Â I could only get to it now that Easter is approaching!
Remembering that his kingdom was not just England, but a good deal of what is now France, it is estimated that he may have spent at most, six months on the British Isles.
Having witnessed the flop of his last few contemporary dramatic pictures, Cecil B. DeMille made a pledge to the public that from now on he would only make epics.
If this is his tribute to "Tales From the Crypt," "Creepshow" and "The Vault of Horror," Bartok has seriously lost his way... and Freddie Francis is probably rolling over in his grave about now.
we're now given Trapped Ashes.
And now we see a certain generosity of spirit: she gives the boy some silver coins; she tells the boss to spare the woman, but it is too late.
This is the most regretful episode of my life for the film has now been deleted.
By now though, I have Lantern in such a high regard that it borders on gaining a mythical quality as I have yet to see it in it's entirety.
This was my third time viewing the film - the first as an extra on Image's DVD of the Silent version of THE CAT AND THE CANARY (1927) and the second on TCM, as part of a Harold Lloyd marathon in anticipation of the release of this same 7-Disc collection, when I was in Hollywood late last year; actually, I liked it better this time around, hence I upped the rating from **1/2 (besides, back then, I wasn't as familiar with the star's short films as I am now)!
This quirky film has everything- lots and lots of comedy, a nice touch of romance, some violence and a hint of sadness now and again.
I've seen the movie at least 30 times by now and her expressions still make me cry, they're just so sincere.
Robot Chicken is one of, if not the funniest show on television right now, and yet most people I know have never even heard of it.
Some of the skits are absolutely hysterical, especially the where are they now with Michael Moore and the Unsolved Murder Cases.
Synopsis: "Na Nan has known best pal Dong Mi and Jung Joon since childhood, and now the trio shares the ups and downs of their turbulent single lives together.
I though the male lead Ben was great and nice looking in that down to earth boy next door way and not the I'm a male super model worship t my feet way, which is very unique for male role now days that have to be the knight and shinning armer type.
This is a film that even now I have fond memories of, and can apreciate as a classic.
It makes me enjoy the movie a lot more now that I know that some famous people were involved in it.
Right now, I just wish I could watch this movie again and see how much stuff I can remember from it.
Get this title into your mind right now: ASYLUM OF SATAN.
Kirk now working for the CIA sends out Mike to Vietnam to stop Polo's enterprise.
Silva, now a CIA agent, sends top man and chronic Wrangler-wearer Muller to Thailand to stop Polo's reign of nonsensical terror.
was released, no one knew how the war would end as we do now, and the fall of the Philippines was seen as a major defeat for the U.S.
I liked it then and I like it now.
I ask myself now, why I wanted to see these movies.
Go get it now and have a great slice of retro horror in your proud collection!
The being itself is a series of monsters, not particularly as scary now due to the advancement in special effects(..or as effective as say Bottin's work in THE THING or Stan Winston's work in PUMPKINHEAD), but effectively grotesque when they pop up on characters..the monkey creature is quite a ghastly creation.
The second scene involves a character who's name I cannot remember (and an actor who should go back to waiting tables), so we'll just call him Annoying Fool from now on.
TWO STARS for laughs provided---but the heartwarming wise-homeless-guy fairy-tale is getting a bit old now: the current run began in the 80s with DOWN & OUT IN BEVERLY HILLS which was based on a French film of the 1930s, BODOU SAVED FROM DROWNING.
Perhaps it didn't age well, but I still like watching it every now and then.
Bill Smitrovich is Crockett's former partner, Scott Wheeler, now with the DEA, and there's an important development/revelation that will forever fracture their long-time camaraderie.
Everyone deserves a second chance, but I deserve to die now.
I didn't have chance to see this show earlier so i'm watching it now 25 years later and it still doesn't seem old at all, it's even greater now as you look back at the mid 80's.
It has a kind of darker Mad Max feel to it by showing how pockets of people around the world survived judgement day and are now facing the struggle of survival against nature and most importantly SkyNet.
In 2007, "In Drei Tagen Bist Du Tot" got amazingly the Austrian film price, the now so-called "Austrian Ticket" which was given before, in 1996, to Vilsmaier's "Schlafes Bruder".
I'm very happy I went along to see it now, and afterword's I even felt that movie buzz that I haven't had since Dark Knight.
Unfortunately, a pilot working for NASA notices the ship and is taken the hostage by Kirk and Spock, who must now come up with a way to get back home without altering the course of history.
I finally watched this about a year and a half after going to see its sequel, "X2", but I have now seen it more than once, and it is good.
One huge loophole is that john Connor says he and Marcus wright (the cyborg) have been fighting for centuries, but there was never any mention of him in the other 3 films, and Connor doesn't know about him until now, So they haven't been fighting for years.
After watching all the X men movies, only now I noticed that Halle Berry was using an accent to play Storm in this first movie.
Not only must these X-Men fight the forces of bigotry and repression afoot in America, they must square off against Magneto (Ian McKellen), a mutant who has survived the Holocaust and now believes that a war with the humans is inevitable.
I have never heard of McG and I have never seen any of his work until now.
A strange disease comes to public attention and it is Adrien who is in charge of the investigation of the disease now called AIDS.
The Merretts, with Mrs. Ashboro now longer living there, end up buying and move into the old Ashboro house.
4.Encounter of ayesha with her brother where she asks her that after killing girls to save their HONOUR what was he seeking now?.This scene is superb.
And it is these same groups that received such full fledged support from the U.S at the time and painted as 'Holy Warriors' by the Western Media that are now considered terrorist organizations in the post 9/11 era.
Saleem is now one of them, a misguided boy strongly hanging on to a deluded version of Allah.
Now of course with Daniel Craig sure to fill those shoes for a fair old bit, it doesn't seem very likely now that Owen will ever assume the role he was born to play.
And now this, the kind of movie I would have lapped up at 15 or so.
At a uncertain time such as we're living in now, it's refreshing to see a program take a chance and make us think about journalistic integrity, what are government is doing, and whether or not they're right in doing what they do.
It has created a fascination with ww1 and I now collect ww1 artifacts.
I don't know whether the standard of television is so abysmal now but I have seen half the episodes and apart from 2 (The Aerialist with Mike "Touch" Connors and Yvette Vickers and "The Ordeal on Locust Street" - just my own personal view) they are all winners.
FFS, you can see where the movie is going now ...
I feel truly sorry for them, now.
A few years ago when I was a bit younger, I used to not mind this show(I'm now 16).
I'm shocked its still on TV after three or four years now.
It would amount to the same effect if the 9/11 footage of those planes crashing into the WTC were shown a hundred years from now, and the viewers were intentionally misled into believing that these crashes happened all over America that day, that every single American was physically harmed, and every person from Middle Eastern descent was responsible.
This program has been out for a couple of years now but every time it premiered I never gave much thought to it.
My fear now is that younger generations, who have my mindset prior to watching this, see it as something to fall asleep on not important or it's in the past.
Do I ever regret it, now.
I think it should be seen especially by white Americans because the slave experience, now that all the eye-witnesses are long dead, is in danger of being forgotten.
I can see now that the film has a lot going for it.
See it now you won't regret it.
I have seen `Jude', `Welcome to Sarajevo', `I Want You' and now `Wonderland' and they are great films.
But now it is here, and possibly finding a new audience, I thought I'd write a quick review.
Nearly every film set in London now seems to have to include the Gherkin, the Tate modern and the Millennium wheel, what Winterbottom presents us with is something simultaneously far less and far more remarkable.
Inuyasha is the best anime series I have seen and the one that Iam obsessed with right now.
I read a summary for it and become interested so I asked my friend who loves anime about it and he told me it was his favorite anime series right now.
And now I never miss the new ones.
I love watching Inuyasha, I've been watching for quite awhile now.
It's been fifty years, he has Kagome now.
The problem with kikyo is that she's a dead priestess who, in the past life, loved the half human/half demon and now wants him dead yet still claims she loves him.
NOW, by now you're probably not thrilled to watch the show.
I'm only on to the second season, but this show is now one of my favorite anime!
Of course, the poverty of Brazil undoubtedly contributed to the terrible nature of the (now demolished) Carandiru; but this week the British government triumphantly announced its plan to build four new mega-prisons, another story it's hard to see ending well.
Probably will be indicated for the Oscar, correcting the mistake made with CITY OF GOD, the best brazilian movie until now.
Probably will be indicated for the Oscar, correcting the mistake made with CITY OF GOD, the best brazilian movie until now.
This happened back in 1986, this is now 2007, I hate to imagine how many more children this has happened too.
She now lives in Kansas City, Kansas and Kim lives in San Antonio, Texas.
"It's too quiet in here (dramatic pause) It's like they're waiting for us" Seriously now!
The film describes (teenaged) Noqreh's life as she attends school and struggles to discover her role in society now that "any" job is within her reach.
J.R. is now the owner of Weststar Oil, the largest independent oil company in Texas, while Ewing Oil -- now owned by Bobby and Sue Ellen -- is right behind it.
I feel there is no other actor out there right now that can perform such a flawless role as actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
Neil is now perversely attracted to older men, and wants to sell his body to get both his cheap thrills again, and earn an income, "so I could get more drugs for Wendy and me."
"I wish they were showing a movie right now," Wendy whispers, a film about our lives, everything that's happened so far.
An encounter with a fellow abductee in his search for an explanation leads him to Neil, now a cocksure hustler with one thing on his mind, and gradually the pieces of the puzzle come together.
Together once in their childhood, they now live in separate worlds but share a deep, dark connection.
The film like this requires very good performances from all cast members and it's got them from everybody but Gordon-Levitt is simply the shining star and I'll make sure from now on to check out all his new movies.
I have never forgotten it and am still feeling the slowly growing horror it produced back then when I remember it now.
Into this a stranger wanders along and is immediately given a teaching job without any checks as we are meant to have now days.
When the Police Chief(Jim Toney)arrives it is discovered the coffin is now empty.
His overriding mission was to crush the power of the great nobles, especially Burgundy - now ruled by the successor to Louis' former protector - and this he was largely able to do, thanks to his policy of encouraging the minor nobles and the middle class.
The plot centers around a group of young filmmakers who go to the legendary but now abandoned Slaughter Studios, where years before a popular actor was killed in a freak accident (or was it?)
In case you couldn't tell by now, this is not a horror film.
Rumor has it, however, that Liebling now crafts short films for the exclusive enjoyment of friends and family.
Back in the day bourgeoisie morons criticized shows like Frank's Place, Different World, Roc, The Cosby Show and Parent Hood for being unrealistic and preachy but those shows were way over their snooty heads and were leaps and bounds over the rubbish that passes for sitcoms now.
Richard Lestrange (Michael Johnson) ventures up to the Karnstein castle after hearing that the Karnstein's are vampires and that a young girl from the village is now missing.
He also hears that an English teacher is coming and when he arrives Lestrange tricks him into going to Venice for a month and now he can get the job at the school.
But it gets worse... you will find that Grieg, now matter what you think of his music, is hardly suitable for slapping a few words on top and pretending it's a pretty song.
But who has the rights now?
the movie is a very witty look at the nature of modern media - using the ubiquitous presence of a TV chef who now finds his career on the slide - as the focal point.
Every so often, aside from the laborious drudgery that the Hollywood's, Bollywood's and now Nollywood's callously discard at we noble consumers like the spent box of Kentucky Drive Thru Â there comes something magnificent.
But now the young people are passing by the streets of St. Peterburg - the best city in the world, with its beautiful houses, crowded streets and a bit crazy inhabitants.
And now to Ms. Davis.
Much of the detail escapes me now, but I was captivated by the way in which the principals hammered out their working relationship, which was not without its problems.
Pants now!"
I just about know every line off by heart now thanks to DVD.
For some reason I have had a DVD copy of the film in my collection for some time now, probably a b-day gift or some such, and I never watch itÂLast night, sixteen years after it first appeared, I watched it again.
I had never even heard of this film before ... now i know why.
I also remember Harry Morgan from "Dragnet" as being the only cast member I recognized then or now.
And it's now when the film well and truly makes its point, a point of reference that should be heeded as long as we all shall live.
Yeah, some of it is outdated now but the movie held up as I recall when I've seen it in subsequent years.
He is supposedly keen on negotiating a contract to inherit the Bay owned by the Countess(now revealed to be the old woman who was killed).
The difference is that "Blood and Black Lace" lacks the theme that is now so popular, with kids being stalked and hunted.
We now know Traci Lords was, how they say, "gay for the stay" in porn.
Also, I don't care that much that it's not shot where the movie is supposed to take place - they do that all the time now, although I've never been able to figure out why.
Bill Gates and Micro$oft may claim it now, but not before I became a WSU graduate, a Washington Apple, a "User Friendly" Macintosh.
It also had them protect their unexplored and pristine land with the bravery and ferocity of the then, back in the 1860's, Cheyenne Dogmen whom these now modern Indians are the descendants of.
I had never heard of it, but it is now officially my favorite film.
Yellow Wolf, who was played by Steve Reevis, was I think aware of the changing world beyond his own, and up until now the only way he could prevent the outside world from infiltrating his own was to do away with its representatives, Which meant of course killing them.
Smith, by the way, is now probably best known as the no-nonsense father on "That 70s Show."
He's now sharing my favourite actor spot with Brando.
Otto gets his by now hot in the collar boss even madder at him by stealing his pretty stenographer Flaemmchen or Flaem for short, Joan Crawford, who sees what a creep her, like Otto's, boss the Iron Prussian-like Preysing really is.
Baron Felix lost his entire fortune playing baccarat and is now in danger of getting his legs broken if he doesn't come up with the cash, 5,000 Marks, that he owes the "Boys" who've been backing up his losing bets.
Baron Felix now on his last legs which he'll need crutches for if the "Boys" don't get their money is planning to rob the Great Grusinskaya, Greta Garbo, the worlds greatest ballerina who's also a guest at the hotel.
The story is really an excuse to display glamorous stars and MGM's now famous ultra glossy production values, but who's complaining?
He has to pay them back - he was going to steal Grushinskaya's jewels, but he won't do that now.
The collisions between the characters is fascinating too, as the Pre-war standards of social class is up in the air now.
We are used to seeing this now; (think Altman, in particular) where characters are all somehow connected, even though they may not even know each other.
A truly sad small moment, as the viewer is left to wonder what will become of the dog now that it has lost its status as the beloved pet of a nobleman.
I've seen GRAND HOTEL twice now, and I'll grant it that despite its soap-opera like story lines, there seems to be something a little deeper going on which is only alluded to in the sidelines: the delicate tightrope which Flammchen (Joan Crawford) walks on as she is courted by Presyling (Wallace Beery) and later on decides to stay by Otto Kringelein's (Lionel Barrymore) side.
The characters are more or less archetypes and are predicted to act in a certain way, and when their fates collide, it's (now) not a surprise.
I enjoyed it then and now and regard it as a classic film set in a pre-Code Hollywood that has its own ancient beauty, for more reasons than Garbo's mannered face.
John Barrymore is the aristocrat now living in genteel poverty.
Lionel Barrymore is the terminally ill bookkeeper who now just wants to spend his last days living it up.
A meek little man, he's got courage enough now, courage that comes when you have absolutely nothing to lose.
Grand Hotel is now 75 years old.
if 1.5 million of less than 2 million of them are killed in the first quarter of century how come they are now 10 million across the world 1-to-20(if all beings are at a reproductive age)in only 3-4 generations and in such poverty what a fast reproduction rate...
This documentary is especially relevant now as many of the areas that were in conflict during WWI are currently in conflict today, i.e., northern Iraq.
Naturally, having just crawled out of the desert and barely survived, they decide to go back and try to find the gold, ignoring the Indian who is now laughing manically at their decision.
The explanation for this is either simply not in the film, or is very briefly covered in sub-audible dialogue, but I gathered from a review that some wild west era settlers arrived there, settled, found the gold and woke the mummies, who subsequently killed the entire town and the inhabitants are now cursed.
Its a real shame that egyptian cinema's still produce such rubbish until now.
Then this balding man pats the half-naked girl -- who is now revealed to be a brainy cop -- on the back and says something like, "Good work, Sergeant, we'll get a promotion for you!"
However this time the story is a little different as now Jason has been led into an ambush and is blown to pieces, however his evil heart lives on and he possesses various people to kill people who are a threat to his immortality, as a bounty hunter says that only a Voorhies can kill him, this of course leads to his sister, niece and grandniece, they are the only ones who can stop him.
And the weird ending featuring Freddy Krueger's hand (which is now explained by "Freddy Vs. Jason") was a little far out there.
now, the mortician has the power and mind of jason, but it wears on him, like in stephen king's "desperation" and "the regulators" (as richard bachman), so he has to pass on the heart when the body starts to wear, and then somebody else is jason.
I really liked it, now i can wait for the new movie of Friday the 13th: "I hope it to come this year".
Why does it look like an artifact) supplied to his niece (oh, this is a long story, and is too tedious and boring to go through right now) who finds the Linda Hamilton in her to terminate the 'terminator.'
We are much smaller people now.
I didn't want this film to end, and will now look up the original stage play.
How many people now know who Henry Adams, Owen Wister, and Louis Brandeis WERE?
It was pretty weird watching a movie with young actors that are all dead by now.
Any damn zombie flick now more features it, or the equivalent "... of the Dead".
I've been a Robbie fan since the beginning, even when he was with take that, he was born to be a entertainer, he's got the talent from his dad, who's a well-known comedian in england.Robbie's comedic talent, his gestures, his voice, the whole charisma, has made him to what he is now: THE mega star!
We know now that LC, Sr., was less than pleasant to be around & that LC, Jr., grew up to be miserable.
The picture also boasts a terrific music score by the underrated and now wholly forgotten film composer Frank Skinner (1897/1968).
A soundtrack album of his music from the film - issued at the time of the picture's release - is now a much sought after recording!
Maybe the English version of the film is ok but the original version (in french) has no taste, no colors, no shape... it is a sad movie, because you see the end of great actors and you see how somebody who could act very well now seems to be reading a text in front of the camera without entering neither the story nor the character.
Her work with Kieslowski, Carax, TÃ©chinÃ© and now Leconte, Haneke and Boorman has given us the modern cinematic equivalent of Garbo - a melancholic enigma.
I have not seen very much of Luliette Binoche but now I'm a fan.
The male lead's story and the love story are now tightly (no pun intended) intertwined.
The courtroom scene is a great example of the humiliation of the man, now having sobered up, standing with other drunks, many of whom may live in the gutter, and being further embarrassed by having his wife appeal for him.
Remember the veranda scene when Maine tells Lester that she now owns the world as they look out over the city lights below?
But now he doesn't want to try again.
Compared with Danish TV/film which is hugely successful right now it seems that their Swedish counterpart have plummeted in to a deep black hole!
It is decided to take a shortcut on a piece of closed highway, Route 666, where the now small FBI caravan is attacked by four zombies.
Mike: Santa will see you now.
And so that begins the fact that they now think that the three are gods and John the Pompous A** loves to cultivate this image.
One scene shows a valley full of skinned antelope carcasses left to rot in the sun, now nothing more than food for vultures.
Since Ritai has incarcerated these dozen extra men, he is now responsible for feeding them.
We now learn some bitter truths about this Mountain Patrol.
Ritai now decides he has to send one of his men back to get more supplies and Liu Dong is dispatched to drive back.
The big boss now takes a rifle and pumps a half dozen more bullets into Ritai to put him out of his misery.
now the Alien movies didn't scare me The Strangers didn't scare me Trick r Treat didn't scare me Final Destination 3 and 4 didn't scare me but the drag scenes made me squirm in my seat  Rating: 1/10
Kekekili is a mountainous wilderness in Tibet, home to the Tibetan antelope - now an endangered species since their fur became a valued commodity in the west.
For all the thrilling nobility of the volunteers and grueling challenges they face from man and nature, the film naggingly feels like a propaganda effort supported by the Chinese government to show how it supports Tibetan initiatives (including a somewhat smug statement at the end that they have now taken over the protection job from the volunteers).
'Kekelixi' ('Mountain Patrol') is one of those quiet, quasi-documentary films that now and then rises out of nowhere and has such an impact on the viewer that it has the potential for creating some global change action.
OK, now you know why I am biased towards this film.
I'm right in the middle of reading the book now for the first time, and it's pretty scary too.
I just finished watching it for the 3rd time (after quite some years), and I like it better now.
I can't sleep now.
If those letters were to resurface now, the embarrassment would put paid to Sir Alan's career.
Flip is somewhere in his mid to late 20s and still lives with his parents, and as to how he wasn't thrown out by now is a mystery to me.
A man died and he was nearly beaten to death and he still hasn't learned his lesson, and to top it all off he now has a hallucination sequence in a cornfield when he returns home.
Even Flip Dog's racist dad was believable, I cracked up on the part when he said "So now you're a n!gger?"
The color photography is, although maybe a tad washed out now, still striking in its use of shadows.
If I did, too late to change it now.
I've "watched" this movie twice on SciFi Channel now.
So this is Meadows introducing to us the villains in stages; the targets Richard must deal with if he is to get his revenge Â we are systematically told what Richard is up against but there is also that nice little touch of Richard showing up now and again with scare tactics.
When he confronts the family man at the end, Richard himself says that he "is now the monster" which tells us that we do not have to root for him any more if we don't want to as he is confronting an apparent innocent but the film is brilliant in its build up, its finale and its attention to detail - great stuff.
Any fan of monster movies ought to get sweaty palm right now and has to brace him or herself not to run to the nearest videostore.
So don't be fooled by the "War of the Worlds" in your movie store right now, it's a B movie, not Tom Cruise.
NOTE: This version IS now available on DVD.
I am reading the book now and the very dialogue of the movie is from the book.
My dad made a recording of it when it was on Masterpeice Theater on KQED a long time ago, but the tape is very bad now.
I've watched it over five times now and each time find something new in it to like.
For years I have been hoping it would be released on video, and now at last I am the proud owner of a DVD copy.
I'll let you know now, I've seen better thrillers.
He's now got his eye on Alexis Smith and Stanwyck is being slowly poisoned.
Humphrey Bogart, for all of the heroic roles during this stage of his career, is cast against type, and Barbara Stanwyck, always the femme fatale, is now a damsel in distress as matters spiral beyond her control as grave danger closes in on her.
Herbert Garrison (now Janet) has been the shows most diverse character.
The Garrison character stopped being very funny, and now is actually amusing again.
It rises above the lice episode simply because it once again reinvents Garrison for the better this time (the Mayor's reaction, "You're a lesbian now," is priceless).
Bye now.
What was scary back then might be cheesy now.
Prof. Constable's weird behavior also attracts the US governments intelligent agencies in the person of CIC agent Saul Wiener, Edward Asner, who's having him and now Dr. Lauder followed day and night.
I remember this movie as a young child.Pamela Ferdin and Ray Miland were great in it.It was actually kind of creepy and depressing about a young girl who had died.It actually upset me as a little kid that the characters daughter died so young.I never knew kids could die and this freaked me out as a kid.In some ways I guess it made me realize that anyone can die young and old,but the ending was hopeful and made me feel a bit less freaked out.The musical score was very well done and the acting was good also.TV movies in the late 60's and 70's,80's were SO much better than they are today.They actually had a STORY and Characters that were more realistic and original.Today,writers have no talent as they need to RE DO like every movie in a remake.Sad.I like the Originals.Wow,now that I think about it,I must have seen this in the 70's as I am still in my late 30's and this was made in 1969,the year I was born.I probably saw it at age 11 or 12 sometime in the mid to late 70's on a rerun.It really scared me.
I just was channel surfing and ran across "Daugher of the Mind", which have not seen since I was a young child (I am now almost the big 50), however, much to my dismay the movie was 3/4 over and I only got to see the last 1/2 hour.
In now seeing the credits and getting the name of Pamelyn Ferdin I was able to go online (something I was not able to do 36 years ago) and find her web-site with all of this wonderful biography information.
Maybe "TVLand" can do a "Where are they now" special on Pamelyn.
One of my life's greatest enigmas has been answered and now I plan to try and locate the movie from the vaults of Movie of the Week which gave rise to Mystery of the week which gave rise to McMillan and Wife, Columbo, The Night Stalker, and McCloud.
The story is well written (although I now know it is based on previous films).
Illegal smugglers could re-invent themselves and become legitimate staffing agencies (a notch better than slave trader)located in Mexico who - for the same money they charge now to smuggle someone, - could hire hoards of immigration lawyers to arrange to bring in Mexicans - legally (with a job offer, matching residence and work permits for those diligently assigned jobs).
I now live in Maine for the last two years and was shocked to realize that illegal Latino's are shipped up here from the border to do the field work for the blueberry and cranberry fields (the largest producer of wild blueberries in the world is here in Maine) and of course they are 'invisible' in every way possible in a 99% white community (look it up).
I have become such a fan of Paddy Considine and will watch whatever he comes out with from now on, he simply makes brilliant choices as to what to associate himself with.
The only editions of Giallo that are still around are like from the early eighties, and it is logicall that by now they are worn out, and at least the one I watched has editing errors that look more like they were made at the time of preparing the video edition.
His mostly insane father seeks to avenge/rectify the condition his son is in and sets up a secret laboratory for research and invites a group of people to his estate to test the powers his damaged son now possesses.
But, excuse me now, I'm off in search for Landi's GIALLO A VENEZIA.
I now own the movie on Paramount DVD and it is still awesome not that it should be in the top 200 but a maximum of 7.1.
I see pics of her on IMDb and she looks OK now, back in 93 she probably still looked cool, I mean why not use her as the kid?
It's 15 years old, now; so the nuclear family values it seems to celebrate have been rendered unfashionable by the latterday millennium cynics.
That being said, I am now intrigued by these so-called "breasts."
That's the best line from this backwoods clunker filled with terrible sound, music, and "actors" who seem to be just a group of friends who took a week of acting classes and said, hey we can make a movie now!
After the credits, that uses cheesy laughter for music, the handy avenger cheerfully continues to nail people down, only now he says something really stupid every time he fires his gun.
The first movie in the series what fantastic and the second was just horrible because they change the actors a little bit and now the 3rd movie in the series is just horrible.
The first movie in the series had a lot to tell about Bufford Pusser's life and the second in the series had just had few thing that really happened to Bufford but not enough to make it interesting and now the 3rd movie in the series is just horrible worst then the second one and this one doesn't tell anything real about Bufford life except for when he died at the end.
Pusser term as Sheriff is coming to an end and now he has a new challenger.
Pusser looses the election and now is unemployed.
Writer/director Beaird also did the film Scorchers, which I recall recommending to folks years ago when I worked in a video store -- now here's another to add for truly, refreshingly, "touch-my-soul" viewing.
I have waited for this film to come out for quite a while now, I missed it at cinema as the mainstream cinemas didn't show it and I had to wait for the DVD to come out which it did on Monday.
Anyone that does have the Clouse's version can now dump that film in the trash.
They put it all together now in the order it was supposed to be in and the result is AWESOME!!
The look of this silent diamond-of-a-film is unforgettable, and the music score that one now hears on videos of the film only adds to the elegance of this silent art masterpiece.
many would simply class it in the same school because it is british, it features "hip" newcomers, and the direction is very flashy and effects rich.....well except for the british part this describes most every film coming out now.
I was scared stiff then but now look back on the memories and laugh.
The director seems to have given the actors some freedom as to where to go with dialogue and even scenes and that gives the film a raw and spontaneous quality and some odd humor every now and again.
First saw it quite a few years ago and now it's just been on MGM.
Having now seen it a few times I can get to savour its elements...the way the beginning give no clue to subsequent events and the doubt some may have right through it that it's all some horrendous mistake.
The only other way I can imagine that all the positive remarks got here is that the director of the movie is now unemployed and has all day to write and post new ones.
I have never heard of it but its one that I stumbled upon today on TV and can not get it out of my mind now almost 12 hours later.
Nevertheless, I see now that Anthony Edwards makes an absolutely outstanding acting performance in the lead role.
After hearing much about this blink-and-you-missed it 80s apocalyptic love-story thriller, I finally managed to track down a battered old VHS copy, but my feeling now was I needn't have made the effort; it's been hard to find for a reason.
I was able to track down this movie on PAL VHS-Tape on Ebay(you can buy it on DVD now,zone 1 only) and saw it last night on my own again.
Ok,I'll have to admit that it's dated now (look at the clothes...)but that same sad feeling that creeps slowly into your head while watching this movie is still there!
If you have your heart at the right place,then this movie grabs you by the throat and won't let go...  On the other handiIf you ONLY like comedy's and big budget action movies(which I also like very much)then you're probably going to despise this one...  Go now and find this little gem of a movie,I know you want to...
Instead, it's a situation that any of us could easily imagine and I think this is why it stayed with me all these years, why it now forms a part of the framework for my imagination whenever I find myself catastrophizing about terrorism or natural disaster, anything that could separate me from the ones I love.
The Magical Life of Long Tack Sam is in every sense a celebration of an almost forgotten man, who perhaps until now, never got his proper due.
Leading an impressive supporting cast is Dustin Hoffman who plays what we would now call a white collar criminal.
Anyone who watched this should feel like i do now - ashamed and embarrassed.
I've watched all 4 episodes of "10 Items or Less" about 4 times each now.
SL&V has marketing written all over it, from the title to the stars (admittedly not as famous during the time of the shoot as now), and in its focus on sex and masturbation, particularly.
Bernie is now so out of it with loss, he comes to Linda's house and asks if she would consider having him back.
He claims to have once been a great novelist, and she is now a successful author on her own.
His father Bernard, played revoltingly well by Jeff Daniels, has absolutely no concept of what's going on outside of his own world as he spews obscenities and dwells on his past as a respected writer; of course now no one wants anything to do with his writing so he teaches English instead (Gee, haven't we see that a few hundred times in films?
Bernard, the father, is an author that hasn't got a lot of recognition and now teaches college to support the family.
Jeff Daniels is slyly funny as the cheapskate, snobbish father who was once the toast of the literary world and is now just getting by on teaching.
But now I have a better idea.
Well, thanks to the fourth of the dire sequels, now we know.
I have been an avid Columbine researcher for nearly a year or so now and was highly looking forward to this movie.
So, the kids and Bink (they all like him now) take it as their responsibility to help her.
Some evening a few days after (or seconds, depending on who's time your on), Dawn is tucking in her daughter Lauren, who up until now wasn't the main focus whatsoever, and we zip up to five years later (1999).
Lauren is now the only child still living at home.
We're now about an hour an fifteen minutes into the movie.
I've studied the real Dawn Anna and her daughter, Lauren Townsend, for some time now, and I can say that both were and are remarkable women.
Originally I faulted George Segal for being so annoying (as Felix)...now, I applaud him for acting the part.
The sex-talk is dated now, and the picture looks like a relic from the late-'60s, yet it's a funny film about opposites.
I recall watching this as a kid on a now defunct Sicilian TV channel; however, given the ample nudity on display and, for a film of its type, the excessive length of the thing itself, it's very probable that it had been cut to some extent.
Every episode is a thrill because it's seems like the hole team believe that "this is my life right now - this murder or murders are MY responsibility to solve" and the output is brilliant.
Prior to these 2 shows I had not really been a fan of the cop genre and can't say I am now but the 2 Scandinavian shows really provided us with an insight into life in those northern Euopean countries through the eyes of their special policing units.
Despite the fact that we were 14 and the film is rated 18 over here in the UK, which was totally illegal and would never be allowed now.
Enter two FBI men from the North - Hackman (the bad cop, who used to be a town sherrif in the area many years ago but now hunts bigger fish whether it be within the law or otherwise ) and Willem Defoe (the good cop trying to set the world to rights with the belief that even racists can't be all that evil to want to kill).
Go rent it now.
A generation has passed, only a generation, since the governor of Mississippi's neighboring state stood in the doorway of the university and proclaimed, "Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever."
The situation displayed here, in 1964, isn't perfect now.
The movie begins with the three civil rights workers who are brutally murdered; the viewer now already knows that the police are involved.
I'm now 23, and have yet to find anything to top it.
To only be able to go back 20 to 30 years and be able to watch some of the shows we referred to as garbage back then....they seem pretty appealing right about now.
Albert states the antique store is a business but the IRS states that it's a hobby so now unless Albert can prove it's a business he will owe the IRS taxes on the $36,000 plus penalties.
Hey now, this is one of my favorite movies.
Well now, let me see ... we learn at the beginning that Morton's daughter might well drop-in on the writer - as she is only borrowing Morton's house in the Luberon area of Provence.
Ludivine Sagnier is very good as the mysterious Julie, the alleged daughter of Sarah's publisher, but now, is she really that person?
He recently bought me the film on DVD as a 'joke' birthday present but ironically now sits proudly on my DVD shelf as one of my favourite films.
I first saw this film on HBO in 2005 and now own it.
The final is the weakest story about a trapeze artist who lost his last partner but now has discovered another,...and LOVE!
I know, you want to see it because the cover shows a hot female body holding a machine gun, and because it's been out of print on DVD for years and now there's a certain level of mystique about it... but I'm telling you, there is absolutely NOTHING here that's worth looking at!
The character names have changed (except for Orville Ketchum, now the janitor, and through the majority of the film practically a zombie), the goofy synthesized piano music is back, and the cleavage is as prominent as ever.
I am watching this right now with about 20 or so minutes left and do not know the outcome.
It now has a sizeable following of loyal fans worldwide (the Wolf Pack), including many people who became pilots (military and commercial) through their love of the show - many fans of which have been following the commercially successful shows of Donald Bellisario (Belisarius Productions) from its humble beginnings in the early 1980s, including the current success of J.A.G.
That photo is a publicity still from 'He Did and He Didn't', though it doesn't actually correspond to any scene in the film as it now exists.
The overthrow of Batista had just occurred and is the background for this story, wherein Dagget tries to find Miller but runs into ex flame Monica (Allison Hayes) who is now a night club singer and is being taken care of by a wealthy Cuban Fernando Ricard (Eduardo Noriega).
Dagget's search for Miller gets him involved with the police who apparently now are defending the new government from being overthrown and retaken by the old order.
Poor Dagget just wants to find his friend, but Miller had been used by the loyalists because he had expertise they needed, and now that they were done with him, he needed to be liquidated.
Lisa Picard is Famous has people, believe me, that are right now walking the streets of New York, Chicago and L.A..
A year later in the June of 1968 history would be made when Elvis once again entered a stage for the first time in 7 years to record his TV special for NBC now affectionately known as 'the Comeback'.
Despite the survival of several other monarchies in Scandanavia, the Benelux countries, and (in revival) in Spain, the three lost ones of 1918 are now joined by the lost ones of the Balkans.
But now in 2005 we look at the film, forgetting all those amusing bit of nonsense and what do we see?
It was meant to appear to be a psychological thriller, yet, ultimately, it's something else; the kind of "now you see it -- now you don't" that normally doesn't happen in inexpensive, quickly made movies.
The only show that we definitely make it a point not to miss right now is Meerkat Manor.
(I am really concerned about Tosca right now!)
Once in the city, Zero Wolf sells off the women and presents the menÂsmeared now with bright blue body paint as custom dictates--as sacrifices to the gods.
Don't we know by now that Cortes' arrival was the beginning of the brutal end of so many people and civilizations in America?
I'd had my eye on it, read all the reviews - a weakness* - now having seen it, I'm frankly baffled by the faint praise that many have seen fit to heap upon it.
The temple of Kulkulcan in Chichen Itza; which was in it's height from 800-1200 A.D. somewhat resembles the temple in the movie, but the sacrifices portrayed in the movie were more characteristic of the Aztec Empire (Tenochtitlan, now Mexico City).
I would be highly surprised if this did well at the box office due to the extreme gore, other language language(Americans don't like subtitles), long running time, and of course the now infamous name of Mel Gibson attached.
When she dies following a car accident - Howard decides now is the perfect time to get to "know" her a little better...
Seeing Annette again is a great experience, especially now that the disease MS has done so much to her physically, and yet she chose to do this to help make all aware of the devastation of this disease.
I'm convinced that fifty years from now film historians will be looking back and wondering why Campbell Scott wasn't a megastar from his first role on.
She's a former screenwriter herself, now living the life of comfort in her Los Angeles house overlooking the sea.
He has done spectacular work on stage over the years, and now he is beginning to apply his genius to film work.
"; "I'm all yours now".
But then again, I'm not reviewing that experience, now am I?
(sort of) As of now, it's 9:32, so about Â¾'s of the movie have passed, & those damn guys are still trapped.
That's really unfair, but what a good idea for our prisons we have now.
But now they lack creative talent with the maturity to put the breaks on the Whiz Kids with all the fancy gadgets that simply wreck most 2007 movies.
Walsh is now best remembered for the gritty action pictures he would later make at Warner Brothers, but perhaps the most important aspect he brought to his pictures was a romantic spirit of adventure.
Based on the "Arabian Nights" it tells you the story of a thief - Ahmed - in Bagdad that fell in love with a beautiful Princess and has now to gain her love, because "Happiness must be earned".
This film is now 75 years old and I say one thing, it gives the movies of today one good run for their money.
Both versions of this film now available on video feature scores based on themes from Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade, which exquisitely conveys all the allurement of the Thousand and One Nights.  
I thought it was terrific then, and after viewing it again now(2003) I still think it is an exceptionally fine movie.
And OK, let me get this over to ya now, the film doesn't have the benefit of sync sound.
Fans now have the complete series of I Love Lucy and The Lucy Desi Comedy Hour.
I read it three times now.
Belldandy makes his wish come true, and from now on she will live with him, to his surprise.
I was excited that now, with CGI, a great epic tale like Beowulf might be successfully made into a movie.
I watched it with my boyfriend, then my  husband, and now with my children.
NEW YORK: Very funny clip, despite the fact I hate Rosie Perez (well, her voice), but the other two characters, the German ex-clown who is now very unsuccessful taxi driver, and Jojo, very funny guy who is just complaining all the time and laughing very loud, are really convincing.
Helmut is truly one of my favourite characters of all-time now.
Before, he was negative about all his customers and found flaws in them, but now he seems to see it all so differently due to a woman who can't see anything.
I know that this film is now at the 10 year mark.
I shall not spoil them, but those sequences really did make me wish that every action movie ever made from now will be in 3-D.
Here since it is met with a more realistic approach, with situations that could be happening right now at night in these cities, I'm almost reminded of Renoir.
I have seen above post just now, and even it is an old comment, I must react.
I liked it then, and I still like it now.
Watching it now as an adult I can see the juvenile aspects of the film, as well as the non-North American influence.
Well, it's still that way but you can now view it in uncut form, thanks to the marvels (?)
I'm referring to the Shriek Show DVD too, Anthropophagus, I have a DVD of the US cut which is now going to be traded in.
I didn't expect a lot from 'Beowulf', for lots of reasons, most of which were to do with the casting: incorrigibly cockney Ray Winstone as a warrior from what's now southern Sweden; wacky John Malkovich as a cynical counselor; loony Crispin Glover as a flesh-rending monster, and weirdest of all, Angelina Jolie as the monster's mother...thaet waes wundorlic castyng, as the poet might have put it.
Even without the publicity or the previously cut scenes (now restored in many versions) Eastman is convincing and works well.
This fellow has been involved in a shipwreck, and found himself forced to squabble with his wife in a lifeboat over the body of their son, whose carcass was now the only meat they had.
I can't right now recall if there was nudity, but it doesn't matter, this is less sleaze and more a spooky horror piece.
It looks great, it takes chances, and it surprises you every now and then.
I love it, I'm addicted and now loads of my friends r addicted too.
I used to watch this show ages ago when I was like twelve and now I'm eighteen and watching it again, because it's really good and I adore it.
It is my favorite t.v show and i think it is better than any other t.v show on t.v right now.
I think they should continue this show because they left the 2nd season on a cliff hanger and now i am wondering what happened.
I hate how they canceled the show right at that point, it drives me nuts thinking about it.I wish they had of even starting filming the 3 series with those actors now, even though most of them are in their thirties and a few of the older actors are dead, but it would still be interesting.
I don't know how high schools are now, but I still think that some of the themes explored are slightly misleading, and stereotypical.
I always loved the show and found it really funny, although watching it now (8 years on) I know there's a lot in it I probably didn't get back then.
*EDIT* Both Seasons are on DVD now.
Pretty much everyone knows the story of Beowulf - man fights monster, monster's mum and then a dragon - but this ancient story has inspired generations of writers and academics, now it gets a shiny makeover courtesy of Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary.
What happens now?
I've seen it twice now, I like it even more the second time around.
Military historians from then till now still debate the value of the airplane in war.
But he is remembered now as the real founder of the modern American Air Force.
It's an amazing story of how an inspired and dedicated film genius, located in New Zealand, anticipated and invented so many of the film techniques we take for granted now.
Colin McKenzie was an unsung genius who periodically would disappear, then reemerge with new inventions and passions to over-awe those of us who now are familiar with his extraordinary accomplishments.
Director Bahman Ghobadi was an enthusiastic show-up for the 3rd screening and gave many interesting tidbits during his Q&A such as info on the banning of female singing and musicians in present day Iran for the past 28 years, that his self-censorship on the film did not help it to get past Irani censors so that he may re-cut the film for the later general international release now anyway (restoring more scenes of female singing & playing) and that the whole 7 months of seeking for travel permits subplot in this film was a nod to the struggles he had to get his earlier "Turtles Can Fly" film made.
For now, however, it has left me full and still digesting.
He and Jan now operate as mercenaries for the New Republic.
This helps make the fact that the cut-scenes are now(as opposed to the live-action of the first) almost entirely engine-based(supplemented with a handful of CGI-sequences) easier to accept, as does the reasonable cinematography and range of animations, and the flawless programming of both.
I'm sorry but that's just insane - people now have criminal liability for animals that randomly come on their property and die?
I stumbled across it on VHS at a rental shop and took a chance, and now am very glad I did.
I have showed him this movie (privately) over fourteen hundred thousand times and now he can speak.
Was it the point that she was now known to be living with a rich man, so she had to be respected?
The first time you see certain things and the next time, now that you know everyone, you'll see more.
One can almost feel the sadness coming from text written by invested historians even today, now more than 60 years after the event that began just before 2AM on 16 February 1945.
Joe Rosenthal is now gone, having passed away this past August (2006).
Thanks to Mr Clint Eastwood's fine directing the facts are now spread before us.
***** out of ***** After starring in the highly entertaining Lethal Weapon 4 and the gravity defying Romeo Must Die, Jet Li has now got 3 excellent hollywood flicks under his belt.
I am a martial artist and I can tell all his movements in the movie are true and real, that's very rare to see now days!
Basically, the hero, a reformed Robin Hood-esquire thief, was betrayed by his partners and now is being hired to retrieve a seal, which they had stolen.
Other cast members were Nancy Addison who passed away so young and Ilene Kristen now on One Life to Live.
It now airs one day (sun.)
I think that the nostalgia for saner time in our history is a big part of why this show is now getting so much attention.
The beautiful, classy Nancy Addison, unfortunately now deceased, was Jill Coleridge throughout the series, and Hale was her brother Roger.
Their sister, Faith, was played by more the one actress, the most memorable being Karen Morris Gowdy (now a Connecticut socialite).
However, for reasons I won't go into it is now part of my job to watch the show for research purposes.
SUMMER would not be the same without this show anymore as its now going into its eight year running and still going strong.
Although now the aim of this show seems to be to cram as many weirdos as they can into the house; gays, transsexuals, plastic surgeoned people, people with problems and so on.
It seems to just be a stage for some truly vile people who now seem to be the average Joe.
now on its 9 series, the show is starting to lose its shine.
u really have to treat the show for what it is, because it certainly isn't intellectual viewing anymore, this was the start of reality TV, and has now developed a cult following who will not stop watching, i personally recommend it.
Its odd now to look back at that first series and see how normal the contestants were compared with those of recent years.
In it's early years, Big Brother was fresh, original and fascinating, but I wonder how many watch it now for reasons other than duty, habit and so they don't feel left out at work, similarly, I wonder how many housemates appear because they aren't hopeless attention-seekers.
that are still out there in Britain,but the TV executives today do not seem to agree,or they are not bothered at finding and encouraging new talent.They are happy now to let talent-free non-entities appear on this show,and others,to create,Frankenstein-like "celebrities",which is rapidly becoming the dirtiest,most foul word for disgruntled UK citizens like myself in this day and age.This word "celebrity" has almost taken on a new meaning from previous generations;it was usually tagged on in the past to famous people,but those who had mostly obtained their fame through talent,sheer hard work and years of struggle.
"Celebrity" now is synonymous in describing those who have no talent at anything accept appearing on shows like BIG BROTHER.The amount of people who have earned a career,and a lucrative one at that,from this programme since it's debut has been astonishing.Brian Dowling and Kate Lawler are just two examples,but the most remarkable was that of Jade Goody,who didn't even win the series she appeared in.She came a cropper in 2007's CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER after her misguided behaviour towards Shilpa Shetty.Now having sadly passed away after a battle against cancer,it is arguable that unscrupulous media types exploited her naivety and inarticulacy (which was in no way particularly her fault) when she was not especially conscious of such events.
Amongst the 'Brother' contestants, the most famous one was the now deceased Jade Goody (a girl who once thought East Anglia to be abroad!).
At least no one has to suffer this show any longer as the T.V stations have now come to their senses and taken 'Brother' off the air, though why it lasted as long as it did in the first place is beyond me.
And the fact that it has gone on for now a 8th series just backs up the fact that TV is rotting.
The contestants on Big Brother are now all-to-aware that when they leave the house the spotlight will be on them.
When it first started it was reality, but now people are just coming in being people completely different to what they actually are.
These things 'just happen', and an end of the world scenario of being engulfed by wickedness is now seen more prosaically as 'oh no, not another crook and another crime!'
I have only been around for 13 years now, and that was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.
I guess it's to late to do that now, but man, It would have been one of my all time favorite movies.
Some kind of alien that the soldiers and the scientists now must face.
I've now seen it a couple of times, once when I was a lot younger (and it didn't impress me then) and again more recently and though I don't regret watching it, its hardly a good film.
Not sure if it could be called a "spoiler", but the ending of this movie, even right now when I think about it, has forever kept me in tears.
I have seen it maybe only 3 times in all these years (am 53 now), and it still never failed to have me so emotional at the end.
And even today, when ever I go to a pet store with dogs (even cats now), or when I went to a pound twice to get a new pet, I can not stay in there for long before my voice breaks and I start shedding tears.
I always wanted to see that movie and now I have.
When he finally gets up the courage to see Jack, it is to find that he is now blind.
The very last scene where Bill, now sure of Lily's love runs joyously over the train carriages is a nice touch.
I missed this when it was on originally (BBC1, 29th December 1981): the idea of it being on a prime-time channel in the Xmas period now seems lunatic, but in the 3 TV channel UK, such things did happen (now we have 1,000 channels showing reruns of "Diagnosis Murder" and reality shows Â how far we've come).
What was cute and clever in the first two is now bland and bitter.
With the existing technologies it could have been done better, but after all I can only conclude that, even though it is "only" TV, this series doesn't disenchant and its main merit is probably the the fact that Bulgakov now found a much bigger audience than he ever could have had with his books.
And the last but now least, incursions made by director by using old black and white newsreels are not providing any good to show up Moscow of the 1930th.
No doubt when it was released in the mid 1950s audiences ( Especially those who crewed an aircraft or fought in the Far East ) could relate to it more but it seems slightly cliched now .
To some it may seem intolerably slow & lacking pace, but to others like myself the Film does something that nearly all Films in the Fifties and indeed many now do not even attempt to achieve, and that is take the time to investigate the main characters in depth and in detail.
Oh say, does that star spangled banner yet wave...sing it with me now!
This is true, more or less, depending on when looking at either man's life (right now, for example, Coppola is fine just making wine with the occasional 'student' film like Tetro).
Boy, what a frustrating film to watch....even though it is very good and has been a part of my collection for a number of years now.
So, now, we're supposed to fall in love with these characters and believe that their massacre was fully justified.
Having now seen all three of the collections released by the Directors Label series (including Spike Jonze and Chris Cunningham) Gondry's work is the perfect addition to the series because he brings an element of bright imagination, and while all three directors are creative, his work is laced with a fancifulness that works as a thin patina, under which obvious intelligence lies.
But at $35 for all three, now that's something nobody interested in "new directors" should pass up.
I had no idea a guy from Star Trek could be so sexy, but now I don't know, I might have to start watching those old shows just to see what I've been missing.
Also, look for some then lesser known actors and actresses who are stars now.
I searched the internet and bought the DVD, watched it together with my 13 year old son, and he loved it as much as I did back then and now.
There are no holes in the plot, it's a good vampire story, and you can have a good laugh too now and then.
Till now, this proved formula has been A CLOSELY GUARDED SECRET.
His ability to always get a laugh, and being renowned for his nice-guy qualities have ensured his continued success, even if most of his movies now are straight-to-DVD capers.
Joseph Larraz, 70 years old now has a clear head yet and a great sense of humor.
And then answers her phone all proud of herself completely clueless that everyone there now thinks she is a total moron.
It's hilarious the way he is so clearly offended by their behavior as he tells them that they have "that 'we can't just stand here and let this happen' look on their faces" and says that now they have to leave.
Thanks, now i know how to kill somebody and be a good serial killer.
First off, the opening we see a "news reporter," a woman who looks about 19 with bad teeth who wouldn't be able to get a job as a news reporter in Walla Walla, let alone anywhere else - and in the first ten minutes she actually compares herself to Diane Sawyer - now that was laugh out loud funny.
I had read good reviews about this and now I'm just officially never trusting reviews anymore.
Leslie has also set up the location for the spree he's planning, and it's the old farmhouse where the young boy, who he is stealing the identity of, was dragged out & thrown over a waterfall many years ago, and now he's poised to "come back" for vengeance.
He also finds the time to hook up with his mentor, now supposedly retired, played by the wonderful and under-rated veteran Scott Wilson.
The series works all the same, even now.
The film runs 7 minutes, and the best print is one the 'Somewhere In Dreamland' DVD, which you should buy right now if you don't have.
The promise Jeremy Podeswa gave with his first film "Eclipse" is really fulfilled now in his second "Five Senses".
It is just as beautiful now as it was 60-plus years ago when it premiered, perhaps even moreso with the wonderful restoration we have now on DVD.
Naturally, being a zombie she brutally murders everyone in the vicinity, but it gets really interesting when we find out that before death, she and a friend were very close, and now that the heiress is back from the dead; the old friendship can be rekindled.
This film was published in Germany on DVD, now playing the full 87 minutes including audio comment by Jean Rollin.
Though the end (which results from a twist in the storyline) seemed quite odd and ordinary to me after I finished watching, it is different now.
And now for Christmas this year i have it and i can't wait to see it Next Monday Christmas Day and i will get the whole season of Emergency.
I have this for Christmas this year and now i very much wanted this Program in my home i love this.
I have not seen it in years, but it cracks me up as much now as it did then.
And now I'm collecting the DVDs.
I would much rather watch reruns of this show on the DVDs than most of the garbage that is on the tube now!
I'll leave that question to subsequent reviewers who care to dig beyond the surface clichÃ© that this movie is about Janis Joplin, which I believe we have now clearly established, it is not.
I found myself wanting to tell the director, "Okay, I get it, she's falling apart, now can we please move on?"
And the song THE ROSE is my favorite song now!!!
Midler's manager, Aaron Russo - who had come to check me out - called-out that I was doing Bette's "jokes" during a live performance in the world-famous "The Queen Mary", a night club in Studio City, CA - now sadly closed after 42 years.
I saw this film in college for $1 in 1980 and never really appreciated it until now.
Right now, I'm listening to the soundtrack.
I have yet to see the Glass Menagerie performed live, and really have nothing much more to say now about the motion picture versions, except that further commentary may very well be forthcoming since my mind has been activated on the subject more than ever before thanks to websites like this.
Her grown son is now moody and weak; the result of being raised by a bossy, delusional woman.
She was obviously sheltered by her mother and now she's introverted, lacks self-esteem, and lives in a lonely fantasy world.
One could only hope that she would soon come out of her shell and that she gained some self-esteem from being lectured on her good attributes by Kirk Douglas's character.Maybe now that the son is out of the picture, the family dynamics will change for the better.
Altogether now: Alone on a dangerous island, Frank's become a fishmonster!
Especially now that we know DI's "Project Naomi" has a counterpart in LOST's "Swarma Institute" (or whatever it's called!
We were pre-Stonewall (I am now in my 80's)and, in fact, living just around the corner from The Stonewall in the NYC Village on the night of that famous explosive event -- another life altering event.
The discussions and concepts brought to light are somewhat the same as now.
And now, we finish with the all-important statistic Â Number of kicks up the arse: 1 (1 for, 0 against)
We'll keep watching it for now...I'd like it if Ming was a bit more of the Merciless Emperor roll than your typical military dictator in a uniform type but the actor is doing well so we shall see.
I'd rather watch Flash right now.
The pinnacle of the season so far has been the "sorrow" episode, which basically tells the story of how Mongo got to be the crappy place it now is.
In fact, the show has started to focus a lot more on her now, and she steals almost every scene she is in.
The show is still not great, but I gave it an 8/10 because it is now doing a good job at being exactly what it should be, a campy romp with clever dialog and just plain fun.
We sit down to this show now with pleasure, and even choose it first over other shows like "Heroes" when we want something guaranteed to be light and fun.
And now, I am too.
If you haven't seen it since the first few episodes, take a look at it now.
First of all Flash Gordon has been dead for quite some time now, it needed to be brought back and more importantly UPDATED!!
The portal- this is good because now Flash and the others can go back and forth between earth and Mongo.
They were of the "meh" sort, at first, but story arcs are beginning to develop, and now that the Flash-Dale relationship has appeared to stabilize (no more awkward, groan-inducing pseudo-romance scenarios), this is one of my favorite shows.
And now the bad.
7) while Dale and Flash argue outside his fathers old lab, which is now Zarkov's Lab, the door suddenly explodes outward... why?
The show found its footing and characters and it's now one of my favorite shows on t.v.
Problems.... SPOILERS AHEAD not that I think anyone will care...  OK so now Flash is Stephen Gordon aka "Flash" because he runs marathons and wins medals for it.
So now we track down goofy science guy living in the micro-Winnebago by looking up his college yearbook online..... WHAT?
and it's available online....  OK so now creepy science guy explains that ripping holes in the fabric of space-time is bad...
Ming is no longer a deviant Chinese man who destroys whole worlds for fun, now hes a Tyrant who worries about public opinion and has trouble tracking down a missing watch on another planet despite the fact that he has the address of where it is located.
Cut to torture time with Flash, now they were going to map his brain to learn everything he knows....
Because of this game, I'm now really looking forward to "Nightfire", the new, completely original James Bond game coming out this fall.
But that fish has been out of water for 15 years now, and its stinking up the theatre!
While this formula charmed us back in 1986 -- it now only makes you want to throw Paul Hogan, and a few shrimp on the barbee for inflicting this boring and derivative flop on us!
Both are saddled with characters that simply aren't believable at their age anymore even if they do now have a rather bland son to acknowledge the passing years.
There's even celebrity cameos (the one with Mike Tyson seems even more ironic now than ever!).
First of all I never saw the first two Crocodile Dundee movie's personally I think its not a great movie but it is entertaining but some of the jokes ar not so funny but there are also a few good joke's but still I liked this movie paul hogan acting very well as Mick Dundee now I want to see the other 2 movie's and I heard they are better then this one if thats true then I really want to see them I give it a 7.5/10
And now, at 26, the film is still just as funny as it always was.
Watching episodes of this show now, I can still admire it for the animation (with beautiful backgrounds usually featuring yellow skies), musical scores, characters, etc., just like I did fifteen years ago, but it obviously isn't exactly the same.
This early 90's cartoon series was a success during its run, and still seemed pretty popular in the mid-nineties when I watched reruns of it, but unfortunately, it doesn't exactly seem like it ever was successful now.
Taz has a family now, a Mum, a Dad, a younger sister and a little brother.
Tom, now a cowboy (or cowcat) on a farm somewhere in Texas is involved in his usual pursuit of Jerry when a gorgeous girl cat arrives.
Rent this one right now.
I've waded through about 50 episodes of Poirot now, from the sublime to the mediocre, but this episode lowers the bar to basement level.
Even though it was an era of sexual freedom that we can barely conceive now, seeing him was shocking.
And what is interesting is that, even with this strange persona still intact, he is to me visually by now quite beautiful--there was a cheap look to the self-conscious Peter Berlin of the tight white pants; by now, the mouth has widened and is more relaxed and he is by now at last a truly beautiful man.
He is definitely 'cute' now, and could afford to wear a lot of dressy things and be a great stylish older beauty by now, and the looser clothing he is seen in when interviewed in the film shows that his taste is still sharp.
We hear from John Waters, Armistead Maupin and others who knew of Peter in his prime, and from Peter Berlin himself, now in his 60's.
We meet the very attractive man (now in his sixties) who lived that character nearly 24/7 in the early 70's.
Rosaleen has now inherited Gordon's fortune, much to the distaste of his family.
This isn't one of those "Government tried a shortcut and ended up creating a monstrosity of nature that now has to kill all mankind" type of sci-fi creature films.
Family living in Florida's Okefenokee Swamp have been exterminating the local wild life, now it seems that the creatures are all out to kill them!
Another point to consider is that David Suchet himself, who has read all the books in preparation for the role, has now been promoted to co-producer status and he has said that he reads and approves the scripts before filming begins.
I was never in favour of voluntary assisted euthanasia before this film, but I now believe that there can be a case made for it, at least in the context of this dreary and highly pretentious film.
I have watched it over 30 times now and I love it more every single time I watch it.
Unlike so much of TV and movies now, I really liked most of the characters and believed they were good people.
Certainly there are strange happening and moments, and the black nationalism may now be out of place.
He's sitting on his home planet right now, entertaining his minions on Saturn.
In Escape From New York crime has risen to astronomic proportions, so much so that the entire island of Manhattan is now one big prison surrounded by the National Police Force.
We now have one of those, I assume this is what the Federal Bureau of Investigation has morphed into.
And the guy that police chief Lee Van Cleef has in mind is Snake Plissken, former war hero, now career criminal with a Rooster Cogburn patch and played by Kurt Russell.
For its time the F/X are good, but seem dated now.
The first of the two Snake Plissken movies (The second is "Escape From L.A.") this is an interesting, but strange view of the future in 1997, which is now, ironically, the past.
"Escape From New York" is an exciting tale of Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell), a former war hero who is now a criminal with a Eastwood-like accent and is ordered by Bob Hauk (Lee Van Cleef), the calm, but stubborn U.S. Police Commissioner to go into New York City, now the country's only maximum security prison and rescue the President (Donald Pleasence) in twenty-four hours.
Go see it now.
So the authorities who are led by iconic spaghetti western actor Lee Van Cleef send in Snake Plisskin (Kurt Russell) a once highly decorated soldier who s now imprisoned after a string of thefts, is coerced in to rescue him, but they trick him into thinking they've given him a vaccine, which results in a very clever plot twist which it's a device which will kill him if he doesn't complete his mission in 24 hours.
Is 1997 and New York is now a prison, when the president's plane crashes into the island Bob Hauk (Lee Van Cleef) the police commissioner, must get the president out of the island in 24 hours so the president can be in an important meeting for the peace of the world.
So this is nothing but an exciting film, now a true cult classic and Carpenter teach us that you don't need the biggest budget to make one of the best sci-fi/action films ever because this film budget is $7,000,000 so is nothing if we compare to Hollywood latest films.
So now he does not only have to take care of the President and try to stay alive in between all those criminals, he also has a lot of time pressure...
I'm sure a great deal of interest and debate will now resurrect this film in the rentals and shops.
The most memorable quote from the film for me:  "Here's twenty quid, now go and buy yourselves a nice big pot of sticky sticky and f*** off back to noddyland"
The film also boasts a crazily eclectic soundtrack - I defy any fellow Welshie to now set foot on the Kingsway without Downtown resounding in their head!
When she appeared on Points of view she looked useless as a TV critic and now she looks even useless has a Game show presenter and was right, she's only good at putting people down when she feels threatened by them.
In some years now, danish movies have been almost nothing but DOGME, violence, or interracial confrontations.
that's overdoing it, well I hope by now I have written enough, so that my comment will be posted
First Denmark introduces a long line of Dogme films, many of them better than anything out of Hollywood, and now they have developed a talent for romantic comedies as well?
The year is 2006 now as I am writing this review, and I still remember it like it was yesterday.
I have now seen this film too many times to even count and could probably recite the whole script along to the film, however it is still funny every time I see it.
Armand once had a liaison with a woman, which produced a son, Val, who now wants to be married to the daughter of a conservative politician.
This is a great movie and I just can't see why it's not available on tape or now that I have a VCR I wish HBO would pull it out of the basement and show it again.
I have a very old copy I copied off the MOVIE CHANNEL, but it isn't very good quality now.
Anyway, the little kid in the movie is Gabriel Macht, who was quite good, as I remember and is now an adult actor...he was excellent recently in A Love Song For Bobby Long, with John Travolta.
I noticed the flyer in the lobby for the SCC didn't mention price.... only if you hurry and sign-up now, you get a free book worth $15.
So, sign-up now for the Spiritual Cinema Circle and watch for my film on an upcoming offering.
The film itself is probably the worst produced, written, directed and actedÂcomparable to Kevin Costner's Waterworld and The Postman (two truly awful movies)Â  More to the pointÂas a parent of a "gifted" child (now a young adult)Âall I can truly attest to is that too many parents and adults seeking "spiritual" rest (freedom from the contradictions and paradoxes of life)Âare exploiting their Judeo-Christian background (whether they are religious or otherwise)Âas a means to explain, control, find cause to and otherwise "deal" with existence.
but its premise is not overly complicated, here is all you need to now for now: A man seeks revenge against a crime syndicate responsible for the brutal murder of his wife.
We held the screening of this film as an event to honour these amazing kids that are around now.
I now realise that their energies were partly responsible for bringing my wife and I to awakening and now the whole family has healed.
I have known of the story of the Indigo Children for quite some time now, and I have run across cases that seem genuine as well as cases that seem fraudulent.
Best of all is the location at which it was made, the now razed Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles.
Added: And now I've got it on DVD.
I will do from now on.
What can I say... well first off this is John Fallon and Christian Veil's new film which has been in the making for a little while now.
So every now and then he tries to commit suicide.
An alert reader of end titles will note that director Lars von Trier ("Breaking the Waves," "Dancer in the Dark" and, now, "Dogville") was a "script consultant," whatever that means.
However, it startles me to discover just how obscure the film has now become; indeed, much of our country's cinematic output has long vanished from public knowledge, an unfortunate consequence of our ever-growing reliance on Hollywood.
Though only fragments of the film now remain, the National Film and Sound Archive (NFSA) have done a remarkable job of compiling and digitally restoring the surviving scenes, with the DVD released earlier this year.
With much of the film lost in time, the original running length of the film is now uncertain, with some suggesting forty minutes and others more than an hour.
On the newly-released DVD, there are two versions of the film: the first is the seventeen-minute "restored version," which basically presents the story as it now survives, with a pleasant piano accompaniment by Mauro Colombis (and an experimental soundtrack by Endorphin that I wasn't game enough to try).
Sadly, the past tense is appropriate here, as the film is now not known to survive except in fragments ... and some of those do indeed appear to be out-takes, as a previous IMDb'er has noted.
Actually, I've also seen (in Australia) another reel of this film: not a projection of the movie's image onto a screen, but rather I've seen (and touched) a mouldering reel of nitrate footage from the movie itself, now deteriorated beyond hope of restoration.
I am utterly, no, totally bemused as to why Michael Caine, (is it Sir Michael now?)
In the mid- to late-sixties there may have been a call for this type of film but not now.
He is pushy and very confrontational and insists he gets his own way now rather than later, very much like Clint Eastwood's "Dirty" Harry Callahan character.
Why people vote so low ?,i cant see what i wrong on this movie ,i saw worse...,and you have to think also in the back of your head it is a TV movie so that means less money to make that film..,i think they forgot that ,so the film is about a virus that comes free on a plane cash and than you see the results if such thing can happen...,very realistic if you think of the real life now Anthrax ....and that kind of stuff...so...i think people rate it too low they underestimated the script,the crew also was good a few good actors and actresses.
I enjoyed the abundant MAC, Quick Time and Lycos product placements, a nice now to the media savvy.
(leaving her house) You would expect a nice thrilling follow up of the movie now.
Although I wouldn't have picked this show to watch, now that I have seen it I realize the importance of our world not EVER forgetting that this can and does happen.
I am going to go vomit now.
After a successful theatrical run in New York early in the fall, The Girl Next Door is now available here on DVD.
Now I know and now I cringe even more thinking about the poor girl that this was done too.
Granted, the amount of respect I've given "Seven" has fluctuated over the years, and it seems that only now do I see it as being a near-flawless masterpiece.
It is now up to Stan, Kyle, and Cartman to save humanity from the horrors of every Christian's worst nightmare, and his boyfriend, George W. Bush's worst nightmare.
So now, if I said that beyond the non-stop vulgarity and infinite humour that this film contains, is a film that has an important message camouflaged in animation, would you believe me?
The "unlikely partners" thing might sound clichÃ©d by now, but trust me, you won't even notice.
the portion of the film i saw had me in stitches,(Marty Feldman's Nursey would have been ecstatic), all the cream of the newly emerging alternative comedy scene seemed to be taking part and set me on a, until now, fruitless quest to track down a trace of this classic through the years.
And we can't forget Mrs. Ethel Shroake, the survivor that's the closest distant relative to a now deceased queen of England.
With it's completely surreal narrative and winning photography, The bed Sitting room hits me now for a number of reasons, the first of which, is that despite looking strangely contemporary, all it's main leads (Except the young uns) are dead.
While in Monty Python, it's surrealistic landscapes, while funny and inventive, never really touches the views on offer here, What was essentially a quarry, is now landmarks of Britain, with bits of it sticking out all over the place.
England is now a barren landscape, littered with derelict cars and buildings, hills of old boots, broken crockery, and other debris.
I've watched a little bit of Fields now and I'm convinced that he's not my taste and quite frankly I'm not sure why he's regarded as a top early comedian.
I have almost every episode of "The Amos 'n' Andy Show" and now consider them just a hair below the Stooges in terms of comic creativity.
He was the greatest, & we need more of his brand of humor now.
(Plus, he inspired me to learn how to juggle - a hobby I've now enjoyed for almost 40 years)  Best short: Fatal Glass of Beer  Best Feature: It's a Gift
Astro Boy discovers new companions, orphaned humans, but he also realizes now that he is a robot.
Once Dr. Tenma realizes that this robot version of his child is nonetheless inferior and sends him away, Toby flees the floating, gleaming Metro City and lands back on the Earth below which is now a trash dump where he becomes known as Astro Boy.
I enjoy this film to my own surprise.While I'm not a child or a fan,I find the animation simple and easy on the eyes.You feel sorry for him when his own father can't look at him the same way now that he's a robot.After he leaves Metro City, he finds his human friends and through them,he gets to find and learn about love and companionship.Then he takes on the evil President Stone,who has become a huge monster himself,threatens to destroy Metro City and everyone else in it.My brother claps in delight as Astro Boy discovers his hands can turn into cannons and guns stick out of his butts.The touching scene where he sacrifices his life is enough to even brought a tear to my eyes.Luckily,he is saved and finally finds his destiny,and it's to help protects the world.It's a movie with a lot of heart and hope.Definitely a kid's film.For an adult,the cartoon characters may be a little childish.Overall it's a great animated film,good efforts on the voice overs and entertaining awesome sequences.
Robot Toby finds friends among orphaned children and robots down on the ground before he has to fight the robotised President Stone (Donald Sutherland) who wants the blue power source used to activate Toby (now called Astro).
And to finish off, I have some idea my review is just pathetic and just goes on about how 'great' the movie is.. when it actually is, but I just don't want anyone to get the wrong idea, it has so much in common with the original series that you wouldn't believe, it's rare nowadays that new animation movies have any background history (meaning any cartoons made and shown on TV before the movie) or even anything in common with its previous shows, so it's pretty good to see something like this come out, makes me happy to be the age I am now because when I was young CGI animation just wasn't this good... and that says something cause I'm only 17 ^^ And even if you have never heard of or even watched the original series it doesn't matter because the movie practically starts from scratch anyway if you know what I mean ;) So yeah, enjoy the movie (:
My Grandson looks forward to our weekly viewings now with his Grandpa.
From now on, Fincher could show that he was an exceptional filmmaker and he kept going with other masterpieces, such as "Fight Club", "Panic Room" and "Zodiac".
The character keeps getting brought through the 60's to the 80's, and now it's 2009.
Having seen this movie now I can whole heartedly say that this movie is as fun and action packed as any movie from the Pixar stable.
I barely watched a show now and then when I was a kid (I'm 36 years old... too young for Astroboy), so I wasn't really aware of the story.
i have never relegated a movie to be the worst ever till now.
If they were to drag it for too long (or worse, remake it now), they would have came up against the Internets public new growing image of adult entertainment.
The show is funnier for me today than when it first aired, mainly because I now understand that the main target were not children but people of more age, something that is relatively unknown.
As this happens, Freakazoid goes: 'now, now there's plenty of me to go round.
Myers now spends his days with Jackson in a police-run compound giving up his powerful one-time criminal accomplices - and messing with Jackson's mind and life....
And now, because the movie itself isn't as slick as Scream, or The Ring, everyone wants to blame the filmmakers.
Witcboard scared me then, and Ghostwatcher scared me now.
The three is only posted due to the fact that I now have an unflagging faith that myself and four of my stupid half-wit drunk friends can make a movie and release it directly to video.
Ghost Watcher 2 is now out, we'll rent it since we want to see if the 2nd part to this "film" could possibly get any worse!
i love this film so much it has a great story line and the actors are amazing.it helped that the film had Zack Efron in because he is a talented actor who recently the lead in high school musical i gave this film 10/10 because it was amazing and i dint want 2 blink because i did not want 2 miss a second of it i also thought that the film was heart warming and it made me see a whole new side of Zack's acting skills i no that i cant wait to see him in his new film hairspray because if it is as good as this it will be at the top of the charts the only downside to this film is that Crystal Hunt who plays Jill Overton got 2 kiss Zack i was so Jealous if only i lived in America i would of auditioned for that part but i live in england for now

I had avoided The Derby Stallion ever since it came out, because I was so much more concerned with other movies(but of course), and one day it was about time to leave the movie rental place, so I just grabbed it and ran on, and now I'm glad I got it.
Everyone know's the story by now, so I won't waste time telling it.
The film also features one of the earliest hints at the talents of comic/playwright John Leguziamo as sweet, introspective supermarket stock boy Johnny, a subdued, endearing performance by a man who's now known for extravagance.
Of course, since 2000, Linux has made great strides into the server market, the desktop market (even Walmart sells computers with Linux now), and the embedded market.
all run by Linux now (or soon will, according to announcements from manufacturers).
If you want to know how this all happened, Revolution OS will give you the background you need to understand the way the software business works now, and in the future.
Of course she fails to mention that Dr. Downer (who is a heavy drinker) botched up her test, and the lab has now revealed that she is healthy as a horse and will not die.
Certainly the jokes at the start concerning Ernest Jones are not so funny now - although Hecht did work in a scene where Ernest gets some back (having been called a fake by Oliver and others at the newspaper, Ernest stumbles into the truth about Hazel - and when he sees the others is swallowing it doesn't give a word of warning).
Lombard and Winninger by now know an error in diagnosis was made, but who can turn down an all expense paid trip to New York?
Jack Welch's fortress, Rockefeller Center, looked then just like it looks now.
Right now, the current hoax is the nomenclature used to describe the appointing of the Cabinet, as though the election were a fait accomplis: "Andrew Card, the president's new appointee......" and other such insiduously assumptive language has been used before, as this movie wonderfully points out.
There is now nothing stopping us.
I also remembered the whole exclusive accommodation block concept (just looks really 70's now!)
The sole weakness of the film is that it is seriously dated, some scenes are funny now simply because of people's clothing.
Still, this slice of Cronenberg's diseased reverence for "the flesh" carries the same "I need a shower now" feeling when it ends, as it did when it first unspooled on movie screens back in the day.
Once the doctor thought he was the master of his creation, but now he is the Host!
He has created a strain of parasites intended to replace malfunctioning internal organs but which are now out of control.
The leashed girls crawling around on all fours also probably would not be done now.
Cronenberg begins his body horror mentality by mixing sex, death, violence, disease, medicine, and technology at manic levels, something he has continued to do for over thirty years now.
Trapped instructs us on the excellence of the U. S. Treasury Department's Secret Service, as its agents track down the near-perfect plates for bogus $20 bills, now starting to show up in circulation.
Basically this whole movie can be summarized in ONE sentence: "Okay, better get going now...why aren't you leaving???????"
Fincher's talents for making a visually stunning film are now well known and he often brings a dark patina to his work.
why are zombies running now?
And the message in episode three (All is better now.
While tracking his stolen gun, he has to go incognito as a former soldier who is now living a life of desperation (we learn that his character really lived this life before getting a job with the police).
Nonetheless, I now have the massive undertaking of deciding which of Akira Kurosawa's films I will watch next.
I enjoyed very much IKIRU, but I have found NORA INU in some respects even stronger and more respectable; I ignored completely this early Kurosawa, Kurosawa's whole early career, and now I see it's something awesome.
And these two are doing now needed more than ever.
I've seen this movie three times now, and not just because i had some pretty bad experiences with ticket collectors and bus drivers too.
Later, the now down-and-out sailor suddenly agrees to ferry two loudmouth, fringe bar singers and their bothersome dog on a 4-week trip to Barbados.
It never happened, & now Elizabeth Hurley (who receives third billing) is featured on the front of the video box.
What I know is that Powder Keg is the more serious The Hire episode, until now.
The Driver now shows a bit of his personality, gives the photographer's personal belongings to his mother and probably, goes to the Times' headquarters and gives the photos to them.
Nothing dates quicker than comedy and people that once made the world laugh (such as Chaplin) are now viewed as being anything but funny.
It is a Dirty Dozen-style shoot'em'up action film that ends up not very spectacular at all (although there are some scenes on top of a moving train that is reminiscent of 1983's Octopussy) and tries to be poignant now and then, humorous failing with every attempt.
Of course "Bastards" was also part and well, I will be trying to see all of those films now not before but after Tarantino's "Basterds" and yes, I'm still a newcomer in regards of war pictures and yes if not for QT I probably would have never seen this film, hell anyways it would have never been released on DVD or Blu-Ray (the 3-disc edition contains a really great conversation with QT and Castellari).
It's great because at first it was just more of the same, I mean more killings and more lies with the bastards, now they killed a bunch of American soldiers thinking they were Germans and took advantage of the confusion of the French pretending to be, this time, certainly not Germans but other Americans, the American soldiers they just had killed, the American soldiers that were especially trained for a mission.
Certainly well known now for giving Quentin Tarantino inspiration (as well as a title) for his most recent film, "The Inglorious Bastards" is worth watching for fans of the World War II action film.
In doing so they accidentally kill a German squad who turns out to be Yankee special forces and now they're forced to undertake a "mission impossible", by blowing up a mobile research faculty, a train lab if you will and demolish a mobile V2 rocket system.
So, the now free convicts decide to make their way to neutral Switzerland.
Not only is it a great example of the kind of movie I go for, but I've been wanting to write something about it for a while now.
The Guardsman is now one of my 10 favorite films.
The dialogue reeked, the acting sucked, the camera work stunk and even at times appeared like a cheap porn, and there was now real clear story to it.
I remember laughing at it when I was younger but now that I think about it, it just seems depressing.
He's made a success, but that success has made him hard and mean, and now he lives in fear of anyone rising above him.
It is all to easy to look back on things now and start naming heroes.
It is now Dane's turn to find in his heart and soul how to reconcile all the elements of his shattered life and so make forgiveness and love the main messages of the second part of the movie.
Many winters passed, and the young maiden was now an old Indian squaw, playing in the open thicket with her only granddaughter.
Dane now has to deal with...hidden revelations...of all that has happened during...All The Winters That Have Been.
Remember this is now a decade where admittedly Moslems are doing some horrible things in many parts of the globe.
Just as his character the Cardinal of an unnamed Balkan country now ruled by a Marxist dictatorship went into the church as a way of rising above the station he was born in life.
Ex comrades in arms, fighting in the Resistance against the Nazis; they now find themselves on opposing sides of Church and State.
griffin plays a former fireman who quit when his best friend died in a fire and is now a tugboat captain and is now raising the son of his friend.
My vision of the pitch:  "Okay.... Eddie Griffin.... okay... stay with me.... Eddie griffin is a retired Navy Seal.... okay.... stay with me.... now he's a tug boat captain!....
How it impacted the Henry family, and showed us why we should care about them now than the first series.
If you want to measure how much television production and mass entertainment has regressed over 20 years you should check "War and Remembrance" and compare it with trash aired on television and theaters right now.
I have had this on VHS and now on DVD for a long time, I love it and have re-watched it a few times.
Moreover- many of these same persons have no ability ( or desire ) to make the connection of those years( 1933-1945 ) as to how the world is now formulated.
Previously, I wouldn't have any notion that he could become what he is now.
Anyway, we are now in the present and the recently awakened warlock uses his scarecrow body to kill various Goodmans(..and others in his path)looking to retrieve his magical book of spells and reunite with his bones so that he can return to fleshly form even more powerful than he is as a walking man of string.
You know how those educational videos that they show us in school, whether you're in school now or you were in school 20 years ago, all look like they were made in the early 1970's by people being paid in bad polyester suit patches?
I had a sinking feeling that I wasn't going to like the movie bio of what was now my favorite comedian, but I went to see it anyway, as soon as it opened, hoping my gut instinct was wrong.
I mean for the cost of a weekend rental they could have had an epic movie making seminar and maybe they would not have ended up with this mess of a film that is right now playing in the background on my lap top.
Everyone seems as bored as I am right now.
I have never seen footage of a Bruce concert/performance, but I have several as music files and have listened to them many times (particularly the Berkeley and Carnegie Hall performances that are also undoubtedly CDs now); Hoffman captures his verbal mannerisms perfectly.
FYI Â There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past Truly Moving Picture Award winners that are now either at the theater or available on video.
That being said, there now only remains an onslaught of negative opinion.
Aryoung picks South Korea, mainly because her mother is Korean and now lives somewhere in that country.
Major disappointments are the film's omissions of Chaplin's post-Limelight work, Monsieur Verdoux, and A Woman Of Paris, a box office failure upon its release now regarded as one of Chaplin's most important films and an adult film ahead of its time.
So now we come to the silly schoolgirl crush which Shirley Temple's character conceives with regard to the urbane, sophisticated, handsome, and slightly rakish artist played by Cary Grant.
Our teen heroine in this movie is a bit of what we would now call a "drama queen."
Temple, the darling little girl of the 1930s, was now grown up, and here comes closest to playing a really bratty character: so spoiled that she does not care about how her actions affect Loy, Grant, Vallee, and her boyfriend from high school (Johnny Sands).
The movie is original in idea, but had the same formula and end results for the productions made back then (and a few right now).
Some of my favorite moments with Hoffman in Lenny was when he thinks about the nurse the first time, when Honey calls asking for money, and when he asks the Judge to sentence him now instead of going through the trial.
Most of the other reviews posted here have compared this movie unfavorably with Mank's A Letter To Three Wives and whilst there are similarities it is actually closer - as my summary indicates - to a much later movie, Buona Sera, Mrs Campbell, in which any one of three GIs could be the father of Gina Lollobrigida's now fully grown daughter.
Eleanor Parker is a sweet woman who gave up an illegitimate child and is now happily married.
I can now see why the show did not last, towards the end the writing was very bad and some of the episodes were long and had too many holes in the plot.
The director/co-writer, Jacques Audiard, has taken a film previously made by James Toback called Fingers, starring Harvey Keitel in the role now occupied by Romain Duris, and made it his own.
Audiard has made a powerful actors' movie in which Duris blooms, a powerful actor now, playing in effect both the Cassel and the Devos parts and acting out the resulting implosion of violence and frustrated artistic passion with astonishing zest.
Audiard, who showed us dark secret places last time, now reveals himself a virtuoso of violence and passion.
I was looking forward on watching this and now I'll wait for the 3rd part!
Cooper, the nominal lead, had just had a career resurgence with his Oscar-winning performance in another genre outing â the classic HIGH NOON (1952); as I said in my review of YELLOW SKY (1948), which Iâve just watched, Widmarkâs role here was kind of similar to the one he played in that earlier Western â though, by now, he had begun to stretch effectively from outright villain types.
And now Hooker (Cooper), Fiske (Widmark) and Daly (Mitchell) will all slowly learn about each other and are about to get their loyalty tested.
I bought this film on DVD in a local secondhand DVD shop,ours being region 2,i was surprised that you can not get this on region 1 area or region 0 which a lot of modern dvds are now,i suppose if you really look around you will find them.I thought the film was very good for 1954,the photography was good,the horse riding scenes on the cliffs were exciting,and the music was good,it was subtle and gradually built up to a climax,but never became to intense,the film was quite atmospheric almost as if you were with them,the directing was clever.the characters were interesting,five very different types of people all brought together.However i think i am the only female so far to wright a comment on this film ,and my point of view may differ.What i see is that the female character is acting in a very paranoid and agitated way ,and is trying to distance her self from them,which is how you would react if you were a woman travelling with four men you don't know,to her the enemies may not just be the Indian's in the mountains.The scene in where she is riding her horse and she looks round because she can hear Hooker and Friske laughing,believing it must be about her, says it all.I mean ,every time she makes a move to go anywhere one of them follows her,i don't think it has occurred to them that she may just want to go to the toilet,the only ulterior motive i can see her having is get me out of this uncomfortable situation,thats why she wanted to stay behind and stoke the fire,she was probably thinking give me some space.A good intriguing film any way.
However, the lure of the prospects of wealth spur the group on to the mine, and they reach the mine, save the husband, but now face the dangers posed by the Apaches.
But whatever the reason, the six find themselves suddenly facing the problems of returning to the Mexican town they left 100 miles or so away, facing a now visible and deadly Apache threat, and hampered by an injured Marlowe.
Instead, they are now in Puerto Miguel, approached by a woman in trouble, a Spanish-speaking American woman, Leah Fuller (Susan Hayward), who offers to pay them handsomely if they escort her through hazardous Indian territory to rescue her husband who is hurt and trapped in a gold mine up there in the hills...
Their financial situation changes when the child is about 2, and before the adoption is final, the adoption head honchos threaten to take her away, because now they are poor.
It is as though the movie is almost a warning to parents, enjoy them now because the little ones you love maybe taken from you at any moment, except, just kidding, that does not really matter because you can always have another and poof your grief will be gone.
But it seems the film has now drifted into public domain, and the result is incredibly dire: a very muddy soundtrack coupled to a picture that shudders and shakes so that you can barely stand to look at it.
She was murdered for being her and not what other people wanted her to be and now she is dead she didn't deserve it.
I have just ventured in to the world of DVD and now have Chuck Yaeger breaking the sound barrier in my living room.
When objects fly in the movie, they are seen this way: here it comes (from the left), there it goes (to the left), here it comes (from below), there it goes (off the bottom), now it wobbles (to show how fast it's going), the dials on the instrument panel turn, then out the front window, now where did it go?, now it's coming right at you, and last just the vapor trail seen from the ground.
But now having seen it it's quite clear I was missing something fairly excellent in the cannon of the "Bio-pic".
OK, now that we've gotten that out of the way.
They both go to their aunt's house to live, but after knowing that Setsuko and Seita are now orphans,their aunt changes her behavior and starts to be cruel and annoying with them.
However, every now and then an animated film comes along that extends it's boundaries and manages to deliver a very adult story, and Grave of the Fireflies is one of those films.
We follow Seita and Setsuko, a brother and sister that have lost their parents in the war and are now forced to fend for themselves in the war torn country.
You find yourself hoping that things will go right now for Setsuko and Seita, and then the knowledge that ultimately it won't undercuts you with real emotional power.
My mother watched one episode with me after I told her about it and now she can't wait for the new episode.
(So, until now I still don't understand how come the man at one row before me could be sleeping and snoring so annoyingly while his girlfriend/wife/sister was staring hard on the screen without moving her head.)
With the sublime Teresa Stratas in the title role, and the now legendary Placido Domingo as her love interest, one cannot ask for better leads.
And anyway, in those days, people did not realise it was racist, they thought it was all right, but now we realize that shorts like this (which include a great deal of others which are way more racist) can insult other cultures.
In short: one of my favorite films right now!
If you like anime, you have to watch this right now.
Cowboy Bebop is a 26 episode animated series from Japan.Now to tell you the truth, I am not a really big fan of anime, I like the fairly violent anime films and the original dragon ball series but I am not a big fan of any others...except this one of course.If you are a fan of anime, you must watch this show now!
Earth is now but a wasteland and civilization has expanded to the further reaches of the galaxy.
I was never a fan of that type of music but after watching the show I now owe a lot of records from the smooth jazz realm.
If I were making it right now I'd probably cast little Dakota Fanning as Ed, Clive Owen as Spike, Jessica Alba as Fey, The Rock as Jet, and Keanu Reeves as Vicious.
Next in line is Jet Black, the owner of the Cowboy Bebop who used to work as a police man and is now a bounty hunter just trying' to get by.
I've been watching anime now for a while, but I come to Cowboy Bebop late.
The soundtrack (oh the music)has been a part of my collection for a long time now.
Conveniently, the FBI shows up about now and praises Danielle for B&E, murder, defying her suspension, and bringing two non-FBI agents into an FBI investigation.
It is not surprising that Naderi having made these films in Iran, won accolades at international film festivals and now lives in the US far from his native land that provided fodder for his creativity.
Americans should stop making horrors now and let the British take over as it clearly obvious that we are better at it!
Well I now rate movies as to how long they take me to get restless, bored and angry as that George Lucas trash did) this rates a 7.
My daughter turned me on to this movie and now every time I learned that it is airing I watch it religiously.
I can now look at it and smile, but also recall those dreams which invaded my sleep.
I can now look at it and smile, but also recall those dreams which invaded my sleep.
In which sky are those stars shining now?
I guess looking at this movie now, it would seem kind of funny, but in those days, it was a horror movie!
I loved Darkwing Duck when I was 5 years old and I still love it now!
It's interesting how most cartoons from childhood seem lame when I watch them now but Darkwing Duck remains funny and entertaining.
This and Talespin are absolutely great, as are the Little Mermaid and Aladdin TV series, but now they are unfairly cancelled.
It sucks how Disney now airs terrible cartoons that are just unoriginal and just crap, 1990's Disney Afternoon cartoons are the best and they're will never be a replacement for that!
It totally ruined a great movie and now I am going to have to try to forget that I ever saw it in the first place.
They've all been okay at best, Godawful at worst, but now it's this late entry from Wesley Snipes co-starring Tamzin Outhwaite, unknown to many but known to me and no doubt many other British viewers from hit TV soap East Enders.
And with that being said, 7 seconds is just about as watchable an anything being produced these days unless you want to soil your sensibilities in the mire of sadistic garbage that is being pushed at us now.
But Bucharest serves very well now as a backdrop for movies, be it action or otherwise.
On my, oh my, where has the promising career of Wesley Snipes gone, he mixed it up with Stallone in demolition man, played alongside Sean Connery in Rising Sun, even had his own comic book trilogy of movies, and now he's decided to muscle in on Seagal, Van Damme & Lungren territory - the straight to video market !
Ty, have you seen "Ronin", now thÃ¡t's a car chase.
i have to say i've been a fan of Takashi Miike's films for some time now.
Of course the old mythology is still present and with some flashbacks we are going to see how this two clans ends in the same town that now is almost abandoned and is controlled by the two clans.
Here a family story is also shown, with a couple that when they get married they forget about the clans but now the woman is going to avenge the dead of his husband by joining the clan of the whites.
Even I really liked the first part of the film, with the story of the town and some memorable scenes (like the "now my name is Henry" or the escape of the gunman), is the final part the best one.
I'm glad I finally saw this picture, one of the most expected of the last year and now one of my personal favourites.
Django, now your love has gone away.
SUKIYAKI WESTERN DJANGO, while it boasts some incredible production values (from the town itself to the pyrotechnics to some absolutely beautiful cinematography), suffers badly when it comes to story (YOJIMBO has been emulated so many times over the years that it must be tied with MOST DANGEROUS GAME by now) and character (it's impossible to pull for the hero because he's rarely little more than a bit player; we never get to know him to the degree that we do, say, Toshiro Mifune in YOJIMBO and SANJURO).
When one thinks of the cowboy Western names like John Ford, Sam Peckinpah, Howard Hawks and John Huston might come to mind but Japanese new wave and cult director Miike Takashi would probably be the last person you would think of being on that list, that is until now.
I was really looking forward to this movie for months now.
Set around, in a strikingly offbeat way to, the 12th century Heike/Genji clan wars Sukiyaki Western Django is the tale of a mysterious gunman (played by Hideoki Ito) who comes into a nearly deserted once prospering town now controlled by the two rival groups.
Corbucci's own Django used the same basic premise and now Miike follows.
Sukiyaki Western Django pays homage to what is now a dead genre.
Hopefully there will be Dougs Second Movie, now that would be great
The two sides are now in confusion as to where their nuke has gone to and how to return home.
The war film now becomes a comedy, trying to find different ways for Lee to prepare for battle, and how modern weapons can somehow be carried over to ancient times.
So what are you waiting for--this is now out on DVD and looks crisp and vivid.
This film is so much fun I can't believe I just found out about it now!
And it's nice to see Whitney looking very pretty, as opposed to now where she's destroying herself with drugs.
After missing out on Reagan's assassination attempt, bodyguard Frank Farmer is now working for-hire.
The film now seems like a myth to me because it's rating across many forums is on the low side, critics hate it and you will be hard pressed to find macho film fans readily about to own up to liking the picture.
The rest of the cast are merely playing second fiddle to the well matched up leads, and outside of Gary Kemp becoming increasingly annoying as the film progresses, they all blend in well to create what is now a sadly undervalued picture.
I was watching this episode now and did not have a clue.
I'd rather rest my head between Uhura's massive pillows now than be fighting aliens on this damn planet."
Many of the other major characters have now passed away and often just replaced with other 'similar' characters, making it more like a soap than a much-loved sitcom.
Even Clegg (Peter Sallis) is now only in episodes briefly.
I feel the producers are now just trying to keeps the show alive for as long as possible, but with few 'original' characters and poorer story lines, new episodes could tarnish the image of the series that was once brilliant.
'Last' is watched by children too; in fact its one of the few television comedies on now that the family can enjoy.
The show gives me something to look forward too now.
I just wish he would chase after Nora Batty now who left.
Even though the characters come and go, there are now new refreshing characters.
Now, if you could go back in time just for one moment and buy the bumper, but now it is 100,000 dollars (just for the bumper).
By now, Luis has given has wife access to bank accounts, and when she runs with his cash, he pursues her, with the help of Downs, the P.I., perhaps to kill her.
Director Michael Cristofer already gave the viewers 'Body Shot' & now he offers audience an erotic thriller, which has been presented in a very beautiful way.
Every now and then an avid movie theater goer is bound to stumble upon something like this, but it still took be by surprise.
Okay, now here's the shocker.
But when Vargas's new bride suddenly disappears, the businessman discovers that his life is now totally based in her.
All I can say is brush up on your English Ms. Valette, because Hollywood is going to be pounding down your door any second now.
He had also grown up now.
Finally he manages to safely reach her to Delhi where she asks him to marry her and leave for Britain.Though by this time he is also deeply in love with her, he must fulfill his 'Dharma' now, that is to marry his fiancÃ© Lakshmi .
I'd really like to see what they could do with a real budget and hopefully they've gotten one by now because these folks have a shot at doing something great in horror if they're given the chance.
I have watched it multiple times now and enjoy watching it.
And it turns out to be true now that I have come to the boards and read almost every review I could find.
The story of their love is told in a very James Cameron's Titanic like fashion, as the old lady Catherine (now played by Polly Adams) returns to the land where she was born to retell the story of her lost love Kisna which we see in flashback as she is interviewed by some lucky reporters.
Because for now, I very strongly feel that Subhash Ghai owes me Rs.
It seems now that Company's Chandu Nagre happened a long , long time ago .
I felt the lead role was miscasted; Hritik would have been perfect as Kisna; he does the soft (poet) and hard (warrior) sides better than anyone in the industry right now.
but now sitting alone and thinking back, i see more and more holes.
Edith Wharton is dead and buried: I hope she will now remain that way.
However, as time passed my interest in older Japanese films began to increase, so now I am trying to broaden my knowledge of classic Japanese films, especially those that were filmed before 1945 of which I have only seen a handful.
The older sister is loyal to a man who supported her in her youth, a shopkeeper who is now broke and helps him on account of loyalty not because there was something in it for her.
The logo at the beginning of 1952's "Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla" reveals that this is a "Realart Picture," and while I would certainly hesitate to call this film an instance of "real art," I can now attest that it IS real fun.
No one would dare do that kind of thing now.
A group of college kids who took the acid "blue sunshine" in 1966 are now getting headaches, losing hair and killing people in the most violent ways.
*****SPOILER ALERT*****  Flemming use to sell LSD while at school but this drug is called Blue Sunshine and everyone who took it then is now ten years later feeling the effects by having their hair fall out and becoming a homicidal maniac that kills anyone in their path.
Likewise I rather enjoyed Mark Goddard's performance as Edward Flemming, a former drug dealer now running for Congress.
Well, having now seen it, I can say that I'm pretty glad I did.
The plot is genuinely intriguing, and Lieberman plays with the conventions of this type of film by having his protagonist *not* be terribly likable, and by having the supposed "villain", a politician running for congress ('Lost in Space's' Mark Goddard) not being really evil at all but just a guy whose bad decisions in the past are now coming back to haunt him.
So, now Jerry Zipkin is on the run to prove his innocence.
When trying to uncover evidence to clear his name, Jerry he finds out that 10 years ago, a group of people from the same college Stanford University have taken a new form of LSD called Blue Sunshine, which now has suddenly caused them to lose their hair and change into homicidal maniacs.
"Olga was now about to achieve a new level of sadism," pronounced "sad-dism."
Go buy it now!
Assuming that the tapes do exist still, I would expect the demand is enough now to justify its release on DVD.
Man, I now hardly know anyone who saw it, but my then-husband and I were big fans.
A video store owner and rednecks with guns must now save the town.
When in space, his mind was expanded and now he knows everything.
The final nail in the coffin for the by now desperate Kroll was that his love of loves, and he had many of them in the film, Marta Molnar left him for another man!
At the movie's end, Kroll's partners are at a meeting where they now realize they all face economic ruin as Kroll's business empire is about to collapse.
Even with all the technical mastery available now to Hollywood filmmakers now, no studio can come close to the greatness of The Match King, made only two years after Warner Bros. scrapped its Vitaphone sound discs to switch to sound on film cameras.
Looking back now, it seems incredible that the Warner Bros. dream factory could make one high quality movie after another in 1932, usually with a 3 week production schedule (6 day work weeks with no overtime pay) on a budget of around $150,000.
In this year of 2009, as the financial world is again enmeshed in worldwide economic downturn caused by thieves in business suits, thieves now who sold near worthless derivatives to investors on a massive scale, Hollywood turns out hit movies dealing with robots and teenage vampires.
There are no movies in fast production now involving the Madoff Ponzi scheme, the strange death of Madoff investor Jeffrey Picower or the subprime mortgage meltdown.
When Farley Granger's devout but tubercular mother dies, it precipitates a rampage against everything that makes up the prison of his life: his ugly urban poverty; his penny-pinching employer who offers promises rather than a raise; the Church, which once refused burial to his father, a suicide, and is now refusing his mother the "big" funeral he thinks he owes her; the smarmy, sanctimonious undertaker.
But compassionate pastor Dana Andrews (now in flashback) suspects the truth....
It had some creative moments in it which now a days that is all you can really expect from a zombie movie.
And now I wished Queen Latifah would have come out, and kicked all there butts.
And now, since 2003, we have Adam Vardy's "Mendy", a masterpiece of authenticity, with exactly the right balance of hidden critique and irony, illusion and satire, a real "Laughing under Tears", as Dr. Salcia Landmann had characterized the work of Sholem-Alejchem.
All the doctors are then set free, however the fifth doctor is informed that he is now declared Lord President of Gallifrey but he says to the Chanellor of Gallifrey, to take charge until he returns, which is the beginning of the doctor going on the run from his own people.
It is now up to her to change her ways and discover that the best way to love them is to love them just the way they are.
So, now the crazy guy is loose in the city, headed for a late night bar sporting that new-fangled invention called television.
This seldom seen, nearly forgotten gem stands out as a precursor to many movie motifs now taken for granted.
Items that were curiosities at the time but are now part of everyday life: A flat-panel big screen TV, TV news hype, and, alas, crazies that for no reason shoot patrons who are total strangers.
When he gets sacked by the horrible hypocritical Monseigneur, we want to cheer because he is free of the crap and now has time to take more interest in - which twin is it?
I found this tape while cleaning out my garage(must have been my dad's or something, I respect him much less now knowing he would watch some weak garbage like this).
After the initial shock of seeing this 'soft porn' (I can call it soft porn now since I've seen regular adult movies/X rated porn against this!
It's not that I particularly have anything against pornography; but what's taboo now and what was taboo over three decades ago are different things, and besides that; you can only watch people having sex for so long before it begins to get dull.
Knowing that his boss does not even take her seriously and that he is the one who should play the matchmaker in the story, Rahul now has to choose between his dreams of success, and his love for Seema.
Chris O'Donnell is just as good as Sam's grandson, Adam Hall, who is now a lawyer.
First there was Blade Runner, then came Total Recall and now we have Screamers.
It is a future time and prisons are now run by private companies for profit because the economy went to hell.
--And this future time is not far from now either.
That's just his track record now as an action star.
A Lot of Dumbheads try to say look like ...... look like these idiot always love to look like something now mario kart idiot Mario kart bla bla was made after Twisted metal and Vigilante 8 these are basic car combat games like snes Rock and Roll racing D: relearn them then try to say look like ......

But now that I got my NASCAR crap out of my system, racing cars can be fun.
But as they say in Hollywood "you're only as good as your last picture" so Anderson is as good as anyone right now.
Robert Peel formed a Tory government, but it only lasted for a few months because Parliament by now had firm control of the Treasury.
William IV was forced to call back Earl Grey and bow to the wishes of the people's representatives, now even more representative since the Reform Act of 1832 reapportioned Parliament after several hundred years.
Meanwhile, Andre's real life is outlined in stunning detail, his deadend job in a call centre, his life surrounded by his dead mother's belongings, his ex-girlfriend, now living in a wealthy suburb.
I am now adding "Victoria and Albert" to my list of all time favorites.
My rottweiler, Lyric, who is now 13 years old was in this movie when she was 7 weeks old.
Honestly now...I read the comments before i watched this feature film, and I must say that I am glad I paid little to no interest in some of the posts i saw prior to my actual viewing.
One must wonder what some of the so called "critics" use as the fundamentals for judging when they view different genres of movies.I mean come on now...it's a MARTIAL ARTS MOVIE...what we want to see is martial arts action...if you want a great plot then go and watch a psychological thriller or a drama.
The first scene with The Justice giving a "clerk-typist" an envelope with "hope it's sufficient - use it well" should tell you right now there's some hanky-panky going-on.
That film (based on an earlier book by Ray Bradbury) seemed dated, even by the 70s, but is more topical than ever now.
What made it shocking in 1973 -- the strangeness of being able to peek into someone else's day-to-day life -- has now been eclipsed by a torrent of tell-all talk shows and contrived "reality shows."
Another sad moment comes in the now infamous footage of Lance riding his bike through the hills of Santa Barbara, while in voice-over, Bill reads a letter to his son explaining the destruction of the marriage and how he hopes one day he and his son can be friends.
Truthfully, the American family is even more broken now than ever before, which ironically, gives this series more relevance today than it had 35 years ago.
I hope to see a lot more from this now young nation of potential film makers... the actors in Osama are all off the streets.
Should the world now tolerate regimes that in the name of religion kill and torture while subverting the most basic individual rights?
now comes on of my greatest pet peeves about the synopsis and reviews on the cover of a movie or book or whatever.
this should be a required film to be seen be all those quo are either in denial or are immune to the many "inequities" that exist in the world since time immoral up into what is now the 21st century, submitted with the utmost respect and love... jamie jo Jesus   i realize i would be hung, burned at the stake, tortured, crucified, stoned to death, and more if republished this in iraq..if not now?
and if we don't once aging rally ourselves to do something about these injustices now...then when?
I spent three days telling everyone I saw just how bad it was, I now have no friends thanks to this film.
There is much weeping among the women and those who didn't wear black, did so now.
But what makes the movie is the performance of the fabulous Beatrice Lillie, unknown to me before now.
And now lets talk about unibrow girl... shave it!
The main point of interest in this rarely seen movie now is the equally rarely heard Jerry Goldsmith score, which I rather like.
He now looks like Daffy duck with plastic surgery.
He used to have his head in the clouds, but now he's lost in outer space.
In the past, they got all the greatest wrestlers, legends, stars of tomorrow such as Randy Orton, Batista, Rey Mysterio, Lashley, Kid Kash, Mexicools, Paul London, Matt Hardy, Hardcore Holly, JBL, Booker T., Chris Benoit, and sometimes The Undertaker PLUS the future of this sport in The Boogeyman (strange dude), Stacy Keibler, Orlando Jordan, MNM, Sylvan... but even now, the roster is brilliant !
Smackdown is the total package, sometimes it have his ups & downs but right now since Wrestlemania, the show is back at what it always was, a top WRESTLING show... plus you have very good entertaining...
My dad wanted to try it, and now he is hooked.
I needed to know what happened next every single episode, so now, I'm addicted.
The series is now approaching its sixth season and the theme of Jack Bauer saving Los Angeles from annihilation is getting old.
I'm now hooked on the soundtrack by Sean Callery and the performances by the characters, most notably Kiefer Sutherland as the great Jack Bauer.
- what the hell is that all about i think that they should bring this series to a hasty conclusion because its done its time now!
Now I am waiting the next season I think now jack must have some peace in his life.
I just finished Day 6 (season 6) and now have to rehab from my 24 addiction again.
I would strongly recommend that if you do not already watch 24, start now because you're really missing out.
My friends have raved about 24 for a few years now, and I never caught any of the episodes on Sky ( cable ) to really comment on it.
Okay bored now, but you get the idea?
This show needs a little humor -- nothing over the top, just maybe have a character make a wise crack every now and then or even (*gasp*) smile.
I bought it on the big DVD pack with the complete first season, because it isn't available in German television right now.
Natural Born Killers is a very violent and controversial film.The two Columbine school shooters were said to have have watched this film over and over again.Its a very violent film and not recommended for children who cannot handle this type of material.I am 15 now and I saw this film when I was 13.It didn't affect me in any way.I play plenty of violent video games and watch violent movies and they don't make me want to kill anybody.This is because I can separate fantasy from reality.Anyway that was my rant...now on to the film review.Natural Born Killers is an underrated and excellent movie.Im surprised its only 6.8, I think it should be in IMDb's Top 250.The performances in this film are great.Woody Harleson the actor who played Mickey Knox ironically had a father who was a hit-man.Anyway the story is great as it shows how the media portrays murderers.The film basically shows the life of Mickey and Malloryy knox.In a comedic "I Love Lucy" spoof, you see Mallory's life at home with her abusive father.Mickey is a butcher who delivers meat and delivers it one day to Mallory's home.The two both led disturbing lives and basically they kill Mallory's family and start going on killing spree's.After a while, they get caught and go to prison while a reporter wants to do an interview with Mickey.A prison riot breaks out and basically they are set free.A cool aspect about this film is sometimes during the violent scenes of the film, you see some trippy images.Natural Born Killers is a great film worth watching for anyone who can handle it.
And neither is Stone--even now he's still having trouble defending his film.
It may not rise as much debate today, as we are getting used to more violence, but it certainly opens you're eyes and it's criticism of the media is now probably even more topical then it's ever been.
Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis play the titular "Natural Born Killers," Mickey and Mallory, a pair of crazy serial killers who both suffered traumatic childhoods and are now rampaging America on a literal killing spree.
After they are finally apprehended, the media has by now turned them into such icons and glorified personalities that the public and media seems to respect them as titans of filth.
The major contradiction in media culture now is that on the one hand, Natural Born Killers is reviled for inciting violence, while on the other hand, it is reviled for being _too obviously_ critical of media violence in a simplistic and unsubtle manner.
Everybody who is reading this review right now has probably seen the film anyway so I won't reiterate the plot, but what I will do is try and help explain the concept of the film since it's quite obvious that there are a few people out there who don't understand this film.
After the Cold War was over these same people started asking themselves, "well, who is the enemy now?".
So now, after watching it all the way through, my final conclusion is that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
I like Corman but his time has passed by now, please, for heavens sake, move the genre forward or leave it to others.
Because if you look real carefully at your tv, you'll notice the foot locker and the dirt on the side which I believe now is a movie theatre called United Artists.

Oh, I love that movie, now I know why I felt so sentimental when I watched that movie first time - it reminds me my childhood so so much.
Most other games I used to play then seem weak and childish (well, duh) when looked at now.
Until now, I've only saw the second biggest monkey head yet.
The story of Paul and Burns, and the group of young, radical women who dedicate their lives to securing women the right to vote is, until now, one of the great-untold American stories of the century.
A haunting reminder of how much we take for granted in the freedom to choose that we, as women, now enjoy.
He shocked me with his talent in the remake of Hamlet, impressed me with Lost in Translation, and now somehow has combined the putz he often plays with an extremely complicated character that few other actors could manage.
The narrative features an interesting narrative hook (a man can't remember who he is and now thugs are after him for something he hid... and he doesn't know where it is, let alone *what* it is).
I can tell you right now that this unlike almost all Sonic The Hedgehog games for various reasons.
Another thing, Rouge The Bat tore away from all Sonic games, making it very obvious that the creator had intended it to be for fans now who were fans from the very begining.
But hey, I'm a 40 year old guy (now), so maybe if I was a 15 year old budding lesbian in 1980, this would have been my "Citizen Kane"?
I watched it again this weekend and now I can't stop thinking about it.
I'm too curious, now...
You may never get the chance to see this film...i understand that it is deleted now...but if you ever get the chance, watch it!
Her old man the city's Environmental Commissioner David Pearl,David Coffield,now wants to turn Times Square, what turned out to be her and her friend Nicky's happy stomping grounds, from the gritty and anything goes swinging district that it is into a Disneyland on the Hudson gaga-land with no personality at all!
I have visited New York City several times now due to my interest that was kindled by this movie.
I know more about films now than I did 25 years ago and thanks to the DVD commentary (by Director Allen Moyle and Robin Johnson-who played Nikki) I now know a lot about what went into the making of "Times Square".
Moyle now wishes he had not left the production after a dispute over including additional songs (so they could have a double album) because his continued presence would at least have had some damage control value.
Looking back on it, I feel now like I am giving it a hard time, but there wasn't much to it, really.
The people he despised are now his best friends, including the office bully and the office slut, who would have never given the time of day before.
He soon begins to visit Vanessa in the hospital, whose spine was severed by a bullet and is now a quadriplegic.
While by no means one of my favorite actresses, it was a delight to see Elisha Cuthbert in a role where her gorgeous looks are only part of her performance and are not THE performance; here is a beautiful woman who freely admits to using her sexuality as a means of getting ahead in life and now she's been reduced to nothing - a fact that she freely admits to having accepted - and finally having to take things extra slow because her most valuable asset has been taken away from her: her own body.
Having embezzled money from the night club he manages, Adolph Menjou must now replace the money before the auditors arrive or face prison.
Every now and then Bob imagines shooting five loath coworkers or blowing up ADD's building.
Saw this on an airplane today, and now I'm kicking back and looking it up.
However, now he has something different to deal with--a greedy and amoral gambler who is determined to get rid of the sheriff once and for all.
gives characterization reasonable depth: Scott and Lansbury are married but she had left him because of his dangerous job (a situation which she has to live through again now); Scott tells Donnelly that he hears The Beast (which symbolizes the scourge of the town) every morning until it's replaced by church-bells at the end of the picture.
Scott is wounded and widely believed to have been killed, but comes back to settle scores, while his ex-wife (Angela Lansbury) who is now a singer and dancer in a burlesque company comes into town and does a quite revealing song and dance number.
She now wants only to "win," no matter what that entails or who gets hurt.
I know that all of the film-school graduates may disagree with me, with him being a much loved director, but come on now, if this is beautiful art, then so are paintings of soup cans.
now really, David!).
But yet, there is an escape.... that epiphanic closing sequence where Dern finishes the shoot, breaks away from the director and sees herself on screen - now outside the movie - is followed by her killing the sinister phantom and embracing the tearful Polish girl... its a serene, goose-pimply moment of release and self-discovery.
That expletive-strewn 14-page ("single-spaced") ur-monologue that anchors the film was shot in the back of DL's house with a Sony PD-150 digital video camera he'd started to use in connection with his website, www.davidlynch.com, "a common midrange model" that sells now for $2,724.
It saddens me to say this, because i love Tupac as much as the next bloke, but on his form in this film it's no bad thing that he now lies six feet under.
But by now he's a boozy shadow of his former self and the star of the show Joseph Bologna assigns his most junior writer, Mark Linn-Baker to keep him in reasonable condition to perform.
You see in film clips the man O'Toole once was and now only commands attention by making a public spectacle of himself at times.
"You're a big star now, and I'm sure you always will be," Benjy says.
I used to watch this show as a young teenager every week and now I'm watching it every week as a young adult and I'm still loving it.
I've watched it when i was a child and now as a young adult again.
I'm so glad that they are now playing the series back on Belgium television.
I thought it was the best series around i live about 3quarters of an our away i use to go with mum after School every 2nd Wednesday and meet quite a lot even the 2 old cogers :) one who lived in Minyip nice chap :) herb Krause very nice to have a chat with the old Emma Garage is now a Internet Cafe , the 2 milk bars have now closed down.
they only just recently opened a new one across from the Public toilets, the old bank   they only got Bendigo bank now , the Pub that they used has now Been Reopened was closed for a while, they only had one pub for awile down near Primary school end great people there nice lunches the emppty Bakery still there, the supermarkets still there, the chemists still there, most hasn't changed they still use the football Ground minyip-Murtoa alternate games between Minyip & Murtoa got a lot of friends both places   i remember going into the Milk Bar where i met Viki Blanch she was nice some talk to you for a while especially when their between shots
They are showing re-runs here in Sweden now again, and I can't be happier!
The most fun in this movie is the opportunity to look back at the US in 1950 where we see the cars and fire engines and even a soda fountain which were all very ordinary for that time period, but which now would be found in museums.
The story takes place around Christmas (so it is being shown right now)and has some traces of Scrooge in Orth's skinflint (except he is married and has a son).
Before Seth MacFarlane got to where he is now with adult comedies like Family Guy and American Dad, he actually had a job doing kids shows and worked on titles like Johnny Bravo and Dexter's Lab.
Now, i have been watching B-movie horrors for sometime now and this film is by far the worst one i have ever watched but also the best.
I am amazed that this film has not toured the U.S, by now.
I'm now trying to find a DVD copy of this film for my collection.
Its hard to find in the U.S. right now (July 17th 2005) but it is poised to explode.
The US of A is now his lay ground wherein he is playing with the lives of hundreds of Innocent citizens.
Sunny continues to be amazing in action, and now he adds comedy to his list.
Where Q, after failing to save Bishop from falling to his death is told, he's got all the juice now, he just shakes his head and it shows a flashback from when Bishop was his friend, we wanna know if Q and Steel get away with robbing the liquor store!
Robert says something like "years from now when only a few of them are left we might say they're beautiful" (sorry, a 25 year old memory is not the best base for correct quoting) Christopher Petits influences of the early Wim Wenders road movies can be traced down best in " I'm Laufe der Zeit (Kings of the Road) " from 1976 - its in b/ w as well.
one of the problems i see now is that watching it now some of the effects seem cheesy, but maybe thats because technology has gotten better and I'm used to newer movies.
It is entertaining, risquÃ©, inappropriately amusing, riddled with nudity & graphic gore, filled with loud, cheesy 80's rock, has a muddled, incomprehensible plot line with maybe six brain cells in it's at times pretty head, and I've watched it twice now.
Long ago,the deities were sent to the heavens and hells.The major deity,Rudra must refresh and cleanse the world per every 4,000 years.Four races appeared,the wise Danan espers,the moist habitat-dwelling Mizushu people,the boastful reptillian Hahchu-Rui people and the tough-as-nails Kyojins.But now that humanity became the major race of the bunch,they must save others,discover the secrets,interact with each other and most importantly,encounter Rudra and it's/his creatures.The most interesting thing of this is that the characters can litteraly spell out magic spells,which are for hereby called "word essences".
"Eve, do you hate me now you know about me and Charlotte?"
He doesn't know that Eve is now living a double life -herself and that of Charlotte's dresser Doris in order to get information.
The most famous thing about "Stage Fright" is without a doubt its final plot twist; having seen the film twice now, I can say that the twist almost holds up, but there is one scene, or more accurately one line, that cheats (Todd and Dietrich meet in her dressing room, alone, and she says the word "accident").
as the camera stays on his back, now inside the home .
The infamous "lying flashback" at the beginning seems far less troublesome to today's audiences than it did when the film was released, perhaps because we're more accustomed to films playing tricks with time, now.
I think that that technique works better now than it may have in 1950.
There are just a few very minor problems in the film, most of them stemming from the trick ending: trick endings are in style right now, but they hardly ever work.
And, last but not least: A tribute to passion, to what is called "Fernweh" in German, the need to get out of where you are right now and see the whole big world, without - in my impression - forgetting the loneliness that accompanies the traveler who doesn't quite know where he belongs (yet?).
It's beautiful to care about the shape of a picture, it's even great when we make it well and the greatest stuff it's when we've got a rather solid story... now it's not the case here, the shape is soooo bad, traveling used like amateur, pretty bad effects (see it to believe), overbids of camera movements, thanks to the director for the bad use of the provided means.
I should now express my gratitude to the woman who stood guard at the box-office on that long ago Saturday night when I, a mere lad eager to see "Bullitt," was refused entry to the second-run movie house where "Petulia" was the supporting feature on the grounds that one of these films (I know not which) was considered too adult for an 11 or 12 year old who looked even younger.
The following summer I learned that "Bullitt" bit (what a dreary bore of an action film), and now I know that "Petulia" is just as bad.
As for Helena BergstrÃ¶m, she deserves a special mention because it really boggles my mind how she EVER became as famous (even by Swedish standards) as she is now.
Looking back on it now as I'm older I think the character helped him release some of the darkness in his past.
His wife now leaves him with his son.
Will Smith is a great actor, now taking serious roles.
This film is based on a true story by the life of Chris Garner who struggles with his life and is now a multi-millionaire.
Chris says, at one point in the movie, paraphrase, "I am happy right now.
I will say that Will Smith was shockingly good now that he's paid his dues with "Men in Black" and "Bad Boys."
And how are they all connected to Emily, a little girl who drowned in the creek years ago and whose ghost is now rumoured to haunt the camp?
I'm 36 years old and have been going to the cinema for well over 20 years now.
But IMDb won't allow me to type what I really thought about Almost An Angel in case it offends the readers....  And now because of the 10 line rule I'm forced to sit here and type even more about the wretched film which is causing me to despise it all the more.
Now i don't want to sound like a know-it-all, because i hate those people, but, as i said in my summary, if your going to comment on this movie, research the topic, or at least now the facts.
It's been 14 years now since these were put out and the more I watch them, the wider the gap between the two films becomes.
Hollywood's version of history is considerably at variance with the facts, and life on the frontier in the 19th century would appear to have been more dull and monotonous than exciting and colorfulÂ Certainly, life in Tombstone, Arizona, in its time of greatest prosperity as a mining town must have been anything but healthy, with its vast number of rough working men relieving their boredom with drinking and brawling, and occasionally shooting each otherÂ  In Kasdan's epic Western, Earp is the upright defender of the law, and Doc, a dissolute gamblerÂ Nevertheless, the men are compassionate and respectful, and both have a kind of dignityÂ Holliday is much more credible as the black sheep of an aristocratic Virginia family and a jaded idealistÂ Dennis Quaid allowed himself to lose 30 pounds of his weight only to accurately portray the gun-notorious Doc Holliday, now, alas devoted to the bottle and in the latter stages of tuberculosisÂ  In this instance we have Quaid breathing fire and fury at the slightest hint of an insult before breathing more heavily into his handkerchiefÂ He's a multi-dimensional human being who provides most of the film's best momentsÂ His character has his own form of abilityÂ Quaid does a far better work of portraying the effects of Holliday's tuberculosisÂ Kilmer, in "Tombstone," never seems to have anything worse than a bad flu, except when it's dramatically necessary for him to look bad in greater degreeÂ   Earp (Kevin Costner) finds Doc sincere but nevertheless strikes up an understanding which one feels will blossom into grudging joint gun-action should the need ariseÂ The need is obviously there in villainous Clantons and McLaurysÂ The path is well and truly pointed to that rendezvous at the CorralÂ  Kasdan's motion picture covers areas of Earp's life that George P. Cosmatos' film "Tombstone" does not even touchÂ While "Tombstone" was an action picture, centering on the events leading up to and including the famous gunfight, Lawrence Kasdan's "Wyatt Earp" focused on the man himself and his life from childhood to the confrontation and beyondÂThe film starts with the teenage Earp and progresses through old ageÂ   The action in Kasdan's film is firm and fresh, nicely photographed and the story well toldÂ But we always remember Ford's "My Darling Clementine" for its other qualitiesÂfor the unhurried lulls and the 'time off' taken on the wayÂ This is Ford indulging himself, as was his habit, but on this occasion the indulgences all come off and are imparted with magicÂ  "My Daring Clementine" was a film of touchesÂFonda, seated, adjusting his boots and his balance while the world, such as it is, goes by; Fonda, the peacemaker, right-and-properly in church; Fonda, with an old-world frontier concept of courtesy leading his lady in the out of doors danceÂ  Earp in Kasdan's biopic is an ordinary man who met and married a beautiful young woman who died of typhoid a short time after the marriageÂ Profoundly bitter about her death, he goes from a drunken fellow to horse thief to buffalo hunter to stagecoach driver to Dodge City, Kansas where he became one of the most famous "Westerners" of all time...
A former POW ( Ricky Giovinazzo) has troubled memories of his past back in Vietnam as now he's a family guy with a nagging wife and a weird deformed son in New York City.
He's also looking for a job to help his family as he begins to now work for a drug dealer with a gang if he can get them the money he owes them until one day he finally snaps and gets revenge even on his wife and kid.
Port Richmond ave has now populated much more, 90% by illegal immigrants.
Most of the businesses that are run down in the film are now active with furniture shops, Mexican food joints and 99 cent stores.
Combat Shock (1986) is a hard-hitting, disturbing film with some very strong scenes, it's about a young man called Frankie who fought in the war, and now hes living back in New York in a slum of an apartment, with his girlfriend and deformed baby!!!
now, back home, where he lives with his wife and his deformed son, thanks to the fact that he has been in touch with Agent Orange, he just cannot get his life back on the rails and this movie portrays one day where everything seems to get as worse as it can be.
Rock Hudson, who we all know now was gay, is the lusty, straight high school coach and guidance counselor at a high school where teenage girls turn up nude, murdered.
But, I guess I'm just an old fuddy-duddy now.
Guys don't come off much better--Hudson is sleeping around with all the teenage girls (kind of amusing now that we know he was gay) and Carson is constantly horny.
It's shocking to look back and see how strange America was during this time of "free love," as the concept of this movie would be completely taboo now.
America has a hard time with this and this film could turn a lot more heads now than perhaps it did in the more permissive 70's.
See it now.
Dolph lundgren is a badaass in this and made me remember how much i love him sure he was never as big a star as most of the action hero's of the 80's but as he proves here, he's the one who's ruling the genre now cus he plays one mean mofo here, the story has Dolph's wife and kid murdered by the Russian mafia, he moves to los angelos and seven years later he is asked to go back to Russia to bring back somebody's daughter back, he refuses to do it at first until he realises it is the same gangster that killed his family seven years ago, so he goes to get his bloody revenge, the mechanik is violent and dark but its great entertainment and delivers the goods, sure the story has been done many times before but the way it is made and its style just make the mechanik an action classic, Dolph lundgren also directed it and does a brilliant job crafting one of the best action/thriller's for the past ten years.
I liked AIR BUD and AIR BUD 2, but now the series is just getting tired.
Watch it now!
I read a review posted prior to the one thats up there now and the same thing.
And if you think the way I'm thinking right now, you should be!
II, like the first one, is no different, except for its extended running time and some minor changes (Anakin's hair is now longer and he wears an outfit similar to Darth Vader's, the first appearances of Grievous' bodyguards, clone troopers now bear their resemblance to stormtroopers, etc.).
I must say, now at an age well thrice as old as the first time, I could take a second look and found it was really as bad as I remembered it.
Similarly to my fellow citizen, I also find it rather peculiar, that out of six comments on this film, four (and from now on five) have been written by Hungarians.
Yes, several multi-player games are now ready for those eager PSP owners, like The Wedding List and Liberty City Surviver.
EDIT: Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories is now out for the Playstation 2.
It's like the writers didn't get the memo that everyone is now supposed to be equal.
I have been coming to IMDb for movie reviews for a few years now and have never commented on a movie...until now.
Perhaps this humor isn't for everyone but it never occurred to me until now that there would be so many lower ratings.
It is my unfortunate duty now to inform you that his latest, You Don't Mess With The Zohan, is by far his most wretchedly awful film to date.
For what it's worth, "You Don't Mess with the Zohan" is a good continuation of the act Sandler has put on for us for over a decade now.
Fortunately Mr. McCarthy gets to continue to perform in contemporary roles even now, particularly SLIPSTREAM (2007).
there is a lot of swearing in the film but it is in context.I have not seen Ken Wahl in anything else but will now watch out for films with him in.
I saw this movie when it came out in 1984 and I have been looking for a copy, now that I can afford the price.
Yes people Dolph Lundgren, never considered much kop in the acting department has now proved he is a more than capable director, even suggesting that his new role deserves him a shot at the big time.
He now lives in his homeland of Russia, with his wife and son working as a mechanic (hence the title.).
A copy of Umberto Lenzi's GHOSTHOUSE was lying at the bottom of my closet for almost ten years now.
The trace it to the now decrepit and dilapidated house and soon meet two brothers, their annoying sister, and one of the brother's girlfriend camping at the house.
There was something very surreal about 'Button Moon' that I loved as a child (although I could see why people now link it to a drugs' trip!)
Is the Genesis story now just going to begin again, with these two as Adam and Eve?
But let's be clear just now and sweep away some of the hyperbole, it's not the greatest sci-fi movie ever made.
I haven't gone to a theater to see a Nicolas Cage movie for a long time and now remember why.
In fact, I now laugh at what I guess I was so scared off.
It's now time to talk about the real Âstars' of this show.
A glimpse of who he could be or who he was and the contrast with who he is now is crushing.
Also there are some very cheap laughs, a scene involving a diarrhoea-afflicted cat hardly is going to spark any wit or imagination now is it?
And now it's time to call up the board.
Audience: *Applause*   Hank: OK now I'll move on to Â£25,000.
Audience: *Applause*   Hank: Right now let's move onto the tough ones.
And now a word from our sponsors!
Hopefully they'll now go join the other four.
If you have even the slightest inkling that you might want to see this then grab a bottle of White-Out and vanquish those thoughts right now.
This is a question I wondered when I first heard about the movie and now after seeing "Date Movie" I know it can't be done and shouldn't even be attempted.
Where is he now?
Or, how do they call it now... "remake", "homage".
Connor Mead (Matthew McConaughey) used to be a once sensitive, quiet guy and then has become a big jerk who is a big shot photographer now.
When movies flash back to the past it is kind of fun because it tells something about a character that you might not know or shows what got them to the point they are at now.
OK, I have never given a movie a 2, but I will now.
Prior to this he says with affection that he wouldn't miss his little brothers wedding, now he's saying mean things about the wedding to everyone?
But now that Connor is returning home for his brother's wedding, things are getting a bit weird.
But now you know from someone who physically has it, it IS available on DVD.
Grew up watching this time and time again and now have the pleasure of re-watching it on DVD.
I can look back on it now across the track of 80 years and still remember what it was like.
This is so much better than the stuff that passes for entertainment now that it's pathetic.
Just the cast was great the animatronics on the gremlins was flawless, and i love this movie now as a 16 year old.
Ah and now to one of my favorites from way back, Ben Johnson.
STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning   With everyone talking about how youth crime and violence has skyrocketed almost to the same level as the States in Britain, this action thriller from over fifteen years ago now looks like a grim prediction from back then, with Harvey Keitel's hardened detective flying over to help stem the drugs/murder problem whilst pursuing a villain he was originally after in the States who he now believes has started to prowl around Europe.
now here is a movie martial arts fans will definitely enjoy.i wish all of jeff wincott's movies were as action packed as this one is.i don't think you will be surprised to find out that the plot is nothing you haven't seen before in other b movies.but who cares about the plot in a martial arts movie.all us fans want to see is nonstop martial arts fighting and that is what you get in this movie.jeff wincott is awesome in this movie showing off some good high kicks to peoples skulls.this movie and martial law 2 are the best movies that jeff wincott has starred in that i have seen.this movie isn't as action packed as martial outlaw 2 but any martial arts movie fans will still really like this movie
Adam West's character Ty Lookwell seemed too one-not to me to every career a series (we get it he's an actor who played a detective in the past and now believes he can be a real detective, but is an idiot), and the writing by the usually capable and very funny Conan O'Brian and Robert Smigal falls flat here, I hardly cracked a smile.
So, how about now?
Would this show work now if they did it again?
I'm sure Mr. West would be willing to give it another go, and if it was on NBC, well, they need all the help they can get right now and this is the kind of show that could help them get out of their 4th place rut, if only to a small degree.
Adam West is perfectly cast as a hasbeen actor who used to star on a detective show back in the 70s who now thinks he can fight crime.
The stamp of O'Brien and Smigel, that we now are quite familiar with from over 10 years of watching them on Late Night, is all over this puppy.
Just got the game a few hours ago, and holy crap, once you get past the training level, you just don't wanna stop playing the game, its so fun, swinging around new york as spider-man and now BLACK spider-man!, and this time, New york is MUCH larger than in Spider-man 2.
Every now and then, you have a major fight, with over eight enemies on screen at once.
However, what truly makes it horrible is comparing it to the highlight of this now failing franchise, Spider-Man 2.
The special effects are great, lots of CGI of course, but even that is getting better and better, and now Spiderman jumps and action seems more real than ever!
I may not have her anymore, but I now have a digital copy of her topless that will last forever.
Not many filmmakers have the cojones now days to just tell a story in detail, without MTV cutting or ADD narrative.
It is worth it just to see Black Flag's punk rock supper star Henry Rollins in this now cult classic.
Just when you're thinking 'I know whats going to happen now ....' it doesn't.
I am now off to take a dump which I know will be more enjoyable with a better ending than Feast (a bag of W.a.n.k)
Where did they get the creatures from, the Bruce Willis movie about the future cab driver that used to be a soldier but now helps the savior of the world?
Well, reality TV has finally done something for me, now it can go away.
There are so many crap films out there right now that get distribution, especially films in the horror genre.
Unfortunately, the turmoil at the film's distributors has put "Feast" on the shelf at least for now.
Gargan was one of the few friends he had and now Fonda and Sydney are fugitives.
And now the sad part.
I saw it 8 years ago when I was 10 and now I am finally seeing it again now that I can understand that it's fake.
Okay, now I would like to make the flaws of the movie that are actually important known.
Well, I'm actually sitting here, now in 2006, actually scared more than half to death , I'm on my own, the film finished about 10 minutes ago its 1.10am, and Wow...am I scared!
It's an absurd movie but maybe you have to have seen it 20 times when you were 19 (and entertainment choices were more limited than they are now) to really appreciate it.
But after I saw it a second time (the full Black and White version), I fell in love with it and I now own it on DVD and have seen it quite a few more times.
I saw "I'm Telling You For The Last Time" before I actually got into the series itself (I was young when it first aired and so now I am feasting off reruns).
The fact that I had not seen nearly every Seinfeld episode (which now I have see most of) made this bit of stand up even funnier as I had never heard most jokes before.
I haven't read the book yet, but am going to now that I know there is one.
For the past 10 years, Sirius 6B has been shaped by the face of nuclear war and now it will be shaped by a another, more smarter, and aggressive entity called a Screamer.
Don't miss this beautifully photographed, funny film, now available in video with English subtitles.
Wonder what the next season will hold now that Kate is gone.
Smacking Tony on the head is kinda getting boring , but, it seems to be more of an affectionate smack now.
BTW, IMO a romance with DiNozzo would not be a good idea right now.
I do hope there are more seasons of this programme to come because now I am really hooked and it has become another of my favourite shows on TV.
Agent Timothy Mcgee is the latest addition to the show, he started as computer whizz and now has been promoted to a field agent and his scenes with Abby are great.
Well the above was written after watching the first 2 series of NCIS, so now I thought I would comment on what I think of the show in series 3 and 4.
First there is the introduction of Ziva David the Mossad agent who is now working with NCIS.
The discord at home is matched by the incipient calamity ongoing at a Project Leo designed early in his career, a Project now physically crumbling under the weight of drug dealing, crime, and discontent tenants - all led by activist Tonya Neeley (the superb actress Viola Davis) who has one daughter at home with an early conceived baby and another daughter who has stepped out of the Projects to better her education (her twin brother committed suicide in despair of his plight in the Projects).
And now lets talk about unibrow girl... shave it!
I was put off by the over the top juvenile humor in Army of Darkness, but I now realize it was just an extension of what Sam Raimi was perfecting here.
It's a fine idea, and it works great, too, because the outcomes of the situations are different, as well... meaning, you see a scene and go "Oh, right, I remember this from the first... oh yeah, now he... what the ...!?"
I do understand why so many people love it, but I admitted then - and now - that this type of material is just not my cinematic cup of tea.
they weren't up to the block-buster digital computerized seamless stuff we see now, but for me this only added to its' charm.
i think his track record now speaks for itself.
ASH encounters some unexpected guests and now everyone must fight for the lives, or become the evil that hunts them.
No wonder Sam Raimi is now directing the Spiderman series.
If you never ever watched this film, I order you to turn off your computer right now.
And, like the first, it quickly acquired a following and is now considered a great movie!
But then now I know it is the actors behind - Aamir is a perfectionist - Lagaan has to be pseudo directed.
So now a movie with an attractive star-cast with great music is being thrust down our throats with history lessons embedded.
I did not have much of a choice when my brother-in-law bought a CD of this movie home & my wife insisted that we should view it as a family...I have been hearing rave reviews till now & so was just a little bit intrigued...however after sitting through the entire movie, I am wondering what the hype was all about...without doubt, this is an above-average film and has been made with a lot of care & effort....however does it deserve all the accolades heaped on it...can I, for once, cry out "The Emperor has no clothes"?
She has worn brown contact lenses for the role, which shows that Indian film-makers are now thinking of certain details that need to be thought about.
India certainly has a rich history of quasi-historical legends: Anarkali, Heer-Ranjha, Umrao Jaan, Devdas, and now Jodhaa-Akbar.
"Jodhaa Akbar" is not her best work, but it offers ample evidence of her growth along the spectrum of Paro-type roles she has enacted since Bhansalli's "Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam" : Nandini of "HDDCS," Paro of "Devdas," the eponymous Umrao Jaan, and now Jodhaa are essentially different interpretations of the same feminine archetype: a Lady Beloved of the Legends, who, having been robbed of all agency because of her gender, comes to embody beauty, suffering, fidelity, and, of course, love.
So now you know where you need to search.
I was accustomed to the opened, relaxed expanse of the country, and now, I was in the heart of London at the height of the Victorian Era.
"I should've mastered the damn thing by now," he cries.
As a result of this film and this film alone the viewer can follow the lack of investigation and now demand that any and all Kennedy related material be opened NOW.
While they can be funny at times, Conan's jokes and routines (with the possible exception of in the year 2000, which I believe has now been renamed in the year 3000) aren't as funny or as clever.
Conan now has the record as the shortest tenure as Tonight host due to the nonsense of self-destruction going on at NBC.
This movie plays on your mind and less of the whole sound loud music now and show a jumpy scene.
i still don't understand the story now about if Charlie was part of the dad or a thing that went into different people , cos what was with the pervy next door neighbour ???
still confused now and I've watched it lots of times.
Okey, now to the second hour...Why?
In continuing my reviews of African-Americans in film in chronological order for Black History Month, we're now at 1972 with the biographical depiction of Billie Holliday as portrayed by Diana Ross called Lady Sings the Blues.
Even at this young age, I was impressed to see a film on this grand scale that elevated a historical Black icon like Billie Holliday; this was unprecedented and this was not lost on me then or now.
If you want to get a more realistic view of Miss Holliday's life read "Wishing on the Moon" by Donald Clarke.Her early recordings are available (now out of copyright) on a multitude of labels,generally the only difference being the packaging.Listen to the freshness and innocence of "I wished on the moon" and forget that this terrible film was ever made.
First and foremost is the elegant sophistication of Anne Harding, a star in the early years of film but somewhat forgotten now.
In the meantime, Joan's business-like attitude towards the marriage has been ruined by the fact that she now loves John and only has six months to get him to feel the same way without trying so hard that John can see that she is trying to get him to love her.
We shall see later, but for now, Ms. Harding just scored a 'bull's eye"!!!!
She has been dating William Powell, a well-known playboy type, but one who actually has a business - a potentially important shipping line that Powell has allowed to be run by others, and is now somewhat shabby.
So now the marriage can go through.
Apparently this and two other films shown that night were held out of public release due to litigation concerning royalties and now the powers that be at Turner Classic Movies have taken care of the licensing issues.
With his talents now attending to business and not bedroom conquests, Powell starts to enjoy his newfound success and begins to fall in love with his bride.
In the meantime Harding's jealous sister, now unhappily married, has been living beyond her means and needs money fast.
This film was shown here in London during the Foreign film exhibition together with other remarkable Filipino films like Imelda, American Adobo...etc....the venue was a bit small( Riverside Cinema)thou the number of Filipinos base in London is quite large now but still of many reasons, Non Filipino viewers are more than our "Kababayans", i cant say that Filipinos are not movie goers cos it's not true.
Maybe because most of them here are westernised now, so they prefer to watch English spoken films.....well thats a sign that they are so easy to adapt(positive outlook in life).
This is what the dying entertainment industry needs right now.
Acting - What do you get when you put Lorna Tolentino, Albert Martinez, Gloria Romero, Celia Rodriguez, Mark Gil and (now) Jiro Manio in one great movie?
Some are quite bad but every now and then a good one comes along.
She must be 111 by now--- she was already a big Hollywood star back in 1941, after all.
It was also nice to see Angela Lansbury, now much older, in a cameo as Firth's domineering Aunt, but with an important role in the story.
It really was a lot of fun and quite the breath of fresh air for children's movies since the slump between The Incredibles and now.
FYI Â There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past Truly Moving Picture Award winners that are now either at the theater or available on video.
I have sky-dived, and I have loved and lost, And I have love now.
And now the big question is: how did Frankenheimer convince Kerr - of all actresses - to bare her bosom in 1969?...
I now recall that I tuned into ER to watch this episode because of previews including clips of Liotta.
Although I understand she now lives in Switzerland, I have often thought that even though I am in my 50's and gave up the thought of acting professionally years ago, it would be great if she still lived in Hollywood and I was able contact her.
At 85 years old, I wouldn't be surprised if she said, "Give me a couple of minutes and we'll go over right now."
Gino, as an ex con, is forced by French law to take residence anywhere but in a city and so he settles with his young wife in the country, where fate turns against him, as first his wife is killed, then he is hounded by his former crime gang to return to his former lifestyle and also one of the arresting officers from his case years previously, the now chief inspector Goitreau is in charge of the area and has a grudge against him and becomes even more suspicious when he finds out Gino's new girlfriend Lucie is working in the local bank With the help of his now good friend Cazeuenve and his new girlfriend Lucie (Mimsy Farmer) he tries to battle his demons and fight against the troublesome cop.
A handsome intense actor who is right now very happening.
They keep trying to justify the fact they are now "travellers" as they get an all expenses paid TV series around the world, and clearly had never stepped outside of their state back in America.
It is great to see many of these places that I may one day visit but now, I have to make up for the ignorance and feigned appreciation of the Americans who ventured there first?
It's a fitting gesture, this burial, since the violin, once symbolizing the music of the tyrannized, now epitomizes the music of collusion.
Although the film was completed in 2005, it is just now getting something resembling distribution.
This episode is now in my cache for use in class, to illustrate just how perfect a portrayal of an imperfect character can be.
"Dakota" is now trying to unravel the mystery of her identity, how she and Aubrey co-exist, and the person/people who abducted her.
My advice, don't listen to all the nonsense out there right now because people are negative on Lindsay due to her bad press.
This was so horrid...  Let me try it this way....  "You can't quit playing piano now, the BIG COMPETITION is coming up"  "But I don't want to play piano like Mozart anymore, even though I am amazingly talented on it, and my writing skills are just above a 5th grader, I know I am destined to be a writer!"
"Oh yeah"  "I think I will spare everyone, including myself, and just kill myself now instead of becoming a disgruntled piano teacher.
So if your decision rests on one of those things, now you know.
It's an obscure film, shot in 2004, only released in the movie theaters now.
The girl is now 21, beautiful, and she says: "I feel resentment because I was not raised by my mother.
She now is asserting herself, showing confidence and at the same time saying she is willing to accept him for the way he is by "dressing up" for a day.
I've seen this movie probably over 200 times by now.
I used to watch it every week when I was at school and even now it's as much fun as it always was.
Although I recently saw Bye Bye Birdie (made in the early 60s) and now can see where Grease got a lot of it's "style" from.
They have made those ridiculous High School Musicals now and that annoys me because they are trying to match up to Grease, but Zac Efron and his Stupid "Crew" will never be able to beat Grease.
Considering Sandy has been celibate through all of the movie till now, I think it's implied Danny will get a nice surprise that night; a message to give to young girls, ha ha.
This is one of a number of movies I saw back when they were first released, misguidedly enjoyed at the time, and now find I have major issues with.
So by now you might be saying, How can you say at that this movie is great and then trash its plot and moral?
Looking at this movie now in my 20's I can appreciate what a fun-loving view of life this provides.
It's funny because I liked "Saturday Night Fever" better when I was younger but now I don't care for that movie and the exact opposite happened with this one...go figure.
Such songs include Summer Nights, Beauty School Dropout and the now famous song Greased Lightining.
Perhaps a few of the performances were a little "stiff" or "wooden," but I think that speaks more to the direction of the film, and the fact that people back in those days WERE more stiff and wooden (read: "proper") than they are now.
Although her skating style may look a bit old fashioned to us now she is still a strong personality on the ice and also as an actress in the frame story.
I was going to give this movie an 8 due to it being a good movie of it's kind but now that I've just seen the whole story it's a sure 10.
Art of the Devil 2 is not a sequel, in that it has no relation to the first (which I am now intrigued to watch as it stars Chai-Lai Angel Supaksorn Chaimongkol), although they deal with the same supernatural forces in Thai lore.
This movie comes at a good time in our lives now to revive our sense of patriotism.
Having had a recording of the film for some time, I now opted to check it out as part of my brief tribute to the popular matinÃ©e idol on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of his untimely demise.
I don't know... but it might very well now be my favorite of the genre.
Creative, silly, constantly surprising, if better known it would be a major cult movie perhaps it will be one now that it is getting a DVD release.
It would also deal the new reformed Braniac 5.1 who is now organic and how he would be convinced to rejoin the legion again.
Dr.Ann Kendall (Terri Hawkes) is the last one of Wincott's list but he finds himself falling for his prey and when the time comes for the kill, Quinn ends up protecting Kendall from the assassins now gunning for them both in this intense thriller.
In this battle horsemen, steel, and an ideology of duplicity won the day over a naive other world whose innocence is now virtually unimaginable.
The story deals with the conquest of the Inca empire (now PerÃ¹) by the Spaniards leaded by Franncisco Pizarro back in the sixteenth century.
Todays kids would not even now who He Man and She Ra.
I thought back to March of 1985, did the math and realized I am the same age now as my mom was then.
It's doubtless that many of those kids Â now parents themselves Â will sit their children in front of the TV and play the DVD, and it will enrapture parent and child alike.
Adults who first marveled at "The Secret of the Sword" as kids can now enjoy it on multiple levels.
Today's breed of programme makers, although largely familiar with the era to which I am referring, have rejected this format, and now have an addiction to making everything look like it was shot on film.
I felt a strange elation when Arthur drew the sword, one of the most meaningful and defining moments in literary, and now movie, history.
My older DVD copy looks fine but sounds a bit tinny, so it's with some annoyance I see there's a special edition out now, which presumably has had the full restoration work done on it.
It certainly seemed to start many careers on the right path and many of the actors are very well known now.
I own it on video and watch it now and again, and I hope that if Boorman ever makes Knight's Castle that he brings back Nicol Williamson as Merlin, because he's just too good in that role (despite the fact he must be really getting on by now).
I remember how suddenly I found myself immersed in this world when I first saw the film, and even now the hairs stand up on the back of my neck thinking about it.
Well, I finished it just now and I have to say, the ending wasn't all that great.
I might be a little confused right now.
I couldn't move from the DVD the entire movie, i was so sucked into the story and wanted to get it but i realize now that i didn't so now there is a hundred thoughts in my head.
But don't get me wrong now!
Frankly, Marisa Tomei is now and has been for a long time, one of the truly luminous beauties in modern films.
If a meteorite or a comet comes by and burns every copy of "Danika" known, into dust, including the master and the daily rushes ... nobody will complain much, not now and surely not in a hundred years from now.
Are we in the present or the past or the future now?
The short version for those who haven't seen the movie is there is no 'twist' in the now common cinematic style there is only the version inside Danika's head and the revelation of the reality.
The bomb is about to go off any day now outside and inside the home of Rose.
It just happens to be now, and in Israel.
Surprisingly enough, gay men and women have been allowed to serve in the Israeli army for over 2 decades now (for very pragmatic reasons, I'm sure).
What will he do now?
What does he do now?
The story is about a couple trying to make it in the film industry and failing at it, so now they have to decide if they are gonna try to keep working on movies or if they are going to begin their real life with their child.
But apparently, it didn't matter to her: she dabbled in acting now and again, when the part amused her, but she had better things to do with her life.
She's bitterly resentful of the price the "talkies" have taken on her career, so now she soaks in her own misguided and imagined greatness, in profile with the flickering projector lighting her outline in the dark.
In SUNSET BLVD, everything just clicks, complete with all the now classic taglines; "It's not me that got small, it's the pictures that got smaller."
"I'm ready for my close-up now, Mr.
Soon, he's ordered into the house by a female voice that turns out to belong to legendary silent screen star Norma Desmond who retreated from the outside world, now living a lonely and isolated existence with her aging servant (Erich von Stroheim).
Almost every sentence, remark, Swanson's antiques and postures have become part of our cinematic heritage now, we sometimes forget how delightfully crisp and clever the dialog was at the time, and still is.
Erich von Stroheim, now degraded to being Desmond's butler, was largely an outcast by then, just as the totally forgotten Buster Keaton who's allowed to play card games at Desmond's mansion once in a while.
Needless to say, he made a whole string of films now considered classics, but this is the pinnacle of his career and head and shoulders above any other self-reflective turn Hollywood embarked on in all the years to follow.
But it turned out great and is now rightfully considered a classic.
The other scene-stealer is Erich von Stroheim, who plays Swanson's fromer husband and director, and now her butler.
I will now look for more movies by her.
What's interesting is that now, so many years later, we're looking back at her looking back.
Even now, recalling the mobsters 'flying' through the air when being shot in the beginning brings a smile to my lips.
Do you understand the anachronistic criticisms now ?
Where'd this film come from and how come it took me til now to see it???
The 6 man tag match well I dont want to talk about that cause all I have got to say is swear words and im not allowed to do that.........why does HHH always use that sledgehammer stop it now you make me sick.
So, why is this movie virtually unheard of now?
I have come to believe that many of these great movies are slowly being forgotten on some conscious level; we the viewing public does not want to remember the best, as it will make us realize the amount of dreck that is now released, and make us maudlin and mournful.
It cares about the last short period of Scottish poet Gowan Mc Land`s life.He had a dismissal from a professorship of poetry and now unfortunately is condemned to earn money with celebrating his artwork in clubs of interested housewives, New England.The housewives, which are shown there, don`t have real ambitions with artistry or poetry;they hope it could be entertaining to watch a person, whose only purpose is to make weird things like poems.This becomes very clear at the end of one of Gowan`s public readings;no one in the audience becomes aware when the performance is over, except the artist himself;he has to give his "fans" permission to applause.
She will have to delude herself:what she discovers is ruined lives,regrets,embittered characters,human wrecks.Time is a hard Master and it leaves no one unharmed.As always in Duvivier's work,the harder they fall,the better the sketches are.For it is basically a movie made up of sketches,Julien Duvivier's mÃ©tier.All youth ideals have gone down the drain:the brilliant medicine student has become an abortionist;the lawyer with bright prospects now has a lousy shady cabaret;one of the woman's beaus is dead and his mother gone nuts acts as if he's still alive.Two of them have escaped to a doomed fate:but one has become a priest and the other keeps his love for something else than women .
Right now I'm trying to get rid of the one about Frodo's Nine Fingers.
And this they did, as we know by now, with a vengeance.
And then, as the world knows by now, came a man named Peter Jackson.
Erotism has been a prime element in Mexican movies for so many years... but now we can thank G-d the days of cabaret, double-sense talk, erroneous poverty portrayals and sex with no obstacles are past.
Well, now here, in the films' main characters, we find a clear winner.
The lines were difficult at best and almost unplayable as the actors (I'll give them credit for now) demonstrated with efficiency.
The story, although dated now, was great.
Yes, the 20/80 split when the pan cake business went incorporated might seem unfair now, but it was better than the 1950's film where Annie just waits on Ms. Lora, dolling out wisdom with a spoon full of sugar.
I knew of this sequence before watching the film, and I was afraid that Woody might not have been able to carry it off, but now I really don't know what I was worried about; Woody is, like in the first sequence, at his best in the scene.
Oh come on now, you know that can't happen, but why not have a killer boob running the country or men fighting over sheep.
In its beautifully restored version, this stunning television showcase, originally broadcast on May 31, 1972, is now available for a new generation of viewers.
And now, you've slipped down the ladder, Stephen.
As he ranted on in these pointless monologues, a flicker of a true actor popped up every now and then (granted, probably on accident.)
And Ill tell you right now, this movie didn't disappoint me; a small piece of my soul died while watching Dead Above Ground.
The fawns are now rambunctious and argumentative, at points even fighting with each other.
I had my mum but was without a father so I could relate... And now I am a step-mom for two children who have lost their mom, so I can now relate in otherwise as well.....
Maybe the animation is computerized now and maybe the DTV Sequels are not going to hold a candle to the original art from the hearts of incredibly talented artists under Walts guidance, But Bambi II is much better than many of Disney's other Classic sequel attempts to make money on nostalgic baby boomers.
Bambi's father takes care of him now, after the death of Bambi's mother.
And now, Bambi 2 filled that hole.
That was one of the most wonderful things about the first movie ...even more than sixty years after it's release, the songs were so well written that they sound just as good now as they did then.
(20th Century Fox, I feel VERY sorry for you that you're now stuck with the unfortunate honor of owning "Newhart," as well as his previous "comedy."
He's getting a little long in the tooth now, but I still chuckle whenever I see him on his occasional visits to one of the late night T.V.
I'll relate the film to mine: While it's true that Southeast Asian film is just now dealing with the issue of homosexuality; and while it's true that Thai cinema is just emerging and probably needs encouragement - this film is a discombobulated mess.
The lovers are now the hunter and the hunted.
Ruben Carter was never, by viewing his actions in the 60's and even now, when he refuses to speak to his son, a person that people can look up to.
If you've gotten to this comment, then you've read multiple times by now how the main character is "bullet proof" maybe "flame retardant" or even invincible.
"The Marine" follows John Triton (Cena) who has been recently discharged for disobeying direct orders and he now has a lousy security job (but at the end, the problem of having a job he hates isn't even resolved, but what do we care?).
So now I'm here now for the rest of you.
Now it's slapstick silliness, now it's brutal gravity, now it's just dull.
The stereotyped characters that I had enjoyed any years ago only annoy now, and Josie's lines when she returned to the show during the big 'shout' made a roomful of viewers laugh with embarrassment.
BUT: There IS one saving scene that makes it memorable: The confrontation between Barris & Kirk, where Barris tells him "I don't think you take this mission seriously", and Kirk responds with "The mission I take seriously, it's YOU I take lightly, now get out of my way, or I'll have you locked up!"
After the risible teen-horrors "Sidste Time", "MÃ¸rkeleg" and now this, the time seems ripe for director/horror buff Martin Schmidt to try his hand out at other genres.
It's too bad that someone took such a good name for a movie...I mean the title alone gives anyone an idea or three about what this movie could have been...(almost famous, requiem for a dream...just to name two extremes...and extremely good, creative movies with similar resources)...It's like when a band takes a great name and shoulda' just named themselves 'another lame-ass band'... Well, the same thing holds true here...a great writer could have taken the same concept (forget the name) and driven this movie into a completely original direction with some real drama, real comedy and real emo-tion...instead, we get what we get...plus now this great title is attached to this run of the mill, halfass storyline with so-so performances...
A shame, really, because the premise is solid enoughÂhulking maniac Jeremiah has spent thirty three years hiding under the floor of his cabin after witnessing the rape and murder of his mother by rednecks, and now kills anyone else who should stumble across his homeÂand although not great actors by any stretch of the imagination, the cast are likable enough.
Technically impressing in the 1970's, but still a charming and excellent movie now in 2002.
Ronnie, the counselor from the original, now owns his own camp.
I just watched it 5 minutes ago, and now I want to put a gun in my mouth, to end the fail that is replaying over and over in my head!
(Come on now, this can't be Barry Levinson!
I am now 29 and still do.
Not now anyway.
Well, thats it for now.
What originally began as a film about some soulful and youthful teens trying to get to the ultimate dance party has now transformed into this clichÃ© morality tale that demonstrates the power of friendship and the strength of humility.
House Party 3, don't fail me now!
I have never heard of any of the actors, I now know why.
The 2006 movie (which this review will exclusively refer to from now on) raised doubts on whether DeSalvo was the Boston Strangler.
This was just a temporary relationship, now that it's over, we can move on.
Putting red wine in the fridge - now what movie was that from?
To balance my obvious admiration for this piece of work, I will now look on the flip side of this shining coin.
I can just imagine the "behind the scenes" dialogue while making this picture: "this is going to be such a cute movie, the story is so cute, the dialogue is so cute, the actors are so cute, the acting is so cute, no the acting is so dynamic, it's going to be such a hit with the audience: being so piquant and lovely, and yet so comical........" I don't know too much about the Back Street Boys, except that they're famous, now I realize they must have made some money and thought they were going to make a classic film, they were wrong, money doesn't always translate into good taste.
The girl's easy on the eyes, though, but apparently she now relies on her Backstreet Boy husband for life support now.
Who can he count on now that he's getting old?
And now for the biggest disapointment...
A former circus entertainer who was spared the gas chamber and is now stuck in a mental institution specifically for holocaust survivors?
Why not the story of a former Jewish mechanic who escaped the forced labor of evil Nazi kitchens where he peeled carrots for 21 hours a day, and who now makes cat food for a living in Guadalajara while moonlighting as a house painter?
The man had been forced to act like a dog to survive the Holocaust and is now haunted by his "dog" past.
This excellent movie is now available in crisp colors and with restored sound.
Anybody can make a film now and anybody can write favorable comments.
I loved this movie as a five-year-old child in 1977 but now it is impossible to find anywhere.
I realize that I was asking for it just by watching a movie with a title like "The Rise of Taj" that wasn't the name of a documentary about a palace in India, but now that I'm through the hellish experience I feel obligated to warn as many as possible about the mental anguish you will go through if you see this craptastic movie.
I've seen the film three times now, studying their moves and I don't think they're as good as Hulk Hogan says.
-3 new actors playing the boys, if u can even consider them actors -rocky is "too cool" to be a ninja -colt has a lisp and a pony tail -tum-tum looks like he retrograded back in time and is now 5  -when tum-tum screams hi-ya it sounds like a little girl  -hulk holgan is in this movie -terriorts take over AN AMUSMANT PARK!
I have luckily escaped seeing any of the Rugrats movies, and have watched the series now and then with my kids.
Go kill yourself now.
Only worth watching as a curiosity now I'm afraid.
You DON'T have to be Norwegian to understand subtleties of this movie (maybe you just need to be a kid, even though grown up :)  This piece was superbly translated into Russian and I remember some of them till now.
Not content with ruining Battlestar Galactica last year, they now present us with this most dire of literary conversions - The Legend of Earthsea.
A series that had non-whites as its protagonists was a rare thing in the sixties and seventies--whites don't need to appropriate this one now.
Ged's solitary search for understanding is replaced by a buddy flick, with Vetch now providing comic relief.
I was so excited to hear the books were being adapted into a mini-series, particularly now with the CGI possibilities out there.
The Nanny ... now that was a film ...  WHO MAKES THIS STUFF EH?
This one is one of his best and I am delighted to have now bought it on VHS so that I can watch it many times, which I plan on doing.
Feeling shunned by the entire monastery, Nacho (Black), now the monastery's cook, decides to follow his dreams to become a professional wrestler.

One more thing, why wait until now to condition Kate?

now i wasn't able to sit through the entire thing, but I'm going to guess that this movie totally avoided the fact that the vast majority of American skinheads are traditional, in the sense that they are not politically affiliated, are non racist, and are actually respectable members of the community.
It's just that this guy finds The Torah and decides the only decent thing left to do now is to act out on the wisdom of his Hebrew-school-inner-child that had somehow never been successfully challenged.

His reluctance to end up looking foolish again would be outweighed by a sense of duty (nay, 'civic' duty) to Gabe, whom he is now motivated to protect since he put him through such an ordeal to begin with.

Intertwined with her night terrors are flashbacks of her youngest daughter, who is now deceased, being struck by a car (we learn this information through dropped ice cream cones and screeching tires).
Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of people that loved this movie... however, now that I think about it, they all had the IQ of a tadpole...
I now want a remake, however controversial it may be, whatever ratings it may get.
That's a thought to be going on with now.
Not my favourite genre of film, "horror", but I recommend this one for a laugh, and to play the parlour game of "now what movie did I see THAT in?..."
Had the Geena Davis character left her abusive husband, forged out a new independent life for herself and found happiness, now that would have been inspirational.

All the best films now tend not to be so mawkish, making The Living and The Dead seem like a bad student project from the 1970s.

She is now going to have an implant in the other ear.
- I sound like a Sword & Sorcery movie narrator now!)
The worst thing about it is now i own it!
Something else now: Is Arriaga making a political statement by showing virtually all of the white Americans as defectives in one way or another while all the Latino's are benign, generous and overall, good guys?
Probably not gonna happen, now that Colbert is such a big star that he's coining words that dictionaries take seriously.

It looks like someone filmed it with a mobile phone and every now and then you see shadows of the crew.
After viewing the film I now understand while he has gone on to only direct one other movie, he's not very good.
But now that I finally got my hands on a DVD of said film and ultimately got to see TUNNEL RATS (I missed the flick's short theatrical run here in Germany), I can say with a clear conscience that all those badmouths were once again a bit too fast with their criticism and concerns, cause apparently TUNNEL RATS turned out to be a pretty neat and well-done war movie, whose intensity and brutality will not leave you cold.
So now we know she was really the killer.
Okay, now before everyone gets on my ass, this is the best film Uwe Boll has written and directed.
(life must've been great bad in those times)  5 - Our friendly heroes (now 2) get in another stint with authorities when they try to pay for their beverages with US dollars.
(No one seems to object her joining the group, guess they got tired of the sausage fest)  6 - The good guys (now 3) encounter a fourth acolyte (also a kungfu master) who's kinda mean to them at first, but now he's nice.
The happy gang (now 4) is making astonishing progress!
America's new sweetheart, Reese Witherspoon -- night now, Sandy B.
This movie is so low budget the only way you can get it right now is to order a copy from the director.
And now they're loose.
I have a friend who is trying to stake his claim in Hollywood right now, but I'm OH so GLAD that he hasn't sold his soul to appear in utter crap like this.
So now you see how it delves into family genre.
Foul language throws a monkey wrench into this because now the script tries to be realistic and 'non-fluffy'.
Overall a decent docudrama which has probably been elevated to cult status by now, as Pamela Smart in real life is now petitioning for yet another appeal.
In the post-modern world we live in now, there is a glut of cinema verite in our televisual entertainment, what with the plethora of reality TV shows and so on.
Any minute now.

Apparently she is now married to a corrections officer, operating a Fresno spa facility.
Actors(or lack thereof): Only the finest for this film... the finest extras ever to grace a screen, now starring in their speaking role debut!
I hated the kissing scenes, and Preity Zinta use to be my favourite actress but not now, after watching this movie!!
I'm now used to the new Miss Marple.
Though the stories now wander from the original plots somewhat, they make for entertaining viewing in their own right.
And now that we are being skeptical anyway: undead girls don't just appear naked on tables in the catacombs of an abandoned asylum without reason, and they certainly don't remain lying there for weeks at the disposal of oversexed nerds!
I am an IMDb regular but have only just joined now.
Liotta showing remorse, trying to befriend and help the man he shot and crippled, beginning to live a normal life, only to have the angry brother whose life was ruined bent on revenge.... now that could have been a good movie.
As movie fans watch this horrible movie, they anticipate that the movie will end "please now and thank you".
The trapped, by now stupefied, movie watcher finds him or herself looking for a road map in the darkness of the theater.
Judging from what we now see on the screen, he was wise to do so.
It can barely manage now.
Unbeknowst to them, a Catholic priest was murdered in a confession booth that is now stored in the basement, and the man who killed him hung himself because of guilt.
Which this house is supposed to be haunted and now the ground are experiencing strange things in the house.
Do you hate him now?
Plus anything I say isn't really going to make much difference because the film's been showing for well over a month now and by the looks of it is still really continuing to rake it in.
Pegg's cringing everyman is getting quite tired now.
The film tells of how Dennis (Simon Pegg) runs away from his fiancÃ© Libby (Thandie Newton) and his unborn child only to have a sense of resolve five years later (now that he's grown up).

First, there is some little prologue about vampire curses and the Frankenstein family becoming were-wolves--now they are the 'Wolfsteins'!

By now most of you are probably used to the terrible errors/weirdness-es in movies that has computers hackers etc.
Anyway, I wanted to see this film (at home only of course) but now (just after) I am absolutely disappointed!
So now, for the first time, my Snipes-Method of film recommendation has failed.
As expected by now, the 'new' McEwen version indulges in a great deal more tinkering.
This time the really interesting characters have either been thrown out altogether (Miss Temple, the Professor, the two lady bodyguards) or radically altered (tragically the 3 sisters - now two nuns).
I will admit I had been looking forward to checking out this film for a while now.
A consummate family man, Shah does all he can to lighten the mood of his friend and just speaks about random things going on around them, flirting with the women going in and out of their paths and finally confronting Saxena to get the point across that "life is too short, if anything we should all know that now."
If the idea was that these were "typical stories", for a guy who grew up in Texas, lived many years in California and now lives overseas, the movie, it just reinforced how shallow and foolish movie makers in NY are and how badly they view their own fellow citizens.
The "sisters" who are pivotal to the plot, are now nuns.....real sisters in the Catholic Church sense.
They now make Miss Marple's nephew into a comical, silly, womanizer.
But I don't suggest adding one now, as it would be unrealistic.
Every now and then a show comes along that redefines your relationship with the whole genre.
It's as if the writer just said: "We have a premise and a story, now lets put in some half written songs, a child, animation, fat people, animals, and pretty colors and we made a child's godfather worthy masterpiece.
James goes outside and is confronted by a mysterious old man who gives James back his bag, however, it now contains magical crocodile tongues.
The writers are probably working for CSI series now!
I suppose the director deserves some credit from audience members like myself who have never taken hallucinogenics but have wondered what a bad acid trip feels like and watching this movie now Iknow .
I do not know what the writer's were thinking (and speaking as a published author, I don't think I WANT to) and one would assume that Dennis Hopper, having now attained a modicum of respectability will never lay claim to this piece again.
Anyway, now that that rant is over, Average Joe was an entertaining enough show, but it just proved that all the stereotyping dating philosophies apparently still hold true.
the one hero of this whole series was of course Adam Mesh, who is thankfully now happily married.
i don't really now what else to say but i found the movie one i would of liked if it was more like ET.
What surprises me is in the wake of people being forced to face the reality of how factually inaccurate and intentionally misleading Loose Change and it's editions really were, these same people are now championing this similar video without skipping a beat.
I get involved in a good project now and then to keep things going.
They were once a hot commodity, but now they've been relegated to menial jobs and Ruby is now banging random guys in her van (as we see at the beginning of the film).
If this is the best Silhouette Entertainment can come up with, they might as well close up the studio right now.
That & the serial I'm in the middle of now, "Captain  Marvel," are far superior to Dick Tracy.
I admit I'll watch one now and then just to see how far the story will wander off into the surreal.
now it did give me a few laughs, but this was a complete disgrace to the film genre and should not have gotten almost six stars.
The casting was alright but that girl when she was young lol now that was funny.
To see how emotions are handled subtly.. now THAT was a treat.
Evolved is so bad that I finally stopped it as the evening wore on because I wanted time for an antidote, something ELSE to watch before bedtime so I wouldn't think my entire day had first been wasted by work and now THIS.
I only watched this one because I have owned it for so long now when I quit watching the second series of Afterdark films.
This is the kind of movie where time and again you find yourself asking "now where have I seen that before?"
And I was like, wow, maybe stuff will happen now.
It goes without saying now (but of course I will say) that I and many others don't merely enjoy, "love", are engrossed by, adore, are awestruck and stunned by, etc.
Other invectives and exclamations similarly invoked the deity, or were inspired by classical literature, the Bible, and popular song, and are now incomprehensible to us.
She holds a *slight* grudge against her family because she's convinced that her sister stole the one true love of her life and now she developed the fiendish plan to use Greta's killing capacities to get revenge.
Hester gives the dog to her niece, and pretends that she cares about her niece and nephew now that her sister has passed on.
Maybe this is because the technology that was our imaginations has become a reality today and there is now no need for these dated action shows.
The imaginations of today are now enthralled by what could be the technology of tomorrow.
Have we had now had enough of the likes of Michael Knight a man whose stylish leather jackets and sun tan of the early 1980's would now be the object of scorn and pity.
As a result of the collision, Gipson arrives late for the hearing only to find that the judge, impatient with waiting for him, has awarded custody to his ex-wife, meaning that she is now free to take them to Oregon where she intends to live.
Ten years ago,maybe, but now ?
more than 10 years ago i laughed my butts off at naked gun, but now this film couldn't cope a bit with it and it's not at all original.
I couldn't have been more wrong and now I'm 100% sure of that the people giving this piece of garbage high votes are friends and family of the filmmakers.
In my opinion this movie is more of a well... documentary or saga about what Regan goes through after the whole ordeal with the demon we now know was Pazuzu.
And temporary office placement companies are now the largest employers in the country.
EDIT: I have to say that with the addition of the two prequels, this installment makes MUCH more sense now.
It does now have a place in the run and should be viewed by franchise fans as a more necessary chapter of the Exorcist story.
I'd give it a 6.4/10, now.
And with their material becoming progressively more poppy, more formulaic, not to mention more predictable, one sees the point at which they should have given up the ghost was now at least thirteen years in the past.
It is now too late for that.
It is now just as easy for bands signed to labels that do not have million-dollar warchests to saturate the listener with to reach a new audience.
The party with the most responsibility for the fact that the party is now over stares them in the face every day when they look in a mirror.
I knew almost nothing about the Pixies before watching loudQUIETloud, and now having seen it, I still feel as though I know nothing about them.
After watching the movie, I now realize that he might have been understating how bad it is.
Nothing to say more, only typing now to complete my 10 lines quota.
As in most of Ellis' work, the protagonists are a bunch of shallow, pretty rich kids (Jon Foster, Lou Taylor Pucci, Amber Heard, among others) and their just as shallow elderly peers/parents (Kim Basinger, who played Foster's lover in "The Door in the Floor", now plays his mother, who's depressed because of her husband's Â Billy Bob Thornton Â affair with the confused newswoman terribly played by Winona Ryder; less serious is Chris Isaak as Pucci's womanizing father, who seemed to have fun playing his character), in 1983 Los Angeles.
And thank god there's no laugh track, but Christ, I have to voice a counter opinion to all this wanton praise since I've sat through repeated viewings of it now (with the aforementioned friend and his flatmate) and I honestly hate it.
so then this horrible doctor who operated on the original horrible girlfriend decides the thing to do is to have our now thoroughly destroyed leading man who is so adorable and hot and long suffering undergo the knife as well, so they can be even... and .
Instead we have a now very dated formula of a small time hustler hanging around a group of kids with oversized afros and egos.
And that's about all she wrote with this dull-as-dishwater waste of time, which would be totally forgotten by now if not for a misleading title change linking it to the notoriously awful camp classic TROLL 2.
I have to move on now, I'm far too upset.
They're now extremely long and carnivorous.
The myth that this was actually a worthwhile science show is now busted!
Over 90 percent of Earth's history was warmer than now.
Global warming is a #1 issue for years now, at least at the citizens.
Right now we are heading towards 7 billion people and they all have to be fed, need schooling, want things we all want.
At least now I have a tape to reuse to record some other junk off the telly.
Ever the copycat, Showtime now offers "The Tudors," combining the time period of "Elizabeth I" and the format of "Rome."
By now, most of the Tudors' historical inaccuracies have been well pointed out; indeed, it's safe to say that the only thing that wasn't changed was the names.
What he's a cop in a big city and after so many years it's just now struck him he'd rather be doing something else !
Hilarious hijinks supposedly ensue as the mob now try to kill Slater, thinking he is the real Tout, while Slater tries to get the diamonds.
Throw in Portia De Rossi as Dreyfuss's daughter (and the 'I hate him for no apparent reason, no wait, now I love him for no apparent reason' relationship with Slater - and I use the term 'relationship' lightly; Tom Cruise had more chemistry with the fish in 'Jerry Maguire'), a painful cameo by RuPaul, a moderately funny though sadly underused Billy Connolly, a mob boss with all the menacing screen presence of American Pie's Chris Klein, two mob button men more cut out for a Home Alone sequel and a soundtrack that sounds like background music from a computer game, then have almost the entire movie played out as a series of flashbacks that Slater is telling mob hitman Critical Jim (played by Tim Allen, who is constantly quoting classic movies a la Remington Steele) and have the audience needlessly wonder at how much of what Slater is saying is true, if anything, and what kind of plot twist might be in store (needlessly wonder because *Spoiler* it's all true and there is no plot twist), and end it all with a cliched train station finish...  Well, what can I say.
Most of these 30's thrillers/murder mysteries have been forgotten by now because, let's face it, they haven't got much to offer apart from Â occasionally Â a good story.
And after he has recuperated in the hospital he chases down his true love from the trio of girls - Mimieux - and tells her "we have the worst behind us" and can now continue their romance, or some nonsense like that.
Also the ending, showing how desperate the characters are for personal revenge and payback would be as wonderful as in those other films, but now it all is just mostly comical trash as Miike definitely wasn't doing this for anything else than money and to satisfy his huge need to work.
I'm sure the Japanese producers and censors have a lot of fun when they see what has Takashi done now!
Hard to believe now that this middling TV Movie/Pilot, with a needlessly convoluted plot, would spark a phenomenon.
But it's good seeing Newman at the top of his form--now, if he will only pick out better projects in which to display his talents.
OK but now the plot , it went all over the place and just seemed to me spoofed of the old 40s film noire classics.
Unfortunately, I'm not going to do that, since I watched it again just last year (I'm 26 now).
The fights which impressed me so much as a child now reveal themselves for what they are - a funny looking blonde guy pretending to use martial arts on a man in a rubber suit (a technique recently revived for the atrocity that was Alien Vs Predator).
There was The Butterfly Effect 2, Open Water 2, Wrong Turn 2, Return to House on Haunted Hill, and now this.
Horror movies that are releasing now is only with gore, violence, sex & bloody scenes.
what a magnificent waste of time, can I have my money back now?
Sasha Mitchell stars as David Sloan the brother of Kurt Sloan (Jean-Claude Van Damme) who takes on Tong Po (Michael Qissi) a brutal fighter who was beaten in Bangkok by Kurt, however Tong Po has killed Kurt and now demands a match with David to reclaim his honor in this disappointingly dull sequel which takes itself far too seriously.
Lucky and Zakes (now played by Rapulana Seiphemo and Ronnie Nyakale) are operating a pirate Taxi and scraping by.
"Jerusalema" is now available on DVD in South Africa.
Look at Superman Returns, Miami Vice, and now even this independent work.
I kept (back in 1999 when I first saw this movie) seeing a mad Ross trying to be bad whenever I looked at him, but now looking back on it and putting Ross out of my head (I really dislike the show anyway), Schwimmer does an effective job... however he doesn't really have dimensions and depth.
And if that ain't bad enough, now we have the cast.
).Meanwhile,Julie's old boyfriend who now has the promising career of ah,fish gutter or something,has to be eliminated so Willis throws a dummy in front of his car and then doesn't kill him,making room for his son who got the weird pseudonym Will Benson(wouldn't it be safer to give him a name that doesn't contain Will,Ben or son?He should have given him a name that's harder to figure out,like John Killer)and they all head to the Bahamas.So Ben is now paying for their holidays or something?Yeah,that'll teach them.
One of the disadvantages of films no longer having all the credits at the beginning is that you now have to wait till the end for clues that the film in question may suck - the appalling film of "The Saint" a few years ago had Leslie Charteris' name nowhere in sight, and similarly "I Still Know What You Did Last Summer" credits neither Kevin Williamson (writer of the first film) nor Lois Duncan (author of the book that it was based on), although they could both lay claim to having originated certain characters.
Karloff's presence notwithstanding, the entire film has only two interesting scenes: in one, a murder takes place in front of at least ten people, yet nobody notices it at first and they go on playing a guessing game as if nothing had happened; in the other, detective Wong gathers (indirectly) all the murder suspects in his house and explains his various theories in detail, in a sequence that plays very much like an early version of all those "and now all will be revealed!"
(See, now, I could have done that - bad Hispanic accent and all!)
I once had a strange feeling to start watching star gate series but now I know... hope I didn't offend some of U that actually like this crap, but for the best of planet earth I rather take Ori as my leader than to see any star gate again.
Stargate should have finished at end of Series 7, but some how was allowed to linger and now we have this cash cow.
Does Schwimmer think he is John Hughes, Judd Nelson and M. Broderick together now?
didn't like it at all was not what i expected it ruined a classic and the story was way off as the Iggy's dad was not the mayor and it was in fact Mrs Claus who went to mother nature not Santa himself and the characters were all wrong it did not have one good point in the who thing they even managed to ruin the snow miser and heat miser songs it was a major disaster i changed the channel and never went back too see it may now Hollywood will leave well enough alone but I'm not holding my breath anyways it was a waste of air time some might find it amusing but i did not and it was awful hopefully it will never air again but I'm not holding my breath on that one either
So, now, at a suave and silver 53, having seen and experienced such much more, what i'll say has more bearing.
after i DID watch it, at least i know which style and type of posts i should be avoiding from now on...  straight to the point, this is a PRO- war movie( very cunning, i give it that).
Altogether the premise of this movie doesn't seem all that exciting, now that I really think about it there is not much to this movie but both myself and my sister have an odd obsession with it.
Something that also disturbed me were the characters Tom Cruise isn't really a spy here, he's to busy with his hair now.
And what were they thinking about Rhames, his Character was very interesting in MI but now he's so boring with the stupid one liners about his clothes.
It's evident in all the movies in Hollywood now, Bollywood fight scenes where one guy flies around kicking everyone's butts with dumb moves.
That producer must've been a flunky at MTV who got a break (and now hopefully she's busy being adorable some place else).
Anyway, I did kind of like the close-up shot of one victim with red lines painted on their body and perhaps plastic (or dead) flies lined up, with the buzzing sound dubbed in, now THAT was class.
Movies that are getting made now are not half as good as movies made in this era; I prefer this film over Leprechaun in da hood or the Halloween webcam movie.
She's been writing songs for a few years now, the royalties have helped with her tuition.
The film would really work now that the voting age nationwide is 18.
But now, this was just something completely unnecessary.
Whoopi Goldberg started off doing silly but funny comedies, now she either does bad films or films that are too self important.
It's just not pretty seeing a vulnerable Lauren Bacall at her worst, whether due to the direction or to her now visible weaknesses as an actress.
As with many films now, it is in desperate need of editing and the length is unreasonable.
It has a weak cult following now due to the success of Parker and Stone's reputations as funny troublemakers, but the fact is that "Orgazmo" really is just controversial for the sake of being so.
Even now I waste time writing this review, hoping to save some of you from this colossal waste of time.
She gets cold, sees more zombie thingys, and returns to Guy's now frozen corpse.
For now, I recommend watching The Orphanage or May while you await better cult horror films.
I am now completely blind in my left eye.
He asks his son why he has never spoken before and his son replies that he never had anything to say before now.
It's become his calling card now -- it's like the first thing he says when he walks on camera is "You talking' to me?"
There are some actors in this movie I have often seen in other movies and do adore, and regret not seeing them in good movies for some time now - so I keep on waiting and hoping that maybe some day those actors will.
I've been acting my whole life, and now I am a film student, production, at University at Buffalo.
I'm sorry but I now a good movie when I see one, and yours are not.
This DVD is on the TV now.
That set alarm bells ringing since it's only April 2007 now.
i know better now.
Other verbal highlights include 'Beware the one egg' (or something), 'All the powder in the world' (NOT in reference to cocaine), and pretty much every deathbed speech of the last ten minutes, as if being shot is now some open licence to soliloquise.
More troubling was the way Hagman's character believed he was Holmes, yet he wasn't troubled by the fact that his friend Watson was now a female, nor that his flat at 221 B Baker Street was now in Los Angeles.
So why spend tons of money on a made-for-cable feature about a topic now irrelevant by overexposure?
First off let me say this film is awful.I would really like to know what made Olivier and Peck and Mason star in this rubbish not to mention the bad performances given by practically everyone in this film the only saving grace is Gregory Peck who plays the Nazi doctor as a powerful man who is seriously deluded and full of his own self importance.The plot basically is this Dr Mengler is alive and well in Brazil and is being tracked down by a Jewish man played by Lawrence Olivier who is part of a group who have formed to bring Nazi war criminals to justice,Mengler has cloned Hitler and placed the young boys with foster families and is now tracking them down to tell them the truth about their backgrounds.However save yourself buying this on DVD and just watch it if it comes on TV it is watchable but it is not a good film.
now, forgive me if i'm wrong, but the concept of a stripper is to strip until she is naked for people's enjoyment.
now that i got THAT rant out of the way, onto this convoluted mess of a movie.
The concept has been flogged to death by the likes of Final Destination and now suffers from any form of originality.
the zombie is then not even after the now senior citizen soldier, instead they want to thank him since he stood up for them.
By now, you probably already know what this movie is all about.
They just kept in line and had blank faces WILLING to get sprayed by this giant ant that now controls the whole town!
Okay, so now you are probably thinking "this sounds horrible--it can't possibly get any stupider"--well, if you ARE thinking that, then are you in for a surprise!!!
Now Chuck is of course a pensioner now and although he's in excellent shape he is, how Gibson and Glover might say "too old for this s**t!"
At 65 he now is heavily doubled.
With his most recent film Bells of Innocence (quite enjoyable actually), he used no martial arts at all and I noted how maybe now because of his age, he was phasing this out of his act and concentrating more on expanding his range.
Here Chuck returns as Sam Shepherd, a former detective who quit the force after a mission went tragically wrong, who's now working as a Private Investigator.
It's long, drawn out and slow like a typical CSI-ish drama with just a not-so-subtle hint of religious preaching now and then (discounting testimony's from "God", since we'd expect that, but the "it's only logical to believe in God" speech from the nerd-brother?).
OK, so I think that I've done as much as I can to describe how stupid this movie was, so I'll now look at it from another angle.
For now, try another movie.
I've now seen this wretched rock fantasy three times, and think I can safely call it a day after this.
I now add my name to that number.
Melissa doesn't escape her eternal torment, Satan now has puss boy's soul as well, and nothing has been accomplished.
After about 10 minutes you get tired of hearing about James Dean, and I like that line Richard Thomas said to his mother "I'm really upset right now momma someone I know died last night" His Mother: You don't mean that movie star Jimmy whats his name?"
I have never seen a movie that completely disregards all information about medieval times the author has given and shows no respect to his work, until now.
"Hill Street Blues" is one of the best shows ever made, now comes along "Cop Rock" by the same producer, it almost seems impossible to believe.
Yes, those dear alien noises, it's the one thing that sticks out in my head (Holding ears and shuddering off the memory now.)
Apparently Rankin used to date her before, and she is now Vince's fiancÃ©.
So with 3 episodes now left it seems that the inevitable end of season cliffhanger is going to be squeezed into the last three episodes.
The watching experience is different but the result is not better than bad comedy, scarcely extracting a smile now and then.
Some kid walks out of a lake, gets on a bus, and goes to Church, where we find a rather loud Priest doing his thing...  and I'm sure all of this has something to do with the six "sinners" the story now revolves around.
With the doors now locked, one by one, everyone is taken out by the redeemer, some guy who probably fancys himself some kind of righteous/sadistic chameleon, hence the killing in the name of God, and constant wardrobe changes.
I'm sad to report things have gotten even worse, since now we need to resource to _our_ (external) knowledge of the period to understand what's going on.
He impressed me enough that now I will look for him in other projects.
Hope I now used enough space so I can submit.
First "Dungeons & Dragons" and now THIS!
Once I had a lot of respect for his work, now...well lets just say you've got a long way to go baby to come back from this.
She can cross over and she needs to do it now before she gets stereotyped.
There are a few other relatively known actors in here, but Terry Crews has already been making appearances in terrible movies for a while now (Norbit anybody?)
But Lucy starts to tell a story, the film now goes into flashback as we see Lucy dancing on stage at a sleazy strip club.
An ex-stripper who has now settled down with her husband gives birth to an uncontrollable, monster of a baby that's growing bigger and stronger everyday.
Collins plays an ex-stripper, now married to Italian Ralph Bates and the film starts with Collins going through a difficult child birth, or so we're meant to think.
I should mention Chesty Morgan around now.
The dialogue is outrageous - especially the scene in the classroom when one of the male students talks about Christopher Columbus going to that "deep pool" of the Alantic Ocean with his "non-stop studs" - which now, out of context, sounds more like a line from a gay porno flick instead of a 1950s b-movie (!).
And of course its view of teen-aged life in the second Eisenhower administration bears not the slightest resemblance to any reality Â then or now.
Basil Rathbone who says he's a former partner in crime with Powell now is engaging in a bit of blackmail and he's contrived quite a scheme to convince Powell he's who Rathbone says he is.
The rest of the film shows our small crew trying to find the monster, now fully grown within 45 minutes(..now that's fast!
and "Uh huh uh uh now you gunna be da wormface".
Tony Todd gives another creepy, over-the-top performance as the man of dreams and pain(alright even now I am sounding like some of that tripe he spews).
For the most part this film is pretty lousy as the acting is some of the worst I've seen in a flick with a budget as large as this films' is, the scares are also somewhat predictable as well as unoriginal---however though, when I think about it now how psychotically creative (for lack of a couple of better words) could one really be with a hook anyway?
For a few weeks now I've expressed interest in wanting to see "The Best Man."
Oh, and another quote (Father to girl, after discussing their inevitable death on the rocket) "Well all that matters right now is that you have cooked us a good meal"
I think it's now in public domain, assuming anyone would ever care to seek out this film that is so dull and lacking of anything that might make it worth watching.
In summation, either watch a bunch of really good films and learn to see how they work ... or just stop now and let other people have a go.
I never give up on a film, but I jacked this one in after only 20 Min's just now.
I really could knock up up better one right now (even the instruments/sounds used are cheap ass midi tacky rubbish).
They still did a segment every episode in which they folded laundry and traded one-liners... but now they were just miserable whining pigs.
The jokes had become bitter complaints and their once-weary persona was now downright hostile.
The roles are tailor-made to safely conform to PC standards of diversity; a carefully balanced quota of blacks, whites, Jews, Latinos, straights, gays, AIDS sufferers, addicts, "yuppie scum" and the now almost mandatory free spirit cross-dresser.
If he's that much of a coward, surely he'd have found a more effective way of invaliding himself by now?
who clenches his teeth manfully.OK.It's a Robert Aldrich war movie,a sort of "Dirty Half Dozen",but hey,now it's 1968 man,it's not cool any more to make war movies,let's pretend we've made an anti - war movie and really clean up.
Some interesting shots but over all, very boring and empty of any substance which keeps the viewer interested......For the agricultural student, its dated because the machinery used is now obsolete, some nice seeds/crops in the film though and shots of animal husbandry are included, especially a titillating scene where a peasant babushka milks a cow.
A silly segment where a man discusses the fact that he's about to die, gets a little something to eat and says "ok I'm going to die now" and does.
Kill me now.
And now with the cult status, recent screenings, and upcoming documentary, will we be cur...I mean blessed with 'Troll 3?'
I have seen this awful film far to many times now.
i scoff now at the Oscars, which seems to be all political.
Why, they turn you into a vegetable before they devour you.....obviously (dont you feel stupid for asking now?)
I will now begin with the double decker bologna sandwich part of my analysis.
Daughter says "Elliott is part of the family now!"
IF i had the unfortunate karma to view this (expletive deleted) in a theater, i would've walked out of this horrendously bad film...it is the second worst film that i have ever seen, beating out the venerable Zabriskie Point by Antonioni (which i walked out on the first time i saw it) which is now the third worst film i've ever seen....but i must admit that there is some pretty horrible (expletive deleted) out there which have forced me to appreciate Zabriskie Point more now...
No, now that I think about it, it's VERY easy to believe that this movie is unappealing.
It's a just a great movie, and its replay value is above a lot of other movies out right now.
(yes it was actually in movie theaters for a BRIEF time) It sucked then and it sucks now.
I'll just stop describing the story now.
Wilson/Hudson explains his behaviour with 'We fought the preliminary for the k*kes; now we'll fight the main event for the n*ggers' This valiant supporter of human rights is the same man who harbours an obsessive need to kill an elephant?
I won't waste my time reviewing a piece of bubble gum like this suffice it to say that bubble gum, every now and then, is kind of fun but gets stale quickly.
And is pretty annoyed that her brother Buddy(Billy Jacoby--William Jayne now) has pined up several naked women in his room.
But not now.
AGENCY is another of those Canadian-made pictures posing as an American film, replete with big-name U.S. actors, and featuring Montreal unconvincingly standing in for Washington, D.C.  With a premise that is more intriguing and timely now than ever - subliminal messages in TV ads - one would have wished for a sincere, thoughtful approach.
But seeing this piece of s$@t make it this far, I now know that any film can find distribution...
Finally, Lance has decided to settle down now that he has inked a $5-million contract to play for the New York Giants.
something has to happen now.
While racketing a congressman, he finds out that running for Congress will earn him more money than he does now.
It's now trying to make a point.
Its only now after reading around, I have come to know that the producers were in a hurry to make the movie for whatever obvious reasons even before the trial started, and the morons based the entire movie around Davids confession<--- what a stupid thing to do... its a painful story and it should have been dealt with more responsibility... all they have done is made David look like a stupid mad in love softy, whereas he might have been the whole mastermind and the poor crazy gal, who knows what mental condition shes got......... Last but not the least, the characters were soo poorly defined, holly marie combs was absolutely wasted, she is one of the best actresses in the industry and did a fine job with whatever twisted script she had.
Notice that the tag line for this movie was "If the God's were crazy now they've gone berserk".
I've never been before, but I am definitely now a Terrence Dashon Howard fan.
It gives me new appreciation for THE LIZZIE MCGUIRE MOVIE, which is a bad film, but whose star now looks like a beacon of modesty and talent compared to Lohan in this make-me-a-star-now vehicle.
He's now a black ex-convict with only slightly more hair in the form of Ice Cube.
He breaks Darius Stone, now XXX, out of jail in one of the silliest stunts shown on film.
Lets get down to the important part now.
The Getty marriage now begins to disintegrate.
This Movie is the second part of the Foreigner, but the foreigner was bad, and now makes Seagal a second part of this bad movie.
If your a seagal fan don't watch it, he was probably depressed when He made it..and now I am.
So Seagal is Jonathan Cold, a high-level ex-CIA agent who is now a "freelance operative," which sounds like nothing more than a title invented for cheesy action movies for a hero who takes matters into his own hands.
The story barely resembles Johnston McCulley's writings (Zorro is now a Governor!
As with Streetcar Named Desire, I've seen this twice now, and still can't say I'd recommend it, except for James Michael Bobby (the Cowboy) as its seductive, off-kilter Blanche Dubois.
but these scenes are about as cool as the stupid hardbody's attempts at making jokes about male incompetence now and then.
By the way,I'm now a recovering Penn & Teller fan.
it was bad  when i saw it in the theater 2 years ago, it is bad now.  
Unfortunately I know very little more now about Derrida than I did when I came in.
He is gone now, but if you've never seen him you have the opportunity in this video to look at him.
Derrida is gone now, but he once was alive.
"Let's see now.
One or all of these specialties have allowed the professor to create a device which now threatens to destroy a fairly large city back on earth, and the professor and his really annoying though apparently brilliant research assistant are charged with the task of creating artificial life for the Brian Joneses' masters, an aging race of paraplegic immortals.
"Oh, so they changed Fairlght, so Jeb is married to a new face, now?"
Basically the producers told them "thanks, now leave".
The movie begins with Annie Braddock (Johanssen) a college graduate who is unsure what to do with her life now.
They made the Nanny character (now Annie) a poor New Jersey girl, raised by a single mother, who has no idea what she wants to do with her life.
She used to be very full-figured, and now she looks almost sick.
The case has now been reopened and it seems the bullets DO NOT match his gun.
Bill Smith (Ken Kenard) was once a policeman but is now a nightclub owner.
This reminds me of other early 80's horror films like the Hallowing, that where good then, but lame now.
First and foremost, Chuck is a poor actor then and now.
Up until now, "Tomb of the Undead" was the worst movie ever.
You've guessed by now that I'm an attorney.
This was a slightly funny sometimes entertaining family comedy, but you can tell how Disney is going into the live action, and will have some unsuccessful movies to now, Meet The Deedles, Mr. Magoo, and others.
You should know that by now, and before I digress...
It could be done heck anything can be done now a days the 2005 movie year was one of Hollywood worst years!
And I always say now, that before he hit big on TV, he had it rough!
Also part of the posse is the now civilized girl who abandoned the mountain-family near the end of part one.
Bobby has a bunch of flashbacks and Ruby is now known as Rachel (she is now sibilized and pretty much normal other than THE FRIGGIN FLASHBACKS!
She then claims to the kids that she is the now legendary Ruby.Pluto takes off on one of the bikes.
They are accompanied by Ruby (Janus Blythe) who actually is the daughter of the feral family, now civilized with the help of the survivors of the Carter family.
That would have been appropriate for a quick montage, but now I felt, that the scenes were put in just to make the movie a bit longer.
Among their number is Ruby (now called Rachel), who has become part of society.
After the prologue, Bobby has flashbacks from the first movie; now, this scenes have background music.
He is now in a biker gang (for sporting motives).
who may be now 30 years old.
That's right, they're all at the same site and now they are invited to dinner, where I'm sure they'll be the guests of honor.
I'm sure that by now most people are aware that IMDb reviews are a breeding ground for hype from the people involved in the film itself, if not then beware of all the high ratings/reviews a lesser known film receives, especially early on when the film's newly/barely even been released.
Simba (Matthew Broderick, again) is now The Lion King and has wife Nala and a new daughter Kiara to be Queen, she is voiced by Scream's Neve Campbell when she is older.
Go on now.
Whether it was for money, boredom, you be the judge, but he did the movie and now I will probably be the judge of how it looks.
It is now time for the makers of "Scary Movie" to make "Harrison Ford Movie" in which for two thrilling hours Ford can't find his family because they're standing directly behind him.
Oops - the computer terminal needed to actually steal the money is now gone and housed in Wisconsin at the new bank headquarters.
But wait, Rusty is missing too, now I have to comply with their demands.
Apparently Boon and Tobias, buoyed by the success of the first movie, said to themselves, "Cool, now we can throw in all the faceless villains the marketing guys they told us would be too much for the audience in the first movie."
Right now if I hadn't actually paid to see this in theater I would be laughing my head off about how bad it was.
RAIDEN btw, is now a less-hardcore version of the original kick ass Christopher Lambert Raiden, if you're gonna remove Lambert, then you need someone fairly bad ass, so what do they do?
In 5 seconds she gets killed by a falling cage, now that is comedy folks.
Thanks a lot John R. Leonetti I know now that you can't direct.
By now the games were in 3d and the storyline had gone from basic Enter the Dragon tournaments to all out apocalyptic robot wars and sorcerors controlling the fates of a bunch of new, generic characters.
Normally I don't comment on films, until now.
AAAHHHH, (SIGH) I feel better now.
Unfortunately, Team Canada's players are more often than not displayed as goons without much finesse (which we all now is far from the truth) and sometimes I had a hard time sympathizing with the Canadian team.
The climactic chase has the fat, bald, sweater wearing axe killer chasing the girls on a glorified riding mower- oooh, now that's scary.
No, wait, this was made this year... Hmm, wow, I didn't think a movie about the great American dream versus the Evil Empire (tm)(c) could hold water -- no longer the evil U.S.S.R, now it gets to be China.
Hopefully, in 20 to 30 years from now, a director and some really good actors will do a remake of "EPOCH" and make it great.
I'll stop now.
Every now and again, it pops up and, if whatever civilisation is not advanced enough to deactivate it, it wipes that civilisation out completely and disappears for another few millions of years.
I didn't think much of this when I first saw it and don't think much of it now.
Miss Marple's thought's now run to "love" and how "love" somehow makes multiple murders less wrong.
Well for anyone else who heard this let me tell you now, its not.
Playing music backwards to hear Satan is now a funny clichÃ© and that music certainly didn't help create any tension.
Oh come on now, I keep seeing posts where this movie is described as "an intelligent thriller".
Now, there are unexpected pleasures to be wrought from watching obscure movies now and then, and while I generally am pretty resistant to the 'oh wow, I've been there' effect, I did find the 1972 vintage shots of 'Place Jacques Cartier' and 'Rue St. Paul Est', well before the resurrection of the area as "Old Montreal' to be such a surprise.
We see Lucy Loveless who plays the lead seemingly drive to Indiana with the redeemed dastardly scientist ( who BTW daughter was attacked by locust and is now in a coma)from the DC area in warp speed time to warn her father who I guess does not have a radio or TV but has have a super sleek cell phone that the bugs are coming straight for him!
They are now carnivorous!
This movie actually contains lines such as: "I'm pregnant and hormonal, now land this 'copter".
It's bad enough we have our hands full in the Middle East, but now the U.S. Department of Agriculture has its hands full with locusts.
Well, I hope it was fun to shoot, I'm happy for all the folks who got their start on this project, and I hope they all got paid real good - can I have my two hours back, now?
Yet another reason to hate technology--infesting the movies now with cell phones to eat up the scenery.
`The Government is lying to you- now!'
The villains seem to be able to call on an endless supply of guards prepared to obey their orders unquestioningly- none of those guards seem to have wondered how the astronauts survived the destruction of their craft or why they are now being called upon to kill men regarded as national heroes.
Eventually, the commander responds with the equivalent of, "We're okay, now shut up."
It is unfortunate that Hollywood quickly lost interest in the complexity of producing good stereoscopic films (which are most often now featured in specialist theatres such as the IMAX), and instead has followed what I feel has been a largely disasterous attempt to explore the potential of anthropomorphic lenses even though in the majority of cases these have no conceivable artistic contribution to make to the final product.
Well, now that I'm older, I can see a lot of things that were not noticeable back then.
now had nine all-weather squadrons and the present programme called for their re-equipment with the CF-105, requiring a production order of 169 in number.
The military recommended cancelling the program,"Finally, the cost of the CF-105 programme as a whole was now of such a magnitude that the Chiefs of Staff felt that, to meet the modest requirement of manned aircraft presently considered advisable, it would be more economical to procure a fully developed interceptor of comparable performance in the U.S." Note that the government was told the Arrow was "comparable" to other aircraft and not that it could fly higher, faster, or further than anything else.
He now has constant nightmares about the whole thing, and they sympathize, having granted him absolution.
The half-Jewish now agnostic judge who pursues Caine is a moderately interesting character, but the audience never can truly sympathize with her because she's rude, arrogant and impulsive most of the time - a young, annoying idealist.
I actually liked Norman Jewison (and loved Ronald Harwood's "Piano Player"), but now that I realize the ironic persecution of the Church (or Mel) that drove them to make this movie, I'm repulsed.
And now adding more content to satisfy IMDb's requirements: Michael Caine plays an ex-Nazi French collaborator; he "acts" exceedingly nervous throughout the film helped no doubt by the liberal application of some oil-based lubricant to his face; Church officials are of course portrayed as deeply corrupt and dishonest, protecting their pro-fascist sympathies until the heat gets turned on them when naturally they sell out their own man, and so on.
Despite some of the favorable comments, most people are bored watching this film now.
Their actions in competition over McNamara now seem witless.
But what I believe is that Snipe's draw as an action hero will subside even more now that big Willy grabs his pistol fairly regularly and now of course the Rock is laying the Smackdown on cinema goers.
Initially he balanced his action movies by doing independent and TV movies as well, to have more challenging roles but looking at his next lot of movies, all action based, it seems he may have made his bed for good and is now content to lye in it.
A guy speaks to the CIA and now the bad guys need to know if it's safe to sell the drug.
Now not only does Snipes, who by the way is an ex military that carries a guilt (now that's original) has to escape from them but he also has to get the antidote or his brain will pretty much fry.
I hope Snipes can start making movies that actually hits the theaters, but for now, he's a straight to DVD actor.
It's about a gunman being cursed, now he has to fight all of his enemies that died by his hands, only this time they're already dead.
In the space of only a day, I have managed to see two of the fifty films listed in "The Fifty Worst Films Of All Time" by Harry Medved (a classic book that is now, unfortunately, out of print).
This scantily clad wench sang about "making love with me" and seeing this tiny woman singing such a suggestive song made me feel a bit uneasy...no, now that I think about it, it made me queasy.
Still, it's hard watching the picture not to crack up every now and then over inadvertently funny scenes like the midget cowboys riding on their Shetland ponies, or walking into a saloon under the swinging door.
I now doubt that I missed much - and think the movie simply fails on all levels.
The sequel, "More Sex..." had begun, and about a half-hour into it, I noticed the former lover who had impregnated her, and had earlier announced his returning to his wife (but only after "messing-up" the bed clothes with her in their hotel room) appeared at her door, announcing a now impending divorce.
I cant overlook that they seriously all out-performed a "star" like Ryder (in my opinion she is so over-rated and now people realize it) Like I said I had a different experience.
So don't all we who executed the sequel feel silly now?
and, oh, the paper was the utter maximum we could send back but we've changed out minds and now we can send Denzel back but he has to be in his undies 'cause his shoes would weigh too much.
Film is now, for the most part, a commodity like toothpaste and paper towels - and it shows!
Jo March is married now with children.
Needless to say I am more careful now.
I know that going into the experience by now.
When the only surviving main character predictably escapes he coincidentally bumps into everyone involved in the setup so we can all feel better now that the good guys have been somewhat redeemed.
Enter Alex, who gives the Americans, and an Icelandic traveling companion, one of those tips that must be urban legend by now: a hostel full of loose ladies that's not on any map, in a country squirming with lonely beautiful women, in love with the American accent.
He is now ready to graduate to torture and murder for his sexual gratification.
It's original enough to be compelling-where we are not in some distant future, but the here and now.
Hey, there's three of them now crossing the street right in front of me just as I'm trying to escape the town!
I'll stop lamenting now!
the man that wrote the shining, shaw shank redemption, misery is now stuck in a horrible flick like Dolan's Cadillac?
I was floored when I saw it back in the day, and I could not understand why it did not receive the recognition it deserved, but now I think I understand the undercurrent which it churned within the industry was not good.
One has the feeling that the film is biographical, and--now that Mr. Butler has a book out by the same name--I guess that is true.
Okay, now the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency, (that's an oxymoron itself)) is framing Jane Doe(or is it the company that's doing it?
And by calling it just 'Friday The 13th' they've screwed themselves on being able to call the next one, the 13th one, which could've been called 'Friday THE 13th' but now that's shot down.
He can use a bow and arrow now becoming Jason Hood.
He runs (wich is fine) and he looks at himself in the mirror (even Jason cares about looks now).
I'll note now that I'm not a prude, I have no problems with sex and violence, but sometimes less is more.
All in all, I didn't hate Friday the 13th, but I hope five years from now I'll be watching Friday the 13th The Remake Part 5.
from the Times Square Police Station (now an Army recruiting outpost) when your wallet got lifted in the balcony during a Bruce Lee triple-feature.
that Jason now uses to get around (because the director wanted a mine.
Oh right, we're making him into Leatherface now.
A couple good touches, such as the topless skiing scene (even though that didn't show off what it could've) and the ax kill (now THAT was pure Jason) can even begin to save this pile of sludge.
I'd now like to take the opportunity to congratulate Mr. Nispel for making an unscary, ugly-looking, suspense-free movie with bad acting, terrible dialogue, forgettable kills and annoying characters.
Are they trying to now "humanize" him like Rob Zombie did with Michael Myers in his equally wretched "remake" of HALLOWEEN?
We can give up now... fans.
Kate Beckinsale wandering around on the screen naked for no apparent reason is something I doubt we would see much of now.
As it now stands there are a few laughs and it's not a total waste of time but will be a huge disappointment to fans of the lead actors.
The fact that this movie has never to my knowledge appeared on any sort of great films list, not even for the 80's, is just proof of the fact that it was over-rated at the time and now has largely been forgotten.
Because throughout we get him plugging his music every now and again in the most rib-tickling, cheesy fashion.
Boy, now we know what really ticked off the gila monster.
Through the combined efforts of the sheriff and a quick witted mechanic, the source of the problem is discovered, a fifty-foot Gila monster who has run out of food, and is now preying upon the local populace," according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.
- now there's a mix that absolutely demands attention.
These two have barely been on screen together and now there's talk of true love?
now onto the crap, the two main characters Bridget and ghost.
They have to move fast with the robbery as Lynn finds out that Hal has contacted Woody and he is now in town.
I now see why he wanted to own it.
Admittedly, there was one brilliant moment of absurdity: a notorious sequence where the little boy, now a zombie, rips his mother's breast off with his teeth.
I now wish i had quit watching.
This was one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen, and even now I am amazed that I watched it the whole way through.
The net result of the mother and daughter walking off alone, being perfectly happy to be without a man, now that, my friends, is misleading and completely detrimental to those women who might otherwise try to work things out with their real-life husbands.
It has gone too far, past being equal, rebounding now to hating men and leading many women to trying to live without them, a really, really stupid outcome of the entire feminist movement.
What The Waitress does is take a case, where dumping the jerk IS more than appropriate, and causes lingering anticipatory angst in a woman's mind, seeing similar things in the men she lives around, stretching now to find them, when, in fact, those things looked for so hard are not even close to really being part of what the men around those women will do or are being, in degree nor goal, even being capable of mimicking.
The only "acceptable" man, now, can't be one?
Available now on MGM DVD, full TV mini-series.
It probably could be condensed into a great movie now
The Baboons now know they're on the Island & will stop at nothing to kill the intruders as Brodie has to use his experience & firepower to keep everyone alive, with varying degrees of success.
Once there, he discovers by a cousin that everybody lied about the reasons why his mother stayed and to make things worse, his father, dead by now, made him promise that he'd never go back to Cuba (so he wouldn't find out, my guess).
As the film begins, it features a rather low and depressed-looking Earl Bassett (Fred Ward), who, unlike his partner Valentine Mckee, didn't profit from the appearance of the giant worms, now known as graboids.
We argued when you were young but now I love you."
* Daughter: "And now I'm dying!"
And now he's making movies??
i connected with none of the characters and now as i think back, i can't even remember how it ends.
now mind you i've only done this a few times and this film happens to be on my 'sucky' film list.
long story short : I'm sorry to whom reads right now because you'll find nothing more than questions, and I'm sorry that you've watched it too as it's not Callas Forever it's Silliness Forever !
This was a fun film to see on TV reruns in the early 1980s, and to see it now would be fun simply to remind me of when I was a kid.
And now, when my kids are a little older, I can tell them their dad was in a TV movie with William Shatner, and they can say "A what with who?"
(Why language gets recast in TV dubbing is beyond me when sitcoms now include some of the raunchiest allusions imaginable.
Too often, this film pulls what politicians through the ages (most embarrassingly right now ) in skirting issues with massaging its audience's ego to ensure no one questions any flaws in the image of any "greater good".
Even in a war that had to be fought in its time, this film's simplistic, condescending emotional symbolism, and manipulation, are exactly the smoke and mirrors that are used right now on this generation's "every person USA".
There are many potential characters: Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Herbert Lom, twitching again), the head of the French Mafia (Robert Loggia) - still struggling from their defeat by Clousseau in 1978, and even Sir Charles and now Lady Lytton (David Niven and Capuchine, reunited for this second film).
Don Wilson stars as a cop who enjoys the occasional virtual reality fighting game, however things go wrong when the people behind the game decide to take virtual reality to a new level by making real people from the video game, okay actually they make the cybersex models as prototype but the main bad guy from the video game awakens and starts killing people and now the only man who can beat the guy is Don Wilson, who in the mean time falls in love with the cybersex model.
Crash down, his daughter, now must the director and father(Henriksen) find his little girl.
And if you're sitting there (in the future) reading this wondering if the now famous directors second movie is worth a watch.
I've watched it three times now and I still fail to see how this is a horror movie.
It turns out that Dallesandro, who wears skin-tight hip-huggers and no shirt, has a history of working for employers who are now dead.
Cmon now.
You've now been warned - Avoid this film at all costs!!
I attended one 30 years ago and my mother still teaches in the school system, which is now about 90% Hispanic and/or African American.
First it was SGCTC, than the Brak Show, than AQHF, than Harvey Birdman, now its reruns of Stoker and Hooch, Metalpocalypse, Venture Brothers, Robot Chicken, in other words, I'm a regular viewer to Adult Swim (it's the only TV I watch regularly).
Hey, I laughed at the Simpsons, then South Park, and now these other shows which Adult Swim has done, but the bashing is wearing thin.
Hey, heres a funny show idea, since there have been Christian bashing shows on the air since SNL started in the 70's and its been 30 years now, why not bash Muslim's?
The dialog was made of one clichÃ© after another suitably punctuated for effect such as when Walters (Luana Walters that is, here credited as Susan) announces to her husband Dixie Logan "Even if you were framed I know now that you're ROTten" (emphasis on ROT).
I once had Battlefield Earth as the worst, but now this movie has leaped far ahead.
I totally loved Malmros's last film, Smala Sussie, which had a wacky plot about movie-lovers/makers, a category of people that I feel included of, and I think I now can say that those that didn't love Smala Sussie probably was in the same seat as I am with this picture...
"Nothing interesting is happening now," you think to yourself as the protagonist explains yet again what he wants his passenger to do, "but perhaps we will reach a dramatic moment at the end of the shot."
When you expected that someone was going to explain to you what was happening the scene changes radically and you can only feel something like "What the heck is happening now?"
I had the screener of this film in my hands for 5 days now.
I have been trying to watch this film for 5 days now.
I was very disappointed with the movie when I first saw it (but not as much as now) as there are few movies that come from true sci-fi writers (Hugo winners and the like) and I was really looking forward to it.
I wish that I had a beer buzz right now; maybe it would help me forget this.
At least I know now that Blockbuster isn't playing favorites - they rent good and absolutely horrible movies alike.
I thought to myself "I'll take it now b/c if its a mistake it won't have cost me anything."
Okay, I watched this just now, many, many years after seeing The Big Chill.
Even the (now) reliable David Strathairn will make you wince.
Watching it now, 9 years later, the series does not hold the same amount of appeal as it used to.
I mean, how do the producers think that anybody who's EVER lived through a divorce (what- 75% of the USA now?
So campy, I stopped the DVD many times, and until now, I still haven't finished watchin' it!!!
Well, now the future has come, and Waters left behind the amateur ways in order to make some brilliant pieces ("Cry Baby", "Serial Mom") that were more in the Hollywood style, much more according to the mainstream ways.
The most horrifying thing is that she is not dead yet, sitting upright in shock but then hopelessly shoved back inside by Leatherface, who has now killed her would-be rescuer.
I can't imagine what I would think if I saw it now.
I already know it's another predictable piece of cinematic junk in the now regrettably classic formula of commenting on the state of modern dating via terrible comedy.
This is now my all time worst movie !!
Her stupid "No Logo" bullshit only translates to other areas of media, now in the form of this Mocumentary.
What are those poor workers doing now?!?!"
From the prologue with the corpse 'art'(not as much a stretch considering the kind of art produced in this era), the Dead Armadillo in the film's opening; a Texas national landmark, it would seem, to the dried up 'Ol swimming hole, to the heroine's once-thriving home now populated with spiders and rats.
I was so excited that the Dimera storyline finally ended years ago, but now it's back.
Anyways, I loved how the film was pretty much all about Bridgette, not that hated Ginger it's just I really didn't want to deal with one of the problems with Ginger Snaps 1 again which was the constant deal of: I'm okay, no I'm a wolf, No I'm okay, I hate you, now I don't, Now I do!
With his soul now inhabiting a new body, the madman believes he can continue his experiments uninterrupted," according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.
I tell you now this movie deserves to be neither liked nor hated, but to be loved.
Please do not watch this movie, there are now 28 minutes of my life that are forever lost among this movie and I am not happy about that!
I now know why he went into seclusion in his last days!
I remember when Aamir Khan gave a good bashing to Amitabh Bachchan and said that his movie "Black" Was a copied.Although I agree with him,but now Aamir Khan's new movie "Gajni" is a blatant copy of Memento .
Pausing, she looked at the now turned off TV screen, then back to me and went on ...  "And then there's films such as this which are just garbage, plain and simple."
It seemed to now know whether to be a comedy, a fantasy or something else entirely.
Now, with Jerry having fights, chairs thrown and Steve and his security team, Maury is now the King of Trash.
If I turn on Maury now, it's the same old topics over and over again.
Then in another show he'll be supporting former "bullied nerds" now "super skanks".
STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning   Six years ago, I wrote my first review of The Maury Povich Show (or Maury as it is now known) and the main thing I could think to write of it was 'sad.'
But the show has had to move with the hard, cynical times and now we have the same old tired scenarios ("You're my baby's daddy", "You cheated!")
only done with harder, crueller guests (but you now have to wonder, with all the inside exposes they do on these types of shows, whether it's all just been how they're told to behave all along...they have to move with the times, after all) who just seem utterly militant and unable to hear anyone's point but their own.
he was always thinking about murdering his therapist and it was constantly flashing back to scenes, but it was one of those lame flashbacks where they don't tell you it's a flashback and you think it's happening now.
They're probably down at the bus station begging for change right now.
They just wear suits instead of sheets now.
A powerful and memorable movie for sure and certainly an important one because the Korean War is largely forgotten these days, so Pork Chop Hill now stands proud for those that died during the conflict, for this is a wonderful testament to the brave fighting under stupid circumstances.
Every now and then, a story emerges from Hollywood which affixes itself squarely on the pages of history.
Okay bring in plot twist A now B now C. Only the cast (as I said) makes it at all watchable.
This is as true now as it was in the '50s.
However, the cast is much more interesting, mainly because we don't have the outstanding character actors now that we had then.
Everyone who saw this movie is now dumber for having seen to it.
Not the plot - I like fantasy stories and will try to get hold of a copy of Susan Cooper's book now I've read such great things about it on here.
I'd sat and watched the DVD of 28 Days Later the previous night: now that's a film not afraid to be British that still went down a storm in the States.
Even now, 27 years later it has lost none of its appeal and my own children are enjoying it too.
Above all it is quintessentially English and far from being dated it is a timeless masterpiece as relevant to children now as 30 years ago.
The world is now at an abyss.
Well now, the croc in "Primeval" answers to the name Gustave and his jaws are never closed neither, but for a completely different reason.
Gustave normally just feeds on locals, so nobody in the Western world cares whether he lives or dies, but he now made the terrible mistake of eating a female white reporter and his quiet and peaceful days of over for good.
Her brother kills himself and she blames herself, and her reason for staying in the business is now more self-induced.
And Debbie Reynolds, who tries her best in a horribly written and conceived role, is still a delight in the similar 1954 comedy "Susan Slept Here," which was far from a hit in its day but now looks better than ever--especially compared to this mind-numbing disaster!
Now, this sound like a relatively HUGE flaw in his father's plan, now doesn't this?
The fact that we now know that the tape is a fake?
I loved Goku as a kid back in the day but that was then, this is now.
Gohan once had some spotlight but now is nothing but an idiot.
Now, now, before you go and reply back or whatever, hear me out, good god.
After arriving home and throwing a full on tantrum which involves stomping on her costume, ripping photos off the walls and throwing all her teddy-bears onto the floor, Georgia takes a deep breath and announces to the family that she's going to be 'more mature from now on'.
Anyway, for reasons the film doesn't care to share, Georgia is now officially a hero.
Oh dear God take me now.
Amongst some of the worst and most vile clips seen in the film include the actual on-air news footage of a disgruntled husband shooting his news reporter wife to death live on Spanish television; a helpless and innocent pig who get's literally roasted to death in a slow and unbelievably sadistic fashion via a blow torch by a group of scientists obviously doing what would be considered now (and even back then) illegal animal experimentation; and a really gross and totally uncensored male-to-female sex-change operation that goes above and beyond anything you might have otherwise seen on TLC's infamous surgery shows!
This and the two aforementioned films have a dark freak-show like allure to them that as ashamed as I am to admit it now was what initially peaked my curiosity and eventually drew me to actually picking them up from my local mom-'n-pop movie store.
The story follows Brigitte, the more weird and less sexy of the two sisters from the first film who is now changing into a werewolf herself.
OK... i'm now a little more than half way through and i'm still clueless as to what it's all about...
AWARA PAAGAL DEEWANA was a hit at the BO so The makers decided to make DEEWANE HUYE PAAGAL, and with the now famous Akshay's comic timing there decided to make a copy of THERE's SOMETHING ABOUT MARY  Took Suneil, Paresh added Shahid, Rimii Sen  Made a commercial comedy film  The narrator act of Viveik that starts the film drowns it first only, luckily the film gets interesting with Akshay's entrance and then a few jokes are nice but then we have so many stupid scenes  A boring leading lady whom i doubt any guy of her age will also fall for Sorry Rimii, But why did the director choose her for the role that required someone damn hot and beautiful to explain people like Asrani falling for Budget constraints?
Plus there added another subplot of the evil Om Puri and his family especially Suresh Menon which makes the film boring  Too many cooks spoil the broth  Luckily the comic scenes between Akshay, Paresh make you laugh Second half gets nice but too lengthy The entire climax is so lengthy and uninviting, like a 70's climax The choosing of the right guy too is prolonged and boring  Vikram Bhatt does a good job in some comic scenes Music(Anu Malik) is good   Akshay steals the show and owns the film, He is the real star though now he has come a long way as an actor Suneil Shetty overdoes the limp bit but does well in some scenes Paresh Rawal is boring and too loud Shahid Kapur is boring in the lead, while Rimii Sen is pure teakwood with a dubbed voice Johny Lever is loud as usual Vijay Raaz is hilarious, Om Puri hams Suresh Menon irritates Asrani is alright
Ok ok enough of the silliness, I will now try and explain and summarize this hahahaha movhahahie.
Switch to present day and the monk, now in the persona of Father Seaton (get it, Seaton/Satan - oh how clever), oversees a large cult of followers.
The only Puppet Master film I have left to watch in the series now is Retro Puppet Master (1999) which I can't say I am particularly looking forward too.
Go to see it now, but donÂ´t forget to take a big glass of water before.
I imagine that now with those rockets flowing from the Gaza, no film company wants to go there.
I cannot believe that this is now going to be on DVD (as of 2/15/05) with "Wild In The Streets" - another retro stinker.
Only after viewing it, I now know why the familiarity crept into the recesses of my newly-awakened brain.
Upon being rescued these kids respond joyously with 'MICHAEL', knowing that they are now safe with the King of Pop.
For one, she has real hair now.
These werewolves have developed from the weird pink things they were before and now have fur, proper fangs and scary yellow eyes!
Despite being released on DVD by Blue Underground some five years ago, I have never come across this Italian "sword and sorcery" item on late-night Italian TV and, now that I have seen it for myself, I know exactly why.
now i'm not going to say this film is terrible but its not good in the slightest.
I though I'd seen the worst of the "8 Films to Die For" already but now that I've proved I haven't I think I'll just stop before I waste any more time on them.
Okay, by now we all know that the whole "Horrorfest 8 Films To Die For" thing was a shameless ploy.
They head out in an awesome van, run into a crazy old eccentric, and even pick up a crazy hitchhiker, before deciding to stay the night in a legendary 'Dark Ride', which is now being re-opened despite the fact that some nutjob murdered sixteen people there not even twenty years ago.
I was also able to say, "insert tedious cheap scare... now" and it would always happen.
I've seen some pathetically amateur films in recent times; up till now, 'San FranPsycho' took the cake as the worst.
I now consider it dethroned by this piece of crap.
I've been a member of IMDb for 10 years now.
I now know why.
I was able to tape it and view several more times now.
Because she got treated badly after she "came out" there's now almost this unwritten obligation and sense of right to applaud to everything she says and does.
What's happened in Ellen's case is that now her loving and devoted fans are mostly people who've been hurt themselves.
It all looks so silly now though.
The story follows Bridgette who after being bitten by her own sister on the last film is now also suffering the painful and slow process of becoming a werewolf.
Spielberg answered their calls, with a movie that set records, but is now nothing but a forgettable tale.
Lastly; how could Joe go back to 1985 and explain to the card dealer that the card he showed him before now is autographed.
When his parents tell him that he must return the card, in a fit of greed, Joe grabs his bicycle and pedals off to the local little league field, presumably now a runaway.
What's more he's become confident (due to the tutelage of the angelic Honus Wagner) and now hits a home run, helping his team win the championship and confound all the kids who've been heckling him as a wimp.
As it is now in CURTAINS, the cast includes Samantha Eggar and Linda Thornson, two capable actresses who weren't young things back in 1983.
DeSantis had been conducting research on a series of shark attacks in the area prior to his death and now his friend, along with DeSantis' sister, takes up the research and finds that the sharks may not be the only threat in Port Amanzi.
Casper Van Dien, last seen battling giant bugs in STARSHIP TROOPERS, now gets to take on sharks in the aptly named SHARK ATTACK.
At the end, after someone smashes her car back window, Rose has an epiphany and drives back home and while a long-dry spring gushes to life, Rose gushes about how she's now Cecilia's 'REAL mother!'
The plot as you all must have gathered by now is that well trodden path of parent and child swapping bodies and all the pranks and pitfalls that they have to deal with (oh how we laugh!).
Then there's the obligatory twist, now I will admit I usually am rubbish at guessing twist's but the two main ones that crop up at the end of The Fear Chamber are two of the most obvious plot twist's ever.
Watching "L.L" now, you can almost picture the haze of pot smoke and LSD trips the creators and writers of this show must have gotten their ideas from!
Truly a time capsule of the late 60s/early 70s, thank goodness that it's now preserved for posterity on DVD!
As he heads back to the mound, he is now destined not to blow the game at all.
A thoroughly hideous experience, gave me a severe migraine, and remembering it now sickens me.
Here we are now in 2008,exactly 10 years after, while i'm searching strange movies on IMDb for a good laugh,that this ''movie'' appears to my memories again and a long chill goes through my spine.
It's now nearly 20 years since it was made, but my two daughters can still recite the entire dialog, and we still "crack-up" when we think about it!!!
But now I look back on this and all of the no limit stuff that I liked and I wanted to...starve myself for 5 days as punishment.
I have 3 lines to burn now so I'm gonna use them bad mouthing other no limit movies.
Horrible friggin' movie I didn't like that movie when I 1st saw it and i now haaaate it.
He now has visions that reveal things from both the past and the future.
Johnny now has the ability to freeze-frame a vision and walk around in it.
Johnny's physical therapist, who has a few lines in one scene of the movie, now becomes a full-blown character Â a wise-ass, dreadlocked sidekick played by John L. Adams, whose every quip is more tedious than the last.
This left the director with no option but to bore us nearly to death with an extended replay of those scenes they had already coaxed from the naive but now wiser Miss Argento.
It has been a while since I have see Mantan Moreland yelling "Feets don't fail me now," but I certainly expected it to come out of the mouth of Dayana Jamine, who played the sister of one of the Black gang members like Moreland.
This is an absurd attempt to cash in by ex-scenesters who are, in all likelihood, now in nursing homes.
Anyway, now you have two sexually frustrated men vying for the same, once pretty "Bride of Frankenstein" - and, they don't care how she looks anymore!
The concept of putting together body parts is a contemporary consideration because we are now able to achieve this.
John Cleese's rabbit teeth were hilarious but by far the two most hilarious parts of the film were the look on Brannagh's face when the monster tells him to meet him up on the ice in a few days (he's thinking why not do it now????)
I do now.
Hungarian film-making had glorious times about 50 years earlier, but it is just struggling now.
The opening shot is of a desolate post-apocalyptic world with what were once our cities but are now crumbling ruins, a lawless world where acid rain falls from the sky & the strong prey on the weak.
Ryuken talks of a school of martial arts named the Southern Cross, the flag of the Southern Cross is now the fearful symbol of a new order.
I don't really know what Canadian anxieties are right now.
But I think Grant's charismatic-stutterer shtick is wearing a bit thin by now.
Pity the poor cast, most of them respected actors, who must now find this idiocy forever on their resumes.
There are a million movies around like this and I happen to be a fan of predictable romantic comedies(if their good) but I found the characters and humor very weak and even though the movie's not DECADES old or anything it looks dated now, especially the hairstyles.
It's getting dark-- now what do you do?
It is now an obsession, an obsession that consumes your entire life.
Time and space are altered a bit; every now and then time will inexplicably slow down.
It's been a couple of years now since I saw this astounding film for the first (only) time; actually, I don't think I'll ever quite recover from the experience.
So now I feel terrified that this 'cult' has the influence to finance and convince Hollywood to waste so much money.
And so I can now tell anyone who's interested: You must see this movie yourself to realize the sheer magnitude of its badness, stupidity, and ineptitude.
I just so it on DVD now.
I hear its has been on the shelf for over 2 years in the US and is currently being released overseas...now I hear Lions Gate has picked up and it is going STRAIGHT TO DVD!!
Finally, in the end, Jack gets his journal back, threatens to call the cops (duh), takes back the wife who's cuckolded him, and quits his business so he can now live life again (something that would have been forced upon him had Ling published her story).
I'm actually feeling very angry now at wasting 1.5 hrs of my life on this.
I remember bullying my then-boyfriend (now husband, in spite of my demonstrably bad taste in movies by wanting to even SEE this) to go see this in '76 when it first came out.
Every now and then some breasts are bared to perk things up but a better script would have been more helpful.
There's a fair amount of gunplay, with the by now banal slow motion deaths, but even the action sequences lack fire.
First of all Maria Conchita Alonso is a famous for just being famous, but she is NOT a good actress or worst yet she is not an actress And I don't get Kuno Becker I never liked him when he used to do telenovelas and I don't like him now, he's not handsome or talented or nothing at all.
It was cool when Spielberg did it in Jaws, but now every talentless director thinks it'll give his film suspense, but it's just irritating.
And now there's going to be another full moon in 15 days?
And of course, special effects that were considered "state-of-the-art" back then, look more than a little cheesy now.
She's just as beautiful as ever, but now she's a girl with something extra...a tumor on the back of her neck that's growing at an alarming rate.
A short outline of the plot would make no sense here, and now that I think of it, a long outline would make even less sense so I won't attempt it.
He turns to an old pal, a mystic played by Stevens (in Light Egyptian makeup and a curly, chestnut brown fright wig) and her husband (played by former child star, now rotund and bearded, Corcoran.)
I can hardly remember the movie now.
For years, I've read of this soft-porn parody of Flash Gordon since it was advertised as one of several midnight movies listed as being at the (now defunct) Cinema 8 at the (also folded) Bon Marche Mall.
While I've had it on tape for years, I've only now gotten to seeing it.
Fitz reminds me quite a bit of Dr. House, especially now that show has lost it's sense of humor as well as the cast and formula that made it great.
shes completely changed except for the fact shes still a werewolf, and is now an independent woman with some "problems" but soon after passing out in a snowbank from an overdose of monkshood is taken into a drug clinic and the story begins there.
And now?
You used to be one major influence on my political education, and now ... (sorry, it'll get ugly now but you asked for it) you abandoned all self-esteem and present yourself as the "brainless bimbo", that all the white racist-pigs tend to see in your skin; are you fraggin' out of your mind?
Your sound was a vision, your records my gyro, you aborted the mission, now you're channel zero!
MTV influenced a whole generation - now THIS generation you want to make their minds mush.
Well, a friend of the owners does what we would now call a corporate take-over--and then he does a make-over on Betty and she becomes a big musical comedy star--but wait--it is more complicated than that!
now if it was wire fighting, it would've been better (like yuen woo pings movies).
As of right now, this movie is only marginally below Ghostbusters 2 in its overall score.
But "you're fired" or "you're hired", for how many seasons now?
But now with season 5?
In the earlier seasons they used to put a lot more emphasis on the business-related tasks - now the focus is mostly in the boardroom where the contestants are expected to do EVERYTHING to keep them on the show (that means lying, trash-talking, backstabbing etc.).
In earlier seasons at least some of the contestants had a bit of integrity, now it seems like the contestants would kill their own mother to keep them on the show.
The Apprentice was once a great TV-show, but now it's just a big fat joke.
I had never heard of this film because I'm 100% positive it did not get onto screens in the UK and now i see why!
Death by house spiders some how i don't think so now lets face it its never going to happen so why try to make it seem as if it is something that could happen in day to day life?
So now they have number 3, and here is what they have done.
yeah i know, now you'll say: where's the story in that?
The motivation of the human killer near the end is revealed, and well, let's just say he's lived 30 years out in the open, not hiding the fact that he was Mary's prom date, so why now all of a sudden is scared?
Everyone knows she is dead, everyone knows he was her prom date, but it all got swept under the rug for some reason, but now all of a sudden he's willing to kill to keep a secret that has never been a secret?
At some point you think someone would've stopped and said, "Hey, this is absolute crap, we should stop right now and quit movies forever."
The review said "good acting, plot, cared about the characters, check it out".. but holy crap, now I think it was all tongue-in-cheek.
So I understand that someone died during post-production, now I'm sorry for this loss, but seriously, don't use that as an excuse to pass off this movie as a good B-Movie.
About the only saving grace is that every now and again you can see something, a faint hope... and I'm not sure if it's a glimmer of respect from one Zombie movie fan to another... a tip of the hat to the genre by stealing ideas from other, greater zombie films that shows through from the screen.
We see Lucy Loveless who plays the lead seemingly drive to Indiana with the redeemed dastardly scientist ( who BTW daughter was attacked by locust and is now in a coma)from the DC area in warp speed time to warn her father who I guess does not have a radio or TV but has have a super sleek cell phone that the bugs are coming straight for him!
They are now carnivorous!
Twenty years later the prison is now a womens' penitentiary.
Xaviera Hollander, famous hooker and now magazine magnate (oh sure) gets summoned to Washington for a trial about indecency involving...well, does it really matter?
if you want to see a film that is really bad then see this now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
more seriously now, this is truly one of the worst films ever.1/2*
This movie actually contains lines such as: "I'm pregnant and hormonal, now land this 'copter".
It's now' Turin, Today' & a prostitute named Angela (Barbara Lerici) refuses to comply with her clients disgusting demands & in her hurry to leave their apartment knocks over a table out of which falls some large dangerous looking knives & a blue folder which she accidentally puts into her bag in her rush.
The current Chief Inspector, Manni (Paolo Maria Scalondro) is on the case, he talks with the now retired Moretti about the dwarf murders but finds out little except that the man thought responsible Vincenzo De Fabritiis (Luca Faglioli) committed suicide.
Giacomo (Stefano Dionisi) now lives in Rome but receives a phone call from an old friend named Lorenzo (Roberto Zibetti) who tells him that the dwarf murders may have started again.
Well, I guess we can see why he's on TV now, the steam started to run out in his film career.
But, now it's stupid, rotten and dirty.
Getting it out right now, this film is completely lame..and basks in it's absurdity.
The two of them become very close, almost like sisters even, but now Brigitte has a bigger problem, another werewolf has been stalking her and now he wants to mate.
It also stars many noticeable by face but not by name actors/actresses, such as Lorie Griffin, whose character would make it seem that she actually accomplished boning her brains out in "Teen Wolf", and now can't tell sarcasm or an insult if you slap her in the face with it.
I feel like I just woke up from a bad dream and now I'll spend the rest of my evening confused and trying to figure it out.
Wall,coming on the scene to put the cuffs on the now crazed and hysterical Mottram.
Rest of cast is OK, with Daniel BrÃ¼hl again a brilliant stand out; the man's just got it, presence, you now what I mean.
It's a bomb in Germany and now I know why!
If you want a twisted plot, there are probably a dozen films a year now coming out with better ones, and that includes European and independent films.
Ex-low life (now nicknamed "Jimmy the Saint") Andy Garcia plans 'one final job' for mobster Christopher Walken.
Walken tells Garcia that his crew will now be -- get this -- "buckwheats."
I could go on for hours about how bad this movie is, and what a waste of acting talent, but I'll stop now.
It's bad enough we have our hands full in the Middle East, but now the U.S. Department of Agriculture has its hands full with locusts.
Are we supposed to think that he's some kind of stand-up guy now?
Unfortunately, what it really was was Raimi demonstrating that he had run out of ideas that he could call his own, and was now getting his repertoire fed to him by the most disingenuous money-men of the industry.
Well, I hope it was fun to shoot, I'm happy for all the folks who got their start on this project, and I hope they all got paid real good - can I have my two hours back, now?
It also seems that all the new students that lives in the "asylum" has had some issues in their earlier lives, and now the doctor has come back to "cure" them.
Now, in modern time, the building is now a college dorm.
Mark and Bryon now swear like sailors.
The class I work with will be posting their replies soon, so I now give you their unjaded opinions.
007 is still going strong with many actors who now have done the role and it shows no signs of slowing down.
Yet another reason to hate technology--infesting the movies now with cell phones to eat up the scenery.
The only Puppet Master film I have left to watch in the series now is Retro Puppet Master (1999) which I can't say I am particularly looking forward too.
This was just a poor ripoff at a time when poor ripoffs weren't as common as now.
It actually looks a lot like that other film of his, "06", only the protagonists are now face-to-face, while "06" exclusively featured two people talking over the phone.
She is now falling in love with Farley Granger (in an unbecoming mustache.)
Well that seems to be the case considering it had an incredibly small theatrical release and now it appears Lionsgate is just dumping hordes of the movies at video stores in hopes of salvaging the production costs.
This is a rip-off of FearDotCom and another film which I can't think of the name right now.
OK, the acting is good, the direction superb and all the music numbers are great (especially "Maybe This Time" and "Mein Herr"), but the movie is depressing (the Nazis slowly taking power), overlong, and the sexual politics are VERY dated (having bisexuality a subject of a musical was revolutionary in 1972--now it's old hat).
Now I know they had to get rid of the kids from the first two, because as you can see Wednesday who was played by Christina Ricci in the first two is now an adult, making movies like Sleeping Hollow.
Uncle Fester who in the first 2 was played by Christopher LLoyd(and brilliantly may I add), now they have some hyper active freak who goes around yelling and screaming like a two year old doing stupid pranks...It was then that it hit me, this new movie was not intended to be a sequel to the previous two.
But in this one, we are greeted to a wonderful film picking up exactly where the first one left off: now with Bridget trying to stop herself from becoming a werewolf, and escaping from the rehab center she has been placed in.
The cast now has several male staffers working in an all-girl rehab center, leading to such activities as trading sexual favors for drugs.
Hollywood filmmakers LOVE tacking this moral onto their corny action epics, and apparently it doesn't bother them that if society never changed, we'd still be in caves right now eating raw deer carcasses.
By now, Anderson has to be a complete idiot to not see that his wife is suicidal.
Naturally nobody believes that the doll murdered anybody (Andy's mother is now institutionalised for backing her son's story up in court) but they do believe that Andy was somehow disturbed by his Good Guy doll ÂChucky'.
Unfortunately the spirit of Charles aka Chucky is still resident and he once again resumes his quest to regain a human body, which puts the now fostered Andy in trouble once again.
Chuck is back and still after Andy is now placed in a foster home after the tragic events of the first film since his mother was committed.
Andy soon find out that chucky is back and up to no good, of course he tell in his forester parents that doll is alive, yet again now one believes him, There some deaths scene that not gory and not even little bit scary and two of death scene are off-screen.
Small wonder that he now does gay porn.
He doesn't mind, though, because now he can finally fight back against his domineering mother, the school bullies and all the girls that rejected and laughed at him.
I'm actually at a loss right now because I don't know if this or Boogeyman is worse.
Well, now you do.
Basically, anything that was good about the first Pumpkinhead movie is now taken out so you can be amazed out how simple the plot is and how uninspired.
The UN didn't fare any better in their minds in 1952 than it does now.
Though not publicized at the time, we now know from proved incidents such as No Gun-Ri (There was more than one eye-witness, and the only dispute is over the number killed) that such atrocities did occur on our side as well as the enemy's.
However, by now, the sites are very familiar.
In fact,we're lucky it was made before gays took over; most films now have to have at least one gay scene, no matter how stupid.
There are some scenes in this film that are definitely not for the squeamish--the first brain scene is just the tip of the iceberg in this kind of imagery, so either brace yourself or click it off now.
Mowatt, played by Pavan Grover who also had a hand in writing the script, is brought to a horrible prison run by a crazy, psychotic, and also sadistic, warden, played beautifully by Dennis Hopper - who has done so many of these kinds of roles he can probably do them in his sleep by now.
I understand the CIA is going to be using this movie to interrogate suspects now.
With that in mind, it feels obvious now that a sequel was always going to appear.
So although McCloud was originally born in Scotland and Ramierez in er, Egypt, now they were aliens from a planet called Zeist; handy, because this new ancestry meant that all that was needed to reengergise the concept was that another visitor showed up on Earth and the games can begin again.
That's the way the rot spread but here's where it started - now please Hollywood...never again.
If you haven't figured it out by now, HIGHLANDER II is completely messed-up.
I honestly dislike the show so much now that I can't even let my TV be on AS while i am doing something else.
now that's a real shame.
This doesn't sit well with their brother who now lives in the city and is the real source of money for the family.
Fosse's delegacy lives on...on film, and on stage right now in London, Berlin, and New York where the CABARET revival, did I mention CHICAGO?, and FOSSE, the musical- based on his life- including a piece from the movie of Cabaret continue to dazzle new generations.
A lot of vaudeville comics who spoke a mile a minute were shoved in front of the cameras to take advantage of the fact that audiences could now hear the actors speak.
Oh, and I bet it would be artsy if we insert a scene where Jack and Meg White (they're hot right now - they have that hit new album that in retrospect no one really liked that much, but they wanted to like it to be alternative and artsy - oh, there's that artsy thing again) are playing with a Tesla Coil.
Well by now I have really gotten over it.It doesn't matter anymore because the film works so well without the other songs,I feel it has everything essential from the stage version,which I have never even seen btw,yet anyway.
This is not your typical musical.It is made in a very realistic way,so there is no sudden singing like normally in musicals.Almost all the songs are performed in the Kit Kat club and they add to the seedy atmosphere there.Thinking about it now this was a good choice.It allows you to really focus on the characters and their development...as a realistic drama Cabaret is wonderful.
An on screen caption now informs us that it's '25 Years Later'.
Precisely why Jesse has decided to move in now is unclear to me, I mean wouldn't the house have changed hands or had new owners in the space of 25 years?, but once again I'm really not bothered in the slightest bit so just accept it.
Plot has to do with another house, this one with Aztec-influenced architecture, also with other-dimensional passages now and then.
Don't waste your money or time on releases of this guy, he's just not capable to deliver anything interesting now or in the future but is a loudmouth playing around with big topics like Japanese Unit 731.
Think about Haneke films, some other films that have been interpreted as a criticism of middle class, upper class or bourgeoisie, city life, suburban life, family institution and think about some horror movies which have been seen in the same way which has become a trend now.
Joel Grey's raunchy "Two Ladies" on the Kit Kat stage to the hysterical delight of the decadent crowd reminds us that all sexual propriety has broken down (including in the lives of the main characters, now involved in a threeway with one of the few Germans who still has some wealth intact).
if you want to see a film that is really bad then see this now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
more seriously now, this is truly one of the worst films ever.1/2*
We mistreated prisoners, we disrespected customs and traditions, and we could have made a heck of a lot better job that what we have done up until now.
All three series have now been turned into movies, none of which have been given a theatrical release.
One more thing that was good about this movie: the fact that it's now over and I can get on with my life.
THis movie is the worst comedy I have seen except for dirty love now that was worse but this movie goes right along with it and jenna jameson is not good at comedy she should stick to being in porn because it does not take much acting skills.
Disney has been making what they call "original" movies now for some time.
That makes no real sense at all... but so now the sect are the bad guys, right.
Director Mathieu Kassovitz has been in the business for a while now and is a well complete actor as well and still something about this project went wrong.
But we have Babylon A.D. now, a lot of my co-workers at my theater warned me that it was pretty bad, but like I said, some people just judge too harshly, I just wanted to see it for myself.
I liked William Devane in 'Marathon Man' & 'Testament', but come on now!
now my comment on this, isn't gonna reflect much on how Stephen king did it, more on what he stole from the original, for Gods Sake Even Dr. Stegman's ending line is ripped off to the core, just replacing Danes with Maine.
It seems to me now that it would have been easy enough with some different placements of the single robot and clever editing to make it appear that as if there were many of them.
The entire city has been evacuated and is now occupied by indestructible robots who kill people and repulse the military with unknown rays -- yet they'll be watching every street corner for some nobody who killed a hooker!
Poor old RKO was reduced to being a craftsmanship studio making (now funny) trash by this stage and barely made any films in this period that have lasted because of quality.
And now we have another.
Hamlet, now ensconced in the Elsinore Hotel, grieving for his father, is appalled by the marriage of his mother to his uncle, and moreover, with such haste; but it is done, and there is nothing he can do about it.
I see no reason whatever to watch this thing unless it's playing on Joe Bob's MonsterVision (poor Joe Bob will have to shoulder the whole job of junk-embellishment himself, now that MST3K is gone).
VHS is really a sad medium for film now.
When the race is half over, the girl back at the starting line jumps into an Allard and somehow catches up to the Jags, by which time the Allard has changed color twice, and gained a spare tire on first the right side, then the left, then the right again, and now it has portholes in the side, definitely not the same Allard she started with.
I now believe that part of horror history to be over.
I actually suspected Penn of being the killer for a while- so right away, I didn't question why/how he was at the Depot- then after he was killed, I now wonder how/why he was there.
That is, until now.
i predict the IMDb rating to drop from 7.7 as of right now to well below 5 as more people seeing the film and give their honest ratings.
So Cate calls on Murphy to assist in saving the day and while the chemistry between the two was so good in the original '48 Hours,' something is now wrong.
It seems that Hammond, who is STILL in jail, is now a target.
I love you to death will never be my favoroite movie but knowing what I do now I can say it's an interesting one(I just wish I'd known the true facts when I saw this years ago).  
It was so bad , I'm posting this now, because the memory has never left me some 12?
She was cute and bubbly in a minor role in the original, got recognized for her performance and now has much bigger part.
Fairly desperate sequel to 1992's "Sister Act" has one-time lounge singer Whoopi Goldberg now a big attraction in Las Vegas, but called back to the convent by those kooky nuns to help bring order to a school full of rebellious teenagers.
The government is now building robots, including prostitution robots, combat robots and so on.
now i know i sound like a teenager, but i usually like this stuff.
"uncle joe" "i think ill leave now"  are you kidding?
Nothing was said about Canadians sending their slaves to what is now Michigan (then still held by Britain) to avoid emancipation.
0 out of 10 for this, and by now known reputation, anything else the writer might involve himself with.
Basically, the film wants to drop us into the same spot where we are now, but following a Confederate victory one hundred and forty years before.
With several of the principals either dead or turned into vampires at the end of "Rape," we now enter the second segment "The Queen of the Vampires."
The cast dependably ricocheted around this range of freaks who can now vie for the camera as the most aggrieved; the schlep lawyer Howard K. Stern, the horrifyingly shallow, stupid and (spiritually) ugly Bobby Trendy, and that flunky, lesbian apprentice.
Then you learn that not only did your best friend go through the windshield and die, but he had advanced AIDS and since he bled all over you, now you do too.
let's now come to talk about the branding...
Being out of the loop I did not know about this movie until now.
OK now let's allow the movie some artistic license.
Course it might be that his sister is now playing.
One of the posters said the film tells the truth; the only "truth" is the pack of lies Dougherty has been peddling for over 50 years in interviews, books, and now this movie.
Maybe re-cutting this movie and adding better scenes would do a lot of healing but for now its just not good.
From the 1st season to now, great show!
Maybe re-cutting this movie and adding better scenes would do a lot of healing but for now its just not good.
What they have now is simply a montage with no insight and nothing new to say.
Directed by Stephen Frears I will openly admit right here & now that Mary Reilly bored me stiff, I honestly wanted to switch it off & go to sleep but in the fairness of this comment I decided to endure the final 40 minutes.
This show is now my favorite show on TV right now!!
The original characters are slowly fading away now and it really isn't worth watching.
Consequently, this can also give a general outline of the plots for several years to come from now.
Neighbours the show that has lost its way well where to begin, well we had so many good story lines from plane crashes to evil twin brothers but now the show has gone downhill.
first off most of the new people on the street like Marco are simply boring where as Bridget is just annoying to the point where you wish the show was cancelled.hopefully the show will pick up again if they bring back evil Paul,Connor, Stu, and get rid of Marco, Didge, all the people who are involved in a storyline with Marco and Ringo as well for good measure.well that's all i have to say really i used to love this show but now it really has just begun to annoy me.
That we did watch it has to do with the fact that transmission is poor right now where we are living in paradise and there's only one channel and this is all that was on.
Well...It has past eleven years since this movie was made and I decided to comment it now.
Burke kisses his girlfriend, his one eye'd black companion is put in an ambulance (fortunatly the gun wound directly to his heart is now on his stomach so he'll probably live).
Looking at the message board on this page several people are asking when this film was released while people who've actually seen THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY are now asking why it was released .
Having now watched it on Belgian (French)TV it's like having watched it on a 'plane ("free" in a kind of way) but I'd never pay to see it...
But i held on and now i can scream it freely.
I know we all have to start somewhere, and Milius was probably a little hormone crazed from eating raw dead animals in the tradition of any good American conservative, but, come on now!
The people who seem to have loved this movie, most of whom are now right wing Republicans, probably saw this movie as a boys wet dream of being an action hero and saving his country.
And yet Milius went on to be a screen writer for the movie apocalypse now.
Nothing really works that well, while watching it last night I just thought it was a collection of seemingly random incidents stringed together & you never get to know any of the character's, in fact I couldn't really name them now as I couldn't really tell them apart.
The animals seem to meander around the city mindlessly, dodging two very thick men working for illegal testing labs and two incredibly irritating strays (one of whom dubiously has a voice uncannily similar to Mike Tyson), team up with a gang of other misanthrope strays now and again (even more insufferable with some of the awful garbagy lines spouted out), and in general, the film doesn't seem to know what to do with itself, because as we all know, since these animals successfully navigated an entire wilderness for miles and miles last time, a city would be pretty small potatoes!
"Plot" now simply lurches from one incomprehensible sequence to the next and makes no sense.
But whom am i to assume... At least now i know we live on a peach which will be burned by a flamethrower.
Brigitte now has the virus in her blood that destroyed her sister Ginger in the first film.
Which now she has become so attached to the syrup and without it, the affects of the curse starts to transform within her.
Joe Spinnel (now deceased), Caroline Munro, Tom Savini, all ought to be ashamed of their participation in this immoral dungheap of a film.
Russ has dug himself a neat little hole and now he doesn't have any money.
The only thing I want to know now is how such a brilliant mind, such as Travolta undoubtedly has, can learn to fly an airplane?
And "Double Team" pretty much signaled that Hollywood had run out of things to do with him, that his fan base and audience was pretty much played out, and that every VD film from now on would be a retread or a derivative, 2nd rate mishegoss.
Three major directors had made a shot at bringing him into the mainstream ("Hard Target", "Time Cop", and "Sudden Death"), and Van Damme had been decent-to-excellent in all of them...but all those directors had moved on and Van Damme was now back to making "B" movie fodder.
Presumed-dead-to-the-world and now banished to this shadowy island paradise called "The Colony," Quinn recovers but is made a permanent resident of The Colony along with dozens of other agents who are "too valuable to kill, too dangerous to let loose" (or something similar).
The guy who once was the Clown has retired after his girlfriend was killed in action, but now it's time for him to take his costume out of the vault, put on the smelly rubber mask again and kick some bad butt.
Come on now people, some of the characters portray high school characteristics in their personalities but they are obviously more intelligent than that.
Blythe Danner can act, but she must have been dealing with some personal issues during this movie (probably working on her clone, the one we now call Gwenyth).
We see Allen then and Allen now.
For some reason I liked this film when I was young, but now I can't imagine why.
Of course, now when I see 1980's pictures and see those fashions and hear that music, I'm always amused because I think, "I actually lived through that."
Fashions come and go, however, and I doubt they would have a fan on the planet now.
There must have been cinema-goers, like me now for instance, who might have been tempted to see the film just for the lady but I feel it has to be admitted that their really was an audience for this stuff in the late 70s.
Well that seems to be the case considering it had an incredibly small theatrical release and now it appears Lionsgate is just dumping hordes of the movies at video stores in hopes of salvaging the production costs.
This is a rip-off of FearDotCom and another film which I can't think of the name right now.
Pam, admits that she is very angry and resentful of Kathy when she first moves into their home, but now, 18 years later, she loves her and can't imagine life without her.
Enter Denise, the woman Brian has met in his Ph.d classes--Brian the psychologist wannabe who tells his aging mother whom he blames for his need to have a variety of sexual partners "You can call me doctor, now."
I'm betting twenty or thirty years from now, it will still seem up-to-date and probably still relevant.
This is supposed to be a kids film -I don't need to explain to my four-year old niece why Spot is now a middleÂaged man hitting on moms and shacked up in some sleazy motel- if they wanted "edgy" then they should have pitched it to Matt Stone.
The show started out broodingly edgy and is now a faint shadow of its former self with the team now seeming more like the Scooby Gang than the hard-bitten original version.
I'm actually surprised I haven't heard of it until now.
- If she did, walking around her home town would be a whole lot harder than it is now.
But Columbo has sneaked the King of Suari into a neighboring room to eavesdrop, and the King tells Elizondo he will now be sent back to Suari to face Suari justice.
I could probably best describe this as a deranged orgasm in the form of a movie, if that makes sense, because I'm telling you now this movie doesn't.
However, I was quite looking forward to watching this film, but now wish I hadn't bothered.
(My dad the dental historian says the perfect smile is an American conceit that's being exported around the world now as a status symbol.)
I can easily imagine that mainstream film-audiences will absolutely loath this film, but I'm a giant fanÂand Araki can be sure of the fact that his film already built up a cult-following by now.
It's difficult to know why the CBC chose to re-air the film now.
- Sorry to only answer your posting now, but I've only recently become aware of all this 'stuff' on "Kill and Kill Again," on which I was the cinematographer and helped get the martial artists for the movie, since i knew them all.... You are right.
Why is that person OK now?
This has been going on for some years now.
I want to re-watch PROPHECY now.
The "I've never been with a woman and now I'm going to die a virgin" line at the end of the movie didn't make sense.
Just awful, I now know how Alan King died!
If director Donald Jones would have been capable of gloriously depicting all the rancidness he suggests in the script (including rape, torture, necrophilia and incest), then "Schoolgirls in Chains" indeed would have been a genuine exploitation classic, but now it's just a mildly offensive & amusingly inept 70's trash-gem.
It's like some surreal time frame now, everyone smokes fags, Askwith is unintentionally racist with "Blackbird" (their listing's not mine!)
Only problem is, their rooster buddy has now discovered a new talent for harmonising Elvis Presley-type rock tunes, and his new manager won't let him go because the old miser has been rolling it in cold hard cash ever since.
Who's the villain now, huh?
I can't explain it, but even now the thought of a tiny owl running around with weapons made out of can-openers and shouting "ANNIHILATION" is hilarious to me.
And by that I mean the now almost countless bad TV shows with directors who think shaking the camera at everything is cute.
Her only memorable aspect in this film is her Ralph Lauren clothes, now of course quite dated, which supposedly caused a fashion revolution at the time.
I guess I know what happened to all of the bad acid in the 60's now, these idiots ate it and decided to make a movie revolving around a witch trying to seduce a young virgin into having fantasy sex adventures.
my father contrasted it to world war ii when the vets came home to a hero's welcome and star treatment as opposed to what vets come home to now.
I wont get into the fundamental differences between now and then, not that it isn't painfully obvious, but it is true that vets coming home today do not get that same treatment.
All this was, was a "remembering" the war and how screwed up life is now for them.
It means more to us now since the passing of Richard!!
We've given him like ten years of paycheck roles now; it's time for him to stop phoning it in.
", you have ask, "are they really just joking"... Richard Pryor, who has now left us, should be so proud of this movie, his comedy is rare and so well timed.
Years later I watched it again and I now thing it's one of the best comedies out.
now she plans to frame Dick and Ingrid for her ruthless crime.
Silly little subtitles tell us that Dr.Hess Greene was stabbed and now has a craving for blood.
Still with no clues, Diamond brings in the 96 suspects in Brown's organization for questioning (funny how Brown's 'organization' really seems to consist only of Joe McClure, the gangster wannabe now demoted to gopher, and two gay thugs, Fante and Mingo (more about that in a minute).
She met him 2 hours ago, took an order of burgers and beer from him, helped him clean up a mess on the floor and now she loves him.
I could go get my video camera right now, go outside and get a few friends together and make a movie better than Legion of the Dead.
`Legion of the Dead' was my first movie directed by Olaf Ittenbach and I can't say I'll immediately purchase his other achievements now.
Every now and then, Ittenbach shows slight signs of ingeniousness through black humor, but the wholesome really stinks.
now i'm very disappointed.
"A Perfect Murder" is an excellent example of this, as the number of devious characters is increased and the body count is higher, and the denouement which in the original saw a wily police detective resolve matters now has one of those endings in which the heroine puts herself in danger.
while part of the acting is fine, and the snakes are semi believable (not outragiously huge) the speed with which the victims die is too exagerated, and it is almost identical to the old movie "Rattler" that is now makign the rounds of network tv movie filler during reruns seasons.
I can only assume that other commentators saw a different take from the one now serving as my coffee-coaster.
Even now, I can still hardly believe how bad it really is.
I do regret however watching again now, many years later, and finally seeing the truth of what this film really is.
This is almost like one of those creaky old Charlie Chan mysteries (the cheaper Monogram studio versions) with lots of red herrings & oddball characters (like the old ex-senator with the checkered past who is now a recluse) & loads of people getting killed over objets d'art that you wouldn't look twice at in the mall.
They may seem awful now, but you were there, and it felt good.
That angel face is gone, her face is so inexpressive now.
Chevy is great at dry humor and modestly scores with a one-liner now and then, but the film just doesn't make it as one of those good comedies that you'd like to watch every so often with a big bowl of popcorn.
I forgot to mention that, but by now you probably assumed that as a given.
Then there is the music: it's the music I love, the music I listened to in my 20s but I am now 44.
Also, revenge-filled,lead-females simply don't sell...look a Jodie Foster's movie, The Brave One...studios aren't touching this genre right now.
When Ricky escapes he goes for the Mother Superior, who is supposed to be the same as in the first film, but now she looks completely different and resembles Two-Face from Batman.
She's now a murderer for whom we MUST feel sympathy.
The great awfulness starts in the beginning, where preacher man from the last movie has SOMEHOW gone back in time and is now not on the guillotine where he ended movie #3 but is walking down a passageway to the guillotine.
Lots of driving and stuff happens as they're going to some caves where all the Christians live now waiting for Jesus.
While it's always amusing to see Bronson Pinchot attempting to make Eddie Murphy corpse on camera, the fact that a homosexual coffee house owner has now become an arms dealer shows how events frequently serve the plot rather than any form of logistical sense.
Now there were conscientious objectors but these were normally people with a conscience about taking part in war.James Mason is one example.However the ideas and views put forward by Powers character would not have been current in the later part of 1940.By that time this country was fighting on its own in a life and death struggle.Chamberlain had resigned and Churchill was now PM.There was an all party coalition government not a National Conservative government.Hitlers peace feelers had been rebuffed and with the blitz there was now no go back.So the anti war sentiments put forward in the film are totally unbelievable as is Powers character.This film may have been a big success in its day but now looks very dated.
According to all the char dev up to now, McD should have punched McS's hand off his shoulder.
Up to now, Addy would have looked McS off in disgust, not challenged him to a duel or believed that would make any difference or thought she might get back with him.
Craig Sheffer delivers a bland performance as the hero, a former airplane pilot who became a technician/engineer after a flying accident and now has a chance to redeem himself.
So after the initial disappointment of the first Final Fantasy movie, which seemed to bare next to no resemblance to the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy: Advent Children has released itself to a warm reception and, now, a dedicated fanbase.
the graphics and animation are excellent and its nice to see the whole gang in CG form Sephiroth's still cool  now the reasons it only got a 4 well the characters feel like planks of wood with some of the worst voice acting I've ever seen(I've watched epic movie)  the movie just seems cloud orientated so much so that it make even the fans embarrassed with cloud this and cloud that.
And now, the plot.
I had thought that we were passed this by now.
Yeah, now, picture that, but with Sephiroth.
So now Cloud must save the day from these guys.
(now i remember the lifestream in the game, but it did not have resurrecting properties, if it did, they could have brought aeris back to life, thus making a completely different story) so cloud is brought back to life and everyone has a party and dives into the pool and we have a ultra cheezy hallmark/ lifetime type moment.
Yes, you heard me Dublin has relocated to the North of Ireland and is now roughly where Belfast is.
But everyone should know one thing by now - no one should distort a Mani Ratnam product.
If you are now encouraged to see this movie, watch for the way the camera meaningfully mimics and follows the act as if the viewer is there and sharing the experience of the scene.
'oh, oh, now the kid goes to play with the poisonous snakes after his mother just warned him about it!
Cheapening an already cheap shot of a film even further, we must now sit through "curtain calls" of the actors as they appear, smiling, in the doorway of the Penmark's apartment.
I now come to the one redeeming feature.
The current postmodern hero archetype is Willis in the "Die Hard" narrative -- the ironic hero now has to face off with fully dimensional villains.
Most studios now invest in getting the perceived 'best villain', and all other considerations form a line behind that.
But, now to sit there for 103 minutes, guts churning and bubbling was bad enough, But to have the Duke insult my intelligence in the last three seconds, of what I figured out in the first ten minutes: "Don't Rob Banks!
The British atrocities in the 1950s against the Kikuyu, whose entire population they put into concentration camps, was only slightly less brutal than Germany's prelude to the Holocaust in early 20th century Southwest Africa (now Namibia), which led to the genocide of the Herero.
Lisa Morton and Brett Thompson have also given us a dodgy script with little interest and beyond stupid (I mean one of those "Thralls" had snake thingos come out of her boobs, now that's just plain dumb).
Does every Indian now living in San Francisco have a history blighted by parricide!?
So if you haven't seen it yet, go see it right now.
Halloweeen: Resurrection with webcams, Jason X in the future, a 3-D Nightmare on Elm Street, and now Pinhead in cyberspace?
And yet in this eighth sequel, Rick Bota; also known as the dude who doesn't allow the Hellraiser franchise to die peacefully; presents Hellraiser now as a popular internet game that has nerdy followers and organizes secret parties in isolated mansions.
BUT there was one who managed to be not only the most frightening of the bunch, but actually never managed to caveÂ until now, that is.
The whole "you dared to open the box, we came, now you'll be tortured for all eternity" is gone.
And it seems like the sex scenes are completely gratuitous now, they no longer serve the plot, they just move a character from one room to the other.
It's been three films now and there might yet be more in the offing.
Leigh Lewis has returned as Hannah Hunter, a Katie Couric like news anchor, who denounced Macaluso on network television and is now a fugitive in the one world government that Macaluso has made for himself as dictator of the world.
She was caught in the last film, but he spared her for this film Judgment where she is now to be tried for her crimes.
In Judgment the Christians are now called Haters and it's big time illegal to be one.
She now lived on her lovers.
Shahin should have stopped those auto biographies years ago, it was OK for a film or two but now it's really boring & tedious.
But up until now I actually hadn't seen one of her films.
It's the skewed logic of a criminal mind that since they stole something then it is now theirs and they are justified in using any means to recover their property.
When these now technologically advanced "Sona" return, close to death, in an attempt to benefit from their home planet's natural regenerative radiation, the Baku hoodwink Picard and his crew into thinking that they are infact the victims.
This is mainly because the Baku, basking in regenerative radiation all day long, have remained relatively pretty while the Sona are now very ugly as the film takes pains to point out.
I think most of his movies are great, with the only exception being School Daze and now this one.
This was my first Spike Lee experience, and I have to say, I now understand why I'm laughing when comics make jokes such as "That makes about as much sense as a white person's script in a Spike Lee movie" ***SPOILER ALERT **** I thought it was hilarious that the first white man on screen kills himself, and the next white person shown is a complete and utter witch.
On top of Spike Lee's blatant homophobia and the not too bright racial stereotyping, on top of all that put the hypocrisy of two lesbians talking the ex-fiancÃ©e of one of them into making an easy buck with his sperm, and afterwards, having impregnated 19 women, he feels he must pay in hell and now HE'S sorry he got THEM into it.
This is when Lee and his collaborator get into the biggest pickle that they can never squirm out of, as up to now they have material that isn't terrific, but has some promise to be developed.
Either Spike no longer respects his viewers enough to allow them to 'figure it out on their own' or that verbally bludgeoning them with his viewpoints (all 75 of them) is now considered a more viable storytelling alternative.
this is the only show ( at least i watched until now ) that not only helps to know how our favorite stars are... but also helps to develop the craft for professionals ( being and wanted to be ) and know the difficulty of the craft for non-professionals, you may ask why general public should know how difficult the craft is and that is because they are the people who comments ( usually bad ) on them.
You will thank me and be pleased that you are not now doing what I am doing: trying to think of a way to strike myself across the head in such a way that I will forget I ever saw this thing.
Certainly this isn't the first film to do this, but that makes it even more problematic because by now filmmakers should know what to do and what not to do, particularly when you are working with the slasher genre.
Joan Blondell was the troublemaker back in the day and she's done a stretch in the joint, but she's calmed down and now is starring in a revue.
The good girl was Bette Davis who went to business college and is now a secretary.
The composite reconstructed movie now runs about 109 minutes.
But we're getting carried away now, as we all know this completely stupid and nonsensical plot is just a thin excuse for fight scene after fight scene.
And now, just to be fair, I must admit that over the course of the film I actually smiled once.
After having survived alone for six years, he now continues his work by killing the crew of Icarus II.
The beginning doesn't ruin what now can still be hopeful expectations.
The two that once seemed chunks of rankest Velveeta now blossomed like the sweetest of Edams next to "Sunshine."
(After the third draft, let alone the thirty-fourth, you should by now know enough to say to yourself, "This isn't working, is it?")
Earlier in the show, another character roars in agony as he roasts alive in direct sunlight; here, now, in the Land of the Big Finale, Capa gets to look all wondering and angelic as the solar breeze flutters his flowing locks.
I now believe this movie has the worst ending of any sci-fi movie I have ever seen.
We are a multicultural society now, we have to learn to live and respect one another.
Well, yes I admit that there are even worse movies out there but that doesn't really make this a good movie either, now does it.
Vampire, now human, keeps girl.
Besides very brief cameo appearances by Keith Moon, Peter Frampton, John Bonham, and a few other now lesser-known 70's rockers as the band The Count Downes, this film has little to recommend it.
Waldemar is now on a mission to destroy Countess Bathory in order to prevent her from making him her slave, once again.
I have been trying to make myself "like" this nearly unwatchable horror/comedy for a couple years now and am getting nowhere.
I have an adoptive mother I adore and who never kept my adoption secret; she is nearly 90 now and I worship the ground she floats above.
(Maybe Kayla, now in her late teens, fills in for the carpool and Chelsea and Travis are now teens, with new little kids to take their place.
He's now old and suffering from some type of senility and dementia.
You know the drill by now.
Andrew Walker is very cute and sure there is a twist, but since you now know there is a twist you'll be looking for it and then it's not that surprising.
The one good thing about this movie is that I now know why plane seats are equipped with vomit bags.
Every now and then, he says, "don't take this too seriously, it's all a goof", akin to what Eminem occasionally pulls during his fits of rage.
I dunno about you, but right now I'm halfway into REALLY getting sick of the whole story.
Eventually, Taeko, the mother is persuaded to trade places; she now watches from within as Gozo rapes his daughter.
Although she survives the fall, she is now confined to a wheelchair.
Gozo now sates his rapacious sexual appetite with a string of prostitutes, openly having sex in front of his paralysed daughter.
and death has now become a metaphor for Game Over, so now, when a filmmaker reaches into their bag of handy shocks there is little left.
But now for the two main things Deodato completely messes up.
Off Balance is more promising and potential than some other films of the giallo/slasher genre and since it's Italian, it could've been so much more than it now is.
Mads Mikkelsen does a good job definitely but i really missed Kim Bodnia cause his role was far more intense and now i've heard that his not in pusher 3 neither is Mads!
Seen this clichÃ©d piece of film-making tonight; now I want my money back; extremely disappointing film on all levels.
That is to say that they cannot cause even a ripple of mirth now, and it surprises me that they would have done when they were filmed.
Looking at the list of credits (so many producers) it's easy to conclude that there were too many cooks in the kitchen...too many people who wanted a piece of the pie (mmm, now I'm hungry).
I've got a spoiler for you so if you don't want to look at a spoiler look away right now O.K.
I think that it was very shocking when it came in the cinemas but now with knowing what happens, this film is nothing but a big joke.
And even when you don't know what will happen, which you now know because I said it, it is also not worth the time.
Of course, I will get to more specifics on this, but for now, lets focus on the story.
The scene is then played out in a now grim way, leading to an ending that is so "original".
But it's christmas so he comes to see his family, while picking up his wife at her firm, a group of terrorist shows up and holds all guests as hostages, John McClane manages to escape and is now the only hope to save the hostages and alert the police.
John McTiernan has proven to be a solid action director over the years, after the breakthrough with Predator he made this classic action flick, that never seems to be getting old, even now.
My belief is that the director was trying to show how passÃ© we now find violence and even goes an extra step to show bare sexuality (there is no nudity in the movie) against the back drop of the violence to allow the audience to judge their own "arousal factors" and how close they are to violence.
After many years have passed I have to say that this movie kept me hanging as it did when I watched it was seems now like ages ago.
Sutherland spends the rest  of the film tracking down the now dangerous criminal, with little  help from his fellow constables or the native people.
Right now, when I'm writing this, I've already decided to quit watching 'Heroes'.
Maybe I had to get the bigger picture, see where the programme was going... Maybe I was light-hearted at first, but right now shows like these make me angry and disgusted.
The once international cast was suddenly down to three (two of which are the Asian comic relief), and all the characters who had already run out of steam by the end of Season 1 were now front and centre, source and solution of the problems.
Showrunner Tim Kring now declared that Heroes was actually about the Petrellis and the Bennets.
Instead, Heroes is now about a bunch of upper-class New Yorkers ensuring one another that it's okay they started a genocide.
Instead you see how the writers using their now totally uninteresting storyline as an excuse to make all the good guys become the bad guys and vice versa.
All those valuable sword lessons by his father really payed off, since Hiro now understands that with a sword, the best fighting technique is to point the pointy end of the sword towards your opponent, and then run toward your enemy screaming until you impale him.
After the opening, the film goes around and shows the story of the "stranger" from earlier in the film, who has now been released from prison and wants to start his life over again.
Unfortunately, no one told retired detective and now private eye John Gifford (Charles Durning), the cop who was there the night the caller terrorized Jill Johnson.
As Duncan takes a beating at the bar, Gifford enlists the aid of one of his cop friends, Charlie Garber (Ron O'Neal), now a lieutenant on the force who remembers the bloody horror of that night but hesitates in helping his buddy.
Thankfully, the film returns to its frightening pace at the end, when the now married Jill Johnson once again encounters Curt Duncan.
If anything, the unfortunate people featured in the movie would be even more confused than they are now.
I believe now that I have.
If you haven't seen it yet for whatever reason, now is the time to do so.
now this little notice is based on the dubbed version I cannot recommend it as the voices are in current english idioms & coming out of the mouths of people from over 1000 yrs ago is pure ludicrous.
Okay enough ranting, now for the good parts of the film, the cinematography, absolutely gorgeous, I cannot even imagine how many hours and days someone would have to film at that same spot to get those stunning shots of the sky.
I bought this movie for Australian $15 a few years ago, most like it's $10 now because it wasn't that good or popular.
Long gone now.
I'll probably go buy it now.
The second movie Dr. Dolittle is now a rather rich doctor.
It's more like a repressed memory now, and I only commented here because I was trying to find out what the Spanish Orangutan in the first movie was saying.
And if you are one of those many people who have only ever been able to watch it on TV then now is definitely the time to rediscover a cool, classic and creative action picture.
What we have here is a cross between The Shining (1980) with it's hotel style setting & The Amityville Horror (1979) with the now standard haunted house scenario (spooky property has a dark past, you know the sort of thing) along with a few boring mystery elements thrown in there for good measure.
There's no explanation as to how or why there's a ghost in the hotel or how it manages to alter reality or how it can transport people back in time &, of course, the annoying American teens mobile phones don't work for no apparent reason either so they get isolated from the outside world in a now obligatory plot device for low budget horror films.
After watching 75 minutes of a film that never went anywhere, we were now subject to the worst musical and dance sequences that celluloid has ever been wasted on.
I had no idea it was based on a real story, but now that I know it I see it even worst.
One of the earlier scenes where they are talking about giving a press conference and Dean goes, "The press has a victim, now they need a villain."
Basically, this movie might have been interesting before all the facts and everything was out but now, it just makes you roll your eyes at it.
Not only is this lazy, but if I wanted to sit there watching endless scenes of autopsies, I would have, well, rented a video that consisted of actual autopsies  instead (yes, you can rent those now).
Even though I swore to myself I would never lay eyes again on 'Men behind the Sun' or any of its sequels, I am now reviewing part 2.
At least now I clearly recall why I took this pledgeÂ.
I suppose it was audacious and cutting-edge in '74, but now it's just silly and boring.
I expected the bobbies to twirl their truncheons and mumble 'Here now, what's all this, then?'
Actually, this last scene isn't meant to be realistic: it's shown from Betty Jones's viewpoint, and she's now entertaining delusions of showbiz glamour.
1/10 I sleep now
For some reason I find myself watching it every now and again.
I now see two recurring themes in these Paul Cox films: keyboard skills and rebound.
I've been calling Tsukamoto the lovebaby of Lynch and Cronenberg for years now.
Meanwhile, the governor and his essentially second in command have been working with pirates for a while now and are willing to team up with Blackbeard so as to get their share of his prizes.
A pretentious eccentricity: a virtually unrecognizable modernization of the Joan Of Arc tale (with the heroine now a drug addict-turned-nurse-turned-whorish miracle maker!)
There are several moments where something like this will happen: a character will fall over with no bullet wound, there will be a close-up shot of a gun firing, then another view of the dead character (now complete with gunshot wound to the head) in a totally different room than the one that they died in, in a completely different position!
Flashback, to Estonia, the prostitute is a virginal choir girl, singing about the "Peace of Jerusalem" (in English mind you), pure driven snow outside (another "message") and suddenly Rose appears: OK now I'm totally lost.
Watching this movie now, you can see how ridiculously dated it is.
10 years from now, is anyone going to know what the one-liner "Say hi to Judge Ito!"
Jury Duty is now something I try to avoid figuring that back in the day I served on three of them at one time or another.
I can betcha 100 bucks this film is now crossed off his resume.
There's nothing in this piece of garbage floating like flotsam now on cable worth mentioning.
There's little fault with the script, which does a decent job of retelling a by now overly familiar tale and even throws in an intriguingly Gothic Christmas Eve party for good measure.
Perhaps in the 70's this movie had some appeal, but I cannot think of any good reason anyone would want to watch it now.
Newman reasons his way to a now untrackable blow-up for unknown reasons.
I wish there were still shows like this now.
A doctor today might push some unnecessary pills on you so that s/he will get some money from the drug company, but they would never go so far as to guarantee you are cured of syphilis and can now freely have sex with people when you actually weren't cured at all.
), and had its original ending (see "Alternate Versions") changed to the awful, unfitting "happy" ending it now has.
And sex back then was pretty much the same as now: First you kiss, then you do the bongo-bongo.
It's also sad to see how mean-spirited some of these "creative" filmmakers are, but the real agenda of this film - the bottom line - came in the last minute - it's another George Bush-bashing cartoon, as "George" is pictured as a cowboy with an itchy trigger finger now, just killing everyone in sight and enjoying it.
I mean, I remember seeing him for the first time in Back to the Future when I was little, and now this?
For example, a bullet bounced off of Superman's eye in his movie; now, the bullet pokes his eye out.
It's a shame to see films that promise to parody the formulaic and over-constructed nature of "epic" films, but fail, and subsequently conform to what is now the "spoof" genre.
An hour into this movie, and I thought "okay, enough now; this is as much as I can take of this crap."
There are so many of these types of movies coming out now where the director has lots of quick edits, hand held cameras and jump cuts throughout the film, please please tell me this isn't how all movies are going to be done from now on.
Jerry does deserve credit for introducing the now ubiquitous director's cut.
this is like a bad sequel around the lines of leprechaun in space, but i forgave that movie simply because the first one was good but this on the other hand you cant forgive it trys way to hard at times and throws a little blood and boobs ur way every now and then to keep u watching, a part made me smile close to the end because it was simply a scene stolen from dead silence.
Jump forward to the present & now the teenage Angelina (Paydin LaPachin) & her mute brother Norbert (Rocky Marquette) decide to head back to Las Vegas after going from foster home to foster home with Dummy to find the fame & fortune as a ventriloquist act their late poor mother never did.
This are times hard to get now, and the nostalgia wins a 10.
Only now, in 2010 are the airlines beginning to install the equipment to make this possible.
The current definition of heroism now encapsulates twenty guys rushing one teenager with a box-cutter and a fake bomb, and after discovering the bomb to be fake, still beating the teenager to death Â heroically, of course Â with no trial.
Still laughing now!
I'm afraid that if I see it now I'll be supremely disappointed by my childhood innocence like I was with Saturday Night Fever...whew...I had no idea what was going on there until I saw it when I got older..again I had tunnel vision as a kid.
The airlines are only now installing the pica-cell technology to make them work.
The opening scenes of the baggage inspectors being so thorough was a bit contrived (apparently they were doing a better job back then than they do now).
Pitt is a bad actor in this & still is a terrible actor now...The problem with this film is the acting, plot, setting, music etc.... Somewhere there was some potential for a campy/scary film , but unfortunately it seems to be more intune with an amateur gore hound & friends running amok with a second rate video camera.
But, we get this long boring story about these three main characters that seems to have no point, except to draw your attention every now and then to the campus killer, who conveniently cuts into the act (no pun intended...i guess).
I don't know why things would be different now.
Although Dwight has been losing it lately and now Paula is put in the situation of finding out who is telling the truth.
I hope that it finds it's center and gets better because I think the premise of nuclear survival is much more interesting now than just a few years ago.
The only person I saw interviewed in the film's entire 1 hour and 45 minute length who was credible was Pete Williams, now a network newsman, who was then the Defense Department's press spokesman.
And now, here we have "The Devil's Rain".
His near-death experience, where he saw his family at the end of a long tunnel with bright light, has now given the ability to not only hear voices, i.e.
Hey man , someone decides to throw a party , party now daddy-o.
Everybody now rides their dirt bikes like they're auditioning for motocross.
Anyway, they are now surrounded by fire, and their only escape is through a mine which is filled with methane gas.
He sees a dead body, dripping of fresh blood, of the concierge while exiting the Paris hotel, and is now in fear for his life.
I've also seen enough of these things by now to recognize that the music itself was even reused scores from 'Haunting Fear' and 'Sorceress.'
I mean, really, now: just how long can YOU be amused by dog costumes?
Drake and Josh is also awful - bad American kids' comedy is now becoming a big business.
Right now, I'm in high school, and it still sucks today!!!
Other ludicrous characters include a crab who has sold out his own people and now makes a living running a crabby patty restaurant and a squirrel who, for some reason, has taken up residence under water.
I can see it now a black family where the kids are involved with the la riot's and the white family has the kids rebel and listen to grunge rock music .The soundtrack will feature bands like Nirvana , N.W.A , Public Enemy , Soundgarden etc .The movie like this will be just as cheesy as The 60's and I gurantee you NBC will do it .See the biggest problem with period pieces when done buy networks is that when you are living in a certain time period you aren't thinking i am living in the 60's or whatever decade is trendy retro at the time .Next time someone does something like this they should put more weight into there project
The animation is more spastic, the voices have lost all of their luster and are now shrill and annoying, and all of the characters have lost their personalities that we once loved.
They should have stopped making new episodes a long time ago to preserve it's greatness, but it is too late now.
SB's voice is high and whiny, and the way he's drawn now is just awful.
In fact, now that I think about it, I think Spongebob is basically the cartoon equivalent of Star War's Jar Jar Binks.
Spongebob has been downgraded and turned into a mindless whining, idiotic perfectionist.His voice is now a lot more high-pitched.
If you're going to judge this show, judge it by older seasons 1 through 3,not the current episodes, because that greatness can't be compared to what Spongebob is now.
But now it has changed significantly in the middle of 4th and 5th season and has gotten worse.
Both films are now cult faves.
I'll be sure to come check out IMDb.com every time from now on if I want to read reviews on a movie, Lionsgate or not.
This also has the gratuitous female nudity and the now requisite lesbian couple (notice we never see a gay male couple?).
Was a big question in my mind now even Rishi Kapoor feels the same in AALC which is very bad  I mean please the superficial way of showing America puts people off and in today's overseas audiences dominating times this isn't good  The first half moves in different lanes and the love triangle is done to death  and the second half gets better a bit Akshaye's realization is well handled and then the film ends well but the sudden change of the other son is too much  They are many problems in the film like the first half which moves in different lanes and not proper treatment is given to most of it  Rishi Kapoor directs some dramatic scenes well but he needs to improve his storytelling, overall a decent debut by one of the finest actors as a director Music is okay  Akshaye Khanna shines in his role, He was always a good actor but signed bad films those days Barring his receding hairstyle he leaves a huge impact as an actor Aishwarya is plastic as ever Rajesh Khanna is okay Kader Khan and Jaspal Bhati are good Satish Kaushik is funny Paresh Rawal is good
I now see why Americans have death sentence, just that it is used on wrong people.
PS It seems Howard plus his scriptwriter now plan to turn the Bernini Mystery into a film, apparently hoping to cash in on another Brown-novel.
It was a different atmosphere than what it is now.
Okay, now I understand how Olen Ray has over 110 movies on his repertoire as a director and Carradine over 340 as an actor!
And the one that got away happens to now be married to Underwood's character, Chip Hightower.
There, now you know the funniest line.
After the Death Wish sequels, Bullseye, Parting Shots and now this, Winner should definitely NOT quit his day job as a restaurant critic.
They also leave out all about the mens expedition except finding the miners body in the mine in northern Russia, and don't mention that his widow who was a lot younger than himself in 1912 is still alive in 1987 now aged 93 and gives an interview to one of the important people.
I was excited to re-watch it on Reel 13 because I felt that now, as a more educated and hopefully more sophisticated viewer, I could fully appreciate it for the important work of art that it was supposed to be, butÂno Â it's still pretty boring.
The more educated version of myself can now see why the film didn't work for me and ultimately, I think it boils down to the episodic nature of the piece.
I am thinking of the NPR Blues History radio series and now this.
Nicole Ritchie at least added some edge, now she is gone from the show.
The third started gettnig worse and the fourth wasn't that good at all and now the last of the "Simple Life" series can have it's last season be as scripted as a CW drama.
I got it on VHS and now its the prank gift on birthdays.
It has now been handed over seven times and only one of the owners (bar me) took enough interest to watch it to the end.
At first, I thought the director was just being "artsy", but now I know that it was some kind of mistake, but it makes this awful movie even worse, if that's possible.
The virologist gets infected with the virus and does not have to wear the containment suit, and to that she says 'Well now I can do this' to the president.
The virologist gets infected with virus and does not have to wear the containment suit, and to that she says "Well now I can do this" to the president.
We need that time again, now more than ever.
If the actors careers weren't over before this movie, they should be pretty much done now.
The story of the movie was not really to bad, something like that could possibly happen now or in the future.
So now this will challenge me to find some one out there who may be able to help mer with this matter.
But it's odd how a film about prostitution can make one feel nostalgic for a gentler age of cinema than the one we have now.
I just HAVE to write a comment of what I'm experiencing right now.
And now I'm still trying to wash the nasty taste out of my mouth.
This is not to mention that the other Bratz movie that came out on the 8th of August now number 1 on the bottom 100 of the IMDb list.
But along the way, it's got montages, and songs, LOTS of songs- which are, as one might imagine who doesn't listen to Radio Disney, the worst trash possible right now.
Then there's a live demonstration in front of an audience, with real tension that the robot is going to malfunction and blow the guy away right on stage, a la the opening scene of RobocopÂ and now I see that Robocop came out a year after this one.
I have never left the cinema before the end of a movie, until now.
The female lead (her name I forgot just now) was refreshing and radiant and definately one to look out for.
So now she is completely delusional and forever insane.
While searching for work, by chance she comes across an old girls' school that now houses a man (Marc Barbe) who preserves and stores personal artifacts that people bring to him.
For while the miniseries was a remarkable - and important - piece of television, the book on which it was based has now been widely exposed as a historical hoax.
A lesson we still revisit now!
But now I have to add this to that list.
This movie is a catalog of clichÃ©s that made a movie and it's characters seem authentic in the 70s, that now seem pretty hoary.
My grandfather who is now 85 served in the war verses the Germans.
I've waded through about 50 episodes of Poirot now, from the sublime to the mediocre, but this episode lowers the bar to basement level.
)appear now and then to prod them on.
Our 'hero' decides that now might be a good idea to do something, so, as we hear the poor girl screaming in the background, he starts to load his gun, taking all the time in the world!
As we hear he screams and the commotion from inside, 'hero' decides that now might be a good time to escape, and escape he does.
You'd expect her to be so pee'd off at him now, having let her be raped the entire night, and sat idly by as a dozen men shoot at her, but no, she says she loves him and they kiss!
But recently, that creativity seems to have been drying up, and Kevin and Perry were resurrected, first on TV (Kevin's sexual encounter explained as a dream) and now in this disappointing film.
The UK-wide (and who knows, maybe by now even international) appeal of shows like "Little Britain" and "The Fast Show" are largely lost on me, running with one-joke 'characters' and one-liners ad nauseum.
I just need to go watch one right now, to erase the horrible memory of "K&P Go Large"...
After looking at the cast here in IMDb now I do understand.
This brought me to the trusty old IMDb, where I have now learned that it was, indeed, an intended straight SciFi.
There's a tiredly trite scene between a Brooklyn-transplant waitress and Hamilton; you can probably can enact the scene on your own, right now.
Also, it gives a musical performance every now and then in the movie, making it also a musical genre.
Still, she's pregnant now and mysterious forces draw her back to the isolated house she claims doesn't exist.
), this is now only the *second* worst.
Okay, now that that's out of the way, this film is pure cheeze.
Mr. Big, played by Rufus in Bloodsucking Freaks, backed their previous venture and he now wants his money back or else.
Can't go wrong with puppet bj's now can ya?
******* crappy spoiler *********************  Well basically the bad guy is on top of a train with the protagonists daughter suddenly his sister who died (as you find in the opening sequence) appears, which was pathetic, I mean for a while we thought he was some ghost then we realize he's really a man but now the movie has gone back to ghosts?
I'm watching it right now on TV 'cos it's too hot to sleep (typical Aussie summer, wouldn't ya guess), and, it being the summer "silly season", the networks have pulled out their big guns - namely, lower-than-C-grade movies, which basically constitutes the entire Aussie industry.
I don't even remember this film being released commercially, so it's probably some commissioned TV movie that somehow got the green light and is now languishing in the perpetual darkness of a station's archive.
Yeesh, now I know why Lovecraft hated fish so much.
A nice film to look at but otherwise a real piece of trash which I avoided up till now.
Shoot me now.
He is almost pushing 32 and playing angst-ridden teenagers might be a bit of stretch right now.
By now you already know the essentials.
So now the infamous "parents in inner-city schools usually don't care about their children" stereotype comes into play.
I've been watching this show as a fan from the first episodes and now many years later have come to the conclusion this show is completely fake and that Jason and Grant are nothing but a couple of frauds.
A show that in my opinion should have been canceled a couple of years ago when it was becoming clear that one of the investigators, who we all know now was Grant was faking evidence for the sake of the viewers.
Juzo is now of course traumatized and has split personalities.
If they do make a Rocky VI, which i highly doubt since Sylvester Stallone is 60 now i think, i will watch it just to see how it is.
It feels like the filmmakers are saying, "Here's a preview of some spectacular shows you can see if you come on down to Las Vegas right now!
Anyway, I never had the desire to hit the casinos, and I'm even less interested in visiting the City of Sin now.
I never saw the original and I don't want to now.
As it stands now, I hate these drunken, whiny, morose sons of bitches.
It shows in the not-too-often, not-too-little use of the term "buddy" between Starbuck and Apollo and Boomer and the trio handclasp colonial warriors use now and then at a difficult or dangerous moment.
How can you go back and enjoy the first seasons of the show knowing that most of the actions by key characters are lies and completely illogical since you now know they are cylons.
It should of course be a legal non-profit entity protecting these classics from overexploitation Â as the one representing Swedish now diseased Astrid Lindgren (of Pippi Longstocking fame) rejecting all adaptations she wouldn't have liked.
Albeit modern forensic science has advanced out of sight since the 1950's, initial proceedings were surely much the same then as they are now.
Regardless,it's one of the most (not terrifying, but i think psychologically draining would be an accurate summary) nightmarish shorts you're likely to see.Check it out now!!!!
His father and mother were among the mirror's victims, and now he wants to document its effects.
It is so lame, and completely dated by now, that it can only be seen as a historical document.
By now every six year old knows about exploding squibs and fake spraying blood and brain matter.
rest assured, from now on, i will never listen to another word those friends say regarding movies!
pointless daughter character (visibly getting bored now by the sheer length of the scene) - 'yes mommy, i'm going to sleep with the light on'   all - 'what a great idea!'
now, does a scene like this really need to last what feels like over three minutes?!
now, i also realise that some may say Cronenberg often favours the more direct approach and tries to test his audience with occasional bouts of realism straight out of a comic book, but i'm sorry, just because he has built up a reputation of doing things this way (which on many occasions i've hugely enjoyed), does not mean he get away with sheer sloppiness of this magnitude.
now, the violence and sexual content.
SPOILER - now, don't get me wrong, i'm always down for Maria Bello with a completely untied dressing gown (in fact i waited what felt like years for that to happen in ER), but, in the context of the film, for the love of god WHY?
so now they can't have sex anymore.
It was a rental from a now defunct video store called Top Video.
While it doesn't use African genocide as crudely as "Beyond Borders," it is painful to see a fictionalized story when the United Nations is right now doing so little about the horrors in Darfur, Nigeria, etc.
Kidman's character now ranks up there with Monica Bellucci's horrid 'performance' in Tears of the Sun as one of the most annoying characters ever in film; and what pisses me off is that this type of character is getting more and more prevalent in movies like this.
You'd think that in a pressure situation where you had bitched and moaned earlier about possibly not getting any protection, you'd be a LITTLE more cooperative with the people who are now PROTECTING YOU!
Penn, now expecting her to finally come clean after about 2-3 previous meetings like these (where he uncovers another one of her lies), and the best thing that Kidman could say isÂ..get thisÂÂ'that's not me'.
Only after more pressing from Penn does she admit that the woman in the picture (her) isn't the type of person she is now.
This "riveting climax" (the horse scene) is so ridiculous that I'm laughing as I think about it now.
When Masturbating Woman awakens from her drug-induced slumber, her vision is obscured by gauze filters over the camera lens, but she can still distinguish the Mistress, Stern-Looking Woman and Wimpish Man, all of whom are now donning various S&M costumes.
Directed by the guy who we all now know as Ben Dover and starring his girlfriend, former Penthouse Pet Linzi Drew, this also makes you think there's more been filmed than the running time listed offers.
Having seen this film twice now - which some might find unbelievable or even masochistic - I felt I had to comment on it.
I have now seen three films directed by Rene Cardona, Jr. and Cyclone is easily my least favorite.
It was the scene of the very bloody ( And now forgotten ) " Muslim - Croat war " of 1992 to 1994 .
The son of El Topo (who has found his way to this village and now grown into a man) takes the gun, removes the blank and replaces it with a real bullit.
Because I hope by now I've convinced you to stay far away from this film.
By now you actually might want to see the movie just from curiosity of how really bad could it be, but DON'T!.
Having been a fan of obscure, z-grade horror flicks for some 30 years now, I do not say these things lightly.
This should have been one of those films that somebody, anybody, should have said, "we need to stop now".
It basically follows 79-84, as if it were just, "Oh then we got a track on the charts, then we went to a concert, then we did some traveling, oh then we did some more shows, now we're big, then we released a couple albums, then a few more shows, now it's over."
Songs are continually cut off midway, and even as early as now it seems Zimmy had begun altering the arrangement of some of them, thus making them too unlike their album counterparts to really get into.
Having won the PR war, there is now no means by which a viewer can allow himself to judge a Pixar product as wanting or in this case, horrid.
Regardless of it's popularity now, no one will be watching this in ten years because no one will be able to trudge through it.
Anyway, I'm calling out to all of you now who want to know if Disturbing Behavior spills the honest truth about high school cliques and preppy crimes: the preppies aren't out to get you, my black-clad, boot-wearing, spikey-haired brothers and sisters, it's the big corporate producers of Hollywood teenage movies.
Every now and then, I suffer through watching movies made by a group of severely UNartistic and UNtalented people.

So I may be giving this movie a low score now, however, in the future I may give it a higher score or rewrite this review in order to incorporate more of the story in the review.

This may rank as one of the low points in the history of British TV;12 "celebrities" are flown off to some exotic tropical Island to see if there is any mutual attraction with each other,hopefully leading to sexual attraction.The word "celebrity" once had rather more respectful meaning for most of the 20th Century;mainly with those who had achieved fame because they deserved it,through endless hard work and great ability at their chosen field.In the 21st Century,particularly in the UK,it is now mostly associated with tawdry,dislikable,intractably pointless excuses for human beings most interested in seeing their names in equally reprehensible tabloid newspapers or c_______ magazines.

OK so now I've got to fill out my comment on this short with a few more lines so it will pass for the good folks at the internet movie database, so ill say the other short on the clerks DVD "clerks lost scene" was a lot funnier and deserves lots of praise.... will that do?

It reeks of "I just watched 'Good Will Hunting,' and now I want to be a screenwriter!"
Here's the great thing about Dance of Shiva, now that I've watched it.

And now I've seen The Shunned House.
And after he does, this Hero, having fulfilled his task, turns for love and adoration to Lori, who lets him have the same speech she does now and whisks herself and her daughter out of his life.

There is no fear of her now.

Though the rating of a movie to simply overall 1 to 10 can be difficult, and I am still on the fence of how much I like it (having just seen it, and would like to come back to it a few weeks from now).
Joss Whedon certainly got it all right with the TV show (if it weren't for the title, so outdated now), but I'd keep happy thoughts about the TV show, and skip the movie altogether.

It could be depicted so much more darker and realistic, now it becomes a little Mickey Mouse Club.

If I could, I would not be writing about it now, would I?!
I'd also read comments about the state of her lips and thought it was just internet geeks going overboard, but they are really big now, significantly moreso than in her trek role, I think she needs to ease off on the collagen before they take over her face, they're starting to look like she was beaten up.

I've seen two or three episodes now, and wish I hadn't.
When I see Monk now I really feel sorry for the creators - they are literally killing their own brilliant idea for the show - everything about Monk became pretty predictable and since usually there are 1-2 people outside the regular cast in each episode it isn't much challenge for the viewers to point the murderer without Monk's help, and constant repeating of "I solved the case" started to remind me of Scooby-doo mysteries...
And if it wasn't bad enough that TELEVISA made "infomercials" and lousy political statements fit in to the show, now Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡THEY CHANGE THE STORY!!!!!!!!

Humans have fled the evil force that now rules the known galaxy, yet some living in a neo-primitive society (a hybrid of Conan the Barbarian and power rangers) fight back.

By now these ideas are yesterday's news and unless you've been living under or rock or are so blinded by ignorance, denial and sheer stupidity (read: a right-wing Christian), these jokes insultingly simple.
Ben Kingsley might have to return the Oscar if he doesn't start doling out a decent performance now and again.
I am sure some will sing praises of this effort, but if a rose is still a rose by any other name so, too, is a messÂÂÂÂÂ  I now remember why I continued with the DVD.

As he tries to get the phone to work, I can imagine what he's really thinking: "Great, there's no way to get out of this film now!"
The first movie I rented was the Movie Version with "This Island Earth" which isn't really bad so I thought MST3K was an damn funny show, now I know it is one of the damn funniest shows ever!

This version of Shakespeare's ROMEO AND JULIET was very famous in its day, and a number of critics that I greatly admire continue to praise it even now.
I do not live among people who shout and wave their arms about all the time, although I will of course accept such behaviour in a film where it is a natural response to a stressful situation; but if I do not live among people who behave like that, I am not likely to watch a film that shows everyone doing so continuously, for very long before I turn it off - or at the very least feel compelled to complain, as I am doing now.

It seems to me that if you're going to have a "high-octane thrill ride", shouldn't you at least be living in the now and the present?
Trust me, three years from now, this movie will be on some shelf in a DVD shop with a fifty cent pricetag on it.
Kenny was funny as an occasional guest star, but having him all the time now and losing the Woodcoks (Jeff & Steph) has changed the show altogether to something that just isn't that funny anymore.
I heard Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn are now remaking this movie, I don't know what kind of success the new version will get, but I am sure, by all means, they can't even get close to the quality of this original one(the original was in the early 70s, and its now 90s!!).
Blockbuster now remembers me as "the crazy dude that wanted a refund for a bad movie he rented".
But, damn, if Phillips didn't prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he is one of the worst directors in Hollywood right now.
Watching reruns on satellite, I am now enjoying it all over again, and I realise just exactly how awful this film is.
Then a red light coming out of a flashlight is buzzing around the room- the alien, of course- and now there are ominous callings on the radio.
So why now, why the plague?
Well, I was amused until I remembered that theme was stuck in my head for weeks after LSF and now it will be stuck again.
Nicole Ritchie at least added some edge, now she is gone from the show.
The third started gettnig worse and the fourth wasn't that good at all and now the last of the "Simple Life" series can have it's last season be as scripted as a CW drama.
Unfortunately it has gotten so bad now I do not even bother to watch Adult Swim on Sundays anymore so there is no chance of me being subjected to the travesty.
The third time was because I knew that it was an actual show by now, and I realized that there must be an audience.
So now she just says "oh my God...." Unfortunately, it seems like all prints of the film which remain are now altered like this.
The movie does portray a world that is now so very complicated in the raising of children, but the writer needs to move beyond mere events and situations.
So now, I hope my infuriated disappointment is understandable after seeing this film.
Despite the very interesting cast no one is particularly good (and Theresa Russell gives one of her really bad performances, which unfortunately by now outnumber her few very good ones).
I expect this movie was made simply to shock or something, and perhaps it did in 1991 but now it's simply an interminable yawner.
I wonder if Mr Poliakoff was working with severe time limitations and was actually more concerned about the (now complete) development of the docklands (into something that resembles suburban American concentrations of office buildings with, arguably, no character, like Southfield and Troy here in SE Michigan) than telling a story about such uninteresting people.
'They stole my secret lance - now we are partners'.
It's not hard now, when lines too pedestrian to even laugh at are recited for the tenth, twelfth, twentieth time.
For cryin out loud, now even Yoda has to be cgi.
I mean, if they could make it look great with puppets in the 70's, why can't they now?
That is how i will now refer to this stinkbomb of an actor.
A glamourized pretty boy who happens to look a little like what jake Lloyd may look like ten years from now.
And now he's doing it again.
Now that I'm retired I do a bit of traveling now and I make itineraries that I like to stick to.
Even now, just thinking of the scenes in Central Park are making me laugh.
I'd better stop now.
That said it is an important true story of the first sexologist who fought for the rights of what is now called the queer community.
In 1930, the public liked this sort of old fashion drivel--now it is a definite chore to get past these god-awful songs.
To sit through this for 100 minutes - now THAT is a challenge!
The whole world knows by now that if one has the 80 million dollars worth of backing, he can produce any half-presentable CGI animated feature, aim it at children and produce a profit of at least 5 times the investment, apparently even if the film is laced with primarily adult content, as displayed in this film.
(I viewed the movie-screening with some friends who asked me along) This book stole precious hours of my life, and now I murder time, that I could have spent in the pub.
Jimmy Sangster, once the brilliant mind behind genre classics such as "Taste of Fear" and "The Curse of Frankenstein", now delivered the severely lackluster script of the umpteenth haunted-house thriller.
Charles Gray, many will recall from the now  classic "Rocky Horror Picture Show".
What started out as a mainstream film integrating strong sexual elements, now becomes pornography trying unsuccessfully to cross over into mainstream.
But just as I thought "Karate Kid" was amazing when I was a kid (I laugh at the lameness of the fight sequences now) I imagine most adults will laugh at just about everything in this film.
Godard has now to my knowledge brandished immature affronts to two of the most talented filmmakers working today, Steven Spielberg, accusing him of capitalizing on the tragedy of the Holocaust with Schindler's List, and Woody Allen, for an unclear reason, not to mention Jane Fonda because of her political activism, just subsequent to directing her in one of his films, which itself served as political activism.
I liked Daffy Duck when he was, well, daffy...he has been smart aleck duck for a while now.
And now it appears that the same voice will star again at the the Theatre Royal.
Apparenly now that Marcellina is dead, Karloff won't allow anyone else to sing like her or sing her music.
Frightened, vulnerable refugees, escaping the political tensions permeating Europe in 1930 (and, we are to assume, the escalating prominence of the Nazi party), come to stay with friends in London; seven years later, having received their British citizenship, the younger sister embarks on a dancing career while the older sister reconnects with her handsome fiancÃ©, now a newspaperman and leader in the political underground.
Anchor Bay used to be one of my favorite movie companies, and now its reduced to putting stuff out like this....pretty sad.
I had given this 3/10 but now that I've written about it I realise that is too generous 2 is all it's worth despite the odd amusing reference to True Romance that has been slipped in.
Also, it might come as a huge shock to some, but people in Kentucky and West Virginia have had electricity, running water, and indoor facilities for at least 50 years now.
Not only that, but--hold onto your seat, now--most women there don't go around dressed like a Dorothea Lange photograph (and didn't in 1973, either!
It used to be fairly well matched to the running clock, yet now we are fed some completely unrealistic timelines, one of the several that annoyed me from ep01 last night was the 2 and a half minutes Jack had to steal a car, call into HQ, hotwire the car, drive somewhere (for arguments sake I'll say half a mile) park the car, find the right house, slip into the back yard, wait for the guard to come out, k.o.
Mary and Robert Gilder (now man and wife) are at the police station, being questioned for the murder of a police stoolie.
It's probably started filming even now, after all it shouldn't take Mr Shell too long to muster up the 7 new pence and half a packet of wine necessary to complete production.
Highly recommended for gullible people with absolutely no prior knowledge of history or culture or anyone who is interested in seeing how very low the BBC documentary has now fallen.
They now have rope barriers to keep people half a metre back from the hieroglyphs etc.
But then again, maybe he really is an angel, and he has found his kind and can now return home.
There was no smooth segway between scenes, it was like *poof* we are here *poof* now here.
Being married to a German, I have now seen this short at least five times; I *have* laughed during it.
'Oh yeah, I remember now.
Oh, sorry, I just shoved you a bit and now you're dead!
If you like Jim now as an actor.
I have never been compelled to write a comment about a movie before this, and in fact, the very first comment I ever saw on IMDB for this movie (at the time, it was the only comment and is now the last comment) was pretty spot on (the one where the person saw it with Finnish subtitles).
However, now that his comments have made it to the back of the queue, and since I just saw this movie AGAIN on TV (on the Action Channel) a few days ago, I thought I'd chime in.
In the future humanity is on the verge of destroying itself which leads to the scientists at ROTOR to make a cyborg policeman who goes berserk and starts killing people for speeding, now it's up to the scientist to destroy him while (in the film's most laughable moments)he waxes philosophical about the robot's place in the universe.
for a white man to sing mammy in black face go down to a black neighborhood and tell the people that.As a non-black that lived in black districts I can tell you it upsets them.When this movie came out on TV in the 1960's it made me cringe because I knew a lot of people around me were going to be upset.Yes,the good old 1960's when the riots started,showing a movie like this didn't help prevent them.The people that support and broadcast-ed this movie go around oblivious to realty.While their safe in a sheltered world during the riots I'm on the funky streets trying to be on time for the graveyard shift.Some persons now believe Leif Erickson discovered America instead Of Columbus.A change is needed in movie history too.In the best interest of a happier society I'd like for this movie not to be given any claim to fame,sweep it under the rug.May a technicality give the fame to a more decent film.
It's more funny now than dramatic.
And now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count has talked himself out with his respect for the films of the silent era
The entire cast gave very good performances, especially the golf-playing police chief (name of actor escapes me right now).
I've lived in Pittsburgh for 3 years now and was excited to see this movie based on the positive feedback I had read.
Close this browser window right now and never give this movie another thought.
Jorge AlÃ­ has made almost unbearable pieces of crap on Tv, stage and film, and now (uh, oh) comes his son, Rodrigo, with this once again irresponsible film about how the poor people of Colombia are nothing but savages, uncapable of dealing with something so simple as having electric power on their neighborhood.
so racoon city is now over run and milla jovovich and jill valentine team up with various other survivors to escape from the zombie infested city, whilst being pursued by the umbrella corporations new toy, project Nemesis, an uber hard as nails villain, there s a less than engaging sub plot involving a doctor guiding jovovich and her lot to saving his daughter in return for there escape, and thats about it, there's no gravitas to any of the proceedings its just shoot explode zombies run and repeat, you wont care about the characters because there's nothing to make you care about them they act as eye candy and Little else.
The first entry in this now franchise had that from Paul W.S.
I suspect its not all his fault though.I was never part of the I-hate-Anderson-crowd.But I think the fault here lies with him and the producers.He ruined AVP.Now this!I think he owes me 20 bucks now for paying to see the combined dreck that is AVP and RE2.In the same year no doubt!!!
I'm going out to buy a packet of straws and a box of cocktail sticks right now, and I'm going to wreak havoc in my neighbourhood.
Frankly, I think this is good - by now it would be STRANGE to see a group of doctors be all white men.
The Wildfire team is now composed of a more politically correct team including a black, an Asian, and a homosexual.
i have joined this site only to tell people not to watch this film, now i have to write 10 lines saying how bad it is.
Its stupid, its not funny, i hate it, i told all my friends it was good so they would watch it and now they hate me, Jennifer Love Hewitt is hardly in it, please don't buy, rent, borrow this.
Phantasm I and II are fun, creepy, scary movies, I now hope that parts 3 to 5 are just as good.
The setting is perfect- San Francisco, then and now the actual witch capital of the world (I should know, I live one hour away from the vortex of arcane power).
I've been watching Charmed for a while now.
The scenes are built up as if you sat in the theater - long shots from one side, only with few closeups now and then.
And now something really spooky...I'm going watch the last 10 minutes left from this mind dazzling horror picture...and I hope I will survive!
Ah, big stars and no nudity clauses, a shame movie might be worth ten bucks now it's a coaster.
He now lives with his older brother Jody (Bill Thornbury), who's thinking about leaving Mike with a relative and leaving their small town.
I still would have given it 3/10, but right now it's in the top 250.
The original's father is now uncle Irving Pichel (as Herbert Stander).
Now, bearing in mind that Doug had shot down dozens of evil, nasty non-American pilots in the first film, and that was without any training, he would now be an even better pilot, since he'd joined the US air force.
But who could stand in Doug's way now?
The rest of the film is a kind of blur to me now as I was in a state of shock and going through the early stages of post-traumatic stress disorder.
In the end, Hayworth and Mitchum return to help out good 'ol Jack, but by now (no surprise), Hayworth and Mitchum have discovered that they don't hate each other but are in love (gag me).
The fun fact is the Plymouth HemiCuda is a rad car back then, and still is now.
STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning   I've been reviewing films on IMDb for ten years now.
It seems that the only serious anime now a days are plagued by feminism.
Children have now been stereotyped as morons who laugh at anything that makes a stupid noise and poop jokes.
now, the movie itself is pretty crummy - strange bursts of acting from some familiar (in usually better movies) actors.
The horrid 1988 remake showed us a (now) pink blob and gave a more realistic reasoning behind why it consumed humans.
The humor that in the old ones was so sophisticated, light and clever is now indiscreet, noisy and lame.
STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning   Burnt out Vietnam vet Mac McDonald (action 'superstar' Michael Dudikoff-hahaha- as he is described on the back cover) now gets by making dodgy deals with shady characters.
It's completely annoying and is one of those films that the best part is the credits because the viewer can now breathe a sigh of relief that they made it through the film.
I think I need a shower now too.
I didn't see "Anaconda," and am now glad - so, I wasn't aware that Luis Llosa directed both films.
Basically Ray Quick (Razzie nominated Sylvester Stallone) used to work for the CIA as a explosives expert, and he is now living as an outsider somewhere in Miami, Florida.
Ray agrees to do this and manages to kill three of the mobsters, blowing them up, but one of them is Tomas Leon (The Dark Knight's Eric Roberts), son of crime boss Joe Leon (Razzie nominated Rod Steiger), and Ray's original friend, now enemy, Ned Trent (James Woods) is helping hunt down Ray as the murderer.
After the obligatory flashback scene explaining all this (Which I've just saved you the chore of having to watch if you've got better things to, like read the back of a cereal box) Woods now associates with the guy who killed Sharon Stone's family (Not in real life, the movie.
She looks 35, now if her parents were killed when she was a little girl, shouldn't Tomas be a tad older(he looked the same age in her flashback) The Specialist would've been a great movie if the plot was better explained and more intense.
The Specialist is a terrible film which I hated when I saw it back in the 90's & still hate now when I saw it but a few hours ago, there's nothing much more I can say other than I personally think it's complete rubbish except some decent explosions at the end which aren't worth waiting for.
Walker argues that Norinaga must buy his guns to quell the rebellion, while Norinaga fears that all is lost now that the scepter has vanished.
The Turtles are now in the forest, basking in its ancient beauty.
Mitsu now knows that the Turtles are good, and welcomes them.
The Turtles now look like Jim Hanson had a breakdown and took it out on the Turtles.
Basically, this is going to be such a short paragraph since the plot is really very simple, but here it goes, the turtles now have a time stick thing-a-ma-jig, so when April accidentally steps into it, she goes back to the 17th century in China switching places with the king's son, the turtles must go back and help April.
Rather than the voice of a Japanese elder that we became accustomed to, it now sounds as if Splinter is a guy with a bad case of laryngitis.
Kenshin now wears April's leather jacket and April wears Kenshin's robes.
He was also the one holding the sceptor so now it is gone.
On change is that now Leonardo is the joke maker.
He used to be the serious one, but now he's making jokes with the rest of them.
so now its time to overall this film.
The turtles are back in time now.
The third outing for out heroes in a half-shell (if you don't know about them by now then start at the beginning before even attempting to endure this) provides us with some time travel shenanigans as the quartet find themselves being transported to ancient Japan to fight some angry folk and rescue April O'Neil (played once again by Paige Turco).
It looks like he's stuck in TV land now and even that's more than he deserves judging by his inept handling of our mean, green, fighting machines.
By the way, don't the turtles seem more plastic now than ever before?
There was acrimony, grief, rage, and a million other things that children's entertainment seems to believe we cannot really handle now or ever.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III, also known as Turtles In Time, picks up with the turtles milling around their sewer hideout with Splinter (who now looks like a shag carpet with eyes).
And since the most serious fans would all be at least twenty years old by now, well, let us just say this film has its work cut out for it pleasing even that audience.
This movie has creeped me out more than any other Horror classic ever could now and I'm far from the age I was when I used to be scared those films.
The first 2 had a rather believable Splinter but now he's juddering and stiff and obviously operated by a couple of technicians loitering a few feet off camera.
If you want to buy just one DVD because of the extras, you should get Phantasm if you can track down a copy(it's gone OOP now).
Scenes that were supposed to be serious like Aeris's death and when Tifa and a now vegetable Cloud tried to escape a destruction of this one village looked so ridiculous I couldn't help but laugh.
28 years later, Don Coscarelli is now seen as a master of horror and Angus Scrimm somewhat of a horror icon (though to a lesser degree than, say, Robert Englund).
What I received was a reminder that Oscars are given primarily for bold moves in the film industry (now no longer bold) and acting has come a long way since the 50s.
We're drowned, beat up, dogs on our tail - but hey, lets act cool right now and make it a point to have a puff or two before we say some really deep lines to each other.
Action leaps into high gear, there's some fairly graphic gore (including the now infamous flying sphere killing), there are plenty of scenes guaranteed to make you jump and the music score is very spooky...right up there with "Halloween".
It began in 1992, so the regular actors have now aged 15 years in a series that is supposed to span 10.
Gina in mini skirt and boots, trying to dance in 60s style just looks ridiculous now.
Please can it now!!!
This is a film that absolutely demands a second and third viewing....which is what I am about to do right now.
The show got cancelled and I have nothing but my memories of it for now.
I am now 17 I have never seen the movie again I stand by that assessment.
From an opening cross fade, we learn that the child murderer from part 3 is now grown up and been released from a mental institution.
It seems now that those lost souls are restless and rise from the lake to bring more company to the bottom of "Ghost Lake".
And now let's talk about the acting!
But not now.
And I still wonder how the lead-lady figured out the secret of "now is the 13th year, so they are going to kill 13 people", for instance.
This movie was a waste of time, I was bored and now I no longer care about it.
The main story line is the conflict between Rule and Fonda, especially over young Michael Shea whose father was killed by Aldo Ray and who Fonda has now taken over raising.
As you probably know by now, an impossibly brutal killer terrorizes a small town but no one has the courage to stand up to him.
He asks her "Are you happy now?
And now comes the mother of all dumb "highlights": the Irish woman stares at the dead "bad man" when - suddenly - he opens his eyes (he wasn't dead - the name is Jason Michael Myers) and grabs her hand violently.
I used to like these gen-x movies too, but now I find them irritating.
I admit I was lost now and then.
OK now look for my documentary on the subject...Its all fact because I said so.
"Thomas and the Magic Railroad" is a feel-good, happy-go-lucky children's film that is based on the long-loved "Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends" (now simply "Thomas and Friends") series of shorts.
I will never trust a documentary again: thank you Mr. Jones, thank very much for ruining a good and until now neutral genre.
Just like now, with Iraq and Katrina - there have been so many leaks, just because of a hurricane and a war.
And the whole ending, when Olivia sings on screen (which makes you go "wow, it's a musical now") but it's just a medley of pointless tunes sandwiched in between a truncated version of the song Xanadu.
Britt Allcroft quit and now they changed the show, and even the show's name.
I am now happy that I was too young to see it because I finally saw this film on television and there are a bunch of birds flying around and some down and out actors looking embarrassed to be there but nothing resembling the claws and eyeball on the poster art.
My daughter is now eight, and thankfully hasn't seen it for a while.
Well now you guessed it that's right voodoo time!
It also doesn't help that Pamela Stephenson's Lorelai character is beyond annoying, that Lois Lane barely appears in this movie at all (the Salkinds were punishing Margot Kidder for openly sticking up for Donner), that none of the plot threads are remotely satisfying, that Superman is now a bit player in his own movie, that Ken Thorne's abysmal and boring score continues to reduce John Williams' powerful fanfares to shrill and campy disgraces, that Richard Lester's disdain for Superman shows in his indifferent direction, and that the acting is all-around awful.
Superman/Clark Kent is now invited to his high school reunion where he sees his old high school crush and they hit it off.
I may have to re-think that now, after  having to endure watching this one again.
when i saw this for the first time i was more of a kid than now......a little kid and i was a big superman movies fan.....i even liked this one a bit....and when i see it right now i still enjoy some of it....it is enjoyable to see superman turn evil....it is the best part of the movie....or maybe the only good part of it......richard pryor is too dumb at some parts of the movie and the opening credits belong to a Charles Chaplin movie.....a bad Charles Chaplin movie........the musical score is not bad.....mostly because it is filled mainly with John Williams' music but still it could've been much better........the only excellent thing in this film is Christopher Reeve's performance......but the rest is disappointing....specially when the big computer battles superman....disappointing but certainly better than the fourth superman movie........** out of 5
Superman II was a very strong sequel despite all the production woes, but has not held up nearly as well as the first film, and now plays more like camp in many spots.
I have liked Cain since his `Lois & Clark' days, but he along (I was not too familiar with de Rossi and am now not interested in being familiar with her) wasn't going to get me to see a suspense thriller.
But now I wish I hadn't.
If you haven't figured it out by now, i hate Eric Roberts.
I know Eric Roberts career is now a bit of a joke starring in cable and straight to video films such as this , but he really does deserve much better and I look forward to seeing him play a memorable screen villain in a blockbuster someday
I am a fan of Bring it on but Bring it on again isn't what i have expected it to be.I thought the actors were better in Bring it on.The routines were not as good in bring it on again.When the movie was over I thought it basically just started and that they never had a very good ending.It was definitely not as good as the first movie.I thought they were going to go to the nationals but then the movie was over!Bring it on again would of been more enjoyable if they continued the movie until the nationals...like we don't even know how it ended!From now on I am never going to watch a cheer leading movie again but i will watch it if Kirstine Dunce comes back in a cheer leading movie!
First of all i would like to say that the producer of this is now labeled a moron because who would make a sequel with NONE OF THE SAME CHARACTERS okay?
Why is it that so many movie companies, insist on producing so many DTV sequels now a days?.
In fact I'll stop typing this right now, because that movie is still occupying my time, and not another second...
It is now having the same effect on my youngest son, who is also an avid Thomas fan.
As far as I've seen, Diesel 10 was never really evil before now (or afterwards, I'm not to sharp on the whole Thomas Chronology).
I use 2 be scared of it 2, but now that its 2005, the movie is so cheesy now.
Demonic Toys, Wax Works and all of the Puppet Masters are so lame now.
It's really weird 2 look back on all the things that scared u when u were younger, and look at them now.
He's still somewhat creepy I guess, but now it's nothing but good old humor!!
I don't know if Seagal is continuing to make Eastern movies now but this was all the better for it!
You can hear his heavy breathing throughout the film, seemingly suggesting that Seagal just carried a box of donuts up small flight of stairs and now he he needs to recover.
The main problem is that Seagal is too fat too be a real action-star right now.
For those who received as a present, you now know who of your friends wish you to go insane.
It subsequently turns out that Heather spilt her drink and that Marina gave her hers so now it looks as if Marina was the intended victim.
Worse, the Shining Time portions on TV are excruciating to watch...and now the whole premise is brought to a movie.
Why are all of the Engines now American?
Galaxy of Terrors is basically now known as the "Girl gets Raped by a Worm" movie.
So now the makers of this film owe me one.
If you're supposedly making a "horror" movie, learn about what is scary, not simply "ooh, it's zombies, and even though it's been done now a thousand times, people will think ours are great!"
When I read posts saying they thought this film wasn't very good but then they found out how low the budget was and now have new respect for the film...I cringe.
This film, now playing at the IFC center, is Claude Chabrol in rotten 'fois-gras' and Isabelle Huppert in a rotten package of canned meat,and yes, it really is that disappointing.
Believing that he commits justice by killing others, now the killer needs to accept that same justice being acted out against him.
And, now correct me if I'm wrong, but at the end of El Mariachi, didn't he have more of a fake hand than a real one?
Not a single cent, I tell you now.
I've seen it twice now and I really cant say anything nice about it other than the sex scenes were okay - but more on that in a moment.
It's about a man, now in prison waiting for the death penalty telling us how he got here.
So I think I'll go do that now instead of lingering any longer on it.
You might remember her as the lady flashing her fleshy wares at Sly Stallone at the start of Morton Lewis' incredibly dire PARTY AT KITTY AND STUD'S a/k/a Italian STALLION as the rest of the world now knows it.
The clips I'd seen were dubbed by some American actor, which looks ridiculous now that Arnie has become so established.
People complain about Arnold's accent now?
Although he'd already established himself as a body builder at this point, he continued to win more contests, became a huge international movie star, is now the governor of California, and might even be President one day, all with a thick Austrian accent.
Even though it was funny beyond words it is still a very very bad movie, everything in it, there is now faint sign of hope for any of those people who participated in it.
Oh yeah now I know it, mad!
I can see why it was despised in 1970 - it's only value as a cinematic artifact is achieved by it being almost 40 years later now, and how eerily the film predicted the rise of "reality" entertainment.
The very same things that Forster's lead character is hated for screening, those things now win awards and accolades and movie/TV career contracts.
SB is a real step down for director Cunningham after making the now classic FRIDAY THE 13TH.
By now, of course, Garfield could play characters like this in his sleep but nevertheless this is a fine example of late forties film-making.
so allow me to just sum up this movie for u then: (spoiler, but please be spoiled)  -Guy goes to a mountain shed in the snow to undergo an experiment with a doctor, guy gets killed, guy gets revived but now his eyes look exactly like those of master Poo in Kung Fu, guy gets killed another 9 times, gets revived 9 more times and then he walks back down the mountain.
Guy2: "now that u mention it.." Guy1: "I hate walking in the rain, don't u?"
Just a touch of originality would have elevated Donkey Punch to at least an average level, as it is now it is just not worth the time and investment.
Wow,...now that's an important and worthwhile goal!
I missed it so many times on TV I lost count...  Well, now that I caught it on late night TV, finally, I can say unequivocally I liked all the above better, except for Golden Boy and Rocky.
I'll just watch the U.S. shows now instead.
If a movie is based on a true story, it makes sense because the viewer is curious about where the characters are now.
It doesn't even try to tell the audience maybe from all this, something came out of it years and years from now.
But frankly: the combination of inane writing, random awkward silences, and annoying music forces me to turn it off about a third of the way through now.
I regret throwing away the Blockbuster receipt, since now I have no hope of returning this little slice of pointlessness.
But this movie had something else more precious and now legendary.
Chen Kaige was years ago a good director, but now he wanted to beat the attractions of Ang Lee's "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and Zhang Yimous "Hero".
it also anteceded 'Marty' the quintessential realist U.S.struggling migrant antihero movie Where are you Paddy Chayevsky now that we need you?
Then there are scenes over and over again where someone says, "OK you can go now.
OK, you can go now.
OK, you can go now..." I can safely say that best part of "The Promise" is when the credits roll, because you know it is finally over.
(They are Korean and Japanese) SO, what do we have here now?
Because "The Promise" showed that China now have the potential to shoot expensive, flat-out, meaningless, BAD movies like this one.
The kids go exploring the island and find the home of a 'dragon lady'-like scientist(Katherine Victor) that welcomes the teen visitors; now she will have more subjects for her experimentation with a secret formula chemical that will turn them into zombies.
Putting Ben on his payroll as his trainer, because he feels that he owes Ben something after what he did to him, Charlie defends his title a number of times but now he's up against a much younger and more formidable opponent then those he fought, Marlow.
Charlie also realizes what a jerk he's turned in now getting his brains beat out in order to enrich a bunch of gangsters who'll use him for as long as he's is still useful to them and when he isn't they'll drop him just like they did Ben.
The continuity has got so out of whack now that it appears they have taken the whole night to get back to the mainland.
The sound you hear now is Wells spinning in his grave.
While the film may seem formulaic now...let's remember it started the boxing formula!
Well you have my thoughts on this now.
Eddie, please, we need a good movie from you soon, I'm sure the only reason they decided to release this was due to your outstanding performance in "Shrek", now that was a good movie.
Murphy has become boring to watch and its sad to watch his films now.
Only in early Plantagenet times did 'virgins' shew their hair and matrons did not; by now it was normal for the tresses to be concealed behind the wimple on the rear of the hood.
I've been anticipating this movie for over 2 years now, ever since I first heard it was in production.
For example smoking wasn`t the social crime it is now , only white people were allowed to be catholics , commies existed and wanted to drop atomic bombs on the USA , young teenage boys could be looked after by priests without any suspicion and teenagers swearing was a certain sign that there were demonic forces at work .
Always on the lookout for interesting horror films outside of the mainstream, I went down to a now defunct mom and pop video store not far from my home and rented Lurkers and a couple of other flicks.
That was then, this is now.
Viewed now one can draw parallels between the Blob people's celebrity status and that of reality show contestants.
Inserting stolen Chuck E Cheese tokens now.
If you want a movie you can watch and step away from every now and then while doing your chores or other errands, this is the one to do it with.
This movie is just a mind-freeze - watch point A move to Point B and then to Point C - now go home.
Where is she now?
But Inga (Jane Duprez ) a Norwegian gorgeous girl to whom Eric was once betrothed is now a collaborationist of Nazis and she betrays them.
In case you aren't aware, it has now become standard practice for individuals with a vested interest in low budget movies to talk them up on sites like this in the hope that the public will pay money to watch them at the cinema or on DVD.
Sadly though, the whole film is pretty much like watching someone play a computer game - a nerdy kid who for a semester has spent all his lunch money on the latest arcade and now wants to impress his peers (and the girls) showing them he can beat it.
1" in the IMDb's top 100 (right now it holds position nÂ°56) is the biggest joke of the year.
If now Tarantino learns how to write interesting dialogues, he actually might be able to make an excellent film.
All of this is looked at as being brilliant by the critics and those in similar circles because Tarantino has a free pass right now.
His films have enamoured critics for 10 years now and this one is no different even though it is a shadow of the opulence that we are used to from him.
Farrah's blank 'oh my gosh' stares make for a dissonant counterpoint, her star must have been fading around now because we get some gratuitous boob shots.
All it is now is an at times entertaining SF romp with a good cast and a couple of really nice gimmicks, but those hoping for another cool genre milestone will be sorely disappointed.
And now I'll take a break from "spoilers", and just tell you the rest of the movie is JUST.
By now one of the news crew has gone missing and Goke kills Andy.
Mirko Crocop is one hell of a fighter when it comes to K-1, Pride FC and now UFC.
After watching this dreck, I now think, "Somebody lied to me."
Up until now, I have never stumbled upon a dollar DVD that wasn't worth a dollar.
Since this one actually irritated me enough to write and warn people off it; it now stands in my humble opinion as the worst film I have seen this century.
They are now 27 and 25 and this VHS cassette tape is now my treasured possession...  About 2 months ago, a cable station broadcasted a 1995 version of 'A Little Princess' which I have never seen before, I watched it and thought the content was a little different; therefore, I took out my recorded copy from PBS and wanted to compare the difference.
It's when the handsome and a bit skeptic, of Dr. Lombardi's psychic powers, Dr. TedErckson, Lance Fuller, comes on the scene that things really start to unwind with the by now mad Doctor Lombardi going so far as conjuring up this She, or Sea, Creature to do Dr. Erickson in.
now I have found it, I am going to try to add it to my collection.
I can't wait to see it again, but who knows, now that it has been 20 years, I may have different feeling to it.
When I went to see this movie, it was a "nothing good is playing right now, so let's just watch this" kind of decision.
Unfortunately, it is listed as "lost" now.
I'm not sure if you can buy it new but I really would love for Wonderworks (or whoever they are now) to re-release it on DVD.
I get it now.
Problem is that by now few viewers still had the patience to follow his "vision", that had strayed so far from the original (and, by comparison, very entertaining) "Nemesis".
"Criminal" offers no such special angle or special depth and tries to trade on nothing but the - by now hopelessly threadbare - fascination of lives led according to the principle of the double-double-cross and the "nothing is what it seems".
Precisely that, however, is the film's psychological downfall in the face of an audience which is - or which one would have assumed ought to be - as familiar by now with the conventions of this genre as it is with those of the mafia movie.
The cinema MUST surely have taught us all enough about the lives and work of conmen by now for us to find it ludicrously improbable that either of the two main characters would be willing to expose thousands of dollars of money already "in hand" in order to secure the alleged "sure thing" of a deal that is to net them many thousands more (after all, it is the endemic idiocy of such greed and of the general greed-driven tendency to forget the "bird in the bush" principle that is the very basis of a conman's livelihood).
Anyway, we are now in the present and the recently awakened warlock uses his scarecrow body to kill various Goodmans(..and others in his path)looking to retrieve his magical book of spells and reunite with his bones so that he can return to fleshly form even more powerful than he is as a walking man of string.
Nathan Jones was killed far too easily and too quickly and you can now see they'll be using the bomb each person is wearing on their ankle a lot as he was the 2nd one to go that way and the 3rd to die in total.
Full of love and tears for each other: I think I'm gonna sob now!
The game is now on for what is literally the fight of their lives.
Story is about Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) who manages a small and rundown gym called "Average Joe's" but with his pathetic group of members he doesn't make much money and now the bank needs $50,000 or they're going to take it away from him.
Or do the sons and grandsons of the "liberators" of Nazi Germany have to indulge now in their past, because the present does not look so glorious anymore?
If you have noticed, until now (July 2003), this movie doesn't have a "Goofs" category.
Actually, now that I think about it this film probably kicked off my love-affair (*cough*) with B-grade movies.
This stupidity is so over used, and has been boring for years now.
It's hard to remember now what an impoverished time the 1970s were for science fiction and superhero television shows.
I am actually suffering from writer's block right now, trying to think of something to say about this film.
Many of the best lines were references to the Stooges now being retired.
I am now determined to get every DVD going about them.
So I think, this is where the story will progress, act two, what now?
If the students do this every year, why do the people living in the mansion suddenly decide to kill off the students now?
People wander off and die every now and again until eventually it's just Linda Blair and the monster guy.
But now that all the clichÃ©s have been run into the ground, it's not worth a second look.
  Average sci-fi thriller movie back in 1973.But today due to numerous improvements on the ideas presented here,this movie is only likely to be enjoyed by the most avid sci-fi movie completist.The special effects here was ripped off by numerous 1970's sci-fi TV series like those countless Six Million Dollar Man/Bionic Woman shows.If one has seen those TV shows before seeing this movie,nothing comes out new or fresh.Come to think of it,the Six Million Dollar Man pilot episodes came out before this movie!So actually,the special effects here were not too original after all.Also,they were not content with the Six Million Dollar Man rip off,they even stole the actor who plays Dr.Rudy Wells in said TV show!No sirree.They can't pull a fast one on a guy like me who has seen a lot of movies and TV shows so I am NOT IMPRESSED at all and do not buy into the hype.So now what have we got?Story?The story looks to me like a reject script from a 1960's Twilight Zone episode.The story was too full of plot holes it's not funny.Yes indeed.
I forgot about him myself until just now.
By now he is a successful and famous novelist and impulsively decides to wrest back the woman he had deserted.
Considering that his child now is happy and only knows the other man as her father and the ex-wife seems happy, you can correctly assume that Olivier's character STILL is a very selfish and despicable man.
Secondly, they should have shown Olivier undergo a genuine transformation into a truly decent guy--not the same old guy who has mellowed some because he's now a successful writer.
anymore now that the Fox Family channel is dead & gone.  
Within the first forty-five minutes, Bridgette Wilson is already gone and there's nothing left but Famke Janssen, who does all she can as Geoffrey Rush's psychotic wife before she herself too, dies, and Ali Larter, who deserves so much better than this movie and can be seen in a much better movie right now, Final Destination.
She's married to Jesus now.
1. when her father disapproves of him & she tries to honour her engagement to another man - 2. when she feels too guilty to be with Gable now that her father's gone, because dad died while chasing her (!)
Too bad the film descended into contrived melodrama that only a masochist (or a repressed nun, but now I'm being redundant) could enjoy.
This just shows how completely irresponsible the PBS was as expressed by Pham Ngoc Bich "Hoang Phu Ngoc Tuong may have been the one to order the killings...now years later he is allowed to explain about what happened in Hue, it's equivalent to Himmler talking about the concentration camps."
The million dollar question now arises: How can one claim the greatness of action that requires virtually no effort whatsoever to create?
I prefer the Bastian of the show over the movies, because now he gets to be a boy.
Since they are a bunch of clumsy fools (buffoons), Kit easily figures out (with the assistance of her young buddies) that they're the one's who framed poor Will; he's soon exonerated and the police now arrest the magician and his buddy after they are exposed by Kit and company.
I always try to see the good things in movies and I never give a harsh criticism like other ppl-up until now.
It is nice to see that after a long and successful film career in the US that Mr Karloff decided to return to the land of his birth and make not only this film, but also others like 'Curse Of The Crimson Altar' which were shown on the big screen in the late Sixties and which are now shown regularly in Britain on television.
I used to know but cannot be sure, now.
Well they are already trying to get it done by spreading fear of identity theft and in general the gullible masses are now beginning to believe that the moment they input their credit card details in to a computer their immediately a victim of identity theft.
How about saying, "no, tell me about it now.
Watched this thriller Untraceable last night.Plot is like this in short.A total sicko killing people live on internet and each time the killer does it in different ways.If much people log in to the site the victim reach heaven quicker.Movie is not my cup of tea,i found it just plain boring.I barely watched the film to the end,felt like I all time did now what will happen.If you want to watch a movie with similar plot but better done go rent Italian director Dario Argentos Card Player(not masterpiece but a bit more inspiring film).On the + side is Diane Lane as agent Jennifer Marsh and let me think...hhm..sorry nothing more.Not a thriller for me and I do not recommend it.I give Untraceable only 2/10.
We now know why Wayne never did Hamlet.
It's girls for him now, especially this one.
The difference between the late 1970's and now could have been interesting.
the first highlander film was great the second and third were not bad but now its just completely lost its way.
The only good news that can come is that The Source has now been reached, and the series can now end, like another beheaded immortal or whatever the hell.
Why do the creators insist on changing the story concept, first the planet Ziest and now there can be only one but there can be more than one?
Bad enough Connor has his katana break, but now Duncan's too!
Hell the team and even him don't seem to be bothered with doing the production notes and b lo g on their own official site, so from that are we to take it they are re doing the whole thing to actually drill in some intelligent action with a spot of special effects and dash of story line that will blow our socks off, or should we take it that they simply have given up and are now hoping they can get away wit the slow progress of a crappiest produced film of the 21st century and I've now just read that its in fact going straight to sci-fi channel, How pathetic is that Im highly saddened by this because this was going to be the ultimate film for me to watch, I've been a highlander series fan for years and just gained the box set, so to know that they have simply destroyed and made a film worse than end game is soul destroying.
I think he got the idea now from the reviews of The Source.
It's probably started filming even now, after all it shouldn't take Mr Shell too long to muster up the 7 new pence and half a packet of wine necessary to complete production.
The performances are what make the film work, and while Mcfayden and Cox have the showier roles (and are excellent in them), it is really actress Eileen Atkins who emerges as the powerhouse performer in the complex role of a woman who has deliberately lived in denial--and who must now respond to a double-whammy that undercuts the very foundation of her existence.
Murray's Larry is not the pure soul who captivated a famous writer--he is the man from "Ghostbusters," trying every now and then to be serious.
Where is the truth about what happened to Anastasia's family, even if even now no one can be completely sure about Anastasia herself?
License to Wed   For quite a long time now, I've begun to think that I've become an easy-going critic about the movies I watch.
But now I realize simply that I have been watching good movies, and "License to Wed" is a healthy reminder to myself that I can still recognize the sight of horrid cinema when it veers before my eyes.
After Because I Said So and now this, I'm starting to wonder if she has some kind of bizarre fascination with women who make bad decisions for no reason other than to move the plot along.
Since we live in a more cinematic age now, you'll do it with appearance in addition to attitude.
Hmmmm...now the caviar and whores--THAT'S a clever plan.
Later I found out that it's an extra on the Criterion Collection version of Videodrome - so now I have to buy that.
Every now and then, Mr. Carradine, Swinger of Swords, does work in mysterious ways.
So I decided to buy this, and now I sort of regret it.
Maria Socas (the sorceress) goes about topless the whole movie, as you've probably heard by now.
Yes, now I know the "writer" watched Lethal Weapon.
Camera is the piece of film that made me realise the genius of David Cronenberg, even though I had loved most of the films I have seen by him I now have a more profound respect for him and I'm going to watch all of his work that I can get my hands into.
George Lazenby's daughter is found dead in one of Venice's canals and it is now up to him to find the killer.
What a mess this is; it's a lot easier now to understand why this was unreleased on video for so many years.
Moving now into semi-negative territory, I found Macey's going-wild subplot to be more than a little strange, but I guess that the purpose was to show the influence that Jayce's irresponsible behavior had on her younger sister.
All of them do seem pretty formula now in retrospect: an evil threatens but only the young protagonist realizes and has a difficult time making anyone else aware.
But now and after watching various episodes, I finally discovered how stupid a show Goosebumps is.
Even the books, now and after growing up, I found them to be poorly written and totally lame.
Miike is good at making weird original cinema, and I hope he sticks to that from now on, but this film was just a mess.
Asking a Wiccan-esque girl if she was a lesbian *may* have been funny on its own, say, a decade ago when every high school didn't have its own Wiccan chapter, but now it takes a little more insight to make that stereotype funny.
In the end, Pearce awakens and her feet are now horrific looking.
They do their job, except that, at the end, in an ironic coda, they substitute a more independent president who will now rule his country with compassion.
It does have an icy female villain well played by one Anne Twomey, who is now known only for her small part as the NBC exec who put the kibosh on Jerry's sitcom pilot on Seinfeld.
It's all academic now.
What follows is a traditional shootout that leads to the obvious conclusion, Django now triumphant proceeds to punish all those responsible for the death of his comrades and his in a similar fashion.
Hitchcock should never have accepted this lethal restriction given by the novel on which the movie is based, because from now on the movie spins around in trivialities.
The only good thing about "The Final Sacrifice" (noted so many times, it is now a cliche`) is that it was humorously torn apart by our trusty friends at "Mystery Science Theater 3000."
Dohwell... didn't expect that now did we?
Well, now they have about 50 minutes of screen time.
This is all for now.
This movie is so basically bad that it makes me wonder if I haven't been making excuses for Argento for some time now.
Mother and daughter now have to make important decisions about their future.
But that's also a little reassuring from the country that by now makes the most interesting movies in Europe.
He has been married but the marriage is now over, and he is a bitter man due to that.
He now has 11 of the twelve coins in his possession.
In fact, our protagonist is now shown adopting multiple disguises in order to accomplice his nefarious ends (a far cry from his head on brutality as displayed in the first two films!)
Possible inane plot spoilers  After having given us one of the bigger and more notable bombs in recent years with Pluto Nash, Eddie Murphy now brings us Daddy Day Care.
If you think your kids hate vegetables now, you'll never get them in the little tykes after they see this nonsense.
To top it off, I'm now in a sour mood as I think of the $8.50 I once had, and the almost ten dollars I had spent on popcorn and soda.
Now at this point, we start getting the fish out of water story, and our hopes are high that the fun will now begin.
Anjelica Houston, who should know better by now, plays the villain running a competing day care center.
Let me start off with the good things:  Okay, now that that's over, let me go to the bad things:   The acting was bad from everyone in the whole entire film, the comedy was not funny in anyway, the script was dumb and unamusing, the movie itself is nowhere near touching, heartwarming, or useful whatsoever, and it was really annoying and utterly ridiculous through most of the film.
I expect to hear Ving Rhames offer to get the horses for his "mastuh" any minute now.
It seems with Shooting Gallery Freddie is trying to show that he's serious now, and that he's left his Scooby Doo image behind.
Beyond that, there is also the question of whether humanity itself (presumably Western civilizations in particular) now saddles itself with unjust laws and punishments which do not "fit the crime."
and is now wealthy but living as a boatman/bum.
I'm watching the movie right now, and I feel like I have to do SOMETHING to get help...
The first of the 17 Scorsese films I've seen that I'll be avoiding like the plague from now on.
I now know better.
But even the saddest ones (and they now, because they have had a fight about who the saddest one was) can shift to a better life.
You can almost hear the director yelling "ok run 20 feet to your left, now stand there and cower, now run back to your right about 20 feet and cower, now look around and run back to your left and cower some more".
And the director doesn't shake the camera, it stays stationary as stage hands shake different parts of the set at different intervals, "shake the lamp and the curtains, now someone shake the wall and shake the chair, now shake the chandelier and drop the ceiling".
And remember, my "clever" pirate reference just now, is more hilarious than all the jokes in "Meet Captain Kidd", put together.
I can officially say now that this version is probably the furthest from the book, except perhaps the 1998 version.
Roddy Doyle's Barrytown trilogy was an affectionate, humorous but unsentimental look at life in the poor suburbs of Dublin; all three books have now been turned into films.
i'm giving it a "1" for awful because the writer's intent was serious, now if it was a spoof of an opera, that would be a different story.
While the animation and style of the movie aren't half bad, in fact (besides of background stuff and vegetation not exactly moving much and the characters seeming lifeless every now and then) it seems better than a lot other animated movies (except anything by Pixar or Dreamworks of course).
With a decent script this could've been a nice animated movie similar to say Shrek but as it stands right now it's somewhere between a 3-4 for me.
It's bad enough her husband had an affair with a sexy young blonde , now he's in all kinds of legal dodo.
It made me regret sitting thought the film, as much as I like Harrison Ford playing a bad boy now and then.
The irony is, of course, that if it hadn't been for the futile efforts of a handful of politicians, Britain's right-wing newspapers and certain clueless activists, the film would have been long forgotten by now (along with many other titles on the list).
LISA, LISA (aka AXE) is one of the 74 entries on the notorious video nasties list compiled in the UK by the DPP (now CPS) back in the 1980s.
Apparently, i know it now, the directors are part of a new generation in the Hong Kong cinema, and they've produced some hits on that basis.
Ok, now i've read the other review on imdb where a guy tell us that Mickey is in the movie just once and for about five minutes but it's not true; believe it or not Mickey is in the movie just once but for three minutes!!!
This monstrosity of a film was cheekily re released again to look as though it was a new Uma film, I have seen it floating around on DVD in second hand shops and car boot sales on numerous occasions - and now I know why.
So now that Chicken's reputation is back the second time, his movie is changed to a Sci-fi Trek flick.
The result is a mind-numbingly dull piece of Euro-sleaze that now shares top spot with Mondo Cannibale on my Crap Cannibal Movie list.
When one of the crooks rapes the Spanish wife, the husband leads the crooks to the cannibals and now there is Hell to pay... yeah, right.
Bedrock looks OK you can easily see that they've spent a lot of time working on it trying to make it look just like the cartoon but the story compared to the one the cartoon has is a definite insult just look at the ratings that this movie has here at IMDB 4.4 right now (March 7th 2000) those guys at Universal should have back in 1993 (when they were writing the script) well the story is really bad let's make a movie combining 4 of the most popular episodes in one story that would have been a very good idea I'm sure that it would have had made much more money than the 358.5 million it made worldwide even though that is a lot I know that if they had a better story it would have like 500M or more.
But then again, I and people around me were literally (and I'm actually not exaggerating now, this is true) were laughing out loud in a handful of scenes from the horrible, horrible dialogue and embarrassing acting.
I have warned you now.
All in all, I'm glad I'm older now because I can see the errors of my ways, and the errors of others ways as well.

Again said narrator would convince you that all these incidents are happening now.
They are NOT happening now!
You would think they would of learned to make a better Street Fighter movie by now.
It almost makes me think Hollywood is racist cause the first movie was on Guile( who was played by a french guy)...great casting there...and now this street fighter, Chun-Li is played but Kristen Kreuk...While I really didn't have much of problem with Kristen playing Chun-Li, I think they could of found someone more true to Chun-Li's character.
I finally picked it up for free using a coupon and now I regret wasting the gas to pick it up.
If I had known, what I know now, not too judge a book/film by its cover, i would just have rented one of the LoTR movies again.
Pauly, Give up now!
More than that, though, since Shore has been out of the A-list spotlight for a decade now, you never know how much of this movie is fact or fiction.
Although some people loved Sandler during his "Billy Madison" and "Happy Gilmore" days and hate him now, Sandler's still famous because he grew up.
But, from early on to now, they're really went downhill: Encino Man: The first film where Shore had leading role.
But now the main question arises that "Did it live up to the 1981 Classic made by Muzzaffar Ali?".
The 1981 film by Muzaffar Ali with Rekha in the title role is humongous in every department and J.P.Dutta's version now appears to me as an arrogant film-making by a director.
To rate the film is now very difficult.
Well, now I know where Tin Soldier (1995) and Bogus (1996) came from, though why there was a need to make the same dull, silly movie THREE TIMES I can't tell.
Irina Palm is one of those quirky off-beat Brit flicks that you come across every now and again.
All in all a well worth the trip out but as its now playing at Art house cinemas might be a little bit tricky to find.
One last thing and I promise I'll stop talking about the rating...I figure that anyone who takes movies seriously (aka younger kids) is now deathly afraid that their grandparents or someone else's grandparents are now going to kidnap them and hijack a plane with them.
As a kid, the show had appeal, but as many other reviewers have noted, 15 or so years on you can just see it in it's true colours, cheesy, corny and now even a little dated.
In fact we're working on a MST style script for it now.
Every now and then a remarkable small film is made.
I hope that years and years from now, when all the old msties get together and lament the movies that never got the MST3K treatment, this movie will rank at the top.
Chiana now has Matrix-style moves and magic eyes.
I have been taunting my cats with it for days now, even emulating the singer's voice and gestures.

The woman had previously killed about 50 bajillion armed gangsters single handedly, and now she has a small length of rope around her wrists (her legs are fine), she can't fight off an overweight, middle aged, unarmed business man?
The canard that the Amerikan Military has even a shred of respect for peoples whom they are inculcated to believe are alien enough to warrant massacring, is stridently converse to what we now know to be the truth about ANY war situation.
He gets a burst tyre and turns into a garage, when he returns to his car the reports now say a dirty bomb was detonated.
now i've got to admit i saw lionsgate and thought oh thats the b-movie company, and i was surprised that they had made a non-horror movie for the cinema.
So now comes the awful second half.
Why then were we shown, in earlier scenes, cops taking people off streets by handcuffing them and bundling them into vans, but now find out that they're ignoring everyone gathered outside the hospitals?
So, we now know there has been widespread contamination outside, we know that the wife was very close to the initial explosions when they happened downtown, we know that she has been exposed to this dust for days and we expect that she must now die.
They grab the wife and then .... tell the husband that his non-air-conditioned house has incubated the bomb's organisms and the sealed environment has meant that his house now has a deadly concentration of same.
I used to appreciate "Conversa da Treta", but now with the movie it lost all the fun!

The same boring ramblings in the TV show now occur even more in the movie.
Even Land of the Dead wasn't that great (mainly due to studio interference)   So now we have Day of the Dead.
It's no wonder the film has been sat on the shelves of the studio for a year now.
We can now only hope and pray that George brings us back to where we should be with Diary of the Dead.
It's the new generation of directors job to make these films now.
with such turd-shaped gems as creepshow 3, day of the dead 2 and now this piece of garbage under their belts.
They discovered that one of the scientists who worked on the project that started the virus has now become a zombie and is in the complex they are in.

It is now in the public domain so you can see it for free.
The dialogue and characters are fantastic and the penguin sub plot is genius...  Buy it now.
it hits a cliff not knowing what they did they made their parents break up the brothers cry now this is THE WORST CRYING I HAVE EVER SEEN and I have seen Muriel's Wedding and that scene in Charlies Angels 2 where Drew Barrymore thinks her friends have died the mother says it's not their fault but the father snaps some logic in them and say it is their fault and anyway Ferrel bury's John C Reilly alive and how he got past the broken up parents I don't know and Reilly gets out and they decide to grow up (they decide to stop acting like overgrown 4-year-olds and get a life) and Ferrel works with his brother and he does some festival or some crap and Reilly's the chef and the band doesn't show up so what does the father do he says go and act like overgrown 4-year-olds and do that band and Ferrel's voice changes everything in the movie (except thee quality) and the younger brother who his co-workers chant something extremely disturbing until that voice came on he decides to make peace with the brother so the movie changes from some 40-year-old losers acting like 4-year-olds to a gay finale like in High School Musical and Hairspray oh and Ferrel entered Therapy earlier in the movie and that stupid voice made the therapist in love with him but we change from a Gay finale to Ferrel and Reilly beating the crap out of little kids who earlier in the movie forced them to lick dog crap which I don't want to know how it became white.
Putting your balls on a drum set, 'gina jokes and all that tasteless humour is beyond me now.
Yes, we're expected now to put down our barf bags and pick up a tissue box.
The film was reasonably well filmed and reasonably edited and it's great that there is now a film out there about a synth pioneer.
So all in all - it's great that there is now a film about this fascinating guy.
The solution to saving the hero from his problem re how to "stay" in "now" is one of those tedious ideas that "love will do the trick.
The fools also, though by now it's obvious that the little men are afraid of the light, never turn on the lights.
Her husband, now starting to believe her a little bit, leaves her in the house to go have a chat with the handyman.
I'm much better now.
A little bit of comedy in action films is okay now and again, but considering the ridiculously high bodycount and number of innocent people murdered in this movie, she seems very out of place.
This being a cheesy 80s slasher flick, those rumours eventually prove to be trueÂwell... almost: Beth turns out to be the only survivor of the massacre, now all grown up and lacking any memory of her childhood trauma.
Basically the plot centers around the fact that a college student has a mental block about the killings of her family members and the fact that the sorority house where she is now living is the place where the killings took place (nevermind the fact that a sorority would buy a murder house to begin with, thats far fetched enough).
May be the American people are bound to believe now one of MW's quotes: Canada's Crime rate is twice as high, as the US's.
Left alone now the white collar crime, that ripped of Middle Class Stock Investors, where the corporations loaned money to Deadbeats to make statistics look better and to raise their profits.

This time, he couldn't be bothered, as if he felt that he'd paid his dues being accurate in the first two movies, and now he should be free to play around and have fun.
This film, originally titled Outer Touch but now called by its American title, Spaced Out, is getting a bit of a cult following though why this should be is a bit of a mystery because it isn't really that good.
Sterne agrees to look into Weiss's claims but eventually admits there is nothing he can do, especially after Weiss gives him some newspaper cuttings from 1944 which appear to show Olivier but since the paper is over 30 years old and Olivier would now be in his 60' or 70's and the guy on T.V.
She is haunted by the memory of being attacked by a serial killer and has now become the new unhealthy interest of a copycat serial killer.
And now another horrible movie where Mandy has turned her back on the sweet and innocent image that helped set her apart as different from the Britney Spears and Christina Aguileras.
It's such a shame and such a waste to think of what a nice image she used to have, and now this.
This kind of behavior is now acceptable?
Oh wait..include a hip soundtrack to help substitute good writing and acceptable acting ....yeah thanks ...I'm buying it now.
Many felt it in "The Million Dollar Hotel" and now "Land of Plenty" makes it perfectly clear; not only has Wenders lost it, he's actually turned into a BAD director, creating horribly weak and superficial stories and scenes.
It's taken for grated now his films are heavy-handed and bombastic.
Yes, that was Wenders' best and he should understand now he needs a good scriptwriter.
You may get hit with a bus and never get to see this film if you leave it any longer, so go now, stop everything and enjoy Gregory's Girl.
The film as it stands now seems to be about four films blended together, which is about right since the heist, the cops, the zombie and what ever else all seem to be in different films made at different times.
Every now and again a cinema house comes out with a film so good it makes you want to weep and this is one of those films.
It would be interesting to read the book now that I've seen a couple versions filmed to see what was included or dumped in each one.
My low rating for this film is due to the story and the characters; it just was not engaging enough to make a really good story, and now that I have seen it once, there is nothing in it that would make me go back and watch it again - unless, maybe I was an Elvis fan.
Jobe has become a genius, he has a hot blond girlfriend who loves him, can now read minds, has the telekinesis ability, and he is angry because some guy called him retarded?
What does he plan to accomplish now that he controls everything that is electronic?
Imhotep's (Arnold Vosloo) mummy has been brought back to life, and he wants the bracelet of immortality, which is now in the hands of Rick and company.
If you are so starved for frontal nudity, I guess you could turn the sound off and get a few nice bodies to look at now and then.
Having thus seduced them into bliss, she exits with her man, while the shrewish liberal harpy who'd exploited her worst of all now finds her own happy ending onstage, crowing out a song which succinctly condemns every facet of humanity without discretion, or any sense at all.
I already own a copy of this pretty diabolical feature and can tell you right now that it certainly WON'T be getting a decent DVD release.
It made a refreshing change from American high school movies which, then as now, generally used established actors in their late twenties or even thirties; the unkind joke about Stockard Channing's character in "Grease" was that she would leave school when she passed her exams or had her menopause, whichever happened first.
The pleasures to be found for me now are the reminders of what a beautiful and electric actress Faye Dunaway used to be.
The Arrangement is ostensibly Elia Kazan telling his story of his relationship with a tyrannical father which is the root cause of the middle aged angst he now faces.
But now, 19 years later is truly an embarrassing movie for everyone concerned.
I don't even know why I bothered going to see it now, but I suppose that the good reviews in UK film magazines won over my doubts.
Rather than a middle aged CIA administrator, Ryan is now a young handsome PhD with little Washington experience.
I guess its not "politically correct" to feature the actual type of real world Middle Eastern "gentlemen", with the aid of foreign government sponsorship who even now are striving, again in reality, to make weapons of mass destruction to use against us?
It's not even so much that the Nazis-as-bad-guys thing is an overused, now out of date cliche as much as the idea that they were Middle Eastern terrorists in Clancy's book and the writers and director Phil Robinson changed them smacks of pure political correctness.
By now the dwarfs have warned the witless Snow White to not open the door and let anybody into their house.
Thus my story about girl who offed scum bags just because they knew they could...now became a story about girls who were abused, etc and so on.
This annoying troll managed to be more obnoxious and unfunny than folks like Chris Tucker or Uncle Joey from "Full House"--now THAT'S bad!
Ron Slinker, wherever you are, whatever you are doing right now, you are my new action adventure movie hero.
And now this, the final installment in the triumvirate of films about dashed dreams and unfortunate morals.
And now he takes a totally different approach: The Family Movie.
OK, now on to Rebound.
), and now he works his job uttering such unique catchphrases as ÂMan, I love Mondays'.
At the beginning of the film, we read that last decade 3,600 lives were taken due to terrorist acts around the world, but due to American's stable political system, the U.S. has been safeÂuntil now.
It's now in 1973 when Gatanebo's coffin is being shipped back, from PÃ´rto Prince Haiti, to the Museum of Natural History in New York that he suddenly comes alive.
Freddy now Gatanebo's Zombie slave will now do anything that his master Gatanebo tells him to even murder.
In doing that, having Dr. Craig murdered, Gatanebo as Dr. Carig can now be as close as he'll ever get to his old flame Kenya or now Sylvia Dr. Kessling's secretary.
Most of the reason for wreaking havoc seems to be that his long-lost lover, Kenya, seems to be on board, but Kenya is played by a different actress than the woman that this man now has his sights set on, Sylvia.
So, while Moreland might have been a negative role model in one way, in another he showed that a Black man can be very bright and articulate as well (now THAT'S a first in film).
We're given no credible reason whatever why Shirley stays with him, and when she seeks work as a dancer at her former place of employment it seems like a smart survival tactic, but this is where the story's true thesis kicks in: John is now the parasite because he's living off his wife's earnings.
and showed a taxidermized Pug (the most respected of all dogs in the nation) with an eye that doesn't fit, now it looked like the eye just popped off!
The Animal Liberation Front of Teryl (Teryl is my fictional country, I made it since I was in 4th grade, I'm in 12th grade now!)
Come on now.
Well once again a DVD box at the rental store drew me into a wasted night.Who could resist a movie that claims to have been banned in 37 countries?So ,even though by now I should know better,I rent this thing and take it home.
Brave as i am i sat through and don't know why by now.
Still some good gags now and then.
I just hope this means that the original will become available on DVD now.

As I write this comment right now Dracula's Curse has a lowly IMDb user rating of 1.6 so considering 1 is the lowest any user can rate a film 1.6 (this will probably change over time but not by much) is just about as low as a film can get & one has to say that Dracula's Curse really does deserve that rating.
There are so many things wrong with this film, the story is awful as it's some sort of horrible low budget cross between the Blade & Underworld franchises as the film portrays the now clichÃ©d hidden Vampire society living within our own & a team of specialist Vampire hunters dedicated to eradicating them dressed in silly outfits & using 'cool' weapons.
From Ellyn Bache's novel about the feisty mother of seven boys, most of whom are now grown and out of the house, still worrying after them, concerned over their health and safety, which eventually puts a strain on her sanity.
Frank Tashlin's 'The Swooner Crooner' is a cartoon I never saw on TV as a child and seeing it on DVD now it's clear why it was kept off children's TV.

I was really keen on seeing this film and now that i have i'm totally disappointed.
OK, now for the meat of it.
You quickly become confused as to which dumb blond is getting hacked on now, but you resign yourself to not really caring since the movie is just so bad.
I could just see them in the offices now...  "Sir its about the game Manhunt" "Whats wrong with it" "Well, theenemies AI..." "Is that all" "No there's also the sluggish combat, poor graphics, repetitive game play, its boring and when you get into a fight you just end up taking turns hitting one another till someone drops, should we scrap it?"
And in the last scene of the movie, Brooks is alone with the coffin containing the now thoroughly cremated Nielson.
Jokes which I can imagine my 15-year-old self repeating ad nauseam in the schoolyard, now fall flat and wearisome on inured sensibilities.
I guess if you are already chuckling at the idea of Leslie Nielsen playing Count Dracula you will probably enjoy this movie... but he can do these kinds of movie is his sleep by now... he doesn't really do anything that he doesn't done better before.
(Hey, maybe if he'd played that part in "Van Helsing" instead of Hugh Jackman... now that woulda been something worth checking out!)
I remember in 1997 when it came out I didn't watch it now ten years later I disgusted with the movie.
Until now, I must have seen everything except talent.

Does one's tolerance for excitement diminish so much with age that I myself would consider this watchable 20 years from now?
In reading this book again, I realized that the "child" is now a young man of 25 - the same age his mother was when she was murdered.

Marvin plays American bank robber Jimmy Cobb who is on the run and now in France.
As it stands it's almost impossible to find a copy of this now--that's a good thing!
Whilst being hunted by Madman Marz, shrew-faced woman does what I now refer to as an 'Indiana Jones', and, despite the contents of the appliance being scattered all over the floor, the killer is duped.
The beginning story teller describes the killer's crimes in detail - he was a farmer who butchered his family one night and now murders anyone he can get his disfigured paws on.

The show has always been sort of predictable, but now I usually know what will happen before it does.
In this case, Disney too now focuses on that genre, disregarding their natural talents and hire an animation company called Jetix (the same company that creates the truly awful Super-Monkey-Robot-Yada-Yada-Wha?
Up until now, I have never seen a horror movie that I didn't like.
"Basilisk" is on right now, the latest CGI monster flick from Sci-Fi, inspired by medieval bestiaries (remember "Manticore"?).
Is that enough lines now?
Though she was able to pull it off just a few years before in "Clash by Night" and "Jeopardy", by 1957 Stanwyck was now 50 years old and simply no longer convincing as a sultry love interest.
The number of Oscars they won, totaling six - two for Davis and four for Hepburn - meant nothing because Hepburn won one for MORNING GLORY, which is now a historical curiosity, and one for GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER, which she knew was a joint one for herself and Spencer Tracy, while Davis' first Oscar was not for Joyce Heath in the badly written DANGEROUS.
I Love You Alice B Toklas may have been cutting edge social commentary in 1968 but now it looks as weary and worn out as its dramatic counterpart, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.
The communication is almost eighty years old, wouldn't they have gotten around to it by now?
Like when The cute virgin is pulled apart by whatever, the two friends find her and says "now that's just stretching it."
If you are looking to watch Turkish made space movie-check out Gora.It 2004 made movie ,it broke all the records.Cem Yilmaz whom i believe the funniest guy in Turkey now is in it.
Okay first i want to say even if i'm a Turk i don't like these type of movies but still i wanted to say a few things.The first movie 'DÃ¼nyayÄ± Kurtaran Adam' was a total disaster everyone in Turkey makes fun of it because it was made seriously as a sci-fi movie and they stole many things from Star Wars.But the second movie is a comedy.Now the MOST important thing in a world class comedy film is to make EVERYONE on the planet laugh,but it doesn't mean that you have to make everyone laugh to make an ordinary comedy movie,i read that one commenter said that its not even close to funny,now i'm from turkey and believe me there are MANY European and American movies people from here don't laugh at and there are many movies you people don't laugh at,this films aim is Turkish population because Turkish sense of humor isn't same with the others,actually EVERY countries sense of humor is different with other countries so MY OPINION is that it doesn't make sense to say 'not even close to funny' to a 'comedy' movie that isn't in your country because it may not suit your sense of humor but people here liked it not very much but still they liked it,so please make your comments on comedy movies according to these things..i'm sorry if my English was bad..

Three things Green has never been accused of, until now.
Unfortunately, the old "B's" done this way needed padding to get 30 minutes of story up to 60 minutes of feature film, but now is needed over an hour to reach the post-modern 10-reel standard.
Unfortunately, relief is brief, because now there's not enough film-time left to do anything with this 'new' tack in any detail.
We follow their preparation and the heist itself, including the now famous mini coopers.
First "Vidocq", now "Le Pacte des loups".
The I am the Walrus segment of this is so strange, with an already out there song, now made in to a music video where they were walrus heads and cut to random fires and John Lennon dressed as the egg man.
Please ignore me now as I crawl into a fetal position under my desk and die.
Because its about a school for girls and 99.9% of the movie is filled with women (now I know why the director's name is Lucky) you can't expect Bruce to have a big part, however his part is vital towards the end of the movie.
It didn't help that the part they wrote for him was as a spoiled brat who needed his buttÂ.. (I wish I would call an adult who is now my mother by her first nameÂ.)
The boss barks "Fix it now"!.
And occasionally the filmmakers' cursory stabs at even the most predictably stereotypical storytelling degenerate into freak-show gawking, as when the camera, now close up, leers pornographically at the jumbled tattoos of a wretched trailer-denizen or lingers, almost mockingly, upon the painfully unfortunate physiognomy of one of the twice-born.
I'd been awaiting this film's release for over a year now, and finally, after a bunch of problems with editing and whatnot, this movie got a DVD release.
Let me say that I know now why I managed to snag the first three in the series for a measly $12.
The comments already placed cite MJ as a 'freak' 'weirdo' and sexual deviant and yet these comments come from people who lives in areas where guys are now permitted to marry other guys, men change sex to women and George Bush to get another term as president.
Living as a boy, so are all men now men, I still enjoy the sound of my own wind is this classed as Manish?
Do yourselves a favour next time you want to watch this stuff turn it off and pick out a movie doc like 'When we were Kings' now that is art

Notwithstanding the fact they quietly walked away unharmed at the end of the first film, they're now being taken away in ambulances and under massive police supervision.
!What kind of crap does MTV come up with?Sure, there's your every now and then GREAT show on MTV, but usually there's dumb excuses for entertainment like The Real World aired.
For you kids who watch MTV now you probably think MTV never did.
Since a large proportion of the market for them is now the late night film showings provided in most hotels, they generally continue to incorporate some nudity to add eye candy to their appeal and also frequently include soft-porn sequences showing simulated sexual couplings, often with little or no relationship to the story line (which can sometimes be squeezed right out).
The film takes you to the famous Spaun ranch and shows pictures of then and now.

It becomes more desirable to spend what money you have now (why save money you're going to earn almost no interest on?
It's always preferable to have things now than have things in the future.
So if a store offers you a plan where you buy a TV interest free for six months, then you can just say, "So what if I have don't have the money now, I'll have it in six months.
If I buy the TV now, then I can enjoy the benefits of having the new TV and put off the costs of paying for it.
I actually didn't get to watch this film until 2009, about 2-1/2 years after its release and now the current economic troubles only serve to marginalize this film and its Republican bashing tone.
The dogs are removed from her home on the basis that Peggy is now MALTREATING ANIMALS.
I could quibble about some elements now, but this is, at essence, a story of the heart.
This woman is now totally unbelievable as an actress and casting her as some girl next door character just doesn't work anymore (especially when you see how difficult it was for the makeup people to hide the bags under her eyes).
They need to make more movies like this now.
But then, to make a number of idiocies just for the sake of disobeying the authorities, that was considered cool in the late 1960s (and also now, at least in the movies).
and "OK OK - I know now that you have a lot of different drugs with different effects, will anything actually happen soon?".

now i would like to say this is one of the best movies i have ever seen.
To be honest I'm not done watch the movie right now, and it seems nothing will really change my review on this movie cause it's almost over.
if you want zombie classics, re-visit the dead trilogy(now quadrilogy)or evil dead films - don't waste your time and money on this.
There are maybe 15 or 20 people in the audience listening to them talk one of which is some goth guy whose face says "please shoot me now".
I try to go down to Selma every now and then and I always think about this beautiful story and film - and all of the wonderfully real characters... the story is so touching and melancholy.
I never watched it until now (May 09) and I wish I had just not watched it at all.
In fact in the mid sixties a huge Jewish center (now the Bronx Museum of the Arts) and the Executive Towers co-op, the tall white building seen in the background of shots taken from behind home plate at Yankee Stadium, were built.
Unfortunately, his plan works too well and all the squares in Washington are sent packing and the good old US of A is now run by Frost and his hippie friends, man!
Riddick, who was just a simple convict in "Pitch Black", is now transformed into something called a Furyan, some sort of super warrior race that was wiped out by the other races or by the big bad Necromongers (what a stupid name!)
Three years pass and she's now happily married and pregnant again.
Ruben Carter was never, by viewing his actions in the 60's and even now, when he refuses to speak to his son, a person that people can look up to.

Let it end now!!!"

You've Been Framed was one of those programmes that as a kid I found hilarious, but it doesn't appeal to me now.
Then Lisa Riley from Emmerdale did it for 5 years, then Jonathan Wilkes did it for a year, now Harry Hill does it, who I don't find paticulaly funny.
Well I do declare they got the whole South in this movie and they is just about as racist and ignorant as anyone you ever wish to meet....heaven forbid I feel like I must have a mint julep now.
From now on, if I see either actors headlining a movie, I will lower my expectations quite considerably.
Surely they have had plenty of opportunities for experimentation before now.
They could have rebelled (even secretly) before now.
To the movie's credit: the IMDB user who said that the plot was implausible (I couldn't tell if they were being sarcastic or not), the sad truth is that it's totally plausible that that exact thing is going on in Laurel Canyon right now (I live a block away).
It's probably going on right now, including the bad acting, shallow personalities, bad music, hippie mom, yadda yadda yadda...
For instance, The Three Bears are now humans, with Baby Bear as a simple-minded giant, Papa Bear as a fast-talking midget and Mama Bear as the stern matriarch of the trio.
Since then I tried hard to get any possible copy of it and now it is available on DVD... now, after 20 years, I think this is truly one of the silliest martial art flicks I've ever seen - and I've seen tons of them.
There's a good story here and clearly Marc Anthony, who's as good as his wife is bad, is the man to act in it, but the film as it exists now is really pointless.
Right now it has a 6.6 - that is a failure of the rating system.
har har: she should see the stuff i watch now.
I recently watched it again (I'm now 15) and I can still see why I was so afraid.
The majority of "10"'s this film recieved makes me now believe that every person that contributed to its making went online to vote.
I just downgraded them to my "B" list from now on.
I believe it now and wish I hadn't bothered; A Night to Dismember is not recommended.
Daniel Bernhardt stars as Alex Cardo, a thief who learns how to fight after he is sent to prison, seems he is in prison due to him trying to steal a sacred sword, however now trained in the arts of martial, he sets up to redeem himself in the kumite.
Amount of disappointment I am getting these days seeing movies like Partner, Jhoom Barabar and now, Heyy Babyy is gonna end my habit of seeing first day shows.
I must fill out a few more lines to submit this, and with the videotape still in mind I now submit these lines:   nose breathing is not funny.
By now, you most likely know what this film is about.
I think that we should all know by now that technical wizardry is not nearly enough and that audiences are smarter than what the smart ass marketing experts seem to think.
long beach is portrayed as a pathetic, once grand, now completely burned out ruin of a resort, with drugged-out losers and detritus scrambling about the broken down boardwalk.

Jeff Daniels, the actor now, finds out that his character took the unprecedented action of stepping offscreen.
- is this supposed to be a comedy or a soap opera love story now?
"OK Mr. Wade, that'll be enough, now get back on your horse, we have a train to catch."
I won't waste time repeating a lot of the films other irregularities, but that run through town with the citizens and gang now trying to kill them, I mean let's get real.
I'm getting corny and about now is where I realize that there's nothing else specific that I can substantially comment on.
These realities confuse Tom since he never was in a movie like the world that he's in now.
I have to go toss my cookies now.
The jokes just die most of the time, and despite the efforts of a cast (including Leslie Nielsen, now a veteran of this kind of thing) that tries hard, the material just doesn't work.
Ex-CIA operative Nick Randall (Rutger Hauer) now works as a lone-wolf bounty hunter in L.A.
The voice acting is more wooden than Keanu Reeves (now that's not something I ever expected to type!
The very poor animation looks like this was made in someone's bedroom (actually I think now you could do a better job at home) and the storyline is nearly non existent.
There used to be a time when it didn't matter who was doing the voiceovers and the goal was to create a dynamic and visually impressive experience, not any more it would seem; now we have to have names to fill up the posters and get people in Â but get them into what?
There is one occasion when the animation threatens to pull through and that's when the hero and his girl are above the sea level watching the moon Â the ripples in the water and clouds above seem impressive enough, but that's when you realise the two fish have been above the water for so long, they would've 'drowned' by now.
But now it's in the back of the pile and it never comes out.
It's interesting as a novelty piece to look at where Shakespeare presentations were, and where they were aiming to be, four decades ago; certainly we have a different emphasis now, as actors forty years from now will no doubt reinterpret the bard in their own fashion (android Iago?).
I've used the word awkward twice now, but it sums it up.
The Alibi feels like a premise in search of a plot: Steve Coogan's an ex-con man who's spotted a gap in the market and now provides alibis for cheating husbands and wives only to find himself in the frame for murder when one of his clients accidentally kills a woman.
See most of the other movies which are out right now because this one has to be the worst of them all...with the exception of Pitch Black.
Are those times past us now?
The end is obviously open for a sequel...I say, bring back Ridley Scott or James Cameron for the love of all that is holy...because they are the only ones that could save this franchise now.
In fact, now that I think about it, it had all the trappings of a Spielberg movie.
If ever Paul Anderson was going to step up and be a real director, the time was now.
Cause the pain is so much worse now.
Paul Anderson obviously hates the fans of the franchises and has been hating them for a while now.
Face-huggers now fall off within minutes of attachment, the gestation period for the chest-bursters is now also a few minutesÂ.and, to top it all off their blood is only sporadically acidic.
Never mind that the audience which kept both franchises in the black are now either in their mid-twenties or middle-aged.
He has already ruined other franchises with his previous films, and now by directing and writing Alien vs.
Yet in this movie it was like, "Oh the Aliens have been on Earth the entire time and it wasn't really that bad now that we think about it."
Male Technician: The is now.
Mads Mikkelsen does a good job definitely but i really missed Kim Bodnia cause his role was far more intense and now i've heard that his not in pusher 3 neither is Mads!
Seen this clichÃ©d piece of film-making tonight; now I want my money back; extremely disappointing film on all levels.
Writers have got to learn that audiences are sophisticated enough now to find such clichÃ©s embarrassing, rather than cool.
A whole host of things but all of those things would make everyone else who is looking at this now, turn away.
What is it about J.J. Abrams that he keeps getting bad shows (and now bad movies like MI:3 and Cloverfield) on the air?
I was quite amused by the first series of Alias and am now ploughing through series 4, having seen the quality drop remorselessly since the opening.
I was interested to see what happened with Rambaldi but I think I realise now nothing ever will; we will just continue going round in circles since any form of conclusion will kill any form of suspense however minute.
I now watch it looking to see how many times they use the word protocol (loved the inferno protocol - hard to top that for over-thetopness) and to see if the actors will surprise me with a new expression beyond their stock-in-trade bemusement (Vaughan), bewilderment (Jack Bristow) etc.
The Last Broadcast is going to start making some dough now that it's riding on the Blair Witch's coattails, and unbelievably, some people are saying that it's better than TBWP.
As it stands now, the 'twist' at the end barely made sense, and although I understood what they were trying to portray, it came across as a cheap ending, a 'it was all a dream' sort of conclusion.
And that's what really matters, now isn't it?
First you have a scene break and suddenly there are these "teen movie" cheerleaders doing a choreographed dance to the song, all looking into the camera like a music video as if to say, "I want you now, 15 year old in the audience.
Bancroft and Compson won Oscar nominations in the early days of the award and are pretty much forgotten now, but they serve up sparks here in this terrific film.
Frankly, it has not aged well and having now watched it for the first time in 2007 it made me roll my eyes in disbelief.
When I was 9, I thought it was cool to have a kid be a Power Panger...now I look back on it and cringe...they must've been desperate to keep people interested.
And I do believe that we've already had a classic animated series in the '80s featuring cars turning into giant robots and it has a hit movie out now with Shia LaBeouf (Shia, if I spelled your name wrong, I'm sorry) called...I don't know...(cough)TRANS-(cough)-FORMERS(cough)!
For those who saw this movie in their childhood and are now adults, if you're curious to see what you would think of it now, I wouldn't say that's a bad idea, but not a very good one, either.
This movie takes a giant backstep in concept and evolution by replacing our Rangers' powerful Zords (animal attack vehicles) with cheap looking, souped-up cars...and worst of all, the Rangers now wear atrocious looking headlights and reflectors on their heads!
Let me put it this way, he used to bitch about cigarettes, now he complains about coffee.
You have five main characters and a couple of supporting characters and now, please press all of them into these 90 minutes and include a background story about each of them.
Then there is the "hero" who seems indestructible, is filled with angst because of his traumatic past at the hands of his grotesgue former commander (who is now of course his prime enemy).
She's expecting to go over her script for Cleopatra but when she opens the door to his shabby multicolored garbage-strewn room she finds him lurching about, his pants unzipped, jerking in spasms, and managing to moan: "I've been an alcoholic for four years -- and now I'm on SMACK."
I'm sure that he's now up in that great cinema in the sky, taking pride in his filmography - including "Night Shift".
Scorsese's trademark violence stingers are now overripe at best.
Its a true feelgood comedy, well written, well acted and very likable, in other words ,far superior to cynical, race to out-gross , slew of humorous films we are subjected to now.
Right now I'm telling you just to rent Malibu's Most Wanted to get a clear picture of how this movie is: humorless with a stupid white protagonist.
I'm a peace and love kind of guy, but right now, four hours after seeing this, I find myself still wanting to fly to LA to find Jamie Kennedy and kick his ass.
I was about to tell my family we were leaving, when my 11 year old asked, "Can we GO, now?"
Not fun at all, you kinda wait now here comes the joke, and then there just comes nothing.
He wakes 20 years later (retaining his 14-year-old mentality, which explains why he is now Jamie Kennedy) and reunites his break dancing team from the old days - Miguel A. NÃºÃ±ez Jr., Bobby Lee and Aris Alvarado, losers all, who can't dance any more, let alone act.
When he finally returns to consciousness two decades later, he discovers, much to his dismay, that the world has moved on without him, and that everything that was once important and familiar to him - from the fashions to the technology to the music - is now hopelessly "un-cool" and out-of-date.
At best, the movie makes one wonder how audiences twenty years from now will be looking back at the 00's.
I have been trawling the bad film archives for awhile now, and nothing can top this.
It might sound like a hollow recommendation coming from one small man on the internet out there somewhere, but I guarantee when more people see this film, it will become a legendarily cult bad film, in the same way 'Troll 2' and 'Manos' are now.
Well you all should know the plot line by now, from the other comments.
And finally there's me, walking out the door, right f*cking now.
1982's "Night Shift" which was one of legendary director Ron Howard's first works can now be considered a comedy classic.
Set in New York City you have ex Wall street guy Charles Lumley(Henry Winkler)who's a worried and uptight type who now makes his living at the city morgue on the night shift.
Overall good and well done comedy a now remembered classic.
Leslie will never be as funny as he was years ago,it would take a miracle,the reason being he is accepting all these ridiculous scripts,just because hes in it doesnt mean it will change anything.Spy Hard has a very few funny scenes,and i find this film very similar to Nielsons other unfunny films like "DRACULA DEAD & LOVING IT" & "WRONGFULLY ACCUSED".I always wished their would be another Naked Gun,that is the only way Nielson can get his spoof fame back,now he is the same as any other star like Charlie Sheen in a spoof movie.
It's OK to laugh at these sort of 'simple, stupid', comedies every now and then, even if it has Leslie Nielsen in it.
Even the recent Dracula spoof produced the occasional chuckle, but it seems to have gone all pear shaped for Leslie now.
This is a great movie that I now proudly own.
Directed by Sally Mattison (at least we now know a woman can make a horror film just as badly as any bloke) I thought Slumber Party Massacre III (although the version I watched had the title A Stab in the Dark) was a dull, predictable, unoriginal teen slasher that does nothing to try & distinguish itself in an already over populated & limited sub-genre.
So; just as the movie is about to climax with the destruction of the nasalisk, the camera cuts to Sean Connery and his team, now having to dig their way out of the smashed underground bunker.
Finally she finds her husband Ulf, but the once powerful and happy man is now an addict to some foreign substance, barely able to speak.
I hope this idea gets re-done a few years from now.
Maybe the complete belief in the 'universal' (rather coprophagous) appetite of the masses for a bit of cheap entertainment between reality show "Big Brother" and the soporifics Late Hour News...  On the other hand, a proof that prestige of American film in general, and of names like Schrader, Liotta, Fiennes are untouched   If I write here right now that we took it as a bona fide self-parody, or maybe an attempt to emulate Ed Wood in producing the worst film possible - Yes, things like that are already been said before on this board, as I read above...
I don't even remember what they are now, but it doesn't matter.
Just one example: towards the end of the film, just before they enter Sir August's underwater lair, Steed and Peel enter a phone box and Peel says "how now brown cow?"
After the magnificent opener, the above average sequel, we now have a lame third flick.
Also, please, enough already with the huge overblown "UNRATED" DVD versions, so you added a 5 second scene and now the film is sooo much better than the crap fest that we saw in the theaters, all I can say is NO.
If you want a cheap alternative to this movie, get a collection of older movie trailers, put them on back to back so it lasts an hour or so, then sit and watch it whilst flicking different coloured lights on and off now and then with some old led Zep or pink floyd music on in the background- playing backwards of course.
Immediately after, they were on the Internet looking up various musical artists from the movie so that they could get to know the music that they now loved, but had missed out on.
But in every comedic role he plays now, he just seems to suck even more.
But, now, the relationship is over and neither of them can afford to pay for the mortgage without each otherÂand so they are having to sell, but, until they find a buyer, they must live together.
'The Good Girl' was so good and on a 'real life' level that if you have not seen this film do so now.
Nevertheless, JA as a "STAR" right now and not an "ACTRESS" has to be frustrated not even mentioning her personal life.
I know now what it must be like to be a psychiatrist.
With dodgy slow motion techniques which should now belong in the dark ages.
I wish now that I had never seen the Hinds-Morton version.
I can't believe that the cast are now approaching 70.
I became tired of it at age 13 and I am tired of it now.
The followup documentary reuniting some of the survivors is an exquisitely touching finale, though wouldn't it be lovely to continue the series, chronicling the gap between then and now.
No more ... the one and only good thing I can see about this movie is that it spurred me into action and now I'm a member here and can take a peek at the discussion threads whenever I want to.
He can write, direct, produce and now act.
So now the protagonist, Cleveland must find people to help him.
The followup documentary reuniting some of the survivors is an exquisitely touching finale, though wouldn't it be lovely to continue the series, chronicling the gap between then and now.
4) Shyamalan continues his now hackneyed convention of having a protagonist who's suffered tremendous loss in the form of familial death.
Frances sings "The Farmer's Daughter" and Bob, out of his disguise now, saves the show and gets the girl.
it's now 44 minutes into the movie and i'm very dissapointed that i missed Malcom in the Middle.  
Redford's first effort to adapt Hillerman (which his company now tries to pretend never existed) was Errol Morris's "The Dark Wind."
I now vow never, never, never to spend my $7 on a movie without a rating of 7 or above from this site.
Then come the year 2000, the four men have aged and are now living in Miami Beach with a good view of the ocean.
Italian-American ethnic humor, and similar mafia-based spoofs are pretty passe by now, wouldn't you think?
Hindsight now tells me I should have waited for the Video a few years from now and saved a few bucks.
This movie is an insult to Lee's memory and, thankfully, most fans now seem to recognize it as such.
There was also much more footage available that never made it into this film, just why I do now know (Check out the documentary called 'Bruce Lee: A Warriors Journey' and you will see more action that was meant for this film.)
But great news for all of you - Amazon (UK) is now selling the complete series (including the reunion) on DVD in 0 region (will play in all regions).
Cordell, who died in the last flick, is resurrected through voodoo, and is now hot on the trail of several miscreants involved in the shooting of a fellow officer Cordell is very fond of.
I don't know about other people but when I think of car crashes I think of destruction; I think of death; I think of loss; I think of the time and effort that it'll take to rectify not only the situation involving how the hell you're going to get around now the car's gone but also how you're supposed to recover from the shock of it.
Crash just consists of a bunch of random sex scenes between two characters we don't even know in the first third, then consists of sex scenes between two characters we don't even give a damn about in the second third before trying to end up as some sort of tragic, poetic love story about two people who have now discovered what really sexually turns them on.
I am so sick of them, particularly of her, what was at first her appealing acting style, the same in movie after movie after movie, now makes me want to shoot the screen.
now for the scene that I thought was the funniest of the whole movie.
Finally, UK Gold repeated the entire series last year, and thanks to a fellow Tenko fan named Patsy, I now have the whole thing on video for me to watch over and over again!
After getting into a vicious eye scratching and hair pulling cat fight with Sally Mimi ends up getting belted by Nick who then together with Sally take off in his car away from the perusing, and now on to Nick & Sally, police headed by Let.
It's a mess this film, but more so when you think that a straight musical with the Friml score could have been done and now probably never will and a version with Ty Power as D'Artagnan would have been a classic.
Look at him, he managed to survive that and he's big boy now.
Probably right now it is showing on the Lifetime channel.
It was disgusting, it was one sided, and it reminded me of the 1960's retreads that come out every now and again to rally people to their cause only to fall apart again once they realize no one is listening.
I can only give a very merciful 3 out of 10 and, to get the bad taste out of my mouth, I'm going now to watch (again) "Les Avaleuses" or "Doriana Grey" and I hope it will help...
okay, now i know that this won an award at cannes but i can only presume that this is because the judges were working under the principle that seems to afflict literary critics from time to time.
now i am no movie mainstream boy, i like to be challenged by films and i like films that require effort.
Animal and Heidenreich (possible the worst team ever and an insult to Hawk) beat the best team in WWE right now, Joey Mercury and Johnny Nitro to win the WWE tag team titles in a rubbish match.
I shall now close this review, because if you're anything like me, you'll spend the next 5 minutes in hysterics.
Our lead character discovers that the evil gym teacher that tormented him in middle school is now going to marry his mother.
This book becomes a best seller and he now teaches people how to let go of there past.
So now our lead character not that likable earthier.
The last theatre engagement is going on now, in Larkspur, Cal.
The nasty PE teacher whose methods affect children, the fat kid who has overcome Mr Woodcock's teaching to become good who has become famous, the widowed lonely mother who has found happiness in the arms of the bully, the nasty bitch who drinks and is abusive to all, the nice girl who stayed in the town and is a teacher herself and the loser, a loser at school and now a loser as an adult.
Susan Sarandon is almost invisible in the action of the movie, even though her relationship with Woodcock (now that's a name!)
Like what I'm doing now.
Dvorak, now a waitress, offers him a free meal - soup, steak, coffee - and a shoulder to cry on ...
Open-wheel racing in the '30s was -good-, but OW racing in the previous decade (at tracks like Beverly Hills and Culver City) was as big -- and spectacular, and fast -- then as NASCAR is now on mile ovals.
The DVD release was announced for Summer 2003 but has now been delayed indefinitely, lucky for you!
"The Guru" is now on DVD in case you missed it in the theaters!
The two die-hard squatters will try to get the band together again and rescue what contained once proud memories of their glory days and now fatal evidence of their stupidity from the well guarded chambers of the police.
By now you will know that you are not watching a movie, but are instead trapped inside the dream of some pathetic drunken 80s squatters, "a bunch of mindless jerks who'll be the first against the wall when the revolution comes".
Dutch critics , especially' at pretentious film festivals in the lowlands hail these kind of films as very interesting , creative and totally ' now '.
probably the most obviously thing is as the years have past by the talent level has decreased the story lines have became stale,dry and not interesting .the days of George clooney and Anthony Edwards and Juliana margulies are well over , now we have the girl in bend it like beck-ham who tried but really is not that great a character or the girl out of broke back mountain and yes john stamos -do you call that star power?
What makes it interesting is that, though Paul Henreid, Ingrid Bergman's husband in "Casablanca" seven years earlier, was by now over the hill and reduced to B pictures, the movie is full of those naughty young girls, including the 18-year-old Rita Moreno and the 19-year-old Ann Francis.
She's an unwed mother who has her cap now set for Paul Henreid and I'm not quite sure how he was able to resist the temptation.
C'mon now ... this can't be a serious drama.
Over the years, I've come to expect more and more of Clint Eastwood's directoral efforts, and I've never been disappointed, until now.
I understand the quote on all the billboards and things now... 'No one knew his name, they still don't'.
We get to see the real Kull now after he gets the crown.
He's the renegade cop, somebody is dead, and now he's out for revenge.
Dragonheart: ANB builds on the contrivances of the first and offers its own; now there's a new semi-evil ruler guy (you'll love his beginning speech decreeing that citizens must always speak the truth), a new convenient dragon (whose 'ice lung' ability is just a little too powerful) and a wimpy hero who learns to deal between the two, sort of.
If Draco was the LAST DRAGON, how are there other dragons now?!
Okay, according to the writers, Nero is now about 16 when his great uncle Claudius becomes emperor (in fact he was about to turn 4); Agrippina engineers the downfall of the empress Messalina and marries Claudius, who adopts Nero.
and where marvels of every imaginable, possible kind, and beyond, never cease... that is, until now.
It's as if the writer saw the stacks of pages and said "Wow, I've to wrap this up now".
I feel better now.
I doubt this is on the air in America now (2008), but Star World network is touting this as a new show in their "family friendly" lineup.
If the US leaves Iraq in the state it is in right now, would the Iraqi people be better off living under a group that routinely slaughters innocent men, women and children as a matter of policy?
Hopefully he'll get it right one day but after this, the Reckoning and now Lucky Number Slevin, I wouldn't hold my breath.
Kendell's lover Beckett then goes crazy with the two, Annie and Rodney, taking off in the confusion together with the now out of hiding Malik and barricade themselves in an upstairs bedroom.
Meanwhile Beckett is slowly going insane hallucinating that he's now the man of the house which makes his two fellow bank robbers Sykes & Henley, Vincent Gale & Dean McKenzie, a wee bit worried about his mental condition.
Anyone who watches this movie will sit there thinking, hoping, that eventually something will happen, that there will be a laugh, or something, anything, will happen to break the slow motion dragging along, wondering if they should get up and leave now or have faith that maybe something is going to happen, but it never does.
Hey, it's 2005 now, there's no longer need to shamelessly rip "The Empire Strikes Back" off, is there?
Certainly harmless in itself but overlong and not exactly rewarding in any way; strangely enough, the director had already tackled the story a decade earlier in GAWAIN AND THE GREEN KNIGHT (1973), which is yet another film that I haven't had the opportunity to catch up with since missing out on it on local TV in my childhood...though I can't say that I'm particularly looking forward to it now!
The movie starts off real slow with unwanted sound effects (not even effects but those silly bangs and booms to give the audience a jolt)(a cheesy one includes sounds of a tiger roar now and then) which sounded inappropriate at times.
First i thought 'God, they have copied 'The Shining' because there was this boy who goes about the house in his small cycle and his dad is a writer and then when he starts seeing the ghosts i thought 'Okay its Sixth Sense now' but it was not even so.
He seems to know the story behind the family in the house and jumps in front of Sush's car whenever she goes to the hospital (she is playing a doctor)  Throughout the movie the kid keeps seeing the zombie family (which is not at all scary) and one night he and his parents go out for a movie, Sush's sis Radhika (played by Piya) is alone in the house and her boyfriend Murali comes to the house (Purab that channel [V] VJ) and starts playing with her in bed and then suddenly he disappears (The crappy part starts now).
Even the husband gets killed and the boy is also smacked by the zombie family (who are now joined by Radhika and Murali zombies).
Susmita comes to know about the tree through that mad guy (Small funny guy) and when she returns she sees her little boy lying on the floor and now her husband is also a zombie.
There is even an insane man (Rajpal Yadav, now when is the last he played a sane character ?)
Kill me now) it's no wonder this was a tad on the dire side.
come on now.
Films like that have been tackled a zillion times in Hollywood, what was the point in turning it into a zillion & one now?
Moore's films have always been under extreme scrutiny, specifically Bowling For Columbine, Fahrenheit 9/11, and now Sicko.
Face it now and save yourselves the Christmas shock.
Trying to imply that Moore is just a glory-seeking filmmaker who would rather hobnob with celebrities than join in the protest, the point falls flat when you consider how the now infamous acceptance speech made by Moore (and the film itself) did more for the Anti-war cause than a street protest ever could.
Moore's films have always been under extreme scrutiny, specifically Bowling For Columbine, Fahrenheit 9/11, and now Sicko.
Since I didn't watch the first part of this movie, I will probably sound stupid now, but was there some sort of an accident.... or several accidents all over the globe since all these people 'suddenly' died and left Ralph from America take over????
Goodman needs to stick to "Roseanne" comeback specials, Saturday Night Live appearances, and "Babe Ruth" type characters from now on.
I'd recommend "Brewster's Millions" with Richard Pryor instead...now there's a comedy that ages gracefully with time...and with a much better cast, plot and vision.
The best part about this movie is that we can now all use the movie's title as a clever nickname for fat people.
I have now watched all of Paul McGuigan's films and love every single one of them.
Again - laughing hysterically now as I watched the film.
There's a healthy number of car chases, fistfights, gundowns and just about anything you would expect from a film of this kind, but it's all done with such a workmanlike air from Marino Girolami (Castellari's father) that I couldn't help but glance at my watch every now and then.
On learning that his old mentor, Freddie Mays (David Thewlis), has been released from jail, The Gangster (McDowell), now a kingpin among fellow gangsters, moves back to the late sixties when he was a young nameless man (Paul Bettany) just hanging around in the swinging sixties.
While Selena plans to use the sphere's powers to rule the world; Kara steals an experimental spaceship and on Earth, becoming Supergirl: the girl of steal; now the long-blond-tressed Kara enrolls in a girl-school as a brunette using the name Linda Lee, while searching for the Omegahedron in her spare time wearing the familiar costume of her cousin Superman.
And I am feeling very sorry and most of all disappointed now.
I saw it on VHS and I wouldn't mind seeing it now that it is available on DVD.
Been a long time now - but if I remember correctly, Amanda asks, after having sliced of the cowboy's penis, "don't you think he wanted it this way?".
The film just lacks that one special thing to take it to greatness, above and beyond those other movies, but for now, it can just be the one to stand out.
Save yourself the pain.....throw it away now!
In fact, it is the worse James Bond, for now.
An otherwise brilliant actress has her biggest - an until now only - genuine fiasco.
Only to have (Jones become a bad guy in another country where the now good-bad-guy (Griffin) killed a really bad guy and stole his dog for evidence (only no wait, he didn't really kill him either (probably another double take, i dont remember who really killed him, I think it was a bad guy).
I wish I could have said this to him now.
8/2/08: So now we're already in the third season, with Brandy having been replaced by Sharon Osbourne - a major improvement - and Jerry Springer replacing Regis (not so much).
Movie and well worth the 10,95 Euro at Amazon.de .. To best describe it.. A funny Action Thriller.. And the last with both Actors in it.. And now I don't think they will act together again..
McGregor is solid, too, apart from his on-and-off accent (which was it now?
And now Shrooms, the latest addition to this sub-sub genre, in which some American backpackers discover the downside to pigging out on fungi fancies.
I expect fans of the duo will like it nonetheless, but it isn't a patch on "My Name is Nobody" and, like so many other films of the time, it really shows its age now.
all the horror i see now seems to be aimed at teens - and its boring!
Im afraid Horror as a genre is dead - it is all just commercialized like with everything else now - they get a good idea and cut/trim/change it to fit a mass audience and i don't like that..
This is getting ridiculous now.
There now follows, in no particular order: dull killings, bad acting, a talking cow, a hairy wolfman, cleavage shots of sexy young things being chased.. you know the formula.
If you do, and can understand them, then maybe we'll go sometime and I can learn to understand and enjoy, in fact I am always looking to broaden my horizons, in fact just ever get a chance to watch Dexter on show-time, now that will make you think.
I had better things to do than watch this stool, never mind describe it to you, who is obviously even now contemplating wasting the best part of two hours on this drivel.
They meet up with some Irish friend (who is obviously British faking a bad Irish accent) that the lead girl (played by the creepy little girl from JC's VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED--the rest of her face has now caught up with her forehead, thank goodness) is creaming over.
Eventually, the former lovers do get together one more time Â the girl obviously in Lockwood's form and the medic now reduced to an old man (played by none other than Ernest Thesiger, whose entrance here towards the end of the film is almost as impressive as the one in BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN [1935]) Â but, tellingly, the camera cuts away at this precise moment, as if we what they had to say was meant for their ears only!
I ended up being stalked by him and now we rarely speak.
It just shows that you should not judge people by who they were when they were younger but who they are now.
Ten years ago her looks were enough for me, but by now I (and probably the casting people) have seen that she really has very little talent.
Brian Austin Green from Beverly Hills 90210 and Carly Pope made an adorable couple and Sara Rue was funny and brilliant.Once in our lives we dream of going back and changing the past for Melissa Rochester (Pope) that time is now.
A hundred years from now, this film would be a great case study of the R & B, Soul, and Blues of this time.
it was (and remains) a brisk paced "fun, and funny" movie that still holds up in this somewhat jaded time we now live in - most viewers today would not have a clue how racy this movie was thought to be at its first showing way back in 1969.
When Victor gets out of jail, his mind is on bitter revenge, especially after he discovers that Elena, now clean and sober, has married the invalid David, who's now a paralympic basketball star.
The European filmakers have always done it better and now with the growth of the independents, maybe the Americans are catching on that in this director's medium called film, the actors are really secondary or even tertiary to the script and the director.
His character is doomed, because what happens to him now is not going to stop, and the worst part is that he knows it.
Anthony also calls Akbar & Amar as his brothers but let's get back to there real dad it seems his the evil guy now LMFAO!
Each story is a little morality tale in the style of "The Twilight Zone," but instead of that series' sense of surreal wonder, the focus is now firmly on the macabre.
This remarkable trio of spooky stories served as a pilot to the not-quite-so remarkable TV series of the same name, though now it is just as likely remembered as the point where two screen legends passed at opposite trajectories of their careers.
There's rich, crooked lawyer Edward Arnold, who blackmails him into burglarizing some incriminating papers; his two-timing wife, Marie Windsor; former magician turned criminal William Talman; his own brother (Ron Hagerthy) who's now Talman's apprentice; his pop (Otto Hulett), a police veteran; and a `mechanical man' (Gregg Warren) who entertains passersby in the Silver Frolics' window.
Having seen him in a few things now, I would not call James Nesbitt a charactor actor.
1 dimensional acting - "Oh, I'm 'playing' irritating now".
After passing on The Full Monty in favour of Brassed Off, the now all-but defunct Film Four were quick to throw money at Peter Cattaneo's next comedy and confidently launched a huge marketing campaign for Lucky Break secure in the knowledge that they had the big local hit of the year.
",  - makes no sense "Hello I'm depressed prisoner(Timothy Spall) - the guards hate me, my wife is seeing another man, I was framed ... oops now I have cancer,,"  - and is very, very bad.
Then one day I turn on Fox/Kids, now spiraling into mediocrity, and saw Robots in Disguise.
As it is now common practice to add the elements of collecting things and battling them in children's anime this is no different.
Except now I can handle it with more of a level of maturity.
Really now?
I've seen two of the movies: The World's Strongest and Most of Tree of Might, and now just watched Brolly: The Legendary Super Saiyan, part of a three pack of the Brolly Movies in DBZ.
Meanwhile, Goku is told by Kaio-sama (or King Kai) that the Legendary Super Saiyan has just destroyed the South Galaxy, and now has his sights set on the North Galaxy.
I liked it in 1991 and I still like it now 15 years later.
But now I FINALLY have a DVD of the film.
But now it is where it belongs, backing up the closing credits.
Japanese animation has brought forward many films which are regarded as classics of the genre (for now ignoring the fact that anime isn't really a genre in and of itself, but rather a style of animation which encompasses several different genres, eg.
I didn't feel scared afterward; let's just say I'll be a little more careful about my friends from now on.
"Blasting caps, that'll scare them, a brain is terrible thing to waste, map, map, where's the map, oh come now don't tell me you've lost that bloody map, oh no sir, that maps around here somewheres" all done in three different pirate voices.
I had been aware of the  antics of the Three Stooges, Laurel and Hardy and Abbott and  Costello, but now I could see first hand the live slapstick of  involved comedy.
(Hollywood turned these out every now and again often to mixed results)   Music aside I really like this movie.
I had been aware of the  antics of the Three Stooges, Laurel and Hardy and Abbott and  Costello, but now I could see first hand the live slapstick of  involved comedy.
As Kiera Knightly's first leading role, I must say it goes against the glam sexy characters she so often chooses now.
Critics argued that the game was just a movie in disguise, now 5 years later the movie is finally here.
The Kilrathi has captured a Navcom AI, and can now "jump" to the Sol-system and threaten Earth itself.
It's just wrong, now I don't know anything about the game series this movie is based on.
Well, I've seen it twice now.
Too often, when their political toadying days wind down, they join important New York law firms or become Washington "consultants," toadying in only a slightly different milieu, and able now to directly afford their bespoke suits and strip steak dinners at The Capital Grille.
He also manages to seduce the loving Agnes, who, having acquiesced is now of course unworthy of a man of his stature.
And now this pompous little man, Diederich Hessling, respected factory owner, leads us into a satire which is not all that amusing, with workers abused, Jewish blood gossiped about and patriotic Germanic delusions flowering with pride.
Cliff Groves (Fred MacMurray), a toy manufacturer, has been married for about twenty years to Marian (Joan Bennett), who now takes him for granted and gives most of her attention to their demanding children, leaving Cliff feeling unloved and unappreciated and ripe for an affair with old flame Norma Vale (Barbara Stanwyck), a successful fashion designer.
Cliff gazes up from his living room window at Norma's plane flying overhead, then turns and walks away, at which point Marian materializes beside him and takes his arm, saying something like, "You haven't been yourself lately", to which Cliff replies, "I'm all right now".
Marian has been ignoring the poor man for years and is patronizing and totally insensitive to his feelings, but now we're supposed to believe that good ol' Cliff has come to his senses and all is well.
He is now middle aged and having achieved it all, begins to feel himself taken for granted by his wife and children.
I have been in search of childhood anime for awhile now.
Whatever,it's an unwelcome and redundant return to Mean Time territory (now over over 20 years old) that reeks of the late '70s/early '80s and,despite its pretensions has little of the flavour of modern Britain.
), now and again shouting at each other, having listless sex, and barely able to conjure up a wry larf between the lot of them.
Having seen both films now, I'd have to say that I agree with that assessment.
Yeah, I got chocked up every now and then, but not like this, this is weeping.
I've just read some of the other comments on this film and am now engaged in a bout with writers block because in no way will I begin to shed a better light on our subject film than the engaging analyses already posted on this site.
Mike Leigh makes this movie as a sociological study because he wants us to be confronted with the state of mind of the working class of now.
I think I started to watch the show when I was 11 or 12 years old (I am now 15).
I'm sure it's a childhood thing and these stories don't appeal much to me now.
OK now that the same drugs that apparently the director was on when he produced this 'stinky fish' have worn off all I can say is: "How can a good cook take such excellent ingredients for making a fine dish (film) and combine them so badly??"
I know now that life is too short.
Last year I finally found the book and bought it and until now I've read it many times and I think it's one the greatest books ever written.
They did a bad job on filming,20,000 leagues under the sea,which was around a 3 hour bore,now,their version of Mysterious Island,again another bore which lasts about 3 hours.
Kudos Marita C. Turns out that CSM, now dying, has summoned them for one final attempt at rekindling the conspiracy.
That would because an alien craft has crashed outside Bellefleur, and is now sitting under a cloaking device.
Watch it, it is shown now and then on Channel five in the daytime.
Incidentally, sometime back in 1992/3 I met the redheaded actor (shamefully I can't recall his name right now) from "That Sinking Feeling" working in Stirling castle, conducting tours and the like!
This worthless piece of crap should be off the air by now!!!
My VHS-tape of this movie is broken now, but I would really, really appreciate it if anybody could tell me how I could get another copy.
But after watching this 1, i fear meteors and the possibility of an intergalactic war far more worse now.
Giving me the creeps and chills every now and then when i go to bed (it just wont go off).
Therefore this is my no.1 alien encounter movie undoubtedly for now and for a long time to come.
In fact, some of them are probably on television right now.
I really do hope this is released in the USA soon, as Thora Birch is definitely not to be missed here.. and I think the stunning Keira Knightley is going to be getting some bigger roles from now on, she's definitely earned her stripes here.
Fire your agents, and do so now.
Exorcism: The Possession of Gail Bowers starts six weeks after the death of teenager Gail Bowers (Erica Roby) mom & dad as she moves to a new home in a new state with her now legal guardians her older sister Anne (Noel Thurman) & her husband Clark Pederson (Griff Furst).
The demon possessing this young girl Goes completely bananas and a horde of priest comes to her rescue, including the priest form the intro, now blind, but full of hope and anger towards the demons walking this earth in human forms, performing an exorcism that lead to their final hour falling pray to the angry demon within.
The scenes with most tension and terror deal with the satanic ritual where a black goat appears and when the devil makes a terrifying appearance (standing up confronting JosÃ© Mari and throwing him out of the tower and then confronting the priest) I understand now how "Drag Me To Hell" got inspired in the use of shadows and the talking goat.
So, now I'll do my best to recommend it to as many other people as possible.
Every now and then I'm inspired by a story and want to write something myself along the same lines, this had one of those inspiring stories.
It's now become a synonym for cheap shysters with me.
Whoever now owns the Warner Bros. library should strike a pristine version of this one.
I desperately tried to like this having first seen it aged eight, but what seemed exciting / scary back then, I find pretty lame now.
The chicks are hot, but AMAZINGLY we see almost no skin (which is why I didn't give it a 10) Watching it again right now...
In doing some searching I learned that these films were preceded by a Jimmy Allen radio series, but I had not heard of that, either, before now.
Here's a list of them:   An Nightmare on elm street Happy Brithbay to me Gappa   Well just those three I came name right now.
So her boyfriend is the killer now?
Do you know when you start watching a movie and in the first 4/5 minutes you start asking yourself: "why doesn't it end right now?"
If seen now by young people who weren't old enough to have lived during the Viet-Nam War, this film will seem "small" and out-dated.
All around I would say that this is my favorite show on TV now with Smallville running second.
The Devil (Ray Wise) comes to collect by making Sam become the 'devil's bounty hunter' by re-reaping souls that have escaped from Hell and now are killing people back on Earth.
A top notch cast, amazing scripts, great direction...I was sad to see The Loop get cancelled and now I wouldn't have it any other way.
It is a regular on my TiVo list now, I can only hope that the network doesn't kill it off for some lame reality show replacement.
In the first episode Sam Oliver learns that his parents sold his soul to the devil he must now serve as a bounty hunter, tracking down evil souls that have escaped and returning them to hell.
I don't really understand why this film did so badly but heh it seems to be more accepted now.
The Characters are totally believable, The surfing sequences are only now being surpassed, twenty years later.
But now I think the director was making a political statement about good/clean fighting and bad/dirty fighting--such as Vietnam.
Back then surfing wasn't about the big buck tournaments they have now it was time well spent with your compadres and the film reflected that time.
Later they escape and before they go home they ask one request of one of their friends (a young Freddy Kruegger) who has now become their commanding officer- will you surf before we go home.
I sometimes wander through my home town now, and occasionally see one of the old gang across the street.
Who would have though that all those jokes we shared, all those lazy days walking through the forests together, all the sunsets we watched and the nights we hoped would never end, all those great times which would never come round again; who would have thought that now it is as if they have never happened at all?
Sure I have new friends now, but it's our oldest ones that count most, those we shared our defining moments with.
It is also in the end that we sense the strong friendship of these boys having now turned men, and we understand how real friendship surpasses the years and the comradeship of youth.
Perhaps it would have helped the film if any of the characters were fleshed out in the least bit, but the way it is now the movie had me thinking about how much creepier it might have been if it was about a deranged Burger King mascot (YOU watch those commercials and play Sneak King and NOT be terrified).
Amongst my friends and myself, we now refer to awesome parties as "Big Wednesday parties", but of course none of them can compare.
After having seen this one now several times it still hits hard every time and probably keeps doing it.
But for now, '110th' holds its place as a forgotten landmark of Black film-making, still entertaining a limited audience.
I think I read somewhere that Alain Resnais and Alan Ayckbourne are friends and Resnais does have an affinity with Ayckbourne's work, witness Smoking/No Smoking and now Coeurs.
There is one more quote thats not listed thats pretty cool Horny the Clown: "Your my girl now, and I'm HORNY!!!!!!"
You know, I didn't know Sanrio, creator of Hello Kitty (and all the other cuddley characters we love) maded this film; but now I do.
Anyway when young Gene Reynolds grows up to be Robert Taylor he's now supporting dear old dad who's still drinking and gambling.
I now have it on a video taped from a Tex Avery marathon years ago.
I have seen this movie listed in film guides my whole life--now I have finally seen it.
Aside from making a few facial grimaces here and there, they were completely unfunny and irritating--sort of like less funny versions of Brown and Carney (now THAT's bad) or even Allen and Rossi (now that's REALLY bad).
I don't know, I've never heard of them until now, but they seem a very cheap and shoddy imitation of the Marx brothers.
Before you descend to the low level of this disaster, I'd recommend "The Three Musketeers" or "Straight, Place and Show," which is in the rotation at TCM (in fact I'm watching it right now, having just suffered through "The Gorilla"), and which features a wonderful acting and singing performance from Ethel Merman.
Alas, by now, the same formula has appeared so often, be it under different guises, that there's little left to be amazed about for one watching this series for the first time now.
Animation quality has aged a bit better though, with only the first episode looking genuinely old hat by now.
Both Vaughn and Hyde-White are Columbo veterans by now, I love the unusual love story in this film an I won't spoil it for the viewers.
Following the cult Brazilian TV series "City of Men" (2002-2005), Acerola (Douglas Silva) and Laranjinha (Darlan Cunha), two orphaned, teenage street kids living in Morro da Sinuca (one of Rio's 800+ favelas), are now about to turn eighteen and face the issues of adulthood.
Fatherhood -- in a social milieu where most kids grow up fatherless -- is the key theme here: Acerola is now a teen dad who has to take care of his baby boy when his teen wife moves to SÃ£o Paulo to work as a babysitter; and Laranjinha is on the search of the identity of his unknown father, only to discover he's alive and is an ex-convict on parole.
He adopts cinÃ©ma-vÃ©ritÃ© style (in the camera-work, dialog, performances), now de rigueur in films dealing with "stark realities".
A deep story about people, and a little bit of what is now Canadian history.
this is very good movie about the wreck of titanic it is unscripted and the don't now Wat they are doing they test new robots name bot1 and bot2 later the changed their name into Jake and Elwood just like Blusebrothers and then they explore the ship in places that had never seen since 1912 i will give this movie 8 because i liked it wen the were telling the story about the ship and they show the rooms digital-ed in computer it is very cool.
I guess it's now a collector's item or something.
I really liked the way they show how it was in 1912 and how it is now.
From the problems Jack has with internal affairs to Reggie having to pay someone off who kept him alive in jail & from the mysterious identity of the Iceman to the fact that Reggie is now a free man & doesn't have to work with Jack just make Another 48 Hrs.
Interestingly James is third in the opening credits while Murphy & Nolte come first & second although unlike the first film Murphy is now credited first & Nolte second which says something all on it's own.
I am watching the Movie right now.
I will watch the rest of the movie now and enjoy myself.
I liked this film, and it still holds it own pretty well today for a new generation of viewers, despite the autos and clothes now starting to look a little dated.
Familiar scenes are replayed again by people now so rich (and yes, I'm thinking Eddie Murphy here in a redneck bar) that the good guys come off as cruel rather than heroic.
So Cate calls on Murphy to assist in saving the day and while the chemistry between the two was so good in the original '48 Hours,' something is now wrong.
It seems that Hammond, who is STILL in jail, is now a target.
By the time the movie ended, not only was I sober, but my mind was made up to begin what turned out to be a four year journey that eventually lead me to where I am right now.
I think we're bordering on ridiculous now.
If Disney's name was still somewhere on this one, I bet they wish they'd have taken it off by now.
I am just now viewing a very old and incredible bad copy of Gunbus, that I found yesterday...
By now in his late forties and sporting an obvious, bright red hairpiece, Charlton Heston seemed an odd Antony when first seen.
Actually nothing to say would make you understand how great this movie is and you don't even need to read the reviews before you watch it, All you need to do right now is to watch it because seeing this movie is a MUST.
Also I think it would have helped if they improved the clearness of the time-traveling aspect, so that you could spent the time you now use to understand the concept, on developing compassion for the family.
She was sniffly when we left and now has the book.
However, from now on, if I want to spend the evening with the DeTambles and let someone else do the work, I'll be watching the movie.
I loved it as a child and still find it absolutely amazing now.
I've always loved the original book and the Broadway musical of Secret Garden and now I love this enchanting film even more!
I'm surprised they haven't become mega-movie actors by now; but atleast they do have one amazing movie that they can add to their resume`!
I now understand why my mother loved this film so much.
She is sent to England, to live in her uncle's mansion,since he is now her legal guardian.
But it's not an ordinary key, is the key from the secret garden, a garden who once was the place where her aunt always loved to stay and that now is locked since she died.
The Secret Garden allows viewers to immerse in a world larger than themselves ease and without having to keep saying...now why is THAT person in the movie...or why does THAT person have to keep making obscene gestures or engage in a constant flow of obscene sexual double-entendres?
The effects are good, especially at the part when the laser beam starting to move, down and up or in the middle, now, that's something.
Milla Jovovich was just a perfect choice for Alice, she is such a cool character and now I'm really looking forward to seeing Extinction.
We as an audience however know something is amiss having witnessed a coffin earlier floating ashore following the flute-playing of a most unusual looking black man who we later see arrive at the castle-like house in which the hippies seem to be squatting now acting as something of a servant/follower to Khorda.
Even now, just listening the very '70s score by Bill Marx (Harpo's son, by the way), I can feel the atmosphere closing in on me...which is a good thing, a sign of the film's effectiveness.
Only real beef I have(..despite the now silly hippie-speak)is the title..this kind of vampire movie needs a more credible title.
"Deathmaster" may come off as pretty dated now, but that actually plays a part in its appeal.
In The Venus Wars, mankind now resides on two planets: civilized Earth and fractious terra-formed Venus.
Apparently an icy comet hit Venus around about now and made the planet habitable.
The film, obviously inspired by "Pulp Fiction" was a big hit in Poland and now is a movie people there quote.
"I should kill you now, and find out!"
), "Too Many Husbands" now resembles Cary Grant's 1940 comedy "My Favorite Wife" with a sex-switch (this film actually beat "Wife" into theaters by a scant two months, but was not as popular).
The film does hold up after 80 years now, and it's still an entertaining precursor of a genre that's largely gone today.
I am watching it right now on TCM.
Like TWO ARABIAN KNIGHTS and THE MATING CALL, this film has now been restored by UNLV (which found the prints of these films once thought lost in an archive of producer Howard Hughes' possessions) in cooperation with Flicker Alley.
I never really liked her until I saw her Bravo Special a year ago.. now I love her and think she is unbelievably funny.
Most tunes are world famous now, and every Mega Man fan can hum these tunes.
It is now Mega Man's duty to defeat Wily for a second time and destroy his new eight robotic minions.
David Zucker is not trying at all anymore,perhaps because his prime audience is now ten year olds who snicker at the word penis.
I have been watching it off and on with my mom, but now we have Tivo and we see it everyday.
The power (literally) goes to his head and, now, let's fast forward to the presentÂ ÂBrothers reunite after one went missing for two years, and older brother, Victor (Purcell) leads his younger sibling, Evan (Cavill) to a sectioned off/private farmland to shoot up the inhabitants.
Weddings now feature passages from the bible, sermons and morality lectures from the Irish priest.
Christmas now features bible readings.
They've dumbed down Shawn's character - he was in college planning to be a lawyer - now all of a sudden he is shown saying he doesn't know how to use a computer and settles for a blue-collar job fixing cars as the only job he can get?
He immediately realizes that she is the only one that can help him and now she's in control... Polanski and Brach once again bring you an excellent thriller.
Why remain in a relationship where there was never any love in the first place and there is clearly no love now?
Mimi and Oscar's relationship encompasses most things; from BDSM to urolagnia and right the on way through to the notion of knowing your once female lover, now full time carer, is in the room next door with another man; keeping you in a sort of cuckolded state of helplessness.
His world, in which he would submit to the presence of Mimi purely to feed a curiosity and because he was able to, but would later find himself on the other foot when she submits to him; his world, in which ego driven positions of power were exploited and the phrase 'what goes around, comes around' didn't exist Â not least, until now.
Few critics took this film seriously when it was released, but it's now steadily beginning to garner attention.
A British couple on their way via cruise to India run into a wheelchair bound would-be writer and his wife, who is a knock-out, and the husband hears from the now crippled man the story of his relationship.
Besides this few topics of discussion (to which I could add some more if I just remembered them right now) I found this film very well directed with some beautiful scenes... also some strongs scenes that stay with us... Excelent performances for the three leading roles... Kristin Scott Thomas is also good in here but not so as in other films also because her somewhat small part in this one didn't allow her to show more than she did.
Despite her drunken exterior, Sheilds who now owns his own production company and studio, sees the potential for a star quality leading lady and signs her on for his next picture.
If you don't watch Day Of Our Lives I suggest you start now!
Rumors speculate that (now 92 years old) Kirk Douglas' character "Jonathan Shields" is loosely based on producer David O. Selznick who's own father Lewis J. Selznick was an early giant in the film industry.
Lovely Lana Turner's character "Georgia Larisson" is supposedly based on the now nearly forgotten Diana Barrymore trying to make a name for herself away from her father, the legendary John Barrymore.
However, unfortunately for Shields, he now finds himself a pariah following his numerous betrayals.
Although it's now more than 50 years old, it wouldn't take a lot of rewriting to remake it today.
I was so excited that the Dimera storyline finally ended years ago, but now it's back.
Georgia, (played wonderfully by Lana Turner) now a popular actress began as a bit player in one of Shields films.
I loved Thundercats just as much as any other child of the 80s, I had the toys: the regular 6", the little 1" high ones, a giant Lion-O that lit up...of course they're all lost now.
But watching the episodes on DVD now is almost painful for how terrible and cheesy the shows are.
But Lion-O, the new leader of the ThunderCats, now grown man due a malfunction in his cryo-stasis pod, with the Sword of Omens will help the ThunderCats to have a standing chance on their adopted home.
I saw very many, much was pleasant to me were a favorite "Ninza Turtles", and from "ThunderCats" I then saw only one episode (about huge spiders), but they have sunk down to me in soul and later 20 years they (ThunderCats) is my favorite cartoon serial from serious (and from comic - "The Pink Panther") and I now try to extract a full serial on disks in the original (without a translation into Russian).
This was my favorite cartoon as a kid and I find now watching them on DVD, I love them more than ever.
I guess these epics were big during the 50's, but watching them now is like seeing a documentary with nitrous.
I grew up watching this stuff as a Saturday afternoon matinee 30 years ago & now, it's still as much fun to watch.
Hercules, now married to Ioli, is returning to Thebes to help sort out a dispute over who has the rights to the throne of Thebes.
She used to look quite sexy, but she's now too old for it.
These gals begin each meeting by singing Sir Hubert Parry's "Jerusalem," perhaps the greatest tribute in song to a now vanished empire.
First with Full Monty and now with Calendar Girls.
Perhaps years from now, the appreciation this movie deserves will be given to it.
But in between, and a little after, these two blockbusters, a series of unfortunate events (not the Lemony Snicket kind) became stumbling blocks in the industry: among these mediocre messes came "Pride", "Popeye's Voyage: The Quest for Pappy", "The Polar Express", and now this--the most recent, most hilarious, and most horrible attempt at a comeback--"Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot".
Hollywood has reached rock bottom so they're remaking everything now but only worse.
I need to get off the computer now.
It was before she had dieted down to where she now has two pool cues for legs.
The bad part: yes, the last 15 or so minutes are plagued by a lack of money and a lack of laughs (money as in it looks like they ran out and decided to end the film...now).
Basically because in this movie that's all Josie's ever heard... how she's such a great piece of a$$ ("the town tease"), and the redundancy of these comments she's encountered up to now has her almost proud of that fact.
As we comment on how beautiful Connelly is, we in turn become a part of Josie's past, and we are responsible for who she is now.
Either someone thinks I am very gullible or movie-makers all over the world should think about making church on Sundays a regular practice ... alternatively, they should spare themselves countless hours in AA further down the line (when directors and their movies like this become common practice) and quit now!!
Where once the print was apparently murky, you now should be able to adjust and reap the benefit of what is on offer.
It's hoped that it can now find a newer and more appreciative audience because it's one of the better B Westerns of the late 1950s.
Okay, now, if you're not aghast yet, imagine a subplot about a pretty lady out to find her missing sister, only to find out she has gotten into drugs with a group of bikers, who are now after her sister's best friend.
The lighting in this scene sucks so bad the DP is probably living in a cardboard box now.
It pissed me off so bad that I spent so much money on this movie... now I think I may go kill myself or something.
The camera-work is dreadful and the blood and gore (which looked cool when I was little) is laughably fake now.
Iâd always heard the name of Al Adamson mentioned in the same breath as that of the acknowledged King Of Bad Movies, Edward D. Wood Jr.; having now watched an effort from him â and one that, by all accounts, is his own nadir (or zenith, if thatâs your bag) â I can certainly appreciate the comparison!
And now he's gone.
Not now.
I'm watching Dr Dracula right now and wonder why this had to be her last movie, she looked as beautiful as ever.Other favorates of the Regina and Al movies would have to be Satan's Sadists and Brain of blood.
Meanwhile Jodies decapitated head has been reattached to her body by Dr. Duryea (J. Carrol Naish) who just happens to be the last living member of the Frankenstein family & now conducts his experiments from an amusement park attraction called 'Dr.
Lana Turner goes back to school, but only to win a dance contest (which stipulates a college student wins) to star in a new movie starring Lee Bowman, whose wife is now pregnant and can't make the movie.
!What kind of crap does MTV come up with?Sure, there's your every now and then GREAT show on MTV, but usually there's dumb excuses for entertainment like The Real World aired.
For you kids who watch MTV now you probably think MTV never did.
I've seen it three times now, my first time being over 12 years ago, and it's no easier to watch now than then.
I'm 50 years old now and it's funny how a person can remember insignificant stuff like that over the years.
One he is cured, an interesting chain of humiliating events that bring Alex even farther down ensue: he is, for example, now attacked by his very ex-mates, now policemen, and his ex-victims.
Unfortunately, society wasn't ready for this film, which is why it is revered now more than ever.
It's very difficult for the straight-shooting veteran (along with his wife Joan, played by Susan Sarandon) to grasp just how different Mike is from the boy who left home to join the armed forces, following in the footsteps of his old man and his older (and now deceased) brother.
Unless you lived through the barracks riots and de facto segregation of the 60's and 70's, and seen the difference now, you really can't believe how far we've come.
Based of the true story, shown on CBS' 48 Hours, of the late US Army Specialist Richard Davis "In the Valley of Elah" shows how those servicemen and women who are now engaged in the fighting in Iraq, as well as Afghanistan, suffer more then just from being shot bombed and ambushed by the enemy El-Qeada and Iraqi insurgents.
In some ways, it has suffered with the passage of time - we are now spoiled with such complex portrayals of gangsters such as in the Sopranos, we find it hard to accept Kitano's almost noble portrayal of what are in reality brutal, selfish sociopaths.
Not that Jennifer Love would go back into it anyways, I mean she is a big movie star now.
Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris were two of the greatest baseball players of the early 1960s whose accomplishments on the baseball field is now legend and to portray these two great athletes, these two great baseball players, these two great men who became legends in their own time, these icons of American sports history, as little more than spoiled, temperamental substance-abusers is outrageous.
Back then, as now, the Yankees were our hated rivals, but even so there wasn't a kid I knew who wouldn't have given everything to be Micky Mantle.
By now you must have surmised that I rooted for Roger Maris in the summer of 1961.
61* now ranks as one of the great baseball films ever.
Not only is monk the most hilarious mystery television show out there, it puts up a great mystery....television will never be the same, now that monk is on weekly.
The Los Angeles (later California and now Anaheim) Angels and Washington Senators (now Texas Rangers) began play, thus spreading the pitching talent more thinly.
Leave, now!
All those really great mountaineers now sadly perished, will be rolling over in their graves (if lucky enough to have one).
Obviously there's terrorists (Russian Terrorsits :O) dodgy Russian's, one of the climbing team has mysteriously been killed so the leader has asked his old climbing friend to join them who is now a monk after him and the leader lost a friend on a climb.
But I cant think of one, right now.
This film reminds me of so much of my own youth, and August Diehl's (Karl Koch) acting is perfect, that me and my wife now had to see it for the third time.
I believe I've now seen nearly all of the earlier episodes via reruns, but for some reason had never seen this initial episode before.
But the best indication of the real quality of this series is that, despite the many improvements made in the successive seasons, this initial effort was better than 99%+ of anything else on the tube, then or now.
But now "funny" scenes only include the characters burying, burying the body over and over again.
I always wondered why Paramount didn't stop production when they saw the final script and I can imagine it would now be just an embarrassment for the entire cast.
Natwick's character (she says she's 42, but Natwick was about 55 at the time of release of the film) appears to have never had a sexual experience before, and now with this Captain, played by Gwen, who we learn has distorted his past accomplishment, love might come to these two people.
During an argument, she smashed a bottle over his head and is now almost sure that he died as a result.
Where are they now?
Donald OConnor, Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Danny Kaye all had desire that is lacking in movies now.
This film shows up as well now as I did when I first saw it in 1996 and was amazed.
I don't know when it will be on again, right now its not scheduled anytime soon, but definitely watch it with someone you love!
I liked Dennis Weaver's performance better now than in the 70s when "McCloud" was fresh in my mind, because his character was not that likable.
but now u have just ruined it for me with the second one.
The new Paige definitely can't act and I can't believe she is now in a Prince & Me 3 and 4.
The producers obviously made more money than they thought with the first movie, and decided to make a second but came out with such a lousy result, that I think its a pity now that my image of the first movie is seconded with this sequel one!
And now I go and watch this "Romasanta", waiting for some excitement, even though the cast wasn't that good (Elsa Pataky, Julian SandsÂ).
Movie 1 it was brown and straight, but now it's unnaturally curly and blond?
It takes off where Paige is now in Denmark and is learning the language, the culture, and the perks of being a queen, including the paparazzi stalking her 24-7.
Maryam D'Abo's Queen Rosalind is flat and wooden and King Harald is now bald and sports a beard.
I am now totally obsessed with this Mexican American director Alfredo de Villa and look forward to this next movie.
It makes one hope he stays with us a long, long time so that we can see the full realization of his talents now that the spotlight is on him and he's better able to get good roles like this.
Too many European movie makers make movies to fit into Hollywood standards, hoping it will sell better; now, American authors teach Europe a lesson how good a movie can exist without Hollywood sugar, false glamour and forced tears.
there's a scene where the driver is taking the passenger home (i cant remember her name now) and the scene is from Mexico airport to her home!
now the nude scenes are great!
now, why on earth will Mexico support a movie like this???
I didn't know this film-maker, Reygadas promises much to me now.
I'm looking for Japon now.
I went into this film without realizing it was by Carlos R. I won't explain the storyline as you may have read it already by now - I will however try to rationalize why it may be loved/hated.
Only now they're large and less attractive, save one gravel-voiced sex cat, and they really truly believe they are making art.
This takes him to California, which is where the college sweetheart who walked out on him now lives.
I bought the double album that went with it (now if only Columbia would make it into a CD as well as a DVD of the movie - HINT, Columbia?)
Carlo Levi, an Italian who fought against the arrival of Fascism in his native Torino, was arrested for his activities and sent to exile in the Lucania region of the country, now known as Basilicata.
Yes graduated and will now be doing some work at the honey comb.
It also has Rip Torn who I cannot watch now without hearing "if you can dodge a wrench you can dodge a ball."
That sentence should be its own genre by now!
love story, becomes (or should that be....alright, I'll stop now) a quest for truth, warps into a courtroom drama, and ends up as a race against time with the fate of the Earth at stake.
now all bees don't want to work.
so that's successful now the bees are back collecting honey.
now barry's job is to be a pollen/honey collector.
Marty is initially ecstatic that his fantasy has been fulfilled, but now that he has opened Pandora's Box (so to speak), he is not prepared for the Sex Monster that emerges.
I certainly loved Babar as a kid, and have a soft spot for it now.
Children will definitely love it, and I do seriously think it is one of the better animated shows to come out in the 80s and 90s, most cartoons these days with one or two rare exceptions are awful with bad animation, lacklustre humour, poor music and lacks even juvenile appeal, or are shows that started off good and now are mediocre at best(Spongebob Squarepants I am looking at you!)
For those of you who possess something like a twisted romanticism, I tell you now not to miss this one, you'll regret it if you do.
America seems to be much less willing to address its failures now than it was then, or even the lesser failures in the wake of World War II.
America seems to be much less willing to address its failures now than it was then, or even the lesser failures in the wake of World War II.
The three soldiers now have a new mission.
Watch out, as now you're going to get an ass-kicking!
But now he faces a new threat in the shape of Romandy (Peter Cavanaugh) a small time gangster's son who wants to take over the casino.
In the Fifties to the Seventies this sort of entertainment designed for the small screen went over reasonably well, but now I suspect that there are more humorless TV viewers than ever who possess little patience and even less appreciation of anything with a sense of old school style and flair that BURKE'S LAW had in abundance.
Fans of the LORD OF THE RING trilogy are doubtless now familiar with the idea of forced perspective and doubled sets; but to watch the results done in 1921 without computer aids, optical printing or computer effects to aid the process and you will begin to get an idea of what a genius Rosher was.
So now Kristen's got her work cut out for her.
Many of the old TV shows are making their way to DVD now and this is one that definitely should be released on disc.
so she is now involved in a murder case.
I'm going out to buy a packet of straws and a box of cocktail sticks right now, and I'm going to wreak havoc in my neighbourhood.
I know this game is older now, but I just got around to playing it about a month ago.
I'm shaking my head right now as I notice the high rating for this documentary.
Everyone who attacks the puzzle is now on the same page, and the movie somehow made me feel a lot better about the human race.
If you have not seen this movie, do it now.
I'm also really curious to know how Jennifer's life developed, and also how all the other women are doing now.
She is now married to John Travolta and they have several kids.
Well I guess I am now Officially Un-Hip, because even in retrospect - No, I don't get it.
I wasted 90 minutes seeing it and I'm wasting more time now spleening about it.
They find themselves involved in a real murder mystery which Briane Aherne sets out to solve himself so that he can write about it and thereby write a good murder mystery; as he explains to his wife, all his stories up to now have been "corny".
I saw it six or seven times I think, there were years when mini-series were 'en vogue', but thinking of it now, I imagine it was pretty melodramatic.
Even the butcher is allowed a moment or two when he is neither a joke nor a threat but a human being, one who finds he regrets the life he now leads but is not persuaded to abandon it.
The world of "Delicatessen" is a dark bleak France where there is apparently no law and food is incredibly sparse (and is now used as currency).
In this fantasy world, the world has been ravaged and food is now in short supply.
Unfortunately for them a giant Octopus attacks the Texas Rose & the crew, Grogan (Hal Galili), Fenn (John Ratzenberger), Jacko (Derry Power) & the Captain are taken while the young deckhand Sandy (Ashley Knight) is left behind with the now wounded Professor.
The Octopus still looks quite good now and the effects were good for then 1978.
You have to see it to experience how rubbish it is, watch this film but don't pay anything more than a dollar, or pound or a euro... try and see if you can last till the movie ends...I couldn't the first time and missed the ending the second time, it now sits proudly with the rest of my DVD collection as it should with everyone, so you can say, I own the worst film eva made
During the final fight scene Steel, his martial arts mentor and for a few brief seconds (used as a weapon) the kindergarten children fight a clan of drug dealing ninjas who throughout the film had been played by children but are now mysteriously grown men.
I can't believe this one was ever released theatrically, nor why it is being shown on TBS now.
He tries his best in both Schwarzenegger's Raw Deal and now Patrick Swayze's Next of Kin to create a violent, good action film but make it passionate and dramatic and all about crime family vs crime family.
Swayze plays a former country boy who moved to the big city, became a cop, married his love, and is now urbanized himself.
Up until the Oedipus - joke I probably would have given this one an 8 but now seeing the whole film its this:  A verrrrrry small (like 6,5) 7 out of 10
I doubt someone could top him, even now.
As you may have worked out by now - I hated it.
I can see director Miike's demented fans now: chain-smoking teens-and- twenties drunks covered in tattoos, with metal hanging from holes punched in their faces, their knowledge-base inversely proportional to their intelligence estimate of themselves .
I have seen something like a dozen Miike films by now--the man produces them faster than I can watch them.
Michael never did receive the fame or accolades as his wife but I know he was proud of her even now as she earns one of Britain's top honor, Companion of Honor, only 65 living people at a time can receive this honor.
Why the garage owner waited until now to contact them and why the cultists take them with them is unknown, but take them they do.
Vic's sexual exploits have obviously taken their toll as he is now in a wheelchair and has had the fastest tattoo (cult symbol on back of neck that represents their individualism in the universe Â or it's just a Greek letter!)
i now know the value of checking with IMDb as to whether or not a movie is worth watching.
So drop what ever you are doing right now and see this movie today!
Naturally, having just crawled out of the desert and barely survived, they decide to go back and try to find the gold, ignoring the Indian who is now laughing manically at their decision.
The explanation for this is either simply not in the film, or is very briefly covered in sub-audible dialogue, but I gathered from a review that some wild west era settlers arrived there, settled, found the gold and woke the mummies, who subsequently killed the entire town and the inhabitants are now cursed.
As a person who has experienced the relationship between client and therapist for several years now, I found this movie to hit on the "sensitive" areas of that relationship in one of the most comical ways I have seen to date.
You see there's a pattern now in the film industry - Hollywood does action films, because they cost so much to make, and the Brits do comedy or drama.
OKAY, now watch the rest of the movie, because the last 15-to-20 minutes make it all worthwhile.
I think I found the movie and if I am right this take place on Christmas a boy was bothered and chased by boys from his class in school and they chaseed this boy into an abandon building while he found a stray cat and he took car of the cat by feeding it and taking care of the cat and then 1 day the kids from his class happen to do something to him at the cat and somehow at the end of this movie this boy ended up having a cat at his home  this movie i saw when I was a little boy in camp and I also saw it on hbo cinemax but I never knew the name and I been asking lots of people until now and I think this movie is the movie I been trying to look for years and I thought it came out in the 1970's since it is in color.
however i do remember that this little boy who found a cat in the alley and nursed him back to health,the boy use to feed the cat and himself tuna straight from the same can also every year around Christmas i believe it came on TV.and me and my sisters and brothers use to watch it.i was about 10 years old or younger.i have a pretty good memory and its now around Christmas i guess this is why this movie came to mind.not only that i have a cat whom i adore.
This movie stuck me deeply - to the point now, I'm 46 yrs old & still think about this movie, happened to look it up to see if I can purchase it somewhere & found some leads (I hope).
It's hard to believe now, in this age of loud, garish, obnoxious children's programming, that there once was a popular Saturday children's show that presented intelligent, sensitive, artistic films from around the world.
However, I understand now, it was something this poor child could give love to.
A lot of the story I couldn't remember because I was only about 7 or 8 when I last saw it, I'm 43 now.
for the next decade until I discovered in late 2001 that Carousel Film and Video (as they now call themselves) still owned the video rights to "J.T."
I am going to Contact Carrousel Films to see if they have the movie in DVD now.
Perhaps after a couple of decades of having seen it, its like Dark Shadows...you remember it as scarier (or in this case, funnier) than it actually was (and we'll sadly never know now how good it could have been), but I would love to go back and watch it again.
OK, now that you know about the web slinging wonder, Spiderman, let me describe the movie.
I am watching it right now with my son on CED.
Until then I have my memorys and the cartoon , for now that will have to do.
"Brother, you're with him, right now.")
Jokes like Ollie checking the time and spilling his drink down his shirt seem old now, but were possibly reasonably new then (and still considered good enough to be homaged 43 years later in The Young Ones).
Both comedians look in excellent health; a little older now, for sure, but age happens.
Those who lived in those modern dark ages, in countries like Brazil, Chile , Argentina, Uruguai, Greece, Spain, Portugal, and several others, which are now democracies, will have a new look through the eyes (with a biographical touch) a lovely young girl and her little brother.
Incapable of grasping the "big picture" as her parents see it, Anna knows only that the family is now woefully short on cash (she runs around the house flipping off light switches and heaters to save electricity), and that her mother and father are so preoccupied with their "cause" that Anna and her little brother (the adorable, scene-stealing Benjamin Feuillet) seem to have been relegated to mere afterthoughts in their parents' tremendously busy lives.
In both Penelope and Bloom, they find an instant connection, being hermits in a cave, and now with each other, finding it all the more worthwhile to emerge from their shells.
I am writing this right after watching the movie so my rating as of now is definitely 9, a must watch if your tired of the usual movies hitting the screens.
The great news is that for the first time an exclusively authorized, digitally enhanced 2 DVD set of "Psychotronic Man" is now available.
I am south Korean, now I am staying in Sweden.
The basic plot is that an old man has raised a baby girl until she is about to sexually develop, so she is now a teenager.
I adore the first three minutes of the film and have just watched them several times now.
He is now a controversial old man, a Senator and his word is key in funding Romanian movies with public money.
Very well-connected artists, whose father, Sergei Mikhalkov wrote the lyrics for National Anthem of the USSR, now the Russian Federation !
The Romanian cinematography has had a crack-up after the 1989-revolution which demolished communism, but now I think it started to come back again.
I can see the pitch saying, here is the script I doesn't make sense now but we will work on it in post.
It did well in Europe under various names but it played only once in Chicago where it was made on April, 23, 1980 at 7:00 P.M. in the now demolished Carnegie Theater.
I'm pretty disappointed not to be hearing about this movie a little more because it definitely deserves more recognition than it is getting now.
This film is one of those rare good films that you don't see anymore now this day and age.
I've pretty much seen all the classics as well as the hidden gems of the Italian sub genre of Giallo, so what remains now are the more obscure and undiscovered gems Â If I'm lucky, at least.
"Smile before Death" is not bad, but certainly not great neither (otherwise it would be wider known by now, ha!)
With out spoiling the movie I could not give a in depth review to prove to you how well this film was made, but at least now you know what you can do to help the progress of this wonderful film.
They don't make this kind of movies these days...right from the start till the very end it's all full-throttle action...and the thing that gets you is this : you don't expect much of it when you see the title and info, thinking "yeaahhh...another dumbass kids movie"...and though it has a few aspects that defy a realistic movie, but man, it becomes more and more engaging by the minute and keeps you focused with its breathtaking scenes and intensity...I mean, damn...this is a well-built movie people, good acting, good plot, strong moral values...and it's all done by simple means and lines, not like the majority of the movies you see now with great actors, boring scenarios and pathetic lines.
We had enough pain by watching Pan anyway, and now is it her grandson??
And now her coward grandson with her stupid characteristic.
Oh of course she does and she and Goku Jr.'s bully now turn friend are now in a jeep traveling to his destination, but sadly Goku is now completely out of the picture.
This movie makes me view Goku in a different light now, he is a runaway who's lazy.
For now this movie stays a relic of my boyhood past and for good reason.
I shall now do my last Good and Bad for Season 1, The Erlenmeyer Flask.
I think the special mood of this film may be that all of these faces are gone now and yet with us, part of those of us who watch and feel that vibration of the past lovers, the war in background and the sadness of our loss of that time and those faces, voices, memories.
Look, we all know the plot by now.
On the plus sides, Seagal does his own "fight" scenes, but they're just sad now.
The main actor has gotten even fatter then previously, and now takes about 2/3 of my widescreen TV.
Come one man you can do better than this ,i used to like your movies until now that is .
Steven Seagal should retire from film now and rest in peace.
The film uses corny jokes and a poke at America every now and then.
Christy also investigates the details about Vanessa's burial, as well as her medical files (which are now in private access for John Locke), all the while succumbing to near psychotic states when she suffers random seizures that lead her to draw darkly artistic portraits of people and threatening symbols.
Penelope Ann Miller elicits the pathos of seeing the ones she loves who do not understand what she now understands about life.
--- I didn't leave, although now I wish I had.
As others have commented here, seeing it now can clarify some of what changed in the assumptions of filmmaking during the 90s.
the much talked-about erotic elements and explicit sex scenes that caused the MPAA to create the now useless NC-17 rating, are actually well integrated into the film and actually work to create better understandings of the 3 principle characters through their sexual behaviors and practices.
"I'd love you at eleven--I love you now--I will love you at a hundred."
Director Phillip Kaufman stirred up quite a bit of controversy when this film was first being released, most likely because of the intensity of the love scenes, but after watching the DVD I am now thinking that this film could have maybe slipped by with an R rating.
the much talked-about erotic elements and explicit sex scenes that caused the MPAA to create the now useless NC-17 rating, are actually well integrated into the film and actually work to create better understandings of the 3 principle characters through their sexual behaviors and practices.
Kevin Spacey is amusing in what now looks like a cameo, but then was quite an important role for him.
Produced this: It was a great vehicle for her and I now have a new found respect for her as an artist.
Tomme is a happy native now.
Markham wants his son to go back to the white man's "Civilization," but Tomme is now a native and no longer fits in that civilization, no matter how civilized it is.
It is absolutely impossible to bring him out from the culture he now knows.
The father now realizes what civilization is doing to the Amazon forest and finally destroys the dam that threatened the life of the natives.
The father is now against the development that he was hired to accomplish.
A timely topic now as well as then.
Every now and then it's possible to come across in pre-Code Hollywood films of such mature pleasure you hope others will like them, too.
You can now see it on the new DVD compilation, "The Gary Cooper Collection", from Universal.
This really is a great movie from 1933 and very ahead of its time.A young woman who is in love with two friends and is obviously sleeping with both of them must have shocked a more prudish audience back then i think it had been censored for a while.But never mind we can view it today knowing that there are a lot of gems like this one waiting to be rediscovered,its a shame that so many of the films made from this era are now lost.A modern audience wouldn't turn away from this film,as you don't expect a film from this era to be saucy and it is.Gary Cooper was a very nice actor and you can see why he was so popular back then,he had a very unusual style of being very masculine and at the same time very sensitive,he was great at picking the more complex roles,his characters weren't as one dimensional as most actors of this era.He was easily one of the most interesting actors of the 30s,this i would say was his best era in films.Unfortunately A Farewell To Arms is the only film you can buy in the UK from this era,i don't know why.Its sad that he is becoming a forgotten actor,i think we must have lost our imaginations a bit as we keep harbouring on with the John Waynes and the Cary Grants,and forget there were other classic actors around that don't deserve to be forgotten yet.
Also a story line could be built on the idea that Tomme is now the Chief.
I hated this movie when I watched it, and after watching it again now I know why I hate it so much.
stunning and breathtaking,leaves you in ore. seen it twice once in a cinema and now on DVD.
From the harsh winters of the South Pole to the lush wilderness in France, the narrative now becomes part documentary and part fairy tale, which tells of the friendship between the two titular characters, Renard the fox and its friendship with the child who christened it, played by Bertille Noel-Beuneau.
Also, it was hard not to be reminded of Jungle2Jungle (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119432/) while watching it now, especially where the son mystically finds his father's skyscraper apartment in a large city.
We did it to the Ukranians in World War I, to the Japanese in World War II and now to Arabs and Muslims.
There are some now "legendary" scenes like the shotgun blast at the end and the sadistically long tongue ripping scene that really makes it clear what is the reason for this film's existence.
It is interesting to hear the makers' own opinions on these (low) films nowadays, now that most of the directors have retired and are old men, and the actors also aging but still possibly in the business.
Eye Candy: a hint of Cinzia De Carolis's bush & an unknown extras bares left tit  My Grade: D  DVD Extras: Uncut edition; 54 minute "Cannibal Apocalypse Redux" featurette; 6 & a half minute tour of filming locations; Poster & Stills gallery; Cast and crew filmographies; 8 minute Alternate American opening; Text essay detailing the butchering of the film; and European & Japanese theatrical trailers  3 Easter Eggs: go to the extras menu and there's an invisible bone over the guys tongue, click on it for the film's original theatrical trailer; Go to the filmographies menu highlight 'John Saxon' and press right for the original theatrical trailer for "La ragazza che sa-peva troppo" ; now highlight 'John Morghen' and press left for the original theatrical trailer of "Make Them Die Slowly"
There is more but I can't think of it right now.
Okay, now onto the individually delightful cheese elements: Stock helicopter footage opens the picture.
However, now that time has come and her father has decided that he wants to back out of the deal, only the cult isn't going to let him.
Here, "Devil Rides Out" hero Christopher Lee is now the villain, Father Michael.
Sykes started the film rolling and Widmark hit her right "in the chops" and the tears came and he said, "OK, now act."
In an old mansion there is a mysterious bedroom, "the blue room," where a man died 20 years earlier,and now, anyone who spends the night in the room disappears!
Nanny by now has become friends with Peter, even to the point of his letting her use the apartment to write in while he's in the office and Iris is still out of town.
(There's no corruption now, is there?)
Ten years later, the kid - now being a teenager - is discovered by his father who had never stopped searching for him.
Ms. Ginger Rogers is 43 years old by now (1954) and in one of her last roles before retirement.
Like Repeat Performance and All About Eve, Black Widow uncoils in a high-strung, back-stabbing theatrical milieu that's now all but vanished Â all the money and the glamour have moved west.
(Not to put too fine a point on it, but the tiny part of a struggling Greenwich Village actor is taken by television producer Aaron Spelling, now one of the richest men in Hollywood.)
I am now purchasing this boxed set for my Grandson, who is turning 9 soon.
Although I try not to miss any episode of "7 vidas" now, I have to say that I never watched it on its first seasons.
Blanca Portillo and Anabel Alonso have proved their great ability as comediennes, but the great discovery here has been unknown Carmen Machi, who had mostly worked in theater before and is now heading for a spin-off based on her character, Aida.
But as it happens, the protagonist learns to live his life "in the now" from the leading lady and in the process they grow together.
It may be slightly on the guy side of the chart, but for anyone that likes a little cheese now and then (especially if you were a young teen in the 80's), check this one out.
its one of those that now a days you'll find at 2 or 3 am.
its just a fun movie to watch with the actors in it that have made more of a name for themselves now than they did then.!
If you want it, you might have to spend upwards of 80 dollars for it... it's been out of production for quite awhile now.
You have to download them right now.
Just to get it out of the way right now, Packard is a sadistic son of a whore.
You'll get a clear picture of just how ridiculously mean he is later on, but for now, let's continue with the story.
Oh I feel dirty now, I actually liked this movie!
The gang features actors such as a young Nick Cassavetes (who now days is perhaps better known as a director) and Clint Howard in it.
Back then as a child I wanted a Turbo Interceptor, now as an adult I want one even more....BRILLIANT!
i saw this movie,and it's my love now.
If it was made now, it would have stinking CGI fx and too much back story.
all together now .
now let's all say it together folks .
There are a lot of zombie movies out there now like FEEDING THE MASSES, DAY OF THE DEAD II, SHAUN OF THE DEAD and many more.
I've now came to the conclusion that those reviews could only have been written by the film makers.
SO needless to say my porn collection has grown now to, but not many of the actors in the film are easy to find...
Paul has a right to be worried, Brett has a grudge against Cartwright, whose meddling stopped his plans years before - he now wants revenge.
Paul also feels that Barrington faked his own death and is now back to eliminate those who may be able to expose him as still being alive by being in the position of finding Judge Cartwright secret files; the Judge's family.
By now, Peggy has turned into Carol Burden, the daughter of the rich Cornelius Burden.
The end was the part that most impacted (me, at least) as the siblings were now able to see all the ghosts of the people who were "missing" (keep in mind in Spanish "missing" and "disappeared" in this case are the same word=desaparecido/s).
He is plain pathetic now.
Although we're an hour into the 170 minute production before they appear and the movie isn't about them, there's something poignant, amusing and inspiring when we see the aging D'Artagnan, Athos (Christopher Cazenove), Aramis (Alan Corduner) and Porthos (John Rhys-Davies), heavier now, gray, a little slower and often used for comedy relief, answer the call to honor and arms.
OK, it is not the best movie ever but its rating is 4.8 by now and this is way too low.
By now a brilliant master of pace, Griffith slows things down again for the final scene.
The film was never released here in the states legally, until now.
And yet, Bergman is not in style now.
When Sharpe discovers that many women children and indeed babies have been massacred under the Frenchman's orders, he is outraged and promptly executes without trial the two French soldiers they have caught, making an enemy of Loup who now vows a bitter revenge.
However when Lord Kiely learns that his wife is pregnant and that Jaunita is actually a French spy in the pay of General Loup, he quickly reorganises his loyalties and tries to rally his men back into order, but thanks to the lies regarding the British atrocities (spread by Juanita of course) many of them are now secretly working for the French against the British and are ready to turn on Sharpe in the heat of Battle, and help Loup organise the kidnap of Lady Keily.
With his friend's now his secret enemy, Sharpe and is Chosen Men are lured into a fight to the death against an enemy both seen and unseen.
For while the formula of Wellington having a problem, sending to Sharpe to solve it, a beautiful woman getting involved and everything culminating in a massive pitched battle was well and truly in place by now, Sharpe's Battle takes pains to develop its characters further.
I'm feeling guilty now.
My score of 8 out of 10 stands, but hopefully I've explained it a bit better now.
Escape now while you have the chance.
8 out of 10 stars  Watch it now!
Why would he take one now?
He now goes on a killing spree creating some serious crimes and stuffing some parts of the bodies into the meat factory where it can be processed into what we eat.
He tells his brother Nestor (Eusebio Poncela), who sings the same song as Paula, and now there are three.
He seems to be enjoying it now, even if he is becoming anxious.
So she's now freakin' over what happened and when she threatens to go to the police, homeboy strangles her and keeps her body in his bedroom.
The closest thing I can compare it to is APARTMENT ZERO, which I now believe was probably , eh, "inspired" by CANNIBAL MAN.
Anyway, now I will say Good and Bad things about this episode,  The Good: Wow, that was very brave of Mulder to go in there.
No real big names although by now you should have heard of some of the actors.
By far the strongest and most important Mythology until now.
And let's not forget that this was his first real movie and that it took him from nothing to Hollywood in like a second, now thats impressive.
It's also that fact that makes this movie so good, every aspiring director (including myself) sees this movie and if it weren't there before, now there is hope, hope that someday i will make it big time to.
By now we've all heard the story of how Kevin Smith somehow scrounged up $27000 to piece this rag tag film together.
Kevin Smith is now a recognizable name in Hollywood and that alone should make you want to see this film.
The film became a huge hit at Sundance, and is now widely (and justly) considered one of the best independent movies of all time.
So now he has to serve a bunch of rather annoying or excessively weird people, with occasional help from his friend Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson), who "works" in the video store next to Quick Stop.
Many of the crude adventures of Dante and Randal are now legendary.
"Second Best" shows what the guys from HBO's "Entourage" may be like 40 years from now, so Mark Wahlberg might want to see it as a cautionary tale.
I saw this again recently, and its such a relief from some of the crap that Disney puts out now.
Oops, this reminds me - I gotta quit writing reviews at the moment and finish writing my midterm paper - now!!!!!
It appears that the filming is authorized as CNR sees everything from the stage, throwing barbs at the audience now and again and would unquestionably have commented on the filming had it been done without his permission.
So now IÂ´m looking for the movie on European video or DVD - do you know anything about that?
The boy racer in everyone will enjoy the enthralling ride - equal to any racecam footage modern motorsport provides - the roar of a 60's Ferrari - to the enthusiast a sound now made mechanically impossible by noise regulations.
I'd like to add, now that I've seen Ronin I know where Frankenheimer got some of his inspiration.
I admit I'll watch one now and then just to see how far the story will wander off into the surreal.
I have seen him in "Tristan and Isolde," "Uncorked," and now this film.
Here in Brazil, a competitive place too, I went to one multiplex (I hope that's the name for these theatres with 7, 8, 9 (...) screens there) to watch "Teaching Mrs. Tingle" (I'm really embarrassed now).
i was interested in this one since i dont' know a lot about John Lennon's early life, and now that the Beatles are all hype again, i made it a point to see this.
i just wish now there is a continuing story!
All the historic sites written about over the years are shown -- the house where John Lennon grew up with his Aunt Mimi on Menlove Ave. (now a part of the National Trust), the Woolton Parish (where John and Paul McCartney first met), Penny Lane, Quarry Bank School for Boys, etc.
How far away the 1950's seem now - such an innocent time compared to today.
It is all about her confidence and eyes, her body language makes it work, and you fall for her just as LaBeouf does, whereas the usual R-rated nudity and over the top craziness has been going so far as to numb audiences by doing what every film now does.
There are obvious connections to Rear Window, the movie even being dubbed Rear Window for the MTV generation (although aren't we a bit past that now?
In the past few years, amidst forgettable roles in I, Robot, and Constantine, he contributed strong performances in films like A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints, and now in the thriller Disturbia.
There were perfect moments in the film where you feel like, it could end right now, and you wouldn't feel cheated at all.
is a romantic loser who says things like " You should see yourself right now - a grown man with his hand down his pants."
Then they asked Kevin and Scott to think of a good poster, now Kevin and Scott didn't think of "hey what would make people want to check out our movie?"
Also, (now this is where I get a bit picky) the original opening of this film was cut, and for good reason, it sucked, it was not funny at all, nor was it even somewhat realistic.
I loved this movie so much that i now own it and every other Kevin Smith flick.
Maybe it was because I saw this one after I had already seen Dogma and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, but now I got some of those great "in-jokes" that were included in those movies.
But the potty humor mixed with the intelligent dialogue (about scatological topics) hit home with me, and even now -- thirteen years later -- it remains my favorite film.
Certainly it would make anyone think: "Come on, now.
Because as simple as that, from the denial of a moustache's existence, now his own is in peril.
This is a BRILLIANT film and now it's one of my new favourites.
The movie then jumps to what seems like days later (or perhaps even longer) and the main character now has a moustache grown out.
It's honestly one of the best scary flicks I've seen in years, and now ranks alongside Session 9 as one of my all time faves.
No doubt the remake rights, as is the trend now, were part and parcel with distribution rights.
This is the current tactic of the American film industry now - distribution with the condition of remake rights.
now - i don't agree with that per se - but it has it's strong points, believe me - on account of we women can make very little sense to our men at times.
They have eaten so much cheese that now they can't stand the thought of ever eating it again.
So, they decide that life now has no meaning and they want to kill themselves by giving themselves to the cat to be eaten.
And, predictably enough, the dog is now afraid to eat cats because he thinks they are poisoned and most of the movie consists of the mice and cat doing terrible things to try to force them to be eaten!
Watch it now--especially if you love zombie movies and remember the "cola wars" of the 80s.
Instead, it is in that select group of shows like "He And She" that were not successful, but ended being fondly remembered by those who caught them - and who now wish they were available on DVD or Video.
The plot wouldn't work now of course, what with the amount of CCTV's & security, the fact a lot of people pay by credit card & I don't understand why the gang don't try to cover their faces.
A triumphant and smug Davidson tells a now completely destroyed, in mind and body, Sadie that she'll have to pay for her sins in being put away behind bars back in the states even if she's guilty or not!
Davidson playing what seems like a sadistic little cat and mouse game with Sadie tells her that she can leave for Sidney only to have Sadie, now suffering from what looks like a sever case of Stockhome Syndrome, chooses to go back to the states and face her punishment and have her soul cleansed.
I'd seen The Razor's Edge with Tyrone Power, and I'd read a couple of Maugham's short stories (I forget which ones, it's been so long), but I'd never taken the time to see read the story or see this film until now.
The story deals with the inner nature of a sanctimonious religious hypocrite, something quite relevant now.
Davidson soothes her in her extremis by telling her in a hypnotic voice (backed by native drums) that she is now "radiant, beautiful, one of the daughters of the King" (a moment of sheer unearthly poetry that verges on psychosis), we believe him -- and her.
So, if you want to enjoy the mystery first, then stop right now...and come back after you've seen the film.
As the final scene very slowly fades to black, the camera fixes on Marc's troubled eyes, the unspoken question screaming at us: am I in a dream now, or have I woken up?
It also led me to learn that the Brits were years ahead of Hollywood in the treatment of gay characters in movies, and I now count "Who Killed Sister George?"
It was very amusing stuff when Holmes smashed the vase and he tries to convince that it is worth nothing and he says "Now now my good man" in a really funny high pitched voice.
We are now on the fringes of a Kafkaesque scenario which isn't really resolved satisfactorily.
For reasons that eluded me Marc, by now convinced that Devos has some hidden agenda he can't fathom, lights out for Hong Kong literally in just the clothes he stands up in and spends a few days - weeks, months?
Unbelievable that Conway would let this happen to his only masterpiece....  Perhaps maybe we'll get an uncut DVD someday - yeah right - it's amazing this is out on DVD now.
I watch it again and again with my kids now.
They say I have to write 10 lines of text and I have nothing else to say, so now I am just filling space.
I love this movie and have to have that DVD now that I know it's available.
But if you watch them back to back now I think this one comes out on top.
Streets of Laredo is just as compelling as the original the only difference is that James Garner now holds the reins as Captain Woodrow Call,One of the most legendary Texas Rangers ever.
Woodrow Call is now a feared Bounty hunter and one of the greatest bounty hunters of his age.
Call is now older but no wiser in the ways of the world and when he's hired to track down a Mexican Bandit named Joey Garza.
Call Drags his ever loyal Corperal Pea-Eye Parker to help him track down the killer despite Pea-Eye now being married and having a family of his own.
But unlike the first half of the film where they've downplayed the military aspects and refer to it as the Islamic expansion, now the military aspects cannot be ignored and it is referred to as the "Ottoman expansion."
We begin with in Stardate 43997 during the first Borg attack on Earth in the TNG episode "The Best Of Both Worlds", where we see the soon-to-be Commander Sisko (played by Avery Brooks) as an officer on one of the Federation ships trying to attack the Borg cube (under the command of the newly assimilated Picard - now known as the Borg Locutus).
Plus, no one complained about replicated food on the Enterprise they thought it was great, so why now on DS9?
And now I will answer a Why for you.
We begin with in Stardate 43997 during the first Borg attack on Earth in the TNG episode "The Best Of Both Worlds", where we see the soon-to-be Commander Sisko (played by Avery Brooks) as an officer on one of the Federation ships trying to attack the Borg cube (under the command of the newly assimilated Picard - now known as the Borg Locutus).
instead of attempting to escape from the pigs on his bike, the scene with the guv, his brother and the other drivers would be a great opening instead we get a boring ass bit that introduces hell as a soldier instead of an outlaw so now he's just a slacker jarhead an insult to the book i hope someday someone makes a new version that's actually true to the story cuz that would be a great movie
Yeah OK, I'm giving this flick a 7 because I really dug it in the day (although of course not nearly as much as Star Wars which I saw at the Lowes theater in full surround sound, now that was an all time high!).
But I mean anyone who watches this flick now for the first time will give this maybe a 4 if they are a post apocalyptic flick lover type like me, and a 1 or 2 if not.
This was filmed in Cinemascope and with a budget of 17 million which may seem like very little now but in 1977 was pretty high for a genre film and about double that of Star Wars.
I finally re-watched "Damnation Alley" now, and what mostly astounded me was how amateurish, clumsy and boring the film is seen through the eyes of an adult!
When his children are mysteriously kidnapped he encounters a fairy (Julia Roberts) who tells him he is the long-lost (and short of memory) adult now Peter Pan .
As for me, this movie has a true treat, an fantastic heart-warming family movie like we all need every now and then.
But I am grown up now and it really struck a cord in me for some reason.
I didn't understand it 18 years ago but it sure as hell is funny now!
This movie is so worth watching if you're looking for a family movie and have kids of your own now.
In the 1990's Peter Pan is now a middle aged man with a lot of work on his head, his name is now Peter Banning.
That is the premise behind Hook, when Captain Hook kidnaps the now adult Peter Pan's children and takes them back to Neverland.
Yes, this is a kids movie.I'm 18 years old now and that would be prime age to hate a kids movie, yet I love it as much as I did as a youngster.
After all, what's wrong with a little dumb fun now and then?
When it was released, many of us were young children and we all enjoyed it, but now that we are older, too many people are pointing out the bad jokes and mistakes and clichÃ©s that they have found.
The Joker makes Sal laugh to death while getting the Phantasm on tape, and now The Joker knows the true identity of the vigilante.
The police are now on the lookout for Batman (Kevin Conroy).
Now I have been adding some Batman titles; I began with the Batman and Superman movie, a movie that I found just good by the way (later I will be writing on here a complete comment for that movie), and later I began to watch Batman Beyond, a series that I never watched before and that right now I'm enjoying a lot (soon I will be writing a full comment for Season 1).
This was my next step and I must "confess" that I had never watched this movie before, now I'm really glad I watched it.
there is a mysterious killer that is going around Gotham that is murdering a gang of now old gangsters and Batman is being blamed.
the main theme starts up and there is a pause as Bruce stares at the mask briefly, possibly thinking, this is the only way now.
When it comes to films about terrorism, the Hollywood market is one dominated by the exploits of cowboys and tough-headed, no-crap Americanism that one might get a kick out of every now and again if it doesn't take itself too seriously (Die Hard), but too often submerges any substance and truth to the situation by trying to please the popcorn-munching audience members too eagerly.
When she recalls an old sweetheart from childhood days, Johnny, who is now a fireman (also played by Cornel Wilde), she realizes he's the one for her but there are many tangled threads to set aright.
Overall, I recommend the movie, but also feel there are a lot of other films in the theater now that should be seen first.
It takes place in a breath-taking array of locales, shifting countries and continents with nothing more than a skyline and a subtitle to tell the viewer where the characters are now.
(Children please leave now, this is an adult movie)  Part of the reason why I enjoyed this movie so much is because it engages you as the viewer by forcing you to consider all the event that are happening.
now for everyone of you that have seen the trailer to this and got the impression that its a laugh a minute film that you can watch with all your friends, its not.
now i hope by saying that i don't give the impression that i'm discrediting the film but the funny parts in the trailer are about the only funny parts in the film.
As on the side Katie is seducing womanizer and federal government employee Harry Dfarrer(George Clooney).So the film has already introduced some complex characters now enter the big plot and theme of the movie two dim-witted fitness gym employees(Brad Pitt and Frances McDormand) come across one of Mr. Cox's old CD-ROM disc of classified information from his CIA days.
Listen, Burn After Reading is out on DVD now so it's defiantly worth renting, especially if you have Netflix.
I have never felt healthier than after 96 minutes of explosive and grateful laughter at the "Burn" screening, also marveling at the array of British-stage caliber acting from "Fargo"-invoking Frances McDormand, witchy-icy Tilda Swinton, a more-manic-than-ever John Malkovich, and a dozen major players, such as J.K. Simmons as the deadpan CIA boss and Richard Jenkins as the former Greek Orthodox priest, now running an upscale gym.
go and see this movie now!
I am sure by now you know the plot summary so I won't go there.
Naturally, the boy's father sees this and is mortified -- what will become of his run for the governorship now?
Without spoiling any of the movie, I'd like to say that I am now the proud owner of not one, but TWO copies of this DVD.
You know the background by now so i won't bother going into the plot.
there have been many films before about white boys trying to act like the stereotype black gang banger rapper but they have mostly flopped until now.
The film is punctuated with Bowie's "Ashes to Ashes" soundtrack, using this now classic song to great effect as our hero staggers around, disillusioned and helpless; armed with a pump action shotgun, an English accent and some attitude, Richard's quest for the truth is soon accompanied by female friend and convert, Layla (Susan Blakely) as she convinces him to seek additional help and advice from Professor Alan Jeffries (Geoffrey Lewis), with disastrous consequences of betrayal...
well that's all for now and later in the movie a female cyborg was crushed on a wall by another cyborg that malfunctioned .
Did I mention that there also happens to be a plot line about the airplane carrying the Senegal flu, which is now spreading among the crew?
She begins acting strangely and having odd meetings with unknown people, and as the reporter begins to investigate things and ask more questions, she tries to kill him and he finds she's now a terminator-like robot(complete with the same kind of eye-tracking visuals from that film).
An I got to say I didn't expect it to turn out so well from the beginning but now I must say it's because I was being a hard headed Disney purist with the whole thing of No Disney Sequels are Bad!
But now I see I was wrong, there's actually some good ones in plot wise and then there's some bad ones you just have to watch them for at least 30 mins to give them a chance but some may require 40 mins the most.
Cinderella, with the help of her mice friends Jaq and Gus, must now fight for her happily ever after.
The Prince, instead of being a personality-free, rhino-hating, long-eyelashed nobody like he was in II, is now a really nice, humble, long-eyelashed main character with a really modern and less formal attitude.
I mean, she is drawn completely differently and looks incredibly weird now.
I now deeply regret my decision to see it at all.
Instead of making everything easy for Cinderella, she is now working against magic and must overcome something a lot more powerful than a mean old lady- a mean old lady with a magic wand.
Well, this is still a Disney film so magic is used and the slipper now fits Anastasia.
I mourn the loss of an art form that Disney worked so hard to gain respect for, the brilliant animators who are now out of a job, and for the fact that their efforts will no doubt be overlooked as "mediocre" by critics and audiences that simply don't understand the effort that went into this film.
for now i would say the script seems even more interesting than the story behind it, but regardless of the star cavalcade they somehow managed to ruin it.
For instance, the first 30 minutes of the movie spend way too long dealing with Karen's relationship with her three children, who are now in the custody of her ex-husband, but never appear in the movie after that.
Super Metroid uses some of the same maps from the original Metroid which are now deserted and has an overwhelming feeling of nostalgia.
She encountered Metroids in both, and now the last Metroid has been captured by Ridley.
I have it now, it was released on video for some time.
The show is over now and so is David and Franks bulling, The BBC don't want them back, ITV told them to go and now frank is trying to start his stand-up career again where he left off.
If you've not seen this movie, see it now.
What was meant to be a gift has become In present-day Montreal, the violin that was once going to be the prize possession of Bussotti's baby is now up for auction.
This movie was one of the best Aussie movies that I have ever seen and I have been looking for a copy of it ever since I was in a teenager but with no success, now I know why.
My wife has mean looking for it for over 2 years now.
This person has since passed on , and now his family who retain the rights have declined to allow reproduction of this truly Aussie Icon Film.
I've been a fan of the actor for ages now, and here he has a role to showcase his full range of talent.
I've never seen Sisto in anything, but now he's on my "must watch" list.
It's like, yeah I'm in for peace, now lets have free sex.
The outstanding songs are now given an extra dimension by the band members who really get it on.Just watch Pete Townshend of the Who playing his guitar on "Summertime Blues",same thing for Alvin Lee of Ten Years After playing the brilliant "I'm Going Home",a rock ode to some legendary Rock 'n Roll songs of the 50's and early 60's.
Although the music is the best part of the movie,the scenes between the songs and sometimes during the songs(brilliantly done)are also of very high and entertaining quality.The "port-o-san-man" scene is quite hilarious and the "rain" scenes show the interaction between the visitors.Not to mention the shots of the village people,the people who live in the village close to the festival.Some are delighted by the festival and some are really p***ed off,watch the sceneof the old "conservative" man working on his car and the debate between the villagers on whether the festival is good or not good for America,this also shows you the big split of views of the american people in those days which now also reflects on the present debate of a war.
Also some legendary quotes came from this festival:"It's a free concert from now on","What we have in mind is breakfast in bed for 400.000" and of course "the Brown Acid warning" which was used as a joke in Wayne's World 2,the parody of the Woodstock Festival.
It was a bit surreal back then, and even now to realize that a city of almost half a million people came together for a weekend, enjoyed three days of peace and music, and then disbanded quietly while a nation watched in wonder.
As I have seen this many times since it first came out on in the theater and then on VHS, I now just fast-forward chapters on the DVD to the music, enjoying my favorite performances in this epic documentary of the most famous rock concert of all time.
For someone who was part of that time, things that were "cool" back then now look and sound a little stupid and naive, but it's still fun to watch.
By supporting Dark Assassin we might finally see some variation in the world of martial arts movie making, which are a bit stale and repetitive right now.
I myself am a eclectic martial art stylist who blends Wing Chung Kung Fu, Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, Professional Wrestling, and Krav Maga into a single loosely structured flexible system I call "Combat Wrestling", and of course, I like a good martial art film now and then.
I found myself shifting around in my seat, spacing in and out every now and then and pretty much wanting to leave.
In closing, let me just debunk a review here which commented on the other users' comments instead of commenting on the movie (and I'm committing the same crime now), but The Echo is at the very least a decent ghost movie...to call it "half-decent" is already being silly.
And now there's Cashmere Mafia.
The story is in place and the characters are in place, but it is just put together in a very over-the-top, run-of-the-mill way that is hardly as classy as Sex and the City ("SatC" from now on).
In Holland the second season is now on TV.
I watched season 1 and the beginning of season 2 in a weekend, and now I am addicted.
4th movement (the finale): Up until now, due to selective camera shots, we haven't been entirely certain whether the killings have been the result of the leopard or someone else.
And the denouement isn't as satisfactory as the balance of the picture, although the motivation for the spree comes off as too creepily real, with what we now know about serial killers.
So basically these two go at it for with WWE's now defunct European title on the line.
They are both judged for a manslaughter and now they'll have to survive the violence and triad corruption inside the stone.
I've been waiting with great anticipation for this to come out on DVD, and now that it is, I'm hugely looking forward to seeing it again, and to making it my number one choice for a "party movie."
Their apartments are old, falling apart, and now the city has allowed a developer to evict them in order to build a new skyscraper.
If you don't think it will scare you from what you may have read about it until now, then see it on my words.
6 tenants of an old apartment complex that has been marked for demolition (as part of an urban renewal program) try to make it through the onslaught of rat people that now prowl the streets, walls, and every ware in between.
But now I know why since this is a John Huges film.
I find the plot really hard to forget now as often I found myself amazed at how thought out this movie was.
"Non-Fiction" revolves around the exploits of a documentation filmmaker and his desire to make a documentary about teenagers and what they're feeling now.
The short film comes across as even trite and cliched, although now I realize that I'm quoting a scene from it almost directly, so perhaps this is Solondz's point.
I have seen this movie twice now, and I'm wondering what is up with that large orange block in the first story?
Not as focused as Dollhouse or as filled-out as Happiness, Storytelling does seem sparse, and that's one of the things I like best about it (I've seen it 4 times now)- how T.S.
For years now we've been plagued with things like "episode" 1-3 of Star Wars, or worse, the CG animated re-edit special edition of the original Star Wars trilogy.
The Plot If any is (now please don't hate me for revealing it) At the end of mankind on Earth, the scientists build a self-sufficient underground city for a few people in order to preserve the human race for two hundred years.
I am most defiantly picking up the book for a more detailed story of ember, but as it stands now the movie is an enjoyable one.
Fortunately for myself I have never taken it upon myself to read the source material on which this movie is based upon, nor had I even heard of it until now.
The massive sets were built in Northern Ireland in the shipyard-turned-soundstage of the location the Titanic was actually constructed in (now the largest soundstage in the world) and it's never more apparent than in the beautiful crane shots through the underground city.
There, now ya don't hafta see it.
The film is full of gloriously unpredictable moments like this, helping it transcend the immediate object of satire, which has dated, now that Hollywood has given up as unprofitable the attempt to educate audiences in high culture.
I had been aware of the  antics of the Three Stooges, Laurel and Hardy and Abbott and  Costello, but now I could see first hand the live slapstick of  involved comedy.
(Hollywood turned these out every now and again often to mixed results)   Music aside I really like this movie.
I had been aware of the  antics of the Three Stooges, Laurel and Hardy and Abbott and  Costello, but now I could see first hand the live slapstick of  involved comedy.
As I have wrote, I like very much the performance of Andy Garcia, I saw him in other two films but now that he is the principal in this movie I think that he should have more opportunities.
It's now three years later and Michael is getting his life back together, and putting Kyle's tragic death behind him, as he goes on the lecture circuit and is invited to speak at his alma mater Kansas University.
It's at Kansas U. that Michael meets one of his former students Dr. Barbara Wagner, Teri Polo, now a licensed psychologist at the Holly Health School for Wayward Boys who asks him about seeing one of her patients 17 year-old Tommy Caffey, Vincent Kartheiser.
Barbara Wagner (Teri Polo) is her former student and now responsible in an orphanage for the teenager Tommy (Vincent Kartheiser), a boy traumatized by the death of his mother.
The weapon used in the Movie Looker is now real.
I've seen The Ice Storm, Hulk, Tiger/Dragon, Brokeback Mountain,and now Lust/Caution.
Considering it is now 20+ years old, it contained technology that is deployed by the military today (light flashes and how it affects the human brain).
This emotionally confronting experiences is devastating for Tai as she actually is very fond of Kuang this combined with the brutal amateur murder by the group were the major factors in her desertion of the theatre now turned resistance group.
It had the look and feel of a former utopia that was now a hellish war torn city.
By them, Ang Lee tells us he was once like them, and still is now, sending message to the audience through art, through culture, and with passion.
I watched this film when i was about 14 and spent the next decade hunting for it after it became deleted, i recently came across it and watching it now i can appreciate it in its silly 80's glory!
I still love this film nevertheless, now that I am able to appreciate and articulate exactly why.
I grew up with this movie along with the other classics, and I love it now just the same.
She is now a forever prisoner in the cursed castle, unknowing that she is the key to ending the Beast's torment.
She begs the Beast to set him free and take her instead, and he accepts this offer, so Belle is now his prisoner.
In the Disney cartoon/video game "Kingdom Hearts" series, Belle, Beast (now voiced by Robby Benson since "Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas" and "Belle's Magical World", even with a little help of some equipment and devices that they used in the 1996 film "Ransom" which starred Mel Gibson), Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, Chip, Wardrobe, and Prince (appearing at the "Kingdom Hearts II" end credits) cope with Sora, Donald Duck, and Goofy as Sora, Donald, and Goofy battle the Heartless, Nobodies, and the Orginization 13.
Although not a huge fan of the movie, I find no fault at all with this film, and it's especially appealing now that it's out on DVD.
The only hope now for either Belle or the Beast lies in the remote possibility that true love may somehow prevail before the last petal of the enchanted rose falls.
the animation was top notch: even now, after disney has had time to develop better computer animation techniques, it still has beautiful color and flow.
I collect everything I can now, and watch it when I need a lift.
Interesting to see how different he is with George on the bonus disc of the Beatles Anthology, yet GH still exhibits a wariness that hides lots of stuff I daresay will never now be known.
Paul McCartney has the biggest say in what will happen to the film, for now we all have to make do with old copies of VHS versions of the original film.
If anything the premise is even more believable now than it was 26 years ago.
Another watched in-flight movie on my IPod, "Let it Be" for my money now stands as an honest and convincing testimony to the talent and stature of The Beatles, even as one can sense the ties that bind loosening them individually in front of you.
The atmosphere seems to be bit dark, Lennon is passive and Paul is clearly the one who is steering the ship now.
The scenes where Phillips shows Clark round 'Project Tic-Toc' impress even now, with sets that look designed for the cinema ( I was reminded of the Krel complex in 'Forbidden Planet' ) rather than television.
I do not recall how this series ends but now I have the complete set of episode to delight along the next days.
Every now and then a movie just plain WORKS.
The kid who acted like he knew everything, must now confront his complete lack of knowledge: about the world, about his friends, and about himself.
And how it's shaped us now, instead of hippies were anarchist.
It's very interesting to see the "new age hippie" mixed in with the radical 60's hippies (who are now adults).
To put in perspective how crappy and insulting this movie is, consider that I have been a frequent user of IMDB for years now, frequently visiting this site several times a day.
How a potential technology could really cause problems in the here and now.
(Again, probably happening now, even if we don't know about it.)
In trying to protect the last, whom he develops a personal bond with, he uncovers a plot to use computer generated images (wow, and now they are real!)
We'd NEVER see that now.
Really now.
I particularly like it when he attacks the faux news (noise) folks for the prostitutes they are to the fascist "upper" hand now running into oblivion what was the American Republican Party.
And now no one can prosecute him.
I now look forward to 8'o clock pm.
Seen today it's highly watchable and competently done but overall I feel that Meet Me In St Louis would come off best in say another fifty years from now.
Some of the slapstick may seem dated by now, but then what about 'American Pie'.
In this case, the male lead is actually the son of the original sheik, but Valentino also plays, just as engagingly, the father who is now middle aged, wiser (this is essentially the adviser role Adolphe Menjou had in the original movie) but still commanding and able to wield a sword.
Where a bit of peroxide and hint of stocking sent the boys wild -- I bit like today now that I think about it!
but is now a man pursued by many who wish to bash in his skull!
Heck, now that I think of it, "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" would definitely be my choice as the best Arthurian film out there!
I have to add this production is so special that I purchased a video copy imported from USA at a cost of Â£140 in early 2000 and now have a downloaded version that I have on DVD.
The only disappointment I have is that it had to end, but I know every now and again I can pull out a copy and view this most wonderful production with an inner feeling that I need to preach to all to sit down and watch Lipstick On You Collar so they to can share this wonderful wonderful experience .
The editing is also terrible, with places where you feel like saying yourself "ok, you can cut now, the moment is over, cut already."
It's called Megalodon but we don't see the shark until well after the fact, and they really don't seem to freak out about the fact that the shark is supposedly prehistoric but now lives in our ocean.
It's not original, it lacks a bit suspense every now and then, the acting is just average and you can tell that the budget was low, to name only a few things.
I've now done this three times and am trying to track down a copy for my own library.
I am now on a personal crusade to bring this marvelously entertaining work of art to the attention of anyone who will listen.
But now as I watch the film 2 years later I realise its the emotional story between Seth and Veronica that drives it to the end.
In short 'The Fly' is well worth taking the time to sit down and watch be it now or in ten years this film will always be a classic.
But now the dream is overÂ and the insect is awake".
We notice also that his face is starting too look a little bit more rough, he's only eating sweets, and now has amazing strength.
But now Seth has a bigger problem, he's now loosing his body parts and collecting the "Seth Brendel Museum", he is grossly disfigured when he begs Ronnie to come back into his life and help him.
Karloff, having just given the performance of his career in the earlier THE BODY SNATCHER, now gives what may be his weakest performance of the 1940s with this film--and frankly he looks incredibly ridiculous with curly hair.
A rare gem also, in that the film is practically unmentioned now.
I don't like musicals Â the idea of a group of people bursting into spontaneous communal song never appealed to me, but the combination of scenario (a post second world war era where the war is now fought as much in the halls of Whitehall as on the battlefield Â and Britain is losing) and music (British 50's) just hit the right note with me (pun intended).
9/13 Â I don't count those last 3 non-RKO efforts with John Calvert), and had to do without the comedy double act of Clark and Gargan from now on.
Every now and then though I find a rating that just absolutely mystifies me.
Maybe hard to find now, but!
He's done High School Musical, but he can't coast along on that so now he's making appearances on other Disney shows'.
The greatness of "San Francisco" now dwarfs this earlier one.
Firstly, Hollywood was now working, for the first time, under the active supervision of the Production Code Administration.
Well, now we can see them and so many of them are good that we can at last see Myrna Loy in perspective and appreciate just how unique and special she really was.
We get the whole thing, death row, the last minute requests for a reprieve (oh yes, Powell is Governor of New York by now and is the one who gets begged to save Blackie's life).
This plot is now screamingly familar but, back in 1934, this was original.
I'm 22 now and I still love the film that much, I'm actually watching it right now.
I have seen it when I was just a teenager and now I have found it again.
Still, I remember that I was awed by the invisibility cloak, have the "Mio, my Mio" tune stuck in my head now in then - the one that gets played on the pipes sticks there too at times - and frightened by the ending battle scene.
I loved it from the moment I first watched it, and even now, at nineteen, it's still one of my favorite movies.
I was wrong yet now glad that I did not turn down watching this film.
To quote Dylan in the movie: "I can see it now, she is a stunningly attractive woman."
On the whole, another brilliant Korean flick, of which there are many coming into mainstream cinemas in the UK now.
First, two things: Spoilers to come, so if you haven't seen this movie you might want to stop reading now.
He's a pimp and she's now a prostitute.
"Bad Guy (Nabbeun namja)" is an earlier film of Ki-duk Kim that is probably being released now in the U.S. due to the success of "Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring (Bom yeoreum gaeul gyeoul geurigo bom)," but fans of that visually entrancing parable should be warned how very different this exploration of the depths of human nature is.
By now we have grown accustomed to multiple story lines.
I guarantee anyone who's seen SS5+ and just read that is curled up on the floor wiping their eyes right now.
By the second time I got through this carousel of events, my mind, now pleasantly anesthetized, stopped trying to find out what's going on and just started enjoying and craving more from each situation.
I am not usually a big fan of experimental films but this movie is now one of my all time favorites.
Well I must say this is one of my favorites now.
She's pretty well fixed now with a new and rich husband and a daughter by that marriage.
The Champ is guaranteed four handkerchief film even now almost eighty years after its debut.
with watching the film numerous times i have now picked up on the camera work and the magnificent colours, with noticing in the first time i watch Amelie the fantastic camera work and special effect which bring the film to life and help tell the story with out the translation, the camera work has defiantly made up for the storyline in Amelie and you notice something every time you watch the film.the colours also help the film and always give your eyes something to notice.
I've always thought that if Amelie would have been an Hollywood movie, everyone would have said "It too sappy", but now when it is in french: "Aaah...it's so nice."
I must say, after I've watched this move, I now consider it my all-time favorite.
Every now and then movies come along that speak out to you and emotionally touch you in some way.
so she decides to return it to him, and when the boy whose now a man finds it he's so grateful that he begins to cry.
It isn't very surprising that this has been a hit in France for a while now, and I have no doubt it will find the audience it needs in the States as well.
And now it has come out in the US, I am a bit frightened, because everybody there describes it as a simple 'feel-good movie'.
(please, will someone give an oscar to that girl, she makes Kidman & Blanchett look pale :-) The score from Yann Tiersen is so beautiful that by now I'm addicted to it ( I read here somewhere something about 'accordeon jingle', please, get some education ;-).
The story itself could easily have been abused, and I'm sure that if Hollywood had made this movie, it would have been ridiculous, but now it is a beauty, a pearl amidst broken hearts.
It certainly deserved the Best Picture award it got there - we're waiting now to see it in a proper theater!
The main problem is that now a days, people choose an actor according to their physical beauty.
The first (Zaki) was previously known as a (Basha) a very well rich man before the Egyptian revolution & now he is a normal old citizen who has his teenage fantasies with many sexual relations with hookers & no job to do except avoiding his evil sister played by (Esad Younes) who kicked him out of his house & tries to send him to a psychyatric hospital at the end to vanquish him forever.
Special lines and scenes are added for Zaky el dessouki (Adel emam) only because he's a famous comedian and the audience would like him to throw a joke every now and then although it's totally unnecessary,Taha's (Mohamed emam) clothes are not of his social class in anyway!
It's a great movie that shows the changes that happened in the Egyptian Society from the age of the kingdom of Egypt until our age now.
now in the age of 65, he's living a lonely life only to enjoy himself with women and girls of different types, finally he found the true love with Bothayna (Hend Sabry) and suffering from the annoying of his half mad sister Dawlat (Essad Youniss) ..  - Haj Azzam (Nour El Seriff): An old tycoon started from zero, wanted to play a politic role but was lost and surrendered in the middle of corruption that rules the game of politics ..  - Taha (Mohamed Emam): a low level young man failed to achieve his dream to become a police officer, instead he joined a radical cell who doesn't really understood the true meaning of the great religion of Islam and became a terrorist and finally died while trying to kill the police officer who once tortured him when he was captured and jailed ..  - Bothayna (Hend Sabry): a poor girl who was forced to become a whore serving the ugliest kinds of people to have the money to live and finally found Zaki El Dissouki who gave her the power and the true meaning of love and finally married him - Hatem Rasheed (Khaled El Sawy): A great chief editor in the journal d'Egypt magazine who is living his life as a desperate homosexual and trying to find a guy to satisfy his sick needs and tends ..  A strange mix of characters which were perfectly managed by a strong story and a great and promising director (Marawan Hamed) Really a worthy movie to be seen as it reflects a hard criticism to some corrupted situations of politics, sexual lives and terrorism *** Lo'ay
The details are so sketchy now which is sad, but I never forgot that movie.
I don't understand why it never went anywhere and is now completely unavailable.
The concert 'Road Tested' is remarkable: I have the double CD, the VHS and now I have just bought the DVD.
It's been a few years since I checked to see if it's available now in any format.
I just Googled it and see that it IS now available in VHS or DVD format!!!
Perhaps the fact that this film is now 59 years old and what was arguably fast-moving then now veers toward the pedestrian draws attention to this basic flaw.
I too thought it was a Mercedes but now know it probably isn't.
After being given a run down of what will happen to them now that they've been caught, Eddie then offers to let the girls go if they'll agree to give him a free ride - which invariably leads to a torrent of abuse for the girls.
Before anyone thinks I'm just Franco bashing, I'm not, I've now seen over 60 of his movies so think I've seen enough to have a pretty good idea of what I'm talking about, I even like some!
The William Walton score (now known as the "Spitfire Prelude and Fugue") works particularly well.
William Walton's music also makes a great contribution to the film, and is now rightly (popular as the 'Spitfire Prelude and Fugue')in the concert hall.
Although now old and obsolete, no other aeroplane has as much right or privilege to fly over our green and pleasant land.
Throughout the film it is Howard himself who takes centre stage and never really leaves it, his star quality and charisma embracing all manner of scenes, from cheeky one - liners, 'you're not a bird, but you can fly', as a retort to Tonie Edgar - Bruce's mercurial Lady Houston, or modestly basking in the reflected glory of yet another Schneider Trophy triumph (the annual seaplane contest between Great Britain, USA and Italy which has now passed into folklore).
I know this because at the end of 1941 I was stationed at 61 (Spitfire) Operational Training Unit at Heston (now part of Heathrow airport) and was billeted in Meadow Way Heston.
The film was shot at Ibsley (now no longer in existence either as a base or a beacon, though you can see the remnants) which was in Hampshire, and in 1942 an active fighter station.
Michael, Earth, Mars, the Sun, and jeez a whole lot more I can't think of now.
It might be horrible if I viewed it now, some things don't hold up well through the years.
now, being skeptical of the government is one thing, and it's good to be skeptical, it shows you're a human being with a mind and that your mind is smart enough to actually do research before you believe the truth.
now i give him credit, because he actually made a decent screenplay, if only he got more of his facts right.
Also remember most if not all of these films are made by Americans not by outsiders and as a result of the attacks on the Twin Towers 100,000 Iraqis' have perished, and now in Britain the US and majority of the world the war is being called illegal but we cry for the 179 soldiers (UK) that have died out there fighting for their country but not for one minute do we realise the chaos and death we have caused.
And yet Dylan Avery was allowed to live and make his "documentaries" that could bring down the whole government-system, and he has also been allowed to make a second and now even a third version of his film (he keeps updating them, because he has to replace his exposed his old lies and disproved facts with new lies and facts).
It is now very evident, from research, investigation, and peer review, that the official story is not only wrong; but that nefarious actions by Israel and the United States Government were at the center of the September 11th 2001 events, which had been planned for months in advance.
What the real Truth is, has yet been fully exposed or agreed on; but it is now very clear that what America and the World was told about the events of September 11th 2001 are not only not True at all, but has a sinister twist to it that involves secret involvement of Israel and the United States Government in a preplanned plot to stage this event for nefarious purposes and for political manipulation of the American People, and the World.
For now, however, those of us who find grave gaps in the official investigation must continue to question the intent of a government that desperately needed a "Pearl Harbor" level excuse to once again invade the Middle East.
Whether this disturbing video contains truth or not, it should be considered amid all the other explanations by anyone who seeks a personal truth amid the mountains of data now available on the internet.
After bringing forth Nigerian money scams, phishing scams, identity theft, email viruses, spyware and stupid urban legends, now it thrusts upon us yet another abomination we have to warn all our friends and relatives about.
But by now, you might have noticed I am picking all sorts of myriad details apart regarding Decoys.
But then as now there are malevolent forces in the world and they are in this story Yul Brynner and his pirate crew.
Also they want to eliminate Douglas who's now the only witness to their crimes.
I did like this film very much both when first seeing it in the theater and now on VHS.
It is so overused that only a writer with no imagination would be tempted to use this now stock piece of "alien occupation" as anything even remotely approaching originality.)
Then I saw 'Great Expectations', another delightful performance, and right now she's one of my favorite actresses.
Because before that we just saw a perfectly normal guy with a nutty mom now we see a victim.
Well now we know that mom is letting her son take blame for killing his dad.
Not so much now.
At least it was good to see actors like Douglas, Fox and Hartmann in their prime, its sad to see what has happened to that trio now.
Fox is now a down on his luck pro-bowler desperate for the cash the family promises him.
With all his arrogance about being a good Nazi now in question the only thing that can bring back Emil to his fantasy world of serving Fuhrer and Fatherland is to get his hands on Uncle Mike's secret papers and send them back to Germany, by US airmail?, to show everyone back home what a good German, or Aryan, he really is.
Though it's now been 24 years since I saw it, I still remember thinking that I should have walked out of the theater.. No one in the audience laughed even once.
And now we meet Leo Rook, a psychotic killer who likes white shoes and to collect heads.
I'd give The Lighthouse - 7.5/10  God bless British horror...now go watch Cradle Of Fear (Ultimate cheese, awful acting and terrible dialogue = a must for any horror fan like me)
One of the hurdles slashers normally fall at is that they're now too restrained.
i had always associate Yeong-ae Lee with a sort of saccharine , sweet piety but watching it showed a different side and made me admire her deep humility, a virtue that is strange to us now a days, Yeong ae Lee infuses her character with beauty , wit, and intensity.
Based on the life of the first ever woman royal physician in the now Korea, it will definitely pull your heartstrings and move you.
In fact, my wife commented that Jang-Geum (grown up) is not as pretty as in the China version now that she can see the imperfections on her face close up....
Don't wait call the doctor now, 72 hour evaluation might seem painful but the sooner you get it over with the sooner you can get on with your life which is probably not worth getting on with at this point so you can start a new one.
Guinness Book is looking at this one right now as the worlds badest of the bad.
Well...i rented this movie only because i needed a second movie to rent at the video store and this one promised a dollar back if returned the next day...now i know why..they knew no one would want to keep this poor excuse of a movie in their house for more then a day.
A great plot, characters you fall in love with, evil bad guys etc But the film has aged well as a drama also, I reckon now way later...
I really want to read the book now.
I had first seen it as what now called a "questioning" young man in 1972 (the son's character was 14, I was 13 at the time) and remembered it being very important to me as the first sensitive, non- judgmental portrayal of gay men on television.
It was better than Mad about You then and is now.
I think I probably have made my point pretty clear by now.
I'm wondering now if this person needed glasses to read the title.
Meanwhile, Nick is falling in love with his old friend from school, now reporter Lisa.
At the beginning we can see members of Troma team company and Uwe Boll says " This is bad, it's a big s***, don't watch it, don't even think about it, stay away from this movie", now we are warn...
