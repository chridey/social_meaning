2 hours later the mother is brutally dead & of coarse the young man is convicted & sent to prison for trial   all along he keeps sayin he had an alibi by a scientist doctor who gave him a lift by his car that particular night   but that witness was no where to be found & after a while the son was hanged the flash backs are over  back to reality where miss marple & the family of 5 children , their father & his fiancÃ©e ( miss marple's friend ) are happily spending the evening doing sharades & hanging around so Merrily  when a scientist doctor spots an old newspaper & reads that a young man was hanged due to killing his mom 2 years ago he comes in a rainy night to this family's night to reveal a dark secret   appearing like a ghost out of the windows where they all gathered & telling them that their long dead brother was with him around 8,30 which is the same time of the murder of their dead mother taking place , so there is no way he was the murderer & they all discover that if their dead brother isn't the one , so it's one of them  & the mystery goes on & on & gets more thrilling & full of surprises i love reading , i would support novels brought to movies , novels are harder than a 90 minutes screen adapted novel to some people ,though novels are more deep full of details & depth that no way a movie can deliver  but on the other hand a movie is easier to understand for young people, easier to watch especially for a whole new generation of Agatha Cristie's young fans  back to the movie ... i think it's done very well , miss Geraldine's acting is always awesome i love the way she does it .. the acting , her custom's ,the way she always repeat the word '' dear'' in many lines in the script makes u feel like she 's ur own granny lol  the casting of the family was wonderful & very suitable , the 2 sisters Kirsten & Hester are wonderful actors especially the younger one kirsten , she is a very sensible actress , the brothers jacko ( the thought to be murderer of his mother is wonderful ), the other brothers were so right in their own places , the lake where a suicide takes place was original ,the house & the stormy weather helped much in the belief of the realism   i don't think the movie is crap on the contrary i think if u r free for the weekend & it's on TV try catchin it or rent it if available , u'll enjoy
