Bruce Willis is AMAZING as always, and is amazing here, he is extremely likable, had a ball watching him Ham it up as a surgeon, had some very funny dialog, had awesome chemistry with Streep and Hawn, looked very funny in those glasses, and just did an amazing job overall, a tough role that he nailed perfectly.
Meryl Streep is also AMAZING here, she is extremely hilarious, gorgeous, seemed to be having a ball, had some great costumes, was very unpredictable and i just loved her overall, she was amazing.
Goldie Hawn is also amazing here, she is very beautiful, funny, had some cool facial reactions, was quite bizarre at times, and just rocked overall!.
The acting is uneven but overall this is a top notch "B" effort.
The other cops do an okay job as well, with the male police officer being the best, but overall this won't win any awards for acting (note to director: the American girl was awful!
This film is a Western, but combines a number of strange bedfellows - the romantic comedies of Hawks (two men fight over a woman treated as a slave); melodrama (the film is brilliant at visualising the limited options open to Rachel, from the proscenium curtains looking out at a world she has no freedom in and the metronome ticking away her life, to the overall claustrophobic setting (a small farm) and limited dramatis personae), and even psychological thriller (like REBECCA, Rachel is a second wife living in the shadow of a perfect predecessor; both films share a cathartic conflagration).
overall unfortunately there are some facts that remain to be a mystery but i will allow you to watch it and decide for yourself.
overall a very gripping film that has been very cleverly made.
overall, strictly for fans of writer/producer/director Zalmand King and boring sex flicks.
I noticed that the overall IMDb rating for this film was a lowly 3.2.
There were a couple ridiculous plot points, but overall it played out very simply and satisfyingly.
And it works, overall, because of just those two things: heavy subject and Rampling.
Sincerely I was expecting more from the ending, but overall a good movie.
(Not his best movie overall, though; that honor belongs to the excellent `Kindergarten Cop'.)
This in no way detracts from the overall brilliance and charm that trees lounge conveys.
It does seem a little confusing though towards the end, but overall I give it sadly a 10 out of 10.
Excellent film overall.
A good overall game that brings very little freshness to the scene.
As an overall aesthetic choice, it does bring more immersiveness to the environment, but since 50% of the action takes place while you chop off the heads off random creatures, the metal beat of WW just felt more adequate (imo).
The level design is perhaps the tiniest step down from earlier in these, here and there, but overall it remains at the high quality of them.
The movie is overall more professional looking and so is the Belial character.
It's professionalism also makes this an overall more effective genre movie.
But no, overall you can't really call the movie anything more than just plain silly.
Renegade has good stories, but all of them fit into the overall story.
The movie overall may be a little formulaic, but it has a definite message of acceptance and overcoming obstacles.
Other reviewers have faulted "Camp" for its shallow plot, the inconsistency of its characters, the stereotypes, and an overall amateurish quality.
Harold Gould, by far and away, delivers the best overall performance in the movie (such as it is).
The lighting for Pandora's Paradox was really quite remarkable, and the overall visual style and mood it produced was fantastic!
Once you get past the overall absurdity of the film, you can actually link the images to real life and use them as a kind of metaphor.
It was too amateurish and hokey and didn't match the overall dark yet slick feel of the film.
the only good part of the film was the eye candy,and this is where so many low budget movies fall short,trying to cover up the shitty acting,bad plot and overall poor movie up by this.
Yes, the movie was bad, but the efforts involved, makes it overall, really not that bad.
You may think at first it is inappropriate, but I assure you the effect overall is very good.
The werewolf had some good lines and worked well with it's attitude overall.
The main characters are unexpectedly engaging (Sam in particular is simply awesome, thanks mainly to Brown's winningly sparky portrayal of her), the acting overall acceptable, and the story unfolds at a constant steady pace.
All in all, this is a good weekend booze/popcorn film for undemanding werewolf movie fans, with some fine moments and an overall feeling of fun.
However, it is a neat effect overall.
The voice acting is almost uniformly great (with the exception of Jen sometimes), and the story is mostly original, save the overall plot, which we've seen a zillion times before.
There are some moments where it feels like some other games, an occasional dopey boss battle, and too many elevators, but wow, the overall pace, artwork, character control, and AWESOME MUSIC makes it the most movie like video game I've EVER played.
The acting is good, I liked the attractively stunning Amy Irving, the story was interesting as hell and kept me wondering what was going to happen, the script was above average (incredible even), some scenes (the one where Mrs Irving's character escapes from the psychic school) were absolutely amazing and overall it was a very entertaining movie.
I would say that 2-4% of the script is cheesy, but overall very good and not very dated at all.
And, while in parts it is awfully silly, the overall effort was far better than I expected and was one of the better Chan movies I have seen.
Of course, the British "humour" only adds to the overall flavor of this particular flick.
Still, students and lovers of independent film will admire this one for its style, its daring, and its overall effort.
The character designs are fun, and even if they're sometimes clichÃ© or annoying, they're bearable overall.
While the scenes with Spader's relatives were a bit stereotyped, overall there are a few good messages here.
The few plot holes and the occasional trite dialogue don't detract from the overall work.
I'd give the story overall an 8, but just the sheer talent of the leads caused me to boost my vote to a 9.
A thriller that offers great performances from a "lesser known" cast, chases, twists and turns, and an overall satisfying story.
It was excellent, overall.
The lighting throughout the movie was uneven and could have benefited from an overall continuity of theme, but all in all, this problem is minor in contrast to the action and dialogue on the screen.
But overall, if you like a good, dark tragedy, pick a dreary night and go.  
Santosh Sivan's overall direction is good, although his work in the Terrorist is easily superior than Asoka in the direction department.
I would say that it does in most cases, mainly thanks to its overall look and a strong second half film for its saviour.
The influence of MTV is apparent in the editing style that takes over during the song sequences; this may interrupt the film's rhythm and impact, but they are part of the overall story.
He has great chemistry with Kareena Kapoor and overall, the movie is well-acted.
Thus, London to Brighton, with its scuzzy and raw feel, comes across as scarier; more frightening in its depiction of a world, the characters within and overall attention to genre.
But overall London to Brighton is an impressive first feature by 'Paul Andrew Williams' and most of the cast.
overall, it was below medium, and really what a sham, it could've been something really good.
The medieval feel of all the extras was good, and some nice stunts there with the (many) explosions, but overall: a thin story, poor acting of the main characters, and horrendously B-movie special effects make this movie one that only barely scrapes a score of 3 out of me.
So, overall a decent B-grade Fantasy.
A decent film overall
In overall context of movies maybe 6.5/10.
The picture's only major drawback is its too-brief conclusion, perhaps necessitated by its short overall running time of under an hour, but this does not explain why the film should be so unjustly obscure today.
To a certain extent, the film assumes either a familiarity with Catholic belief, or an overall sympathy with the contemplative way of life.
Watch this movie as all truth unfoldsÂand overall, to find out if this determined Lady wins back the trust and vote of her people.
I'm not really sure what the overall message of this movie is.
The overall theme is that slick yuppies are trying to take over the beach, which is the domain of scruffy surfers.
I overall give Death on the Nile 8/10 stars.
THE LONGEST NITE is very welcome addition to the gritty triad films genre of the Hong Kong cinema and due to its great and believable performances and characters, gorgeous visuals and overall honesty, it will last many viewing times without losing its power and impact.
:) )  So, overall, a very good film, but not quite up there with the likes of His Girl Friday or The Philadelphia Story.
Movie has some slow parts in it, but overall it is really funny and not to be missed.
Beethovens 2nd is a pretty good sequel, not as good as the first as far structure wise, but it comes pretty close for me.Its fun, entertaining, and somewhat funny.Also it actually follows up the first one in a good way.It was very new and fresh in a way, and some what believable, that really the first one and second one capture in a right way.It was good to see the return of the original cast members, and to add in some new characters like Regina( who was a cool villain).It was really funny at times, especially at some points from Bonnie Hunt( who's character I love).I didn't care much for the ending, and some points it was a little too out there and unbelievable, and the dogs annoyed me at some points, as did some characters.Well, overall if you liked the first one you'll like this, and in fact this is probably the last good one sequel in the series.
overall a decent movie but if you expect it to be groundbreaking throughout you will be a little disappointed.
For anyone that is easily made motion sick, the camera work is very shaky during the chase scene and had it lasted much longer would have detracted from the overall experience for me personally.
There are some actors in this movie that may not be well known, but overall I think everyone in it did an adequate job.
The overall premise - a group of humans, kidnapped to start a breeding program on another planet - seems fairly standard.
After having re-visited Harryhausen's Sinbad trilogy recently, I have decided that this one, overall, compares very favourably with the other two.
I feel that this one is best for a sense of epic adventure and empathetic characters, THE SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINBAD is best for the monsters and THE GOLDEN VOYAGE OF SINBAD is quite possibly the best of the trilogy overall.
Roy Budd's splendidly stirring'n'sweeping majestic orchestral score and Ted Moore's exquisitely rich, vivid and vibrant saturated color cinematography further add to the overall enjoyment of this engaging and satisfying fantasy adventure treat.
Species 4 has a cast of B actors who do a great job at carrying the story and the level of CHEESE in the plot and characters was kept to a bare minimum making for overall a well put together made for TV sci-fi horror film.
This movie was the first karate/kung-fu movie that i had seen and still today i watch it definately a classic, the Silver Fox is one cool dude anyway good action tons of fights good plot and the usual dubbing but overall 10/10.
It takes from a lot of different ideas but the overall feel of the movie is non-stop fun to the end.
So while the film was overall one of the funniest I've seen in recent memory, there were a couple of great moments of highly stylized action.
Most of them appeared in some of Stephen Chow's movies before but because the context of every movie is different, the overall result is hilarious.
Direction is fine, and the writer/director obviously knows where to pull his punches without overdoing it (so he doesn't labour his points and thus overall message of the film).
A few too many sequences of beautiful cinematography with music goes a little longer than necessary, but this is nitpicking and overall an excellent and original film.
Take the kids to see this one, a thought provoking story with minimal violence and an excellent, overall non-sentimental respect for the natural world as well as the humans and animals that inhabit it.
I think on the overall, this movie is worth watching!
I finally got to see this film last night - the previews looked great and overall I wasn't disappointed.
Frankly, I thought the "slow" parts were the best and overall, thought the film had just the right amount of action, instead of overdoing it as the recent Mummy pictures did.
The way I took the last lines -- my $.02 -- was merely how I took much of what Andre was saying: not the precise import or meaning of what he said (boy, does he talk fast) but rather the overall tone of dread and the fear of death he evinced.
Fortunately, Shannon Whirry (Joanna) satisfied the most important criterion for the lead actress in this kind of film; i.e., she had good overall proportions and looked good in revealing attire.
There are a few holes in the plot (the ending and a little throughout) but the overall coolness of the movie made up for it.
A Lot of people think this is the worst of the series, i would have to say no, in fact it's one of the best of the series, it's at times creepy, hilarious and overall just a lot of fun, the pool party is especially fun times!.
good zoom in's, created a creepy atmosphere, great use of color, and overall he did a great job!.
Rober Rustler is Excellent here!, he was my favorite character here, he is hilarious very likable, and overall just seemed like a fun guy!.
This is a very different film from the usual bollywood love and action crap, it might take some influences from the Shawshank Redemption and other American prison films but overall it is a very original and fresh film.
The cast overall is enjoyable to watch, but not perfect.
Anyway, despite the foregoing, the movie has a good message and the overall acting is way better than good!
There were some scenes that I could have done without, particularly in the last 30 minutes of the movie, but overall I could watch this movie on a Sunday afternoon, before Goonies and after The Toy.
in certain parts, but overall, I'd recommend this to anyone who likes psychological horror.
As for the overall movie, I give this movie an 8 out of 10 stars.
What I really hate about these movies is the fairy tale tone that is applied to the overall presentation.
Even though there are a few stupid parts, overall I really like this movie.
generic pap overall, but still it was watchable...if your a Dolph fan, check it, if not avoid.
In fact the acting is overall excellent throughout.
The 'monsters' aren't great but then they aren't really that important to the overall plot.
I do agree that Last Winter was somewhat flawed here and there but overall I was blown away.
But overall.
My advice is to try the original first--as overall it's a little bit better.
The film culminates in a satisfactory conclusion and is overall worth seeing for its premise, characters, dialogue and action toward the end.
overall, if your looking to tell/show a group of preteen/teens the story of the holocaust without the brutality then this is the ONLY movie to show them.
There were times that she was found lacking but overall it was OK.
Even the sketches of characters and their respective performances by the actors are hemmed in time with the overall off-the-wall configuration.
But overall a very nice effort that hold up with the best of the cable movie genre.
Like 24, each season has an overall story, but unlike 24, Stand Alone Complex has episodes that have nothing to do with the main story arc and are for the sole purpose of revealing characters and establishing a world (the latter is something that 24 doesn't need to do).
Doomwatch - the gritty and often rather lacklustre series covering moral, social and environmental issues was the only programme that came close to Timeslip at this time, but Timeslip was overall much more successful.
The Wrong End of Time is a fantastic instalment in which one of our central protagonists encounters her father in a 1940's naval station - coincidentally where the time barrier stands in 1970's England - and with the first appearance of Commander Traynor - a character so crucial to the overall story.
I would say EKLAVYA is by far the best of the very,very rare number of good films that Bollywood has made throughout their existence.Why,because it's more focused and well made than any of their minute number of good films.It's got rich atmosphere,intriguing setup,brilliant visuals,impressive sets,costumes and a different vision.But,overall,it is still a flawed epic.
Tony Todd was the perfect Candyman, his dead-serious facial expressions and low, menacing voice adds to the overall creepy effect of his character.
Heston gives an overall fine performance.
Also of note is that none of the fight sequences evoke excitement and overall we are left to watch a movie that is hideously dull in it's uninspired tone.
There are a few moments were the suspense builds a little too long, but overall the payoff is great.
They always deliver Stories (granted, not necessarily written by them) that are simply original, animations that are top-notch and an overall styling of their movies that blows my mind every single time.
The only smudge on this glorious movie is the overall story.
There were some technical problems, but overall the film moved nicely.
The story is contrived but overall a good flick to watch on a rainy day.
Still, overall, this is an enjoyable period piece and a must for lovers of the great detective created by Rex Stout.
Whatever else might be said about the overall entertainment value of this production, Rex Stout would not be disappointed by the production decisions or the casting of this nicely drawn adaptation.
Locations are stunning and the actors put in good performances overall, I can't think of a dud performance in Sharpe's Challenge.
The only thing that I can possibly think that would detract from all the praise I have for this film would be the over showing of Lucy Brown's bosom which, although perfectly lovely and appreciated, was overall probably a tad unnecessary.
(There are a handful of minor goofs in the movie in terms of accuracy, but they do not detract from the overall film.
True, some of the dialogue in this movie borders on juvenile, but overall I rate the movie very high.
Lord, as was often the case, comes across a little stiff, but overall this is a solid TV-movie/pilot, with excellent production values and a good supporting cast including Nancy Kwan, Leslie Nielsen and the ubiquitous Andrew Duggan.
The movie has a nice grabber of an opening beneath an Iraq munitions building, and the overall photography is quite stunning.
Some of the scenes tend to be a bit overdrawn, and samey, but this doesn't detract from the overall intensity which is helped in no small part by the acting.
The acting overall, is kinda average, especially by Kyle MacLachlan, but with an always impressive Dwight Yoakam, and a usually solid Martin Sheen, the movie also ends up succeeding here as well.
Some of it looks neat, and it was probably an influence on Alex Winter's brilliant "Freaked", but overall it's too slow, dull, cheap, poorly acted, and unimaginative to be of any interest.
At times the film seems excessively languid, but overall it does justice to its interview subjects, who emerge as fully-depicted individuals, sometimes passionate, sometimes restrained, but never without the dignity that should belong to all mankind as birthright.
Only the beautiful jungle scenery and the inspired use of Kraftwork's insanely funky "We Are the Robots" as the opening credits theme song offer some relief from the overall stupefying tedium.
The film and the casting is overall successful, and it's so very Serbian.
Although there is alot of sadness in the film, the overall feeling after was uplifting.
that is the overall theme of the unsung hero in this movie.
if you want to see plenty of hot chicks showering Goofy violence and the overall awesomeness of Orville check this movie out i first saw it on USA network years ago and have been wanting more Orville ever since Check it out!!
It always amazes me that people rent this stuff, apparently expecting Bergman or something, and THEN decide they have to write negative reviews denouncing the overall silliness, bad acting, cheap production values and amount of nudity and/or violence.
But the story was engrossing and the overall feeling of the movie was warm.
But overall it really touched me in that sweet/sadistic way.
Jean Gabin would go on to appear as Inspector Maigret in 2 subsequent films - MAIGRET ET L' AFFAIRE SAINT-FIACRE (1959; which I've caught up with a couple of years ago) and MAIGRET VOIS ROUGE (1963) - and work a further 5 times with director Delannoy (including the afore-mentioned second Maigret film); interestingly enough, Delannoy himself would abandon his own artistic aspirations shown earlier in two major French films of the 1940s - L'ETERNEL RETOUR (1943) and LA SYMPHONIE PASTORALE (1946) - to concentrate on modest genre offerings (of which MAIGRET SETS A TRAP is the best-known and probably best overall as well) for the rest of his career.
The storyline in overall is standard and should be acceptable.
This movie is in overall very painful to watch.
While overall this is Stingo's coming of age story, at its central core we get drawn into Sophie's saga.
Simple, yet effective, a very mature piece of work and pleasing overall.
Sondheim's lyrics are wonderful, Diana Rigg is delightful and overall the quality of the show is more than acceptable.
And with it's bizarre colors, intentional (I assume)filming on a barely disguised soundstage, and incredibly plastic costumes and sets, along with the aforementioned overacting, the overall tone is one of just unbelievable creepiness.
There were many things I did like about this movie- the animation was spectacular, and the movie was, overall, pretty sweet.
I found it entertaining, not wandering off the original's storyline too much, and overall really good.
The animation is absolutely gorgeous, brilliant, and overall the best in 2D production you've seen in a good 10 years.
The animation is every bit as good as a lot of the recent theatrical films , with beautifully rendered background art and an overall "Technicolor" look that was for the most part quite dazzling .........and how about them voices?
Ah well, it does not detract from what is overall a good film.
The only reference to a black cat in the movie is Werdegast's phobia of them, and really, this could have been left out without affecting much of the plot or overall effect of the film.
But the movie is still pretty impressive with great performances overall (especially by Allison Elliot - that woman has got more talent in her little finger than a lot of big stars do, and Richard Harris' son is great,too), an effective score which includes some cool songs (too bad there is not CD out - how canI get hold of "Rockets" or the song played during the end credits?)
However, no graphic showings of severed limbs or penises flying through rooms, which would have cheapened the overall effect.
I think even though the budget was low and the overall quality of the film was rather primitive by today's standards, the "feel" of the movie is what made such an impact on me and everyone else who has watched it!
Then there is the overall context in which the Germans are losing the war, but nothing much is made of this except to the extent that it generates a movement among (some of) the officers to eliminate Hitler, a movement about which Major Grau (Omar Sharif), investigating the slaughter of a prostitute, observes cynically that it took quite a while for the movement to develop since the army seemed satisfied enough as long as they were winning.
Unfortunately, these things take away a lot from the overall feeling of otherwise great movie.
I agree that some special effects were overdone and unnecessary, taking away from the overall appeal of the film, but I really hope an English version could come out so I can see it with the rest of my family.
But the plot although interesting and immersive does seem quite weak and overall degrades the rating for this movie.
I was impressed by the trailer and when I finally saw "Dinosaur" first time, I liked some parts, but overall I found the movie a little mediocre.
But overall, this movie is very great, I really recommend that you see this, you will really like it!
The desert setting is apt as it conveys the isolation of the situation well and overall this is a perfectly pitched film that makes every aspect work.
The premise is very original and the script, the direction and the overall acting is actually very good.
Still, due to its few merits and overall Eastern status (meaning there are NOT any stupid lightening "entertainment" elements usually found in, for example, modern Hollywood horror films) make this to 4/10 category.
I am not outraged by the insertion of Miss Marple so long as the overall result is still satisfactory and this time it is.
But overall, I did enjoy the movie for Geraldine McEwan as Miss Marple, and the more fun and light-hearted first half.
Worst TV host ever, worst interviews, worst guests, worst sketches, worst on screen talent, worst acting, worst writing, worst directing, worst overall production.
It's not a classic, but it's still memorable, and has some actually quite good songs that are not in the least bit intrusive and only add to the overall charm.
Only a smidgen of nudity and the delightful presence of the always dependable Mary Woronov as a snarky, sardonic secretary provide a little relief from the overall crumminess of this lousy loser.
The most hardcore bad film buff will be surprised by the overall ineptness of this grade-z "film".
"Delightfully goofy" couldn't be more apt for this film overall.
His occasional missteps result in some unevenness of pace and tone (which some judicious editing would have remedied), but with the overall wallop the film packs, these are minor lapses.
But overall, I would not go out of my way to recommend to someone to see this, unless they were looking for something silly and cheesy to watch.
The acting was rather wooden which contributes to the overall poor production.
That is THE most irrational cop (or character overall) I've ever seen in a film, and this time it's a bad thing.
The overall editing wasn't too bad, with some exceptions where a cut left me totally clueless what's going on.
The jail house rape of Yvette is very graphic and I doubt if any other movie will show such a powerful scene unless you see "Two Women" again where the Italian Star is similarly abused.Perhaps the scenes showing Jones in a gun battle with the local police was not too realistic as it might have been but overall I believe the story rang fairly true to life and regret that it had to be placed in the area that presented the law as having such men who would take advantage of a good looking blond woman in distress.
Moreover, the overall story is not strong.
The overall effect of the film is merely jaw dropping, for a lack of a better term.
Where Advani improves over KJ is that the overall emotional quotient is toned down and KHNH is a lot more colourful than KKHH and K3G .
Kal Ho Naa Ho might be resented by some for its rather high-pitched EQ but overall it's great to watch once .
Simply, Harsh Realm is overall a thoughtless show with a potentially good premise.
The Sopranos is the most powerful and addicting series I have seen overall, and its highs are so mindblowing that I would have to call it my favourite show in spite of arguable lows (most of which I disagree with).
Moreover, it contributes to the overall hypocrisy of a movie meant to galvanize social reflection and reaction through the didactic speeches of its belligerent protagonist Nick (Clive Owen), while exhibiting remarkable indifference to the objectification of the nameless victims that suffer and die in the film so that our love is not for them, but for the named heroes who suffer and die out of pity.
I am appalled to see that the overall IMDb rating for this movie is only 5.2 (edit: now down to 4.9!
Even to this day, six years after seeing it for the first time, I can't get over the freshness, originality, and overall boldness of Alex Proyas' visionary masterpiece.
The movie seems to run a little long in places and there are a couple of pointless plot points (the whole Dean Stockwell character), overall though and mainly it is a cool action movie in the same vein as Die Hard or other movies where you have the one free guy making trouble for the bad guys.
We are treated to many dinosaurs that, although not the most realistic looking, are quite effective and are integrated well into the movie and the overall storyline.
The deep voice of Freemen and musical score adds to the overall strength of the movie.
Ugh, really I think I am being quite generous overall on this particular amateurish indie horror effort.
I got a little bored and uninterested with it at times, but The Love Bug managed to pull me back in sometime or another, and I thought overall this was a nice movie, that I'm surprised hasn't been watched by more people than it has, because it seemed like classic material, but I guess not.
So the reason for not releasing this movie to the theaters must be the "overall crappiness" of the movie, rather than the nude scene with co-star Craig Sheffer.
It was not without flaw, but overall, it was wonderful.
But overall it is very funny, and seems to have held up well over the years.
But, really, that's such a little thing compared to the overall high enjoyability of this series.
There were good episodes in Season 4 and 5, plus some good moments even in the bad episodes, but overall the show just wasn't the same.
The overall feel.
The overall idea is not very original, which is okay.
I thought the acting was overall pretty good especially in some of the supporting roles like Lucy's parents.
series and if it wasn't so restricted on content, overall if you like the Sopranos then you are more than likely love kingpin and even if you don't like the Sopranos you should give it a try for the massive amount of raw energy put in this TV Show.
overall its a good film, i suggest anyone who reads this should see it.
Basically the movie centers around the two leads trying to make it back to Tokyo and their adventures along the way with a cast of unique and at times plain creepy characters showing up along the way, there are some flaws here and there but overall this is a great emotional, bleak, depressing yet in the end hopeful movie that I fully enjoyed and I personally thought the two lead actors did a superb job and at times the visuals and landscape were depressing yet stunning.
This movie is not formulaic overall, when you consider that it's almost impossible to make a scary movie of any kind that hasn't been done before.
I think it's probably my favorite short of his, though, considering that it so well mixes everything in animation, stop motion, and real motion, and that overall it's quite adept at forcing you to think about all those children's shows that involve alphabet songs and alphabet animations dancing around, and how a lot of that stuff can be very disconcerting and bizarre if really looked at.
So, the overall product is a mixed bag.
For the ending I must say that overall it was a movie highly above the average.
I have always liked him and find this performance relatively solid; he is acted off the screen by Bogart in their scenes together and his one shot at emoting over his plight as an ex-con is comical but in the overall he is very likable.
There are a few moments that do work, but overall, I'm disappointed.
I'm sorry the overall rating this movie received was so mediocre.
To a degree, the cameo by another Warner Brothers character and the ending of the short, along with a wonderful beginning, salvages this short and raises its overall score.
Although Arcand goes too far sometimes, the film is overall and excellent satire of modern life.
But it's overall significance?
Death Wish is indeed a pioneer in the genre for which it spawned, and overall it holds up well today as it did in the 70's.
But there is also a sense of overall tragedy to it all.
I really think they gave it to her because of the overall movie, not her individual performance.
While Donnie Yen's best martial art performance is in IN THE LINE OF DUTY IV, his best film overall is BALLISTIC KISS.
It was funny, witty and overall entertaining.
But he never lets the pace flounder, and neither does he let the Connery-Down love interest suffocate or distract from the overall plot.
), glaring blatant continuity errors, and a hilarious technical gaffe involving a conspicuously visible boom microphone dipping into the frame, crisp, sprightly cinematography by Ed Hershberger, an endearingly cruddy extraterrestrial beast, a rollicking bang-up score by Christopher Thomas, and some gut-busting joke-ridden ending credits, "There's Nothing Out There" overall sizes up as a brisk, frequently riotous, and highly pleasing low-budget (it only cost $350,000 in total) tongue-in-cheek horror film genre lampoon.
It does walk a tightrope between credible and confusion briefly but this just kept me focused on the story and the characters which perhaps did need more development however it works well enough to keep the overall feel of the film moving in a consistent direction.
Thora Birch really played the part very well, and the movie overall had great character development.
There are times when the clichÃ©s and caricatures can become a bit too heavy, but overall it works.
The overall production is excellent (the brightness and colors in the photography, costumes and sets is stunning)... plus it pulls off the impossible by successfully steering toward dead-on seriousness near the conclusion to drive it's point across.
So please give all of us a break with this age nonsense.The overall production was well mounted and since the original stories have been done so well by Jeremy Brett, a new pastiche always fun because it is new.
The casting overall was terrible.
While a film like Schindler's List allows us a broader view of the overall situation, it failed to truly give any insight into the individuals who allowed the machines of war to keep operating.
The ending leaves one wondering exactly what was going on, since some things that preceded seemed to never have happened, but overall this is a excellent watch, very well done.
CINEMATOGRAPHY Pretty good overall.
While they did some things right (they did manage to make Matt Salinger look scrawny before the experiment), overall it was another attempt to take a character with a long history in the comics and put the filmmakers' own spin on it to poor effect.
I have Woodstock on DVD and the music's better, many performances are better (or worse in a more entertaining way than Live Aid) and the overall feel of the occasion is more alive.
The above mentioned factors prevent it from being utterly boring, but my overall reaction is one of disappointment.
Special credit must be given to Charlie Schmid's score too; it's very atypical and adds a great deal to the overall atmosphere of the movie.
The cinematography and script as well as the overall attention to detail in the dialogue led me to suspect that Welles might have been responsible for more than just his own role.
The ending is a ripoff of another, more popular film (I wont say which), but overall, I'd give Toolbox Murders 7/10.
Also, there's at least one red herring that's a little too obvious, and the clichÃ©d ending detracts from the overall effectiveness.
Also, some of the camera angles were interesting at first, but as the plot and the overall content of the film left much to be desired, the angles began to really get on my nerves after a while.
Even though there are these "errors" one must realize that this a work of fiction and these sort of incongruencies do not detract from the overall power of the film.
There is a character named Enrique that you first think what has he got to do with anything but before long you realize he is so important to the overall feel of the film and reminds us that we are all tied to each other in some way.
My overall reaction to this lame flick is one of disgust---disgust with the dolts who wrote, produced and directed this waste of cinematographic effort, and also with the fact that this movie is so incredibly insulting to those who are disabled.
Well, some are, but the overall drama of the movie makes you laugh.
Most people I know enjoy it, but think it fails overall.
They took everything they learned when working on The Simpsons and applied it, though overall I do prefer that to this.
The special effects work (especially at the beginning) is good, the cast tries and there are some interesting things that happen, but overall it's a grim and unenjoyable film.
There is some over top emoting from the lead actors that is slightly lame, but overall a good relic from the cold war.
Laughton held the overall reins of this project as his pet producer was in place over Hitchcock, and you can see how he was granted free roam whether Hitch cared or no.
Strangely lacking in some of the more distinctive camera techniques one would expect from Hitchcock, Jamaica Inn overall is still an enjoyable watch Â just slow.
I'm not sure if I can explain the low rating of this film overall on IMDb, because I thought it was a remarkable action/suspense film, full of excellent actors and unforgettable moments.
I think the character's body language and comments within this doco bring so much richness to the overall piece.
The overall tone of the film was perfect.
It makes the sequence feel rather limited in terms of its mood, acting and overall storytelling.
Several scenes come in mind where character movements are awkward and unrealistic to the films's supposed genre and overall feel.
The biggest drawback of One Frightened Night for me was that the overall story never completely eluded the feel of a poorly made B movie.
Okay granted they're pretty straight reruns of the first movie with different casts, but they look and feel great, and the overall standard of material is pretty high.
While I didn't really care about seeing the Mickey Mouse Club stuff or some of the other extras, the overall package is very nice.
Voice acting is very well done, Mion/Shion Sonozaki are personal favorite characters, but everyone else does good job of making the overall warm/dark feel of the atmosphere!
The overall cinematography of the film was outstanding.
Each character paints a bold picture of the times that they are living and they are also important in the overall progression of the story.
But overall, AG is a dazzling and memorable nostalgic drama superbly written and directed, falling just short of a masterpiece.
They're not exactly the same genre of movie, but they both have a very similar feel to them, in both dialogue and overall tone & pacing.
Amazing twists and turns with an overall awesome romantic storyline of what love and everything about love really is about.
So before you praise the overall romance of the film, consider what implications are being accepted.
Alyssa Milano is a great addition here too, overall very solid goofy movie that had some original lines and laughs and great physical comedy.
The blood effects are amazing and the storyline was fresh and overall the movie was amazing!
The acting in the film is very good there are some very intense performances and some graphic scenes.It's shot very 70's slasherseque which overall gives it a creepy aura.The storyline is very easy to follow yet very disturbing and depressing at the same time.Overall fans of The Devil's Rejects and The Hills Have Eyes see Texas Chainsaw Massacre:The Beginning it's well worth the admission fee.
overall, i highly recommended this movie, but not for average ghost/slasher horror fans.
But the movie, though flawed and a rehash of some other familiar Fellini themes treated more successfully elsewhere, is also delightful in parts, with a power in the use of visual symbols that I have rarely seen before, even in his own, more overall successful movies.
Yes, there are scenes that drag on and on, and generally some of these seem superfluous and dubious to the overall arc of the production, but for the most part, the script and direction remains coherent in its willingness to merely document rather than emote.
I thought the dialogue was clichÃ© and poorly written, the backgrounds kindergarten crayon-style looking and the overall game play to be very boring.
I guess this movie got killed off because of the budget, and overall it must have been braindead people being responsible for this.
Slightly marred by a rather sappy conclusion, "Kansas City Confidential" overall still rates highly as the authentic gnarly noir article.
It still wound up good overall, but it never lived up to that great beginning.
Having just watched this early '90s suspense thriller about computer hackers (I think) for the first time, I was partially confused about some scenes though overall, I was a little entertained by some of the comedy elements that were sprinkled throughout.
However overall I feel Season 2 was a good Season, and it is deeply sad that a third season never got past the drawing board stages.
The story is cute and the overall plot is not bad either.
One of my favorite anime and overall examples of noir style in graphic arts of the 80s if you can ignore that very dated helicopter scene that makes everyone so angry...
Great ending, great film overall.
Thought all of the characters were good and added to the overall mood of the film.
I liked the film, I enjoyed the plot and the action, and thought that overall, the movie was solid.
It gets a little cheesy at times though, like when he gets into the bad guys' office by pretending to be a delivery boy delivering highly unstable plutonium capsules in - get this - a brown paper bag, but overall it stays in the same vein as the original and may even be better in a lot of ways.
Tony Scott does a very good job here, keeping the film at an exciting pace, injecting lots of great humor, good camera angles, and doing a great job overall!.
Despite its overall low ratings, I cannot help but like "Pony Express".
The story overall is a road ride in the eyes of two likable idiots who are oblivious to everything and yet, they still manage to get out of trouble without even trying.
The late sixties, early seventies style, lighting and some scenes are descent along the way, but the overall film just doesn't involve the viewer.
it is a good watch nevertheless, and will not disappoint you if you can "pass" the explosion scene without loosing any interest... so the plot gets 10 stars( while i will ignore the similarities, they are different in context itself and do make perfect sense overall ), the acting gets 10 as well( i can not think of anyone that was playing "badly"), the soundtrack gets an 8 ( great musical choices but not consistent, again a sign of low budget),the camera work gets a 10( great achievement for a low budget), the script gets a 5( 1 for originality in essence and 10 for consistency), and finally the cgi effects get a more then deserved 1 star.
This trial and error process nestles in with the overall study, while Alyosha's naivety will see him, in a gleeful and euphoric mood at the time following the granting of the six day leave, happily take on the extra burden of delivering a gift from one soldier to their partner along the way; something that we will eventually come to realise merely delays the lead as well as put his life at needless risk.
The overall premise is okay, but the execution falls completely flat.
So overall, I would recommend this film - it symbolises all the good that made the late 70s memorable.
I wouldn't say that Pretty Baby, directed by Louis Malle, has the overall audacity of the main art-house European-directed sexual trip of the 70s, Last Tango in Paris, but it comes close, very close.
There's a heap load of nudity overall, including a hot bit with Sarandon and Carradine, but really Malle is after the whole insulated world of this whorehouse, and how being true to oneself ends up clashing with the un-yielding mind-set of those coming in with a wad of bills and a set goal.
Yes, I am aware of the fact the rather vulgar and tasteless subject line entirely misfits the overall tone of this film, but when else am I going to have the chance to use this clichÃ©d saying in a review?
And Josephine Hutchinson is very poignant in a small scene that doesn't seem to me to make sense in the overall plot but has an exciting payoff: Her scream through a window saves our hero from being run over.
But no bad language, no visible sex scenes (although we do know it occurred), and overall a delightful film.
But overall I thought this movie was very powerful and am still wondering why the critics have been so unkind to it.
The actors were good to very good, the overall production was good as well.
I thought that overall the movie was pretty good.
I thought that overall the movie was pretty good.
(At least not in overall effect: Tex's single most outrageous gag of this sort is in the long legally undistributed "Uncle Tom's Cabana," 1947, and involves a cash register hidden under the aroused male's coat.
(The Keira Knightley version has its own charms here and there, but overall was a big disappointment to purists and was not historically accurate at all, though Donald Sutherland did add a surprising sweetness to Mr. Bennet - a nice if not faithful interpretation.)
First of all, let's examine the overall look of the thing.
The overall look of the film resembles a soap opera, resulting in a very dreary boring film.
There are a couple of laughs, in the end mostly, but overall it is not that funny.
As has been the case with some other episodes in the series Â which, I have to admit, has taken me by surprise overall Â this presents a far more chilling, and subversive, concept (bestiality) than is usually associated with Hammer Films!
At least in the American six hour version there are several discontinuities and unexplained points that detract from the overall effect.
There are of course some coincidences of family members' and friends' paths crossing at key junctures, but the story overall grips us.
The movie starts a bit slowly, then it gets a bit of a more interesting pace, but overall it's not a movie that will have you see it again any time soon.
But the overall focus of this film is Billy Crudup, who never strikes a false note in a role which appears exhausting even to describe.
While overall his film is the most wholly satisfying and entertaining, it's not without a heap of 'hip' shots, like the one that pulls back (via computers of course, though very cleverly) across the set of a movie being shot, or in some of those angles that one saw as being one-of-a-kind in Park's Oldboy.
8/10 overall - definitely recommended
Most importantly, that is not the focus of the filmmakers here, and the fact that Moore is a woman is little more in the overall scheme of things than a footnote in cinematic history; Moore is just another character in the `Dirty Harry' saga, and she's a good one (especially when compared to Harry's partner, Al Quan-- played by Evan C. Kim-- in `The Dead Pool').
I actually found it pretty boring overall.
As weird as the storyline is, it does make sense in the overall context of the film.
As far as this film, the stories were interesting, the direction was detached, and overall, it's not great.
I might add that this was the first filmatisation that I watched and thus my opinion might be a little biased but I think that this film is still on the top shelf in terms of overall quality, a true classic.
"Sweet Hideaway" may not succeed overall in its approach.
It doesn't get much better either apart from a couple of decent car chase scenes & one or two nice kills, overall there is very little to recommend here I'm afraid.
Though, it might have some biting topics covered, but there's still a sub-plot involving Knox's niece that seems more or less irrelevant to the overall proceedings.
But overall the film's momentum never slows up and I was kept in awe by the simply amazing performances of the cast and the exceptional direction in constructing the period.
It's a top-notch road comedy with Field and Jones overcoming the obvious sentimentality of the overall conception and making a memorable duo.
The dialogue is hilarious, the murders are wickedly funny, and the overall atmosphere of the film is disturbingly bright and shiny.
However, the overall story makes sense in a "gestalty" kind of way and I don't think it's a killer issue.
However, the overall production is superior, and the storyline refreshingly unique; as "Don Q", and his story, are quite different than the original "Zorro".
overall a good film to watch for the anthology fan.
i'd say overall it really fits the times, as it was filmed in the late 70's.
Told mostly in flashbacks, we meet an assortment of characters, each of whom is a piece in the overall puzzle.
Of course we don't need to compare this movie to those masterpieces mentioned above; I've only established the unjust comparison as a guide intended to help western-buffs to have a quick and overall idea of this movie)   Regarding the actors, the over-acting, operatic style chosen it doesn't seem to work always with all the actors.
Each character is perfectly cast and the comic-book approach taken by the actors in the realisation of their roles complements the overall style of the film.
A few liberties have been taken, mostly by merging several men into one (eg, Richard Harding Davis is merged with Edward Marshall) or slightly misordering or misascribing actions to keep the characters down to a manageable and recognisable few (Marshall was shot at Las Guasimas, Tiffany actually died of fever), and the regiment's return to Montauk is left out, but overall tone of the movie is of scrupulous accuracy.
Granted, the CGI creatures are really tacky and unconvincing, but that criticism aside this flick overall sizes up as one hell of an enjoyable romp.
  Good classic film that shows how the North dealt with the Confederates and American Indians at the same time during the U.S. Civil war.Good overall production and the ciematography was very good.To nitpick,the movie started slow and Parker's dresses were too unrealistic for the circumstances.Also the romance chemistry between Parker and Holden was lacking.The script could also have been a tag better.Still,the second half of the film delivered the action goods which will delight true Western genre fans.Only for fans of the genre who are not partial to the Confederate side and fans of the lead stars......
I do think the ending could have been much better, but still, it doesn't hurt the overall quality of the movie.
I spent a lot of time criticizing this one fatal flaw, but overall I am still giving the movie a 7, because the rest of it (with the exception of the tepid romantic subplot) was so good and so effective.
Unjustly reviled by most critics during its theatrical release, "The Hunter" overall sizes up as an extremely solid and satisfying little ripper that's well worth checking out by both Steve McQueen fans and action movie buffs alike.
The girls seem more believable overall.
My overall rating is 1/10
I'm just saying the overall music is better than that of the first one.
The love-story sub-plot is perhaps the least successful component (Halle Berry is not entirely convincing)--and the film very nearly shoots itself in the foot near the end--but, overall, this is a very satisfying and stirring movie-going experience (even on video).
this movie combines EXTREAMLLY well many aspects of American politics that anyone can relate to regardless if you are in the office or not, poor or rich( even if there are some charming attacks at the rich class), disfranchised voter or not.if you are not pleased with today's politics overall then this is for you!
The performances in "Bulworth" entirely demonstrate that Warren Beatty is not only able to direct, write and produce well, but also that capable to lead an all star cast, including Don Cheadle, Oliver Platt, Isaiah Washington, and Christine Baranski, into an Oscar worthy overall appearance level.
I gave it a 7 out of 10 for its overall against similar films.
Within the context of B-dramedies, this is undoubtedly a great movie, but within the overall context of movies as a whole, it falls just short.
It was entertaining now and then but overall, it was too slow and not enough plot to make it worth going to the theaters to see it.
That is the focus, goal, and overall tone that a film like this should have followed.
This movie gets high marks for five things and low marks for three, so overall it's a keeper.
She knows it's good and isn't shy about showing it, and (5) overall a good mixture of crime, comedy, romance and suspense and just right amount of time at just under 100 minutes.
How could the costuming, set design, and overall artistic direction of the film go so overlooked?!
!While a few effective sequences do exist(notably the beginning of the movie)the overall effect is lame.The film resembles me a TV movie and lacks any scares,gore and violence.The acting is alright,I suppose,but these CGI-effects are terrible and the plot is boring.So if you're looking for a good horror movie,then try to avoid this one at all costs.
The actors/actresses overall do a fine job with the script, although you will catch some flaws along the way, but portraying Midwestern college kids they do not.
I was very surprised and disappointed to see that it rated so low overall, as I've always enjoyed the movie (over and over again!).
Decent actors, but overall an uninvolving script with characters that I didn't care a fig about.
But overall the movie is fun and well worth a visit.
With an intriguing mix of internal and external conflict, a love story, comraderie that only the fine sport of football can bring, and an overall theory that the underdog can compete, Second String is an excellent movie worthy of viewing every possible moment that it appears on TNT.
looking like she's about to go into convulsions - but overall it's not enough.
Sure, there are some mistakes in it, such as the weapons used, but that should not detract from the overall excellent story line (which is much like "Objective Burma", another excellent film).
Fit right in with his overall "homespun" personality.
I'm hesitant to give a movie this silly, corny and stupid eight stars but I had to because overall it was fun to watch and provided a number of genuine laughs.
Tony Martin's "Tenement Symphony," although seemingly misplaced in the movie, was great, in that its melody was classic in tone, and Martin's voice only enhanced the overall effect.
But overall the movie was pretty decent, but it shouldn't be portrayed as more than it is; a good action movie (and it often is made up to be more).
If there is a single positive note among the deluge of negative, the film does boast a climactic twist which manages to be slightly unpredictable and vaguely realistic - both shocking surprises in a film which could not be farther from either quality overall.
It all boils down to a typically pointless ending and overall, this is one of the few films that is bettered by the lamentable 'Demons 2'!
Excellent action, great use of CGI, a few jarring "impossibilities", but overall an excellent action-thriller.
anyone who was associated with this abomination as well as anyone who enjoyed it is cordially invited to board the bus for Royal Oak, Michigan for an appointment with Dr. Kevorkian...can't really pinpoint whether it was sicker or stupider than anything i've ever seen...the cover of the film promises something that seems interesting...when you are subjected to the Chinese girl doing her art thing during the beginning credits, you know that's not going to happen...if i had any sense i'd have turned it off at that point...horrible script, poor excuses for acting and an overall mean-spirited attitude make this a candidate for the absolutely worst movie EVER...do yourself a favor...dodge this bullet...
There are maybe one or two decent gore effects, but overall, they're as bad as everything else.
Much has been said of Chaney's inappropriateness for the part: well, I liked him overall and he was quite effective in his various confrontations with Paige (particularly during the climax, one of the best in the Universal canon) or vampire hunters J. Edward Bromberg and Frank Craven; he may not look like a ladies' man but then Lugosi himself was past his prime in THE RETURN OF THE VAMPIRE!
I was swept away by the vision and the overall mood of the film.
So, overall it was a very well done show, and this is why I love to go to the movies.
Robert Siodmak makes great use of his resources and the film rivals the first film in quality and overall composition.
I think more could have been done with the plot line about the Stalker's mob connections, but overall, I rate NIGHT VISION as a brilliant action movie, and well worth spending 90 minutes of your life watching.
There's some atmosphere oozing from it but not that much overall, has a strong amateurish feel to it as well.
This first ever film adaptation of a John Steinbeck story is not perfect, but overall, it's still very good, and very faithful to the book.
They have slammed good points 3-5, overall weakened no.1 and only no.2 enhanced in any way.
Cons: Utter cr*p for a script; very bad acting overall with only few exceptions; laughable, pathetic characters; illogical, predictable, stupid.
"Boondock Saints" is a clever, funny, sufficiently violent movie with an overall high entertainment value.
Of course you may find some over familiarities in the story lines, but overall this is a very entertaining mystery series, probably not the best out there, but worth a watch.
The songs were sometimes unnecessary, but overall better than I expected them to be.
overall, this is a title to see, but probably not to own.
Pacing was terrible, jumps were made that made no sense, and the overall quality of acting and sets was deplorable.
My description for this Bugs Bunny episode, overall, is fun.
The movie's greatest strength, though, is the overall production.
However, I must say, that overall the movie is mundane, and seems to go on forever.
It's nicely directed with a good overall visual style and it has a good compelling story, that mixes drama with some more supernatural elements.
Of all the Jack Ryan films, I think Patriot Games and it's sequel, Clear and Present Danger remain the best in terms of storyline, character development, and overall direction.
Some good make-up and special effects are a plus again however, but overall it leaves much to be desired.
I cant see how this movie is related to the eye series and the story seems decent towards the start but just drops from there, but overall a fairly entertaining movie and worth a watch.
I found the twist at the end regarding May and Teddy's fate rather amusing and it fits in with the overall mood of this film.
The acting is excellent in spots, and very good overall.
The action sequences are truly exciting, overall pacing is excellent, and the miracles wrought by God are depicted with awed and respectful wonder.
I really think all teenagers should watch this at the beginning of their high school days.It will make things a lot easier for them due to the message of this film.Its about saying "screw'em" to the world and to just be yourself and that its OK to be abnormal because "there is no normal".Every teenager suffers from Self Esteem problems but after watching this film they should feel a lot more relaxed within themselves.From touching scenes to funny set pieces it has something for most people and will leave you with a nice feeling inside,how many movies do that these days where its all doom and gloom and ridiculous scenarios.This is also a very well acted movie and is lovely piece of work overall.
The director has explored this topic previously in films such as The Unfaithful Wife and Wedding in Blood (among others), but Pleasure Party stands out because it's an overall much darker tale than what went before, and may well be a contender for Chabrol's all time darkest film.
Just needed a bit more overall coherency.
While it lacks an "iconic scene" like the first one's famous ending, "Ringu 2" is a better balanced and overall improved example of Nakata's particular (and very influential) style of the New Wave of Asian horror.
It is dark and gritty which makes it overall realistic.
The acting overall was mediocre, but given the script, they did about as much as they could with the material.
But overall, this movie sucked.
The experienced Stuart Whitman is less successful, although overall he pulls off an acceptable performance as the Priest that helps Jennifer against the Hand.
Demonoid, Messenger of Death is a pretty unique film, it's certainly something a bit different & overall I was throughly entertained by it.
Although the tempo of the movie becomes unnecessarily slow at certain parts, the overall result is quite satisfactory.
So overall I'd give it 7/10.
Great fun overall, Newton is just a pure delight to watch in this entertaining, surprisingly well-written and executed boys fantasy brought to life.
The thing that gets me overall: this film makes no sense!!!
An overall Emmy-deserving piece of art.
A good movie overall.
Each cast member plays their part very well, especially the 2 female leads, the directing is not without its flaws but overall is very unique and very well done.
The character it's self it pretty cool....don't get me wrong....he has some good points but overall weak performance.
The film also boasts actual history events from the 1969 World Series and a finish which will surprise you, it's a movie that you really have to pay close attention to, but it's worth the lenght of the time duration, overall this film gets a 9 out of 10
overall this movie will be a 10+ for audiences that are well any age!
I do have to agree that it tried to have a good lesson in the story, but overall my recommendation is that no one over 8 watch it, it's just too annoying.
The film overall has a Shimmer-like quality, too.
Pretty good movie overall in the sense that the story keeps moving and there's no soppy love scenes to slow things down.
The overall pace of the film is very gentle and contemplative, and the sex scene with its unwarranted nudity feels out of place.
"Highway to Hell" is so unusual and extremely refreshing in its vision that I couldn't help but love its labyrinth of dazzling ideas and overall junky goodness.
The film did drag here and there (certainly with Fellini letting some vignettes last longer than they should) but overall, the cumulative effect of all the stories creates a unique visceral experience that's seldom seen, back then or since.
Each scene is a terrific picture, with several visual layers, extraordinary lights and focuses, a lot of invention, of visual flair, and the overall technical mastery is stunning.
However, the length of the film causes one to believe that there is a lack of overall substance.
There's a sadness to this story, especially near the end but overall, even though it's central theme seems to be "death," I don't think it's a depressing film.
The over direction of Fincher puts the emotional undertone in real jeopardy but, thankfully, the overall experience is mostly a welcome and rewarding one.
I was very impressed with the overall cleanliness of this film.
But overall, the movie was too formulaic, but that's okay, since sometimes movie-goers just want to watch something that does not require too many brain cells.
Believable characters and an overall good script make this film one that makes the modern gangster movie look pitiful.
So, overall this isn't a masterpiece, but Scorsese was definitely showing the sensibility that he brought to his later movies.
Pursued does have a couple of small hiccups due to some cheesy dialogue, but it is a real good western overall.
Some actors are miscast (would have preferred a more seasoned actor play Slim...such as Martin Landau), but overall, it's a fun film to watch.
But overall, this is definitely one of the best programs ever made, and will continue to be a source of entertainment for many generations.
The actors have rendered their skills to the best,the screenplay was great and overall the characters are well delivered.
Still, the movie is competently directed and photographed and overall is worth a look.
The influence from Wes Craven's classic The Last House on the Left is clear and obvious throughout, but the film doesn't do anything new with it and overall is really rather boring.
However the main problem with "Steel Trap" is it's dullness, and even if you did like it, you have to admit it was a bit dull overall.
I only saw this Israeli film because I wanted to see Ronit Elkabetz and she blew away the scenes she was in but overall, her appearance was much too brief.
Corny, fun, interesting and light-hearted are the perfect ways to sum up this movie, and if you haven't seen it, of course don't expect a masterpiece, but you will enjoy it for it's wacky characteristics and overall cheesiness, yet emotional effectiveness.
I can totally see why this movie might come across as totally lame; it has half- baked plot with a rather strange pace, underdeveloped characters, and a little substance overall.
There are a few nice touches, and the romance here doesn't feel forced, but overall it's just an above average action flick.
**POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW**  I was impressed overall with 'Fulltime Killer'.
It's your basic assassin showdown movie, and overall its executed well.
Ridiculous from the start and very boring overall.
It was very well thought out, and overall, creatively original - it has it's own spark that screams unique.
Sure, it looks a bit cheesy here and there, might have needed some extra care at some times and places... but overall, the lasting impression I got was that This Isn't A Gigabuck Hollywood Movie But It Sure Looks Like One.
However, often despite the terrible budgets and overall cheesiness of the films, they were still often fun to watch--or at least to laugh at due to their ineptness.
So overall, a slightly worse than average flick, though for Bogart a sincere effort but a miss nevertheless.
The one thing that keeps the movie from being better is the overall silliness of the situation, particularly the death scenes.
Lucy Liu giving birth alone on the side of a hill in a field... or the Chinese soldiers ripping apart bags of blood with their boots and rifles ... the body of an important character left in the mud...), but the squirming is part of the movie's overall experience.
Still, overall this makes for an interesting experiment with India.
Randy Orton, Triple H and Rey Mysterio would seem to be among the favorites but the overall match was not the classic Rumble that we always hope for, mainly because there are usually a few side stories that play out, some setting up future feuds.
Obviously The Rumble and The Cruiserweight match were the best matches on the card, but overall could have been MUCH BETTER!
"Robin Hood" features all the criteria of a masterpiece: great actors, a great staff, a great plot and a great overall product.
He uses these simplistic structures to keep us focused on the overall depth and tone of the film.
Whether the story the film was based on was true or not, I thought the performances of all the actors and actresses were exceptional, the photography was excellent and overall though not a film that could be called 'enjoyable' because it was so sad, I was intensely moved and gave it 9/10.
He came across too soft to be real and like he was reading the script as he was going along and overall not very believable.
It would of improved the overall quality if they had someone better in that role.
The plusses: good story, compelling lead actress, enough plot twists & turns to keep me interested, a strong ending, a middle eastern guy who reminded me of great bit players from the 1940s and an overall professional look about it.
Just like a Chopin Prelude played by many different pianists: the notes are the same and predictable but the overall effect can vary from terrible to sublime.
Don't go in expecting a backstory on the killer, or why he's out stalking gay men, or too much depth overall - it is, after all, just a quintessential, formulaic slasher flick, just with a queer twist.
The overall effect really isn't that much different than a decade later--as both films are wonderful for the time.
This doesn't mean that the film overall is an incredible landmark, only in part and only there on the technical side of things.
This is overall a truly emotional and violent roller-coaster of what happens when friends grow and and the repercussions of what that means, be it good or bad.
This is due to the great Morricone score and the witty dialog, SOG is hilarious at times but overall takes itself seriously.
The ending could have been done better, but overall this movie was good from start to finish, and if you like good crime/mobster films, you should definitely see this one.
This notion that Anna Magnani is in this overall project almost like her own vehicle, as Scorsese has said in his film My Voyage to Italy (which inspired me to seek this out to start with), it's un-thinkable to see anyone else play either of the two roles.
Nonetheless, "Phantasm" sequels are overall better than the majority of horror sequels.
There's an overall sense of dread that's sustained throughout.
I probably made that synopsis sound more soap-operatic than it should, since it doesn't very well convey the overall twisted, creepy atmosphere that Browning achieves in The Unknown.
this was such a great movie the climax my gid what a climax so great this movie focuses on the Muslim-hindu riots and the friendship of Dev (Amitabh Bhachchan)and Tej (Om Puri) and how Dev has a compulsion to act which makes up for the climax i didn't predict the climax what it would be but Nihalani shows us that being human is more important than anything and if you fail to be one or fail humanity for that matter death will come to you only then basically this movie is adapted from a specific incident from gujarat and some riots that took place there in some life-taking incident overall songs aren't that good except Rang De Ni" it's basically a good movie with everybody delivering a better performance as the movie progresses and the action just keeps you there
Like each film in this series tends to do, it's style and overall tone is a whole lot different than that of it's three predecessors.
I suppose it isn't too terrible though because his character wasn't of much relevance to the overall story, but still).
This is overall a great series, but the wait for this next sequel is starting to get excruciating.
The actors all look like and act like soap-opera stars, and their delivery, expression, and overall demeanors are terrible.
But overall decent gore and good shooting of the old woman in the head.
my overall : 3/10
My rating in detail:  1 star for cinematography (ok, but barely) 1 star for the music (it didn't hurt) 2 stars for acting (sticks out because the rest of this film is so bad) -2 stars for the script  The only positive: James Burns obviously has tremendous fun playing the sadistic Sheriff - it's a pleasure to watch him  Makes for 2 stars overall - and that's generous.
The one thing that seems to be a theme to the overall film is the past mistakes Mike made when facing The Tall Man.
Although the story line and Francisco's character are quite fanciful and interesting, the dialogues seem to be pretentious, the character build-up insufficient and the editing quite confusing, causing the overall feel to be incomplete and puzzling.
Recently reliving the experience on DVD, I was amazed at how every scene seems to hit a bullseye...both as individual vignettes and ultimately weaving together to make the overall quilt.
The soundtrack courtesy of Nico Fidenco is infectious, and helps to make the overall film more erotic.
But the star of this movie is the time in which it is set, and the set design, cinematography and overall mood of the movie are captured wonderfully.
All in all, a 10 for realism, a 5 for being rushed, and an 8 overall.
The acting overall ranges from adequate to excellent, the best being provided by Kurt Rogiers who portrays a necrophiliac serial-rapist in a way that he is almost likable.
There are indeed moments of rallies, door to door campaigning and even the occasional shouting match, but the overall effect of the editing is more Fahrenheit 911 than a true documentary.
Film focuses strongly on Tony and Manja, but could have rounded out the wife's character a bit more - overall an enjoyable film but the ending's a bit melodramatic as most were for the time.
I had heard about this film and about how underrated it was,then last week i saw a copy of it on ebay on VHS PAL UK.I was really surprised as i didn't think it had ever been released in the UK.It must be one of the rarest videos in Britain as sadly not many people have heard of it.Luckily i won it for just over Â£3 not bad eh.So if any one else is interested in buying a copy,there must be others available in Britain,if you really look around.I couldn't wait to watch this film,and i must say i wasn't disappointed.Its starts off a mildly amusing story that suddenly gets sadder and sadder until it reaches a climax to a very tragic ending.I must admit the last 10 seconds of this film does bring tears to the eyes,i wont say why,but try and see this movie and you will see.The acting between Gary Cooper and Anna Sten is first rate,her character is very likable as she is totally unselfish,and is trying to please everyone,so she does deserve happiness.Garys character,well he is married and his wife is not a monster and she does love him,so you feel sorry for her as well,i think you have to decide for yourself in a triangle like this someone is always going to get hurt,but you don't know who.Also this is a very early film showing us cultural differences and the sort of conflicts that can arise when two people from very different back grounds want to be together.Can it work?he is from a literate sophisticated family,she is from a poor immigrant family that is still trying to learn new ways.The answer is if two people really love each other then they can over come their differences as true love conquers all,i think overall this was the strongest message that comes out of this film,to some people the married issue may be the point of the film.Any way this is a very haunting film and well worth watching if you get the chance.
Here the cinematography and editing match the direction in all being top notch and the exquisite tinting in the restored version adds a great deal to the overall atmosphere of the film.
But overall the movie seems forced and is something of a hit and miss.
The overall ineptitude of this film and the monumental waste of talent does warrant some kind of perverse redeeming value to it however.
The music is terrible, the acting is terrible, there is no plot, and overall it is a tasteless mess.
The Water Horse has a few inconsistencies, but overall is the better of the two films.
I highly respect these filmmaker's, but you get the feeling watching this that they didn't have a lot of creative control overall.
The denouement for this film is, unfortunately, too similar to other "twist" endings that I've seen, diminishing the overall effect a little.
And, overall, that's what this film turns out to be: pretty lame.
While some of he humor was really dated and sappy, the overall context made this a hilarious look at what pop culture used to be.
Having been a member of a wedding band in the 1980's, it brought back great memories of the music, the fashions and the overall aura of that era.
The movie also has some points to make on the subject of love; The Wedding Singer portrays that being in love is overall better than being a 'Fonz' type, womanising character.
But overall, it's an excellent show with no meaning or purpose to it whatsoever.
The overall messages of the film are a real eye-opener compared to the propaganda we hear today (2008) regarding America's wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
My only wish is that the overall picture held together better as a whole.
But overall it was a concise drama about coming out in a middle class family.
The young actors are mostly unknown but mostly talented and add to the overall positive impression the film made on me.
I saw the preliminary character sketches for this film and was horrified at what the costuming and overall appearance of the characters were.
However, overall, X-Men was a good start to a good trilogy of the 2000's.
Concisely, in a model of economy, Singer establishes the characters and creates the overall conflict between them while broaching questions about the enormity of segregation!
So, overall, this first "X-Men" movie does have its cheesy moments, but that certainly doesn't mean it has no entertainment value.
X-Men was a really entertaining, and overall great film.Than again, I use great in lowest term, but still, I think it deserves to be called great.This movie is one of those superhero movies that delivered and stuck.Most just deliver and then you forget about them, but this one always has to be one of the first superhero films that comes to mind when you think of that genre.The casting could've have been more perfect either.I mean, Hugh Jackman, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, and Halle Berry.All of them I've seen in numerous amounts of films and I think they're all fantastic.This is a good movie, and I recommend it for basically anyone.
Because of that he uses way too many explosions, and action that completely overshadows the storyline, a storyline that wasn't overall too bad if plots had been kept quiet and filmed appropriately, for example, there's a scene where Christian Bale gets emotional trying to appeal to human emotions, and the scene gets you caring,....for 3 seconds then its over, it should of been dragged out, and really got you into the film before the final battle.
Just the directors choices and techniques lowered its overall rating.
As for the general sound effects they are both very fitting and believable adding to the overall credibility of the film which is considerable.
There is, however, some interesting action scenes and overall the action is acceptable.
The movie left me feeling a little unsatisfied but overall it is in itself (i think) relatively unbiased, showing all types of reporters and also things that may or may not be motivating the US government.
The overall lack of comedic timing in this movie indicates serious problems throughout production.
overall i thought the family dynamics were great - in a horrifying way.
Yet to interpret these films as such and only that would be to misunderstand the overall logic of these films.
In their very diversity, they seem to offer an overall 'world view', whether it be clear-cut or oblique, in which the characters in these films are all part of the same condition.
However, from a long term perspective this movie has diminished the value of the overall franchise and potential of any future films.
The action is very cool, skillfully done and overall fantastic.
Cons: Outside of Shichinintai arc, the series was overall boring, repetitive and some of the characters are extremely irritating.
Unfortunately, after seeing the whole series through and a few of the films, I can say that my overall disposition has changed, and it falls into almost all of the pitfalls that plague "bad" anime.
I think that overall the look was amazing, the action and CG were great and the acting was mostly good.
But overall it was a good movie that made your heart ache.
The overall impression for me was one of a very good amateur company doing their very best to put on a show.
The situations explored around relationships and family are universal and so easy for anyone to relate to, there are misunderstood physical situations and language barriers which all add to the overall melodrama/comedy unfolding on screen.
Subsquent viewings of the film only make it better, and it is overall just absolutely heartbreaking.
While I will agree that Lust for a Vampire is entertaining overall to a degree - it is also heavily flawed and unworthy of the great Hammer tradition, Jimmy Sangster the director, and many of the Hammer legions of production workers who have worked and created much superior work.
Many people have found that most DVD editions of "The Black Raven" to be too dark in places and of overall poor quality.
The settings and costumes are wonderful depictions of life long ago and the overall production values are very high.
It is wickedly funny in places but it is its overall warmness that makes it a success (unfortunately not at the box office anywhere near as much as it should have been).
Perhaps the odd decent movie and some classic reruns of your favourite old series... but overall, generally speaking you don't expect too much.
With the pitch-black ending, the director shows us that the film isn't meant to be taken seriously, and overall, Bay of Blood is both influential and a great time - and therefore shouldn't be missed by horror fans.
I expected less than I got in regards to overall quality and story.
Although it is not a "perfect" movie, I think the overall feeling one gets from its mixture of western, mystery, and romance themes is something quite special.
The overall story itself edits well into each segment due to the well defined connections between the characters.
Crawford herself had worked in silents, and scored notable successes in such films as OUR DANCING DAUGHTERS, but she has made an easy leap to the sound era and never overplays her hand; Flaemmchen is among the best of her early performances, and Crawford herself thought it among the best of her overall career.
I did manage to complete 75% of the movie, and there were some funny parts which made me laugh, but overall it was horrible.
Very good overall, but Snake and Crane Arts of Shaolin is better (even though it has an awkward title) if you're looking for something from this era.
but overall the film was rather serious.
I have written the orchestral arrangements and composed some additional horror/ambient music cues which has been put to great use and adds a nice flavour to the overall score, I think.
I would agree with most of the reviewers that this is overall one of the best adaptations of "Jane Eyre" ever.
But the misrepresentation of Jane's character is not Cusack's fault alone but partly also due to the script, which brings me back to my first point of criticism: Since the script is overall so faithful to the novel, the viewer naturally concludes that each word uttered in this version must come straight from the novel Â but such is not the case.
Let me conclude by saying that despite all my points of criticism I still think that this version in its overall great faithfulness to the novel is miles above nearly all other Jane Eyre adaptation, and I would invite all true lovers of the novel Â and using that term I exclude all those who earnestly affirm that the silly 2006 perversion of Jane Eyre is true to the novel or to the spirit of the novel Â to watch both the productions of '73 and '83 and to form their own opinion.
The basic techniques were adequate and I had little qualms with the overall product.
I guess if there was a problem with the movie was the overall message.
While it is a little one sided, it gives an overall impression of the positives of convenience and the negatives of PVC and gives both opposing arguments from the industry and activists- ranging from the "end user" (her parents) to the ultra-hippie to the corporate exec.
I loved the shots of people concerned with this issue going out and testing the air themselves, I liked how all involved were calm and overall respectful, and I most liked the opposition between the narrator and her parents.
While the performance is a little discusting, the overall character is really funny.
The plot is absurd, but this seriously added to the film's overall hilarity.
The reason Screwed is so funny and ultimately works well as an overall film can be credited, in a very large part, to the perfect casting.
I thought that overall it was a very good movie.
I strongly urge any one to watch this film and i believe deserves a much higher overall rating.
The movie doesn't draw the viewer in, instead it psychologically irritates and alienates the viewer by butting unrelated scenes together (which one would think might have some overall meaning in the end, however this is not the case).
Neither Giallo a Venezia nor Patrick Lives Again tried to be suspenseful but disgusting, but I think they could not stray too much from their initial premise ( Patrick Vive Ancora being some sort of sequel or remake of the excellent Patrick, a thriller by Richard Franklin), and manage to build if not overall suspenseful athmospheres, at least some pretty good moments.
I enjoyed this film overall, especially in its portrayal of Brecht's efforts to keep harmony within the little harem he'd created for himself.
The overall sepia glow that this film has adds to the sense that the viewer really IS seeing and experiencing "Old Heidelberg".
overall, a very impressive film with intelligence, originalty and style.
While I liked the movie overall, the impending scene where people were trying to set up a dispersal sight was a bit unrealistic and far fetched.
As I say, there are faults with the movie but overall its a thought provoking movie and on its own terms terrifying.
While the movie is extraordinarily captivating overall, I think a few scenes in the beginning have a somewhat cheesy 80s feeling to them, but they're still strangely hypnotic.
this is a Masterpiece ...god it almost made me cry..please vote good for this movie ..this movie deserve to be on the top instead of stupid movies like "This Is Spinal Tap" (1984) and lots of other not so deserving titles on top 250 films list on IMDB...Steve McQueen is at his best as Papillon...great story and overall an excellent picture..if you haven't seen it yet ,do not hesitate you owe that to yourself if you are a movie fan and don't forget to vote after you watched it we have to have this movie on Top 250 films list..Don't you agree with me?
But overall, a memorable escape film that ranks with the best of other escape stories.
I guess overall if you're looking for a crazy spin on the Real World then by all means watch this.
The overall structure of the film is a clever look at the unpredictability of an artist's focus, in that filmmaker Ross McElwee set out to make a documentary about the Savannah Campaign and ended up making a film about his failed relationships.
In hindsight, for each case, a better choice could have been made for overall family enjoyment.
Even if you didn't know that Baumbach and Wes Anderson ("Rushmore"; "The Life Aquatic") are close friends, you would notice from the overall design of "The Squid and the Whale": the use of music as a dramatic element (Pink Floyd's 'Hey You' plays a crucial role), costume design (Bernard and Walt wear the same kind of Nikes), and the titular exhibit, which bears more than a passing resemblance to the drawings that punctuate Anderson's films.
Let's just be honest, it's not Slater's voice which makes him likable but his overall performance.
On the plus side however the 2-dimensional characters are engaging, there are one or two great jump-out-of-seat moments, tips of the hat to not only the original movie but also HG Wells' novel "The Invisible Man", effective use of music (which is all new - not a rehash of Goldsmiths original) and an overall sense of fun (That's Executive Producer Paul Verhoeven shining through, I think) - despite the nasty moments!
The direction overall isn't too great and I would never guess it was one of his films if I didn't know any better.
It is true to say that the acting from both Defoe and especially Hackman is top notch, the photography and film score excellent coupled with the overall pace of the film makes for a very entertaining viewing.
Michael rooker has always been good in his movie.. he played as a villain,and so.. he has proved that he is also great at playing as a villain...just like Michael ironside..  overall...i give this movie 10 out of 10 stars...  Bravo For Mississippi Burning !!!!
So, overall it's not a blockbuster, and it's not something you'll want to rush out and tell your friends about.
The very ending offers one doozy of a marvelously ironic surprise plot twist while the arid desert setting adds to the overall creepy tone.
Still, one is drawn into this sumptuous bag of tricks almost against his will, and the overall results are fun for '50s connoisseurs.
Although this movie has three rather uneven stories in separate segments, the overall package succeeds, is quite beautiful artistically and is highly entertaining.
that is the overall theme of the unsung hero in this movie.
if you want to see plenty of hot chicks showering Goofy violence and the overall awesomeness of Orville check this movie out i first saw it on USA network years ago and have been wanting more Orville ever since Check it out!!
It always amazes me that people rent this stuff, apparently expecting Bergman or something, and THEN decide they have to write negative reviews denouncing the overall silliness, bad acting, cheap production values and amount of nudity and/or violence.
But overall, Airwolf blew ABC's Blue Thunder out of the sky.
These are the overall qualities of Viva Las Vegas, and guess what?
Imho their best period overall was with Universal during WW2, but this is on the same level and the generally higher production values more than compensating me for the loss of that special Universal atmosphere.
Its very apparent that this was an expensive film to produce overall.
The make-up and prosthetics, tattoos, scarification of the cast, as well as the overall look and texture of the movie, make for one of the most vivid and haunting movies you will ever see.
Together, they made a lot of infamous but overall terrible exploitation flicks.
The overall cuteness and intense hilarity of this show will definitely draw you I'm.
My overall experience with this movie is great.
The overall feeling is that if the makers had opted for an existing location instead of constructing one, some more money could have gone toward retakes and actor coaching.
The character angles are decent and the overall design is nicely innovative and not overdone with a fake gloss.
There are various copies available, some better than others overall in various states of decomposition, but I haven't seen one better than the Thames Photoplay issue.
The lack of color added to the overall darkness of the film due to lack of lighting also is a deterrent to watching these very, very old films that were made when my grandparents were infants (literally).
But overall this series is very well done.
But the whole story was nothing special, maybe some cute dialog in the middle, but overall quite average.
But luckily after the LA episode came the NY episode which was the best overall.
The Paris episode, well it wasnt that great overall.
To say which one was my overall favorite might be a little picky, as every one of them had something to offer differently.
Italian horror movies from the '70's and '80's especially, are not really know for their subtitle or overall brilliantness.
And soon enough, the vacationers will get to meet him face-to-face...  A lot of people down ANTHROPOPHAGOUS for it's slow pace - which I can't really argue - but overall, the film is handled competently.
This foray into horror for the late prolific sleaze director D'Amato is overall a worthy viewing for die-hard fans of the genre.
So, overall, this was worthy of an 8.
Still,overall, I recommend it!
Big Night is a peaceful joy to watch because its themes and the overall feeling of the film is so normal.
The actual events shown somehow faded from the overall sense of poetic experience at the end of the movie.
But it's safe to say that overall the moments of greatness far outweigh the few awkward, misdirected moments.
It's almost as if the cutscenes are an afterthought to join the levels together, not as a part of the overall story as in Jedi Knight.
Jet Li is AMAZING as always, and is AMAZING here, he does not speak much, but he is very believable, likable, had very good chemistry with Bridget Fonda, kicked that ass, and was just amazing overall (Jet Rules!).
Nevertheless I struggled gamely through it, but overall the boredom of this over-trodden story was only relieved by the commercial breaks, and of course it's conclusion.
Basically, pretty much the word 'amateurish' sums up my overall impression.
It is full of subtle/dry humor and has an overall upbeat mood.
I love the film Xtro, because it's weird and imaginative, and just overall a strange little film.
The story was ok, but overall this was a pretty bad movie which I was hoping to END, END, END as long as it lasted.
that just reminded me of, like, one crazy summer or something and it gave the film an overall atmosphere that i liked.
So, as I overall liked this movie because of good plot and atmosphere, and also because of mostly good acting, I give it a final score of 8/10.
overall, it was a pretty good movie despite some of the acting.
But this is not to disparage the overall cast, which is remarkably fine and includes such noted artists as Brian Blessed, John Hurt, Patricia Quinn, Patrick Stewart, and a host of others.
Overall, I love the writing, acting, and overall production value of such a amazing under-rated film.
Okay, overall, it's an enjoyable film--especially for us guys from the 80's who grew up with the movies referenced in this.
This means of course that the overall feeling of doom which the films had is not really present here.
But overall, this s a second-handed-European-kind-of-style film that might be hundreds out there ever year in Europe and all better than this one.
Three particular bits to note: overall the gay men in the film were effectively portrayed -- no caricatures.
The film is beautiful, the score regal, and the overall effect spellbinding.
Thus, when an "Oh my" is heard from Gulliver, the audience knows it should pay attention to this point in the plot, as it is important to the overall storyline.
Prior to my viewing of 'The Living Dead Girl', my only taste of the master of erotic vampire films, Jean Rollin, was the low quality and overall less than brilliant 'Lips of Blood', and because of that I wasn't expecting great things from this movie.
She looked fantastic and while some of the 'concert' scenes were a bit long, overall the movie was very well done.
And, again, humorous banter and an overall fun vibe should not be undervalued!
I can understand the whole "Sliders Rift Thing" as a convention for the characters getting to Mongo - interstellar flight isn't possible for Earth when this series is set and most viewers realize this - but overall there isn't much innovation.
A cute movie which deserves a good notch or so above the overall rating here.
That probably explains why its overall IMDb user rating is just 5.
Ray Milland, Sam Elliot, Joan Van Ark, Adam Roarke and Judy Pace are all realistic in their performances as the family, and overall, this is just a fun film that is worth watching over and over again.
I see she didn't last too long in the States, and I'm led to believe that the show overall wasn't very well received.
But there is still plenty there for those who don't speak the language and overall the plot and humor translates quite well.
The overall premise of the film is fun, and the film delivers non-stop laughs.
Horrible movie overall.
Yep, the overall ending is predictable, but not unbelievable and a few of the side stories might surprise you along the way.
It is a thriller from start to end, and overall a very enjoyable film.
I think it could have worked better, but overall a pretty nice movie.
Some of the actors are a bit bad, but overall, the message gets across perfectly.
The acting is very good overall, making the story very believable.
It is an excellent film overall and is among my favorite animated features.
The script is amazing, and even though it may really be too over the top once in a while, it doesn't distract from the overall picture.
There is another company that puts out a DVD which is better quality but apparently while the overall quality is better, the version of "The Dentist" is censored & has cheezy music added in.
There are flashes of the same brilliance in a few of the throwaway jokes, but overall, there's just no humor for anyone over the age of 10.
From their quirkily hilarious character designs up to the overall portrayal of these robots, they easily got me tickled pink.
That, however is just me being ultra critical, overall this is a top draw movie and worth a look.
So overall, it's an excellent film that I highly recommend.
The shooting style, the acting, the story overall.
I found Framed to be a pretty entertaining film overall - unfortunately, the only version of the film available to me here in the United States is the Americanized version of the film.
While the score is well done, my biggest complaint is the music used in the film, which consists of generic aggro-rock that disrupts the overall tone of the movie.
The ending is quite appropriate as the overall film is just a snapshot of one Friday night of these four bickering friends.
This is a truly fine feature debut and whilst budgetary constrictions make a little of it look slightly amateurish this takes nothing from the overall effect and let us not forget that this much overlooked film was an obvious inspiration for Alien.
It's not without its issues, the characters mostly aren't terribly interesting and neither are the actors, and the writing and direction are efficient and sometimes ace, but not as overall gripping as Cronenberg's later works.
But, overall, it was a decent movie, especially for Showtime.
It's also a solid film noir which, although often very dark and negative, in balance bucks the trend by being overall uplifting and leaving you with a satisfied feeling Â although some might say that excludes it from being counted as a film noir at all.
I don't remember much of the details of the movie......just the overall feeling I came away with....the pain...of something terribly wrong, injustice...
Some of the editing tricks are neat, but overall, it pulls you out of the movie.
However, this one is a good movie, a bit clumsy in some areas, but overall quite watchable.
I totally understand why, without spoiling anything, the overall message of the movie is shocking.
a little comedy here and there, action sequences were okay but overall a disappointment.
As above, this is in a category all of it's own: while it has flaws they cannot take away from the overall impact of the story.
One thing that absolutely takes away from the overall greatness of the film is it's one-dimensional depiction of anyone non-white.
This was silly, but easy to overlook given the overall greatness of the piece.
But overall I like this movie; Hoffman is great, realism is very painful and some of the dialogs in the movie is excellent, the only issue I had were some unnecessary nude scenes and unconvincing beginning of the movie.
This movie is bizarre because, while judged overall its story is shmaltzy and unbelievable, nevertheless each individual scene plays absolutely convincingly and feels very real.
It also takes a while to explain what exactly is going on, but overall it was enjoyable enough.
With brilliant story lines, believable acting, real sets/locations there is little here to be improved and the overall package can appeal to all.
Sure the overall arc of the story may have been predictable, but there were still plenty of dramatic moments along the way and you enjoyed the ride.
Although as a purist-at-heart I was slightly disappointed to see even a second of the precious work edited, overall I am amazed at how well they adapted the tale to fit into a neat little 2 hour time frame.
And, while there were some definite weaknesses (mostly in the quality of the animations), overall I was completely convinced.
Morales' polished cinematography are up to speed, and there's a decent smattering of yummy female nudity (Misty in particular as usual looks quite scrumptious in her birthday suit), but overall this movie is too poky and plodding.
Truly entertaining, overall funny, cool action scenes and a bit of that comic romance.
But overall, it was a great movie, that unfortunately hasn't come to DVD yet, so I hope since "First Shot" has, this one will finally make it.
It is slow-paced at times and has a tendency to drag endlessly in places, but the overall product is more than satisfying.
The overall Rumble was very good, with Stone Cold Steve Austin winning, of course.
The overall tone of the movie is of a very tragic nature--even such lighthearted moments as the aforementioned sequences involving Seita and Setsuko playing around the house or gathering fireflies as lights for their cave are all tainted with a touch of sadness, for we know that these brief scenes of happiness will not last.
Delivered in a deadly earnest, reporter style voice, the narration manages to add to the overall mood and also provides some of the funniest moments, including the excellent conclusion.
Anyway I found this quite a good film and the acting was quite good, I thought the way it was shot was really cool and gave a great effect to the movie, overall I give it ******** out of ********** for a horror flick  Good Movie!
The plot was a bit fuzzy and had the makings of a first time director but overall entertaining.
overall it's a funny feel-good flick smoothed out on the r&b tip wit a pop appeal, appeal, to it.
The performances were flawed at times but what the film lacked in the strongest of performances it more than made up for by the overall chemistry of characters and the general likability of them as well.
Although these situations seem very unlikely, I believe BuÃ±uel's overall intentions are to make the point that, despite each individual's expectations in any given situation, anything is possible.
So a 4 of 10 for movie overall, but an "8" for camp value.
The visuals/cinematography were wonderful, the story was interesting and overall it was a fun movie to watch.
Anyway, like I said, Houston is great to look at, her voice is divine, and Costner tries hard, but overall this movie is not much more than an extended episode of "General Hospital" or some other equally brainless soap opera, and is just as predictable and badly acted.
The comments before mine are mostly right on target...I am in awe of the filmmaking and can't say enough about the dramatic subtleties, the opulent production values and the overall magnificent way the entire project was handled.
Beyond the acting, "Blue Sunshine" also contains some very creepy imagery, a nifty score that serves to heighten the overall mood of the movie and a tightly written script that manages to do what few movies have been able to do, create an effective and memorable anti-drug message while avoiding being overly preachy.
The movie has slight plot holes but overall it's a good movie.
The 70s show had crappy flashbacks and overall was pathetic.
So overall, I love this movie and recommend it to anyone.
The overall result looks more like a graduation project than a proper production.
And although Sabine's incapable of using chopsticks (laugh at the "foreigners" again, why not), overall one must assert Rice Rhapsody really doesn't try to cash in on any Asian vs. Western tripe, nor does it make a big deal of cross-cultural love affairs.
I thought the use of the football and boxing footage worked well, and overall it is a fantastic film from start to finish.
However I felt that the ending was a letdown & to me it hurt MY overall enjoyment of this very well acted & made drama.
But considering how marvelously done the flying sequences are (exceptional for the time), the consistency of the writing and acting and the overall fun of the film, I think the average person would still probably give this movie a score of 6.
But overall this is a good film.
A visual masterpiece this film may be, and certainly an overall interesting watch, but 'The Fugitive' remains inferior Ford.
Having said all that, I admit the film is interesting start-to-finish, the racing scenes terrific, the film effectively manipulative, and overall qualifies as a decent means of entertainment.
But overall, an interesting, entertaining film.
A lot of the scenes had dark lighting and not a single second of musical score throughout the film added to the overall dark atmosphere of the film.
A good film overall and it was really effective in putting the message across even if the movie was just 80 minutes long.
Were it not for the progression of a precise time-line moving from one World War to another, and providing a solid structure for the overall drama, a viewer might easily get lost drifting along in such haunting images as dead sheep hanging from the branches of a tree, a funeral service conducted in row boats alongside rooftops, or a crowd of wailing women running toward a field of dead "husbands, sons, and brothers."
That they are one at the same time cerebral, immature, literate, prankish, frightened, polished, well educated but vulnerable and inexperienced, puts them well outside the troglodyte teens that inhabit the deconstructionist zoo in most post 1970 films, (with the exception of a unfortunate and mis-placed "strip poker" sequence which violates the picture's otherwise overall mood.)
The very fact that MGM did not employ its bevy of famous names in this picture seems a testament to the overall sense of *ordinariness* that "Exit Smiling" conveys.
Some thoughts (for whatever they are worth)-    - The Beach has several Trainspotting-like moments of inspired glee mixed within the overall darker elements of the story (Richard's dark dementia broken up with a little goofy video game bit, for example).
Although the script overall is the weakest link here, Richard is an intriguing character.
"24" has certainly changed the way suspense and addictive television is overall viewed.
The film did need some work with lighting and sound but overall was a fun flick and definitely a thumbs up for people who enjoy this genre.
The overall movie was put together very well, and it actually made me visit New York mind you this was my first time visiting.
The overall movie was put together very well, and it actually made me visit New York mind you this was my first time visiting.
A curiosity of the late 60's (including footage of Paris in 69/70; also notable for the use of text within image which I actually quite liked), but a real disappointment for Miller fans, and a pretty bad movie overall.
Very few movies have the overall excellence of this one..."My Favorite Year" melds together a superior script, outstanding ensemble cast, and outstanding direction from Richard Benjamin...and the crowning achievement of it all is the tour de force performance by Peter O'Toole...Mr. O'Toole takes a character that potentially could have been a buffoon and creates a hilarious yet touching portrayal of an aging action film star who has to do American TV for his "new business associate- the IRS"...assigned to watch over our British invader is Mark Lynn-Baker, who is lucky to still have hair by the end of the show...which by the way is one of the cooler endings ever...and ya gotta get the movie to see it for yourself...I could say something wonderful about each member of the cast...and you'll want to pay particular attention to Joseph Bologna as "King Kaiser"...in fact, rent this movie, enjoy it, then buy it...you can watch it over and over again and love it each time...one note...the scene with the firehose on the roof is one of the funniest movie sequences ever...but it is all good...and I loved it!
make the movie a little heavy for young kids, but overall the film is far more effective than the Disney remake, where the boy is too old and the adults don't really make much sense, even for a comedy.
The overall plot is unimportant yet is completely engaging and satisfying.
Given the fact that Brandauer had such remarkable men at hand as cinematographer Lajos Koltai (the images in this movie are very beautiful - the autumnal tints convey a certain feeling of doom) or composer Georges Delerue (a beautiful title theme), the overall result is most disappointing.
The movie has it's good moments,and the ending was somewhat surprising, but overall it left me feeling "dirty" for lack of a better way of describing it.
The storyline is a little sketchy, but where it is unconvincing it adds to the hilarious overall atmosphere.
Truly good film makes the viewer feel a little more uneasy and a little less certain about themselves; but the overall tone here is one of celebration, and its a weaker work for that.
I was still moved by it and sad at times but overall it's very good.
Still, this, overall, is about two percent anime, which is not a lot, but still.
In fact, I am not really a big fan of SW's Expanded Universe since its purpose is to explore the possibilities beyond the movies (which in turn ruins the rhythm of the saga's overall presentation).
II feels slightly shorter in terms of its overall length and atmosphere due to the fact that most of the situations only take place in two worlds (one of them serves as a prologue to Revenge of the Sith as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine is kidnapped by Grievous).
This is overall a quality piece, well worth watching.
I shall ignore the various "believability" of certain actions in the overall storyline as this is a sci fi movie so you will get loads of them e.g.
Regardless of what I though of the movie overall, nearly 24 hrs later and the movie is still with me.
Serious audiences of independent film will find some production and script flow flaws, but overall, an excellent, compelling venture into a world most of society never experience.
The movie itself runs a little slow overall, but for Stephen Geoffreys fans, it's a must-see.
I'd give this movie overall a 8/10.
The script could have used improvements, but overall it was a great movie.
Sorry all, but even though I overall LOVED the movie the author MISSED on the history.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Face_on_the_Barroom_Floor_(painting)  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Dixon  8 out of 10 for the overall feel of the movie, 2 out of 10 for the history inaccuracy.
A simple average, though does not explain the high level of overall enjoyment from the work of fiction.
It took me about 5 hours to complete the story, and the overall the game is quite good, but after Spider-Man 2 (and, in particular, Ultimate Spider-Man) I was hoping for better.
This movie struggles between being a gore horror (succeeding in some parts but overall trying too hard), a dark comedy (a bad one at that), and a deeper movie than what it is by trying to develop character depth (epic fail).
The gore succeeds at times, but as I said before overall it feels forced and given the attempts at comedy and character development, doesn't feel like a gore horror.
The overall acting is pretty dodgy, (I love the girl yelling for Kurt every five minutes, who wisely leaves very early in the film) apart from maybe the son, (who's recording the whole thing) he's not too bad.
Overall it has a few good tense moments, but nothing overall scary.
I thought overall it was a great movie, and I was watching in constant suspense.
I can't get over the reality scenes, the adoring personalities of the film; 'Nancy' the blowup doll; 'Art' the retard; 'West' the twisted f**ck, and the overall feel + story which makes you laugh till you urinate yourself, and then cry like a kid getting his teeth pulled.
The whole killing and story approach of this movie however still give it an overall original touch.
It doesn't make this one of the best written or most intelligent Columbo movies out there but the overall entertainment value of the movie compensates for this all.
But, overall, I am sorry I put this show off for four years.
The hell with the overall market themes and the Bollinger bands.
The "bottom up" investor looks for individual companies with favorable cash flows, good management, and quality products, regardless of the overall condition of the market.
The film is directed with a glossy feel and atmosphere, adding to it's overall fun.
Fine acting all over the place, especially by Krol and Becker (still brave in German moviemaking to show a Nazi not as a complete monster, even if he is, after all, the bad guy), and despite the overall sad story executed surprisingly lighthanded.
It's overall shape is definitely familiar, but to see it as just another 'Castle' knockoff totally underestimates it.
'The Castle' is funnier overall, but the Micallef political ad is by far the funniest thing in any Australian comedy I can think of.
Also, I found some parts of it gross, like when that police officer is in the basement and they show his icky face...o_O Although I rate this movie 8/10, overall I found this film scary yet interesting.
I think Diana's overall presentation was superlative.
However, it didn't really take away from the overall movie.
Also, the camera shots from low angles with wide lenses give an overall visual perspective that rings true as the way a child would see the world.
I would of liked to see the reasons the older brother did not like school, and a bit more of Magnificoes friend, but overall it was a good film.
I think the message for kids is overall positive, and something parents could be comfortable with exposing their children to.
What I didn't figure on was the fun, extremely colorful story, overall.
A few rude words and food fights to keep the kids (and parents) happy, oh and a dancing donkey, but overall a film that is lots of fun.
The overall script i think is very original, could be better of course, but it kept me on my sit the whole time.
Some details were too stupid, like the " time to make a phone call", or the peaceful way in which Dakota seems to take his situation   The Good: The overall history, the photography, the way they portrait colors and his significance, the ending was nice also.
Unfortunately, it has its ups and downs, but overall I thought it was a pretty good horror/thriller.
I did become a little confused at moments, and there were a few plot holes (which I expected considering the complex storyline), but overall I didn't see anything that affected the course of the movie.
He really humanizes Prince Charles in this film, I think overall it is a very flattering portrayal, although I don't really like how he and Camilla took advantage of Diana's innocence and youth, they really ruined her life.
I gave the film 8 stars instead of 10, because I generally don't like these tell-all types of stories based on celebrity dirty laundry, but it was a good film with good acting; enjoyable overall.
Besides that, the story was very lovely and the film was according to me believable and moving due to the performances, the music and the overall writing.
I would recommend this movie to anyone You will not be disappointed as it is a very good production and overall I give this Movie a 10 considering the budget was not that much and to pull off a masterpiece like this show you what good writing and directing can do for a film like this.
Battles and the world map are in Mode 7, and the overall is well-animated and coloured.
I did not feel as if the contents of the movie were lacking at all, and that the overall production was very professional.
And there's one more thing, very good taste of music showed in all of Eytan Fox's works, "good" here I mean "goes on very well with the movie", the overall ambiance.
I found the movie with a mixed style is somewhat inconsistent at some spots, and some of the music used is kind of tacky, and overall feeling of the movie is very low budget.
Although slow in some parts, overall the characters they meet and the plot really kept me interested in the film.
The overall dark tone and look was mostly gone here and a lighter approach was attempted.
The Sam/Jack story was wrapped up in the first two episodes, those two were pretty good but the overall buildup to the climax was always going to be a letdown.
Looking at "Profiler" overall, the show had a great cast.
Albeit it wasn't terribly original nor unpredictable and certain elements (chiefly the love subplot) felt unnecessary, overall the movie kept me laughing from start to finish.
Good premises for a situation comedy, good actors - however the overall impression is one of disappointment.
The sets were good for the most part though inconsistent, as were the style and overall appearance of the film (sometimes it was bright and technicolor and sometimes muted.)
The characters the actors were portraying often came off as mindless automatons, sort of stereotypical parodies of American archetypes if you will, the performances were often wooden to the point of disbelief Â almost as if they were trying to overact in a very detached manner, it worked quite well and added to the overall sense of "disbelief" I had while watching this film.
This was overall the worst adaptation of anything I have ever seen.
While a few names are mentioned, surely the overall group should be known as more than just "the kids".
The rest of the cast adds to the overall excellence of the production: acerbic Ned Sparks as Miss Colbert's business manager; lovely Rochelle Hudson as her ready-for-love daughter; Henry Armentta & Alan Hale as businessmen cajoled by Miss Colbert's charms; and especially Fredi Washington, memorable as Miss Beavers' daughter, a stranger inside her own skin.
His musings in this role are hilarious, in a way that only Woody can be; and overall this is one of the funniest scenes of the movie.
As I said; the sketches are hit and miss, and some of the sketches fail to penetrate, but overall this film is a big hit for me.
It becomes clear that Allen seized the concept of the novel as a loose framework to string together a series of punchlines, making the overall feel of the film appear overly patchy to properly gel together, even for a series of unrelated short narratives.
It has some very low points, (let's face it, the giant tit was awful), but overall a ten!
Not even my 8 year old sister was scared of this movie and by the end we were all just laughing at how physically painful this movie was in terms of horror, suspense, and overall, a decent plot.
The make-up of the killer was pretty good (kind of a poor Crospy imitation) and that's the best thing about the movie overall.
There were many things I did like about this movie- the animation was spectacular, and the movie was, overall, pretty sweet.
I found it entertaining, not wandering off the original's storyline too much, and overall really good.
The animation is absolutely gorgeous, brilliant, and overall the best in 2D production you've seen in a good 10 years.
The animation is every bit as good as a lot of the recent theatrical films , with beautifully rendered background art and an overall "Technicolor" look that was for the most part quite dazzling .........and how about them voices?
And overall, the action sucks.
The Marine is just a silly film by WWE simply to entertain it's fan base and further it's empire.For one to judge The Marine you need to take into account that this film was intended to entertain action fans with a no brainer,cheesy,action,popcorn flick and as a popcorn flick The Marine succeeds.John Cena is actually a good actor and he played his invincible,heroic,one man strike force character to perfection as did Robert Patrick with his absolutely hilarious character.The Marine has the most unbelievable stunts and at some times they are almost unbearably bad.The fight sequences are great,very intense,very hardcore, but the explosions and special effects are brutally unrealistic and cheesy.The film also has some of the most annoying,campy,corny, dialog ever captured on film.It's so bad you feel like you're re-watching 1997's Batman and Robin.As a follower of pro wrestling I'm aware that John Cena currently has a love/hate relationship with WWE fans.Females and Adolescents love Cena while Males hate him.My guess is that The Marine was made in order to change male fans opinions by making an action film that generally appeals to them.However judging by the overall IMDb rating WWE failed to do so.I wouldn't necessarily say THe Marine is a bad film but it is incomparable and can't compete with mainstream action films like The Transporter,Crank,or District B13 however if you enjoy direct to DVD action flicks that have a thin storyline but some great action scenes like Special Forces or Belly Of The Beast than The Marine is more suited to you.It's definitely not the worst film ever made and I think for the most part it's because it doesn't take itself seriously and admits it's a popcorn flick.Overall The Marine is just silly action much like wrestling and much like wrestling the characters are whacky and at times unbelievable.
This has the logical consistency of marshmallows filled with ketchup, and the overall aftertaste is just as disgusting.
The film keeps a good pace and can even give a scare in places, but overall, I'm not impressed - and the bad effects make the movie rated only a 3 in my book.
in one instance we are talking about the oppression of the African American, while in the other the directors seem to be building age-old stereotypes), the characters continued towards their bland downward spiral, those annoying, randomly placed racist police officers were back, and the dominating "father" element seemed too serious for the overall theme of this film.
The overall feel of the movie was worse than a made for TV movie.
The overall plot line, if you can call it that, does not really lace the movie together in a tight package.
The jokes seemed forced, the plot was unoriginal, as stated prior, and the movie overall had no purpose in being released to the theaters.
Well, if this movie has done one good thing, it certainly has inspired me through its deficiency and overall suckiness (OK, not a word) to actually go read the books.
Worst, I suspect that in Part II, tonight, we're all gonna see Ged, whose little cheek scar only adds to his overall "hotness," smooching a princess (the SMALLVILLE babe).
The acting was pretty decent overall, and the story was good as well.
The trouble with its overall excellence is that one or two faults stick out like chicken bones in a tobacco wad.
I also feel that there are eventually too many characters introduced: if you left the Langrishe Theatre Group out completely it would make very little difference to the overall plot, and while Brian Cox is as good as I've ever seen him, that particular brand of scenery-chewing tends to rub off on the other actors - and it did.
"Citizen Kane" it obviously isn't, but it still manages to retain its overall fun and shock value.
overall this has been a very disappointing experience.
the movie was actually that bad.....Yes it is one of the worst movie ever it is non horror at all , should be a thriller of a low grade and never be made as horror at all .True that the plot start promising but i just lost all interest after 29 minute of hardly trying to keep my eyes open ....why you ask >>>well thats a Thai movie who tries to capture a phenomena that happen to turn it to supernatural base it is purely cultural which is OK an all but the movie have set Zero effort to place any fear There is suspense I give u that but overall the film could have been made into a much better film and in my own review i say the idea is great but the display is very very poor just give it try when u have time to kill and u are Bored so just by then knock yourself out lol
But overall it is very average!
Final Thought: Don't watch this for action, don't watch it for acting, don't watch it for creativity, only watch it cause it overall worse than any movie you've ever seen.
While the overall score is very respectable and the reviews are mostly glowing, I didn't like the film at all.
Somewhat decent movie, overall, but frustrating in it's questionnable plot devices, and overall storyline.
However, there seemed to be so much unexamined and unexplained that, in my opinion, took away from the movie overall.
I was excited to they're going to make a movie about heavy metal violence but I did not enjoy this movie at all, while it was slightly a bit enjoyable, overall I was highly dissapointed in it, I wish that they would focus more on the metal bands than the government.
It also diffuses the overall tone making the film feel muddled and unfocused.
A little more serious problem is that after its climax the film loses some steam moving towards the denouement, but overall the screenwriting sisters have produced an entertaining film that speaks with authority on its subject.
Similarly, the overall plot is also assumed to be known.
Given the talents of the cast and the overall look of the film, which (make-up effects aside) is handsomely mounted, I find it difficult to give this film less than three stars.
topless maidens, torture and violent battle scenes (some of which are pleasantly gory) but overall this film feels distinctly lifeless.
Something else now: Is Arriaga making a political statement by showing virtually all of the white Americans as defectives in one way or another while all the Latino's are benign, generous and overall, good guys?
the ending is decent but overall the movie is pretty bad.
I like dry humour, British humour, but am a fan of all of it overall.
While "Sisters" isn't necessarily boring, its restraint and overall lack of innovation doesn't make for exciting viewing.
So I usually turn to IMDb before I go see a movie and IMDb usually is on point with its overall rating for a movie.
I had only been let down once this horribly from the overall rating before on IMDb and that was with Across the Universe when it got a review of 4 out of 10, when I thought it was a work of art.
The characters, Lowe and Demi, do seem to learn something thru their experience but overall they are both shallow people.
But overall this movie is very bad.
Also, an unfaithful cameo by "Orson Welles" (played by Jodi Ashworth who does a more faithful job sounding like Ben Stiller in "Dodgeball" than he does Welles) and an overall moral ambiguity weigh down this film's potential.
The editing is, likewise, uninspired -- most of the shots linger a couple of beats too long, making the overall pace just tedious enough to lose tension.
The basic plot contains a handful of ingenious ideas and the setting boosts an overall unsettling atmosphere, but the screenplay unfolds too grotesque and the escalation of the events are far too implausible.
But overall it fails and is not enjoyable!
Sure there are some really nice moments, but overall it just shows stories of vapid people going through their meaningless existences until they finally let go from the tragedy that hit.
I found the title ironic as the overall tone of this film is bleak and full of loss, the characters pitiful and depressed.
While Shaloub and Steven Colbert segments where worth a smile, overall, this movie is NOT funny.
Snakeeater II:The Drug Buster boasts good actionscenes, and some good performances from Larry B. Scott and Ron Palillo but overall Snakeeater II:The Drug Buster is a mediocre movie.
overall, its still watchable, but unfortunately so many difficult stereotypes were confirmed that it really reflected badly on the state of dating in America
A couple of the scenes were okay, but overall they were pretty by-the-numbers and uninspiring.)
I didn't, however, mention the deliberate misuse of transporting toxic waste because it was an obvious set-up and part of the overall camp of the movie.
I won't pretend that there's no entertainment value to the movie, but it can't be taken seriously on any level and it ultimately ends up being an overall let down.
Amitabh was nice too, but the main fault of the movie, I think was the haphazard screenplay, which effected the overall quality as well as direction of the movie.
My advise watch this if you really and even really bored, but overall the film was not to my liking and I'd say to any of my friends not to bother with it, even though it's got good actors in it.
The post-apocalyptic premise is touched on here and there(..mostly through dialogue)but the overall theme comes straight from HILLS HAVE EYES.
Even though its a bit dull, the film is saved by the moronic dialog which offers plenty of unintentional laughs and the overall strangeness of the product.
Anyway overall I'll rate this movie 2/10 as it has some pretty looking girl.
The character of the police inspector provides some comical relief, with his witty remarks and arrogant behavior towards his younger colleagues, but it's just a small positive detail in an overall extremely dull and forgettable movie.
The overall atmosphere of the city is well-caught too, on the whole, and people who know Edinburgh in August will recognise it.
But overall, the characters are dull, passionless, and the tone is too cool and cynical to let any of its lowbrow humour work.
Some changes, of course, updating it to present time (story was originally set in 1942, published in 1943), expanding the story a bit -- but overall, nice work.
The overall acting is pretty mediocre, although Isaak and Pucci bring some life to their characters.
I'm not sure why this film has so many good reviews and an overall above average score, but if you thought it was terrible, your not alone.
But, overall, I feel that the movie was trying way too hard to be dramatic, artsy, and decadent and it really didn't accomplish any of it.
I am puzzled as to the overall meaning implied here.
People have compared this movie to the excellent "The Princess Bride" but as a slightly jaded and cynical viewer, I'd have to argue that "The Princess Bride" is a lot more enjoyable in every single aspect (swordfights - I weep when I even compare the two, dialogue, plot, characters, and just overall silliness) when compared to this movie.
The cast was overall mediocre and the plot would amuse those under 12 or anyone who is gullible enough to believe two guys can escape unnoticed in the night and find a canoe and THEN go across the English Channel without oars.
But overall, the sumptuousness of Tudor dress and architecture is well shown and gives the series a gorgeous look that makes us want to believe there's some attempt here at historical accuracy Â which there isn't.
The editor didn't seem to even understand the point of the movie and in a rush to just end it as the sound at FADE OUT (emblematic of the overall editing problem) just dropped as if the editor just couldn't wait to see the thing end.
This movie was an overall eye-rolling train wreck which was only made to capitalize on the laurels of the first one.
The overall execution leaves no vague on what goes wrong and how it becomes celebrated as fruits of crime are reaped and shared by even the most moral in our lives.
The ending turns the interest level back up somewhat, but not enough to salvage the overall experience.
The acting was fair, the overall plot could have used some work, and the gore should have been toned way down.
The actionscenes themselves are okay, but overall the film is worthless.
Cheesy costumes, childish lines, bad musical score, and overall a whole mess storywise.
And overall, the movie isn't very scary (even though we're lead to believe it IS by the trailer): there's a lot of unnecessary gore, and some jump scares that once it's revealed what made you jump, you get mad at the movie for startling you for nothing.
The costumes were fun and it had it's moments but overall, just a mediocre, high-strung film set in the early 80's.
These attempts are unconvincing and inconsistent with Annabelle's overall surly demeanor.
The three points I'm giving is for some really touching scenes, but overall it is below average.
Main overall complaint?
I found that overall I didn't enjoy it a whole lot.
In fact the costumes and overall quality of the movie is so low, that when we starting to watch this movie, I freaked out a little: I thought I'd mistakenly put on a porn flick.
But compared to other kids movies like spiderman, its not even close to them judging by the overall impression.
The overall movie felt home made and the kids left the room to play after 20 minutes of the most tedious 'action' Avoid this movie if at all possible - it's dull, poorly acted and you don't even want to KNOW about the 'swashbuckling sword fights'!
This scripted performance within the story was even worse than his overall performance in the main story.
Easily the worst Hammer Frankenstein (and one of Hammer's overall worst), HORROR is dull, plodding and seemingly endless.
So overall, not a particularly good film.
It made several critical mistakes and is overall, just not a movie that motivates.
My overall rating: 2.
I can't believe that it has a 6 for a rating overall.
At 108 minutes overall, the 88 minutes run in real time, the story only just stays within its welcome too.
This movie was so awful that I watched up to halfway through waiting for it to "start" - for the plot, characters, and overall tone to start making sense - before realizing it was never gonna happen.
The visuals are very blue, grey, depressing and support the overall unpleasant viewing experience.
While some of the riffs (particularly those about the long pauses in the dialogue) are very funny, overall the episode is too inconsistent to rate too highly.
The writing overall was lacking in many spots.
An excellent, not quite often seen premise and overall not that bad idea, and excellent special effects to supplement that.
Nevertheless if you decide to watch this film, it is not what you call boring and overall it is just pleasant watching Douglas and Turner getting into trouble with their unexpected friend De Vito adding a bit of fun tone in the process.
But, overall, I did enjoy the movie.
I would have liked to recommend this film because the acting is good and the story is interesting, but the disappointing way the filmmakers chose to wrap up the story puts too much of a damper on the overall enjoyment.
The prevailing theory seems to be that the kid is actually "The Redeemer" and that he's the one pulling the strings (those of you who've seen the movie will get that reference, I'm sure) behind the Priest's murder spree, but overall CLASS REUNION MASSACRE isn't coherent enough for the viewer to know for sure.
In short, the character development sucked, as did the plot and overall development-everything could have been SO much more planned out.
However, the previews didn't really say anything about the great acting, touching scenes, and great overall story and concept.
Yes, there were credibility problems with the story but overall, it was good escapist adventure.
I thought overall this movie was pretty good.
It's a cheesy and minimally plotted 80's earthbound "Alien" imitation and it's produced by Roger Corman, so that ought to give you an immediate idea about the overall quality of this production.
The overall result looks more like a graduation project than a proper production.
Occasionally the chemistry between Fox and Dance was good, especially the marriage bed scenes, but overall the direction and performance created a second Mrs. de Winter that made little sense to me.
The small budget excuses the poor cinematography and editing however it doesn't excuse the bad acting, dialog and overall horrible directing.
The film has a few fun moments, but overall it looks cheap and sloppy--like most Hercules films.
This is the perfect movie for teenagers to watch for the scare factor but overall pretty bad.
In some ways I was almost disappointed by parts of the ending of the film, but it did not really affect my overall enjoyment.
4/10 for oft mechanical writing, visual gags that never work, and overall bad acting (except for CLAYTON ROHNER: he sold his character well).
The overall effect is the same but without the hassle and expense of going out.
The overall cinematography and effects is comparable to the TV-movie work of the Pre-Battlestar Galactica Sci-Fi Channel, though the cast isn't quite as talented as the typical Sci-fi channel cast.
Even though the cast is great and the potential is obviously there, the screenplay is overall tame and uninspired.
But all this does is to add more unnecessary time to the overall product.
Sometimes it's just bad casting - Carol Kane has the ability to lower the overall quality of any film and whoever they cast as that rock star should definitely keep his day job.
So the promised action-fest is pretty boring overall.
I'm sure a lot of money was spent on this one, but overall it really wasn't money worth spent in my opinion.
"Operative" literally means secret agent, and freelance basically means someone who works for themselves, or someone who occasionally works for other people and organizations but is overall self-employed.
But as a film overall, I can't imagine how it gets such universal acclaim, especially considering its sub-AV Club technique.
AND, so it was that this 1983 TV version appears to haphazardly take elements from ALL 3 previous films, and mix them together in a jumble that, while some bits seem nicely-done, others are just HORRIBLE, and the overall product is just a jumbled, at times nearly-incoherent MESS.
Beyond that, the overall film was deplorable.
But the overall script is silly and goes way over the top!
Granted, the movie is somewhat interesting at points, overall it just was not made well.
The way the overall story progresses just isn't that interesting and often too predictable.
There is also too little happening and when there is something happening it isn't being very effective, due to its build-up and overall story.
This scripted performance within the story was even worse than his overall performance in the main story.
Available in the US in both 'R' rated & 'Unrated' cuts I will be basing my comments on the longer version although a few extra gore shots doesn't significantly alter the film overall.
OK, the camera work is good and the overall quality of the picture is good, but this film has no real point.
A coherent storyline and an overall ending point perhaps?
There isn't a semblance of a decent camera angle, all the scenes are "misty" and "firey/smokey" and really don't add well to the overall ambiance of the movie, they make it seem more like an 8th Grade production of some bad Shakespeare play no one cares about.
I don't mean the major plot point, about the mars mission, but rather an accumulation of little details that just seemed totally unrealistic even though I was able to buy the overall idea of the movie.
Of course the details is somewhat different, but overall, it is most definitely the same story.
Not the tour-de-force MacLaine's fans were probably hoping for, it does have some cute bits and pieces but suffers from a muddy production and tepid handling overall.
I certainly not saying these things didn't happen but we seem to be missing a large part of the overall picture.
I know this don't go to theaters but the quality and the overall final result is substandard even for a straight to video action flick.
Ordinarily I would have been amused by the grade school level acting and campy plot, but overall I found the film to be just too incompetent to be enjoyable.
I think this is a typical French author movie (read: pleases only its author :) where part of the audience will walk out, part will stay totally annoyed, and some will love it thinking it's of the greatest insight, overall not generating much revenue.
The concept and idea is decent but the film's overall plot is so absurd that by the end of the film, if you are still awake, you are squirming in your seat hoping none of your friends find out you watched it.
The music was poor, it didn't create suitable atmosphere for the movie in overall.
Kind of boring, overall.
Oddly, however, the acts are generally just awful and probably won't appeal overall to anyone!
So, how does this movie have an overall IMDb rating of 5.4 (as of 1/31/07)?!
I observed a BAD Humphrey Bogart recently that actually had a much higher percentage of scores of 10 than CASABLANCA--even though the overall score was still quite low.
The writers try to make up for a tired story with some snappy dialog and succeed once or twice, but overall the whole thing is just one big failure.
The sound overall was mediocre in the transmission I watched from DirecTV; it may be different on video or DVD.
But overall, if this were the first Ft13 that someone ever saw, then this 're-imagining' has left them confused as to what Jason's mother actually did and why Jason does.
Because of this, a while back I reviewed all the original Star Trek episodes (the good and the bad) because the overall ratings and reviews were just too positive.
I think they should give Chase the sheriffs' badge because he makes more headway in the investigation and fixes the overall problem.
For all of its very predictable flaws, the film's cheerful charm for the most part carries it through on a sheer sense of fun, and at only 73 minutes it doesn't overstay its welcome, overall making The Giant Gila Monster easily worth a watch for any who get a kick out of classic monster B-movies.
I guess if you are drunk or high on some heavy drugs, it might have some redeeming value, but overall, oh my god!
Paltrow was broody, cold, and overall not a very likeable woman.
as for the overall picture, the script is tedius, and the scenes are very, very long.
Some of the stories were published previously, and Bradbury included them in an overall book.
i really enjoyed the original Tremors.it worked on a lot of levels.unfortunately,this sequel doesn't.it seems to be mostly played for camp value,but i don't think it works very well.i found it very mostly very slow and boring.there were a few almost amusing moments,but overall,it was a disappointment.Kevin Bacon passed on this one,and it's easy to see why.he must have read the script.Fred Ward is back,but without Bacon,he his character just doesn't work as well.Michael Gross returns,and doesn't have much too do.also,i thought the dialogue was pretty cringe worthy at times.plus,the movie isn't really original.in fact it borrows heavily from another big movie that had come out a few years ago.i've seen worse movies,but this one still ranks as a major disappointment.for me,Tremors 2 is a 4/10.
As most Disney films, it all works itself out in the end but the movie overall doesn't deliver the kind of craftsmanship in the story that usually keeps us interested in a Disney movie.
The whole thing is just stupid overall.
The ending is an intriguing surprise and worth waiting for, and the film is overall a good entry in its series and a respectable addition to the canon of werewolf films.
overall together with the first one my favorite part, i mean normally i'm not a fan of little girls in movies, and i hate it most if the director wants to force you into still liking her after she killed humanity or some sort of that, like the children in 28 Weeks later who have just wiped out our world and humanity, hated them right from the beginning, while i even liked Ghost after we learned about her, i mean it's quite a feat playing at the end a little murder girl and still appearing genuinely innocent, but i think it's the way her illness makes her into believing what she does.
overall a great horror movie, with just enough suspense and gore to never get into the way of the story, at the beginning i thought, not a movie like Halloween 2 (great movie)again, were they just systematically wipe out some sort of hospital, but then she escapes and the story goes on and on, just good old story-telling like it should be.
The fiery Hispanics (usually with tattoos or in gangs)  While this may be harmless entertainment for some, this has been overall perpetrating stereotypes.
Several funny lines cannot compensate for an ugly look and an overall lack of interest in these characters.
the story contains plot holes you could run a tunnel through - and i'll generally overlook holes in a plot if the overall thing does it for me; and i just experienced an incredible letdown the second time i saw it.
It starts on well,have some very spectacular visuals of Africa,but it disintegrates,disorients thereafter.Its very good example how you neglect most vital part(rather say it soul)of movie that is SCRIPT and ends up most boring movie ever made.Storyline simple,leave it nothing to say more about it.I usually watch horror flick for special effect ,but it is not the case here.It seems director avoids such situation where special effect needed,if its there though very few which looks really primitive as compared to other Hollywood movies.I think it could have been better,overall its bad in all aspects except photography.
Some of the atmosphere is very depressive and moody and really lends to the overall feel, but I don't think any single scene really steps out and defines this film visually.
The movie itself gets a 0 out of 10, but because of the gore and good f/x I'm giving it an overall 2/10.
The overall narrative isn't bad.
Far Cry is overall an average FPS game with bad story and terrible voice acting, annoying game play and after a few hours it become boring and predictable.
The murders are extremely gross, graphic and relentless, so undemanding horror fanatics overall have few things to complain about.
The acting is pretty weak overall.
Where there are indeed many parts of the story that border on funny and is sometimes even thought-provoking, the overall feel of this movie is as arid as the Outback.
While this movie may be faithful to its source material, it's overall a dreary, melodramatic bore for most of its running time.
Moore does try as Hester Prynne but ultimately the role proves fairly plain, simple and unmemorable overall.
Some of the performances (especially I thought that of Hardie Albright as Dimmesdale, with the exception of that closing scene) seemed a bit forced, although I appreciated the attempt to mix some humour into a movie that could have been very heavy, as Alan Hale and William Kent portray the attempts of Hockings to help Goodfellow court the widow Crakstone, although in some ways (again, I haven't read the novel) that seemed unconnected to the overall story.
In terms of the overall quality of the movie compared to others of the era, I find the 1930's a strange decade.
But overall, this is a film that even the biggest bad movie buff should be leery of approaching.
The main story is a small dog dealing with two kids, the kids' parents, and their overall household.
2) Although this film is truer to the original novel, it is not faithful and makes considerable changes that alter the overall intent of the story.
In sum, if you share the liberal political philosophies of Michael Moore, you will enjoy the America bashing, and overall enjoy the movie more than others.
The jokes are, for the most part, far stretched, based on "anti-American" cliches and lacking in subtlety that would make them more useful for the overall plot.
The wastelands, Paradise Valley & Southern Cross City all look very convincing considering the budget as do the costumes & the overall look of Fist of the North Star.
The concept of a serial killer with supernatural powers who desperately attempts to transfer his murderous spirit into a new body after his own execution is dreadfully unoriginal and already featured (more or less) in at least four movies, namely Wes Craven's "Shocker", the atrocious third entry in the "House" series, the criminally underrated film "Prison" and the overall lamentable film "The Chair".
overall, this film should be renamed and it would be very successful:  "How Not To Make A Drama/Adventure Film: Exhibit Vol.
The score by the usually-reliable Pino Donaggio is undistinguished and unmemorable, which is indicative of the film overall.
The alternate title for this film is "The Veil" and granted, that ALSO has nothing to do with the movie, i think overall it's a better title than HAUNTS.
The acting was overall OK, though sometimes Kinnear makes you raise an eyebrow.
I really wanted to like this movie but half way through the movie i stopped trying to find good points in the movie mainly because there weren't many so overall it's a disappointing movie and i wouldn't recommend anybody to watch it.
The concept and the overall presentation though, is entertaining.
My overall view of this movie is that it should definitely be avoided at all costs.
Actually, I thought the werewolf makeup and overall film quality was not bad, and the acting from a little known group of actors was overall pretty decent with a couple of exceptions.
I say great acting, great writing(in most cases) and overall a great show buy this on DVD if you can find it it's cheap and definitely worth every cent.
I guess overall, this was too silly for my tastes.
As of right now, this movie is only marginally below Ghostbusters 2 in its overall score.
So while there is one or two original things here, the overall feeling, for me was "boring"!
Some stunt work (especially the skydiving scene and helicopters) are pretty good, but the overall film is too bloody serious to even be fun, hence it's often tedious.
The start was bad....the ending was bad and overall it was a huge kick in the nuts.
The film has an overall tone that is way way way too serious for a comedy--a clear indication of an amateur comedy-director.
That aside, Marge and Gower Champion are superb in this film, and Red Skelton with some help from Zsa Zsa Gabor adds several funny sketches to the overall production.
The only thing I can say that was good was the scenery was nice and the overall feel of the time.
What an awful shame ... with a cast like this and and a basically sound overall plot this movie should be a good watch, but this movie fails to hit the mark - it's films like this that put a downer on the British film industry.
The 1873 story is supposed to symbolize the modern day story but the flashbacks do not flow with the modern day story and overall don't work.
The acting is pretty good, but in comparison with the overall story, makes a very funny reaction (I found it more a comedy than a drama).
A bad movie overall.
Her features are distinctly different from that of Huston's and her overall looks are too perfect to really make Morticia come alive.
I was vaguely entertained by the gore but overall this movie's idea was the fault.
The overall movie is not really that great, but the nude scenes with Rochelle Swanson, in fact any scenes with her in are watchable.
Anderson is a good cop and overall a good guy.
In the second half of the film, there's a bit of gore and witty one-liners, but it's too late to improve the overall quality.
The film has an OK pace, there are one or two half decent scenes but the character's & dialogue are poor & overall it's very predictable.
Honestly he was horrible at being a mean cop and it was overall just annoying.
Some movies are fun to watch despite their overall poor quality.. but not this one.
On a technical level House II: The Second story is fine, editing, photography, music & overall production values are adequate.
Now I admit that the acting was a bit shoddy, but I believe that overall it wasn't that bad for a no-name cast.
The plant continues to eat people that Henry brings her & that's just about the entire plot of Please Don't Eat My Mother apart from the various sex scenes edited between the female talking plant eating things which have absolutely nothing to do with the overall story in the slightest.
I think this is the main reason why this movie leaves an overall pointless impression.
But overall, the movie is just a weak, clichÃ©d filled, amateurish movie that delivers no scares, unless the cheap loud sound effect trick was used.
The overall atmosphere in the movie is fairly O.K.
The film is very earnest in it's portrayal of the gun problem in the US, but overall it is pretty forgettable.
In the final analysis, this was a project perhaps too ambitious for Almereyda at this point in time; knowing what `happens' in the story is not the same as knowing what it's `about,' and in some of the choices the director makes, it's obvious that the `essence' of the play has simply eluded him, much to the detriment of the overall film.
Ethan Hawke has his moments as Hamlet, but overall puts nothing into the role.
I seriously don't think that this movie deserves an overall rating of 8/10 (average), compared to the movie which in terms of storyline and theory it would have been going for in my opinion, the Butterfly Effect.
An overall good attempt at making a film, it just needed some work to the script and to the directing in parts.
The movie lacks scares, tension, mystery and an overall good pace.
This is one of Jean-Claude's lesser efforts, it lacks the overall excitement of Bloodsport and Kickboxer as well as the visceral enjoyment provided by his later movies like Universal Soldier and Hard Target.
It has some redeeming qualities but overall it remains nothing more than a bad, silly, '80's B-monster flick.
It's got some moments, but overall it drags.
I even scoffed at the IMDb overall rating for this movie.
Satellite ran this stinker late last night and, what seemed on the surface an interesting premise was lost quickly in the poor writing, stiff and otherwise horrible acting, mute extras, and overall lack of direction.
But overall this is definitely a film to avoid.
Grizzly rage is the sort of Sci-Fi Channel 'Creature Feature' that typifies everything bad about the genre, this is just awful in every regard really & the overall negative comments from people here on the IMDb are wholly justified here.
The atmosphere of "Schoolgirls in Chains" is overall sleazy and brute, but the screenplay lacks suspense and suffers from too many dull moments.
To top it all off the film had really unbearable songs to add to it so overall it is a very bad cartoon.
But surely they could afford a much higher budget and overall better actors (With the exception of Lou Gosset Jr and a few others - indeed the fact that they can keep a straight and serious demeanor through out the film shows that those few actors really are outstanding in their craft) but I suspect this film is aimed to appeal to the truly stupid people.
Other than that fun bit of trivia, the rest of the movie contains unnerving landscapes that look like something Dr. Suess would draw if he was on LSD, ridiculous costumes, dull fight scenes, creepy characters, and the overall feel of a fever dream.
Now the overall idea of a working woman who has trouble balancing her high-paying job with marriage is very good, the execution looks like it needed an editing--with some dopey performances and logical errors that should have been cleaned up before filming began.
In they end they tried to attach all three and not surprisingly the result is a poorly paced and confused affair lacking coherence and overall good direction.
But, overall, you still leave the movie feeling somewhat bemused, let down, and on the whole, dissatisfied with it.
However, they're lost in the lack of story exposition, characters without motivation, and overall length of the film.
To be fair, the overall mood and feeling (Paris as the humid, drizzly, polluted wintery-cold nightmare) is well captured.
I watch a lot of European and asian movies, because i think overall they take more time to develop the story and do not simply hang on to Syd Fields' 3-act formula.
On the basis of the lackluster story, and other elements that don't do much to elevate the film, I rate it lackluster (4) overall.
Her first major role, doing all of her own stunts and overall just doing a phenomenal job.
Well, perhaps all this is just due to the weak overall quality of the movie.
The predictable outcome took way long to get into it and overall it was kind of a disappointment and rather overwrought.
Its uncompromising to be sure and often looks terrific, but is overall really boring.
The overall sound managed to be muddy but was nevertheless so shrill and tinny that I was afraid it might make the neighborhood dogs start to howl.
However overall, a disappointing storyline with few engaging characters and a poorly cast lead sinks this film for me.
The acting was overall okay, but what really sucked for me was the storyline, directing/editing and the ability to keep me entertained.
The supposed budget of about $2,100,000 doesn't sound too bad actually so it's a surprise that overall the film is rather flat, bland & forgettable.
It is very unattractive visually, and the film has dated very, very poorly in terms of its overall look.
After renting this out of curiosity, and overall, wasting a very long 90 minutes out of my life, I feel like I need to comment on this.
Theresa Russell is capable of far better work and she did an OK job given the poor story but overall it wasn't that great.
Still, it is not a mindless shoot em up which most sci-fi movies are these days, so overall I enjoyed it.
However, I must admit that She Hate Me was a disappointment - yeah, the topics are very hot and relevant, the execution is beautiful, but the film somehow lacks a coherent overall line, perhaps its due to the fact that the film tries to connect and mix too many things (whistleblowers, lesbians, love, African Americans), the bottom line is just not clear and none of the topics are dealt with in detail in this film.
The really sad thing about She Hate Me is that it isn't even not very good for a Spike Lee film, this is just a bad movie overall.
overall, it has a good premise, i mean who doesn't love shows about sexy vampires and forbidden romance?
My overall impression: this movie is as mediocre as it gets; just how so depends on your age group.
This movie is basically similar to George Lucas, Star Wars Episode I, in which actors, and actress are cardboard character, language are somewhat unnatural, but in addition is the problem of poor editing, long sequences of movies at points where it doesn't seem to contribute to the overall story.
If any directors want to have a good movie despite his bad editing, Kubrick's movie was a bit long, not well edited in many scenes, he still won the day because his premise for the story was strong and plot elements were there to prove his premise, which buildup to a strong message or a theme of the overall masterpiece, which we can sum up in few words, such as in Dr. Strangelove, that an accidental holocaust can happen.
After enjoying the freshness of the original Pusher, then Bleeder was alright film overall; although it was hailed as a big advertising flop here in Denmark.
As for the movie itself, it does have a good performance by Watts and overall the acting is good.
It's impossible for me to find a rating that reflects the overall quality of the show.
Is "Die Hard" one of the best overall movies ever made?
The overall sound managed to be muddy but was nevertheless so shrill and tinny that I was afraid it might make the neighborhood dogs start to howl.
Gemini is somewhat confusing, but overall it is a haunting film that actually generates fear and a deeper feeling of uneasiness.
I wanted to love Vacation, I truly did.Seeing as how everyone thought it was a magnificent movie, I wanted to think it was a magnificent movie as well, but instead it turned out that I thought Vacation is pure crap.Nothing was funny.I laughed at maybe one thing.Also, it couldn't keep my interest, and it was "REALLY" boring.I was pausing the movie continuously, because I wanted to get up and do something, for I was about to fall asleep.The acting was good, and the script is somewhat original, but there was a lot of unnecessary material as well, and overall I found this to be a pretty terrible movie.Don't waste your time on it.
There were a few chuckles, but overall it was mostly me groaning.
Much of the fault for it being such a poor film are the result of poor writing (with a WAY over-complicated murder scheme), an annoying and clichÃ©d character (Lola Lane playing a very stereotypical "pushy female reporter") and an overall lack of energy.
Assorted bad guys are too clean, the same locations are used for different parts of the plot, and overall it looks like it was thrown together in a wet weekend.
You may get some laughs, but overall, this movie is not good.
I thought the direction was OK, nice use of black and white, some OK shots and an overall suitable feel, and the soundtrack worked as well, a bit repetitive but it sorta suited the film.
To add insult to injury, the choice in cinematography gives the show a camcorder look at times, thus cheapening the overall experience.
The overall most important element of the TV series was the plot - the heist, the robbery, the fraud, the trickery, the whatever...
Aiming to be a "metaphoric" spy movie about the evils of secrecy and the wounds of childhood, the film fails for having plot devices instead of characters and a sloppy, unconvincing direction, resulting in an overall bore.
Was a big question in my mind now even Rishi Kapoor feels the same in AALC which is very bad  I mean please the superficial way of showing America puts people off and in today's overseas audiences dominating times this isn't good  The first half moves in different lanes and the love triangle is done to death  and the second half gets better a bit Akshaye's realization is well handled and then the film ends well but the sudden change of the other son is too much  They are many problems in the film like the first half which moves in different lanes and not proper treatment is given to most of it  Rishi Kapoor directs some dramatic scenes well but he needs to improve his storytelling, overall a decent debut by one of the finest actors as a director Music is okay  Akshaye Khanna shines in his role, He was always a good actor but signed bad films those days Barring his receding hairstyle he leaves a huge impact as an actor Aishwarya is plastic as ever Rajesh Khanna is okay Kader Khan and Jaspal Bhati are good Satish Kaushik is funny Paresh Rawal is good
This overall was a pointless,loss of direction,VERY boring movie with your basic stereotypes that just confirms that the movie biz is on a decline with great stories and creativity.
The film doesn't have a sufficient overall arc or thru line and the result is a jumpy and disjointed narrative.
As one of the key (albeit tenuous) conflicts in the film is the balance between Hart's romance with Susan and his pursuit of good grades at Harvard Law School, the lack of effort put into the former does serious damage to the overall impact of the film.
The Movie, overall, was just awful.
In my opinion the movie overall was just kind of embarrassingly bad.
But overall I gave Contagion a rating of 4.
I think if you didn't live the decade, you might not have a sense of what the movie is about, the overall picture is a bit dim.
I'll just say that it was pretty bad overall - bad delivery, and they were completely unbelievable.
The movie overall was well acted but there was very little a solid acting performance could do so save the weak plot.
There are lots of good acting, but the story and the overall atmosphere is so brain dead that I couldn't really enjoy the acting.
So overall very gay, I was honestly hoping that after the gay beginning it would start to redeem itself, and it did... but then it came back with heaps of gay that just plain ruined it.
This ending loses a point from the overall score.
A rare bit of wit in the script raises the score but overall a snoozer.
The final sequence ("the Oswald Awards") makes the most sense, but overall this was just a bad idea.
I count this as the worst sequel ever in one of the best series ever.Previous rocky movies dealt with a lot of hardship but had a great overall positive and motivating feeling.Then this farce of a film comes along.Its the worst start ever for a movie.Hey Rocky you're brain damaged and oh yeah you lost ALL your money.Somehow.There's no decent fight in the whole movie that scrap at the end is nothing better than the one at the chipper last night..How long does it take to fly to Russia??
Even so I had to depend on the execution of this to come away satisfied overall.
The acting here is good overall, nice cinematography all around, but what absolutely kills 'The Interpreter' is the script.
The thing that keeps you interested in the movie is how cute the actors are... overall, a forced, boring movie where you get to see the exploitation of two cute/good actors' genitals for five seconds.
The gore and bloodshed is shocking, indeed, but you can't possibly neglect the many moments of boredom and the overall execution of "Cyclone" is downright tasteless and sick.
The idea of people being forced into cannibalism is interesting; but the characters are boring and the overall atmosphere is far too impressive for the film to be enjoyable at the same time.
While it has its moments of weirdness, overall it is neither as sleazy as Tintorera nor as bizarre as The Treasure of the Amazon.
The disappointing part is that the movie had potential because of the acting of the mother and father and the overall story was a good one.
I was just disappointed in the overall execution and script.
The movie employs disaster flick favorites ranging from drought and famine to social discord and disease in painting a picture of overall chaos in the America of 2017.
There are several more instances like this, which contribute overall to an extremely simplified picture of America as divided along meaningful partisan lines.
On the opposite side, they pay an unusually large amount of attention to Evelyn Nesbit's story, which is only a minor thread to the overall plot.
Sure the movie overall is a failure, but it should certainly be seen as a concept that could spark a series of newfound home video comedy.
What made the movie bad wasn't its juvenile sense of humor, but rather the lack of overall jokes.
If incomprehensible wire-fu wuxia is your thing and you love films such as 'New Dragon Inn' and 'Swordsman', then you'll probably love this film, but as much as I appreciated the silliness of the whole thing, I just didn't find it that enjoyable overall.
while at times the scene is funny, overall it's pretty drawn out and boring and the big 'reveal' at the end isn't all that funny and is basically a cop out to end the scene.
"The Grand" is funny in parts, but overall there are three unfunny minutes for every funny minute.
I choose this film as one of the greatest films I have ever seen overall under Platoon, Three Kings, The Shawshank Redemption, and Life is Beautiful.
What makes Nukie so brutally awful is hard to pinpoint, but the main issues seem to be in the characters, and the overall pace of the movie.
BUT I have to say that cameos raise the overall value: Vinnie Jones is simply a genius, as always, and Rade Sebredja (or however it's supposed to be written, hope you will excuse me) shines briefly and brightly.
Towards the end, you find that the overall story was after all quite weak.
"Hollhole" is a crazy, incompetent and overall ridiculous film.
Performances are mostly fairly good, but Darren McGavin painfully over-acts most of his scenes and the number of hypertensive yelling and fist pounding scenes by the entire cast really detracts from the overall experience in a big way.
Yes, perhaps there is some interesting psychological commentary in the movie, but overall it is bizarre, unrewarding, and with no sense of closure.
The use of digital video, cut with even grainier digital video makes for a creepy look, and the sound work is a constant video hum which increases the paranoia and overall strange feeling.
Jess Franco seemed to enjoy making them, however, as this trash makes up a large proportion of his filmography; and women in prison flicks are probably one of the main reasons why a lot of people's overall impression of the prolific director is not good.
But overall i just a a brief summary of this film.
The special FX were hit and miss but overall OK for a small budget picture.
Though the rating of a movie to simply overall 1 to 10 can be difficult, and I am still on the fence of how much I like it (having just seen it, and would like to come back to it a few weeks from now).
I give Rob-B-Hood two more stars one for the lovely baby(he may be the most vivid character in this movie), one for the respectable dedication by Jackie(the overall failure should not be blamed on him).
This is a haunting movie with a really nice, twisted plot, a lot of suspense (especially in the first part of the movie), overall decent acting (I thought the character of Anna and the guy waiting for a heart transplantation were done especially well), but rather uninspired music (although the sound effects are nicely done).
It has the overall feel of a rejected Sci-Fi Channel Original.
Having revisited POLTERGEIST just recently, I was startled watching this sequel in just how far it deteriorates in overall quality from one film to the next.
Poltergeist managed to be funny, scary, dramatic, and overall entertaining - all at once.
Some problems that the film faced are that there are too much dwelling on what happened in the first film, the film's pace is quite slow, rather humourless, some rather meaningless scenes, a lot of talking that has no real interest and overall it's rather a pointless sequel with no meaning to the narrative when it finally finishes.
One of the biggest overall problems with the film, however, is pacing.
The overall impression of this version of Crime and Punishment is much more different than what I saw in my mind while reading the book.
Even if there are the film overall is an absolute beauty.
There are some good parts to this movie but overall it is very boring and slow.
Some of the writing acting and directing is done quite well but overall the movie just lacks something.
The acting is overall terrible (the middle-aged lady in the bar and the bartender are the 2 exceptions).
Why three 4 for Devgan's acting + 2 for Neha Dhupia's body + 1 riya sen's exposure + 2 overall things - 6 for Sanjay Kapoor and Arbaaz khan  
The same goes for the the overall feel of the movie.
I felt like I was watching some sort of corporate training video: same overall quality...same overall message.
No - several were well worth watching - but overall, the experience was dispiriting.
There were too many things that Roshan tried to incorporate in the movie and overall it just didn't work.
overall, this "HORROR" movie which would have trouble scaring a two year old is not worth paying the five dollars to rent it out.
The parts are most often overacted, though Susan Hayward's performed well overall.
They would've had a lot less material overall and only could've done about 2-3 seasons rather than eight series, like the BBC version.
As for this version, I will give it an overall rating of 2/10, mainly for the idea.
So overall it is a very bad movie, but if you persist to have your own opinion about it, don't read further because from here on i will give some SPOILERS.
The writing is uninspired almost as much as the direction is, this is what causes the overall production to suffer.
It feels like a sonambulistic exercise, intent on putting us to sleep, and it has an overall lackadaisical feel that really irks the viewer.
There was promise in adding to Lemmon's original 'George' portrayal, but Martin does nothing to improve on the other actors previous comedic timings, and overall portrayal of a neurotic businessman bent on getting every Manhattanite's name down so that he can later sue them for whatever inconvenience he (or his wife) has been subjected to.
Now, the term anti-hero is one that springs to mind here but I'm not going to apply it to Katrina because she (as does the film overall) doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as the term.
The film is misjudged in its overall delivery and presentation of its ideas; a fun, fast and frenetic series of scenes that revolve around trench-coat wearing hermits being told to kill people on the promise of an easy lay from someone we're supposed to be gunning for.
But overall, the characters are dull, passionless, and the tone is too cool and cynical to let any of its lowbrow humour work.
The script contains one or two creative ideas, but "Curfew" is overall tedious and without suspense.
It's evidently cheaply made and pretty bad overall but, I guess, harmless enough; still, virtually the only thing of interest here is the film's comic-strip look, complete with captioned descriptions during transitions.
As a history major, I was hoping for an alternative approach to Augustus than HBO's Rome, which, I feel, failed to capture his overall "feel" quite as well as they did Caesar or Antony.
The overall film is wretched--far worse than any other Wheeler & Woolsey film I have seen (I've seen about 12-15).
As for the quality of the film overall, this isn't a particularly bad film for the first half and it does have an interesting plot twist (Dracula finding love).
Not one joke in the film worked, and even if it was a mediocre one (which is the best they had), it still was terrible because of Matthew Perry's awful timing and the overall bad acting.
Which is to say it's a really bad flick overall.
Yet an overall goofiness survives throughout.
", which might not be for everyone, but it contributes to the overall style of the film (in my opinion, at least).
(I make a special exception for Alien3 [WARNING: SPOILERS of series-spoiling elements in Alien3 & 4 FOLLOW], which, though not bad overall, will forever be my choice for worst movie because of the GLARING PLOT HOLE and contrived, character-killing plot devices at the start of the movie that COMPLETELY DISREGARD the plot, characters, and story lines that Cameron et al.
Although I had nothing to do with the project and only had the pleasure of meeting J.P. once, I absolutely loved the story, liked the characters, and was very impressed with the overall quality and attention to detail.
The camera angles and overall cinematography were horrible.
overall, this is the worst movie i have ever seen and a complete disgrace to horror films, if your going to make a horror film, do it right.
The plot was not terrible overall though it actually showed some potential but it wasn't without flaw.
It wasn't a great movie, but it was enjoyable with its action scenes and overall design which included some fun on screen deaths and gore.
This obscure Universal "B" horror flick is also included in that yet-to-be released Box Set I mentioned in my review of HOUSE OF HORRORS (1946) above and, unfortunately, while I would certainly say that this one is more readily enjoyable, my verdict overall is equally lukewarm.
In the second part, we get some cursory mention of the two survivors and some theorizing as to why they may still be alive... but then they're simply forgotten and don't even figure in the overall plot.
A good premise and a great start but overall, a disappointing animated short.
It had the overall quality of a 70's porn film without the skin and sex, which is even more pathetic that a 70's porn film with the skin and sex.
So overall, it's probably one to skip since even with the missing chunk in place (which it isn't), it's still not a great movie by any stretch.
Iron Eagle II was as ridiculous as it's predecessor however the edge of the first one and the overall amusing teenage vengeance angle is in favor dropped in favor of your basic military mission that for the most part is watchable if not too interesting.
overall rating: four out of ten possible stars.
But the acting awards overall have to go to Angus Scrimm as The Tall Man.
I would endeavor to guess that the main actors in this movie donated their time and talents gratis, because I cannot imagine anyone paying for the services of professional actors just to let their talents languish in the doldrums of obscurity, drivel and overall bad acting.
so now its time to overall this film.
story 3/10  scenes 3/10  special effects 6/10  fight scenes 4/10  character development 4/10  brilliance 3/10  overall 3.5/10
Sure, they are still portrayed by men in suits, and those suits are still maintained by the Henson workshop, but the overall tone of the turtles' skin and the motion of their mouths indicates that Golden Harvest told the Henson workshop that they just wanted something passable.
I think it's good that this film does leave some loose ends, because it goes along with the movie's overall feel.
The acting was pretty weak overall, but the material was thin.
Ghost lake is a pretty bad film overall, it has virtually no horror elements, the various twists are dull & just don't work out in any sort of satisfying way & the artwork on the box really is very misleading.
The overall feel of the film was that it had been made by a 7 year old.
It's sorta "so good because it's so bad" because of its bad fashion sense and the overall look of it but the actors are so boring and lifeless that XANADU doesn't fall into the quotable campy "bad" films.
It's one of the highpoints of the entire series, yet still can't avoid being disappointing by the overall poor quality of the production.
I expected this movie to be kind of hackneyed to begin with, but the overall package of "Down to You" was beyond my worst expectations.
There are little glimmers of hope here and there, but overall this is garbage.
But overall, it's really not worth anybody's time.
The overall lighting gave you the feeling that someone was just walking around with a light bulb.
Hurcules in New York, 1970 2/10, Worst movie of 1970, Second worst of the 1970's, 1214th overall  I didn't actually see this movie recently.
But overall this movie was abysmal, and was just one step below "Private Resort", simply because Private Resort had Johnny Depp (who went on to do great things), I'm afraid this cant be said for this movie.
Performance: The performance of the actors was overall good.
It's just a weak and pointless flick, overall...
The film's other interesting performance come from Guy Pearce, whose American accent is frequently preposterous, but unlike LA Confidential (where Pearce gave a fuller overall performance), the accent remains mostly consistant throughout.
The overall acting is about as wooden as a lump of driftwood.
The film was started post HAHK(even the title was HUM AAPKE HAI SANAM that time) and it took 8 years to complete  When the promo was shown i was shocked considering SRK and Salman haven't shared screenspace since KARAN ARJUN and suddenly a film with them and Madz comes   The movie is regressive, outdated and could be better in 90's  The back story of Madz- Salman is so cringeworthy even there is too much sermonising  But there is one plus point and that is SRK in this film, well normally he overdoes his scenes here he is in full control and plays his role with a straight face and brings a lot of fun in the movie  Sadly the film never manages to sustain the tempo and we have tripe like GALE MEIN LAAL TIE.etc  Also it's funny to see the appearances of actors Salman suddenly in 1 scene looks straight out of JUDWAA days with his medium sized hair and with his overacting but lively acting and then he comes to 2001 days where he looks dead The dubbing too is inconsistent and also his acting which goes from amateurish and then to dead acting SRK too suddenly has short hair, long hair and also his looks keep changing and so his dubbing and acting Madz too, in 1 scene she has brown hair and then the ponytailed black hair look  The film also has the late Laxmikant Berde who wasn't much seen in 2002 Also we see Atul Agnihotri who was rejected post 1998 i feel and was just seen as an extra   Direction by KS Abdiyamaan is outdated though good in parts Music is okay, most songs sound old Cinematography is inconsistent  Acting SRK though looks inconsistent yet he delivers a wonderful performance and rarely hams which is a relief Madz is as usual, she does a good job but her role is too regressive Salman khan is inconsistent, at times lively and at times dead below average overall Laxmikant Berde is okay Alok Nath is okay in a small role Atul Agnihotri is a reject and he annoys
Thirdly, the overall characterisation is pitiful.
The overall silliness of it shows up strongly that your hoping it would break out the madness, but it hardly eventuates.
Though a few stretches of the story drag slightly, the overall effect of this film is true-to-life charm.
There are a couple of bright spots - Bernard's encounter with a skeletal space-pilot and the 'Close Encounters' spoof where Andre Marianne's French scientist tries to communicate with the aliens by playing 'The Entertainer' on a Wurlitzer but overall the film has little to recommend it.
The gadgets are pitiful, the script is shocking and the overall production makes even the regular sci-fi series look like they spent a mint on them in comparison.
Although it has to be said, this is my favourite part of the film, I still cannot see its relevance in the overall storyline.
Do not believe the reviewers who write that this is "overall, not a bad film."
Poor visual effects and the inexplicable fact that Keitel's voice was dubbed by a British actor add to the movie's overall cheesiness.
The imaginative set pieces and overall design are vividly detailed that you could see where most of the money gone too.
The overall effect of "The Zombie Diaries" is forgettable.
Supporting cast is good, performance more even, overall better than average, but the script and plot are both a little weak.
From the first few minutes the film is just annoying to watch, there are some fine actors but the overall optimistic & downright annoying feeling simply makes the film unwatchable.
Then there's Dr. Carlo Rambaldi, a hypnotist and overall oily guy, who threatens Brack, from This Island Earth, and hypnotizes a beautiful young woman.
The story is somehow intelligent and has a lot of clever twists and turns but, on screen, it has some failures and basically in the overall acting zone.
It also takes a while to explain what exactly is going on, but overall it was enjoyable enough.
The movie has some scary moments and some silly moments, the monster in a flannel shirt comes to mind, but overall it is good fun on a rainy night.
If your movie really has been funded by Bollywood gangsters and not some outside ENTITY TO WHOM YOU MUST NOD TO in the movie, in those tiring obvious ways then make the overall movie more down to earth, and not have the cadets take their national oath to the nation in English........
Because ultimately given the overall geostrategy of the region, with whats going on in Afghanistan, you are not helping India and the people of South Asia with such cheap movies.
But as you watch, you keep shaking your head at the overall quality and cheesiness of the whole affair.
The special effects weren't terrible and there a few well pulled off moments (like the jittery ghost doctors), but overall it didn't enhance or cook up much of a lasting atmosphere when they finally pile it on far too much.
My overall rating of this movie is lower than "Scream 1+2" and "I know what you did last summer" (and believe me, they rated really low!
The overall effect was a movie worthy of a showing on Mystery Science Theater 3000.
The flaw in the film is the script, which tends toward a certain clinical, slightly artificial awkwardness from time to time, and although the film offers many interesting visual metaphors, it ties them so loosely to the overall story that it is often difficult to know to what these metaphors refer.
The little boy, Josh Flitter, does an excellent job as the annoyingly forthright "minister in training", as do the other children playing minor roles, but the overall attempt was bland.
The movie has some decent flight patterns from the different type of planes, but the overall part is so horrible that not even the actual air strikes within the movie could wake the crowd up.
I had some issues with what I felt were this movie's attempts at achieving emotional extremes through completely unrealistic portrayals of high school students, but overall I felt that the movie's many engaging elements outweigh those negatives.
but like I said, overall a great movie.
Second, the the entire movie overall seemed to be going nowhere.
After "Saving Private Ryan", which had left an overall good impression, I hoped that this Hollywood product would turn out to be on the same level.
Kruschev was Political Commissar at the Front level and was involved in the overall planning of the defensive battle and the encirclement of the German 6th army at Stalingrad.
There is no sense of the battle in the film either at the unit level or overall.
In any case, this is not overall a very bad short.
There were some really nicely directed tracking shots and overall stable, camera work.
In fact, the photography is bad overall.
Hedorah is not that good of a monster, Godzilla Flies, and overall this is one that I really do not recommend.
Yes, there were a few good bits in "Wonder Man" and the special effects were very good for that time (deserving of the Oscar they received), but the overall film just seemed so sub-par to all of us.
For my money, "The Court Jester" was Danny's best and funniest movie --a great script with excellent pacing, well-designed and executed set pieces, hilarious situations and songs, and just a great and satisfying storyline overall.
Despite this cool start, I also immediately realized that because it was made by a so-called "Poverty Row" studio, that the budget and overall quality would be suspect.
First, the overall visual "bleakness" of the series.
"Member of the Wedding" has a very respectable overall score of 7.7 and the acting of Julie Harris was nominated for an Oscar.
In contrast to that, one could say the sparseness of the production contributes to the overall detachment, the girl being alone at the farmhouse with the 3 killers.
The gore is minimal, the acting is nonexistent, and it is an overall forgettable movie.
The closest thing to Friedel's film that I can imagine is Marc Lawrence's ultra rare Daddy's Deadly Darling aka Pigs (1972) which has equally menacing rural milieu, dark and deadly farm houses and overall feel of unexplained psychosis.
Nevertheless this is a film with good production values, not always completely believable, but overall solid.
Needless to say, the plot doesn't really go anywhere and the overall effect is really rather dull.
The reason for that, is because I think that often the reviews for most movies on this page are pretty fair to the overall score of the movie.
plot - bad, screenplay - really bad, acting - contender for all Razzie Awards...overall i'd like to give it 0 out of 10 stars.
Some of the issues discussed are the acting talents, or lack thereof, of certain cast members, and some were kind of dry and others overdone, but overall, the entire cast was right on the money.
There's the occasional laughable B movie dialogue which lifts the film, but the overall grimness of the film makes it hard to watch and stomach.
I saw the movie as well and i thought it was mildly entertaining although i have to agree that it was overall a bad attempt to milk the TV series.
But overall I felt I had wasted my time.
The acting was OK, I suppose, but frankly the overall wasn't my cup of tea.
Technically Sorority House Massacre actually isn't too bad & could even be described as being quite well made, it's just a shame the film overall sucks so bad.
It was overall quite novel, but it suffered from a couple of draw backs.
But overall this film has it moments but that does not change everything like I said there was NO DOUBT that this film is boring dull confusing and delivers no energy.
Even though the movie picks up a pace at the ending, the overall lousy acting by ALL actors doesn't help the semi-interesting what-if story make an interesting movie.
The overall feeling though was not one of hatred...this is just an overplotted mess, with moderate entertainment value throughout.
While there are adult characters in the film (most notably the coach, who is himself awkward and hardly authoritative), and while we meet Gregory's dad briefly, they come off as backdrop, and the overall impression is that this is like a live-action, Scottish, adolescent version of Charles Schulz's 'Peanuts' movies, where kids run about on their own seemingly at whim after school, but aren't necessarily concerned with being full of destructive mischief given that freedom.
While there might have been a couple tiny bits that left a bad taste in my mouth, overall I thought it was great.
There were great expectations for a team with three superstars but they never jelled as a unit and were a dismal failure overall.
The overall presentation is as about as compelling as the hair on my scrotum.
OK so, the idea is good but the movie overall feels soooo shallow.
Bland characters including the main characters   3. poor plot   4. uninteresting killer   5. overall boring This film is...is...pointless, mind-numbing and bland.
But overall, The Black Dahlia is just another bad film to cap off the summer.
These clichÃ©, overdone characters made for no comedic situations and overall a lousy dose of comedy.
But overall, it is too silly with an abrupt anti-climax and not worth seeking-out unless a fan of Moreland.
The overall result is campy at best.
Cinematography is below average, acting is very good, but overall the movie makes no sense.
You can't really deny that "The Space Children" is an overall tame and unexciting Sci-Fi story.
Mr Todd is the famous barber that chops up people into hamburger after slitting their throats and selling said hamburg to a local meat pie shoppe.Some of the sets and street scenes seem solid and true to the period but the whole mess is overall (forgive me) ham-handed.
The problem isn't so much the trite plotting as it is the overall and overwhelming tone of the drama.
On the overall, this movie makes "Friday The 13th" look like "Citizen Kane".
4) To be fair, I laughed in some scenes, but in overall the movie is really awful.
But overall the movie looks like too many people made choices on it and doesn't have a definitive style.
The ending was a little dumb, so that pulls the overall rating lower.
The reviews had this as one of the Top 10 films of 2004, but yet the story was disjointed, not very interesting and just overall not entertaining.
The ending is OK allright when the couple turn out to be brother and sister and she is just letting him rot somewhere but overall one would have expected more.
If your idea of excellent television includes the the writing, acting and overall production quality seen in THE SOPRANOS, DEADWOOD or SIX FEET UNDER, avoid OZ.
The overall themes of child abuse are used merely as a provocative and exploitive vehicle.
When locals do enter the lens, the encounter is always brief, shallow and artificial--indeed, many of the interviews seem staged--and the overall feeling is often _exploitive_.
It all boils down to a satisfying, yet open, climax and overall; despite its problems getting a release - this is a damn good horror film and will surely rank as one of the best of 2006!
And I'm not giving it a break because it was made in 1998 so overall I give it a 3.
These live action adaptations are simply horrid, and it boggles my mind how this has a rating beyond 2/10 overall.
the overall the concept of Death Note is intelligent, exciting and has a great story.
Most of the ending seems to be an attempt by the filmmakers to take control of the theme (which they don't have) by reintroducing arbitrary characters and involving them in entirely new plot lines that don't have any coherent or enthused meaning on the overall storyarch.
Although, I don't understand what Jesus has to do with the occult, but it still added a lot of overall insanity/craziness.
Basically this film is a very clichÃ© action film that is not in anyway stylish or well scripted but it is funny, notably the bad Russian accents and the puns, one of which had me in stitches when Dolphs sergeant is briefing him on his mission saying "have you ever heard of agent red" and Dolph replies " it sounds like a bad action movie", so at least the makers of this new they were not making a classic, overall this is not horrendous but is still pretty bad,you could quite easily stomach the full ninety minutes on a good day, if only for the hilariously cheesy dialogue but if you have a choice between this and an earlier Dolph flick theplace this nicely back on the shelf.
I expected the overall quality of the flick to be poor, and so wasn't disappointed in that regard.
Something like Mafia Vs Ninja needs to be reviewed with these potential qualities in mind: humor (intentional or otherwise), creative fighting styles/ gimmicks, quirkiness, and overall effect.
overall a decent flick, and one kung fu fans should dig, especially if you liked fantasy mission force or any other of jackie chan's more bizarre films (half a loaf, the original drunken master, etc)
The second and third stories are forgettable and therefore the overall affect of the movie is a negative one.
But this overall serious bummer of an open ending sucks so big time I bombarded the movie without any shame to a 1 outa 10.
So on my scale with about 1400 films in the bag that would be a 4, since it at least progresses somewhat coherent and you get the overall idea.
I did laugh a few times, but overall it adds up to one I won't watch again.
The overall effect is that of a remarkably boring two hour long drug trip, best appreciated through open mocking.
Benning proved that she can do comedy just as well as drama, and she was overall great in this movie.
After enjoying the freshness of the original Pusher, then Bleeder was alright film overall; although it was hailed as a big advertising flop here in Denmark.
If the performances are somewhat shaky, at least they do not distract from the overall allure of the story.
I have to admit that the new Blue Ranger (a little boy) performed better than his predecessor, but overall, as most sequels go, this film bites the dust.
The overall effect is as if the producers had decided to cast Dame Edna Everage in the role and hope that no-one would notice.
The film does have its moments, especially with Spanky and Bumbo in the kitchen, but overall it reminded me a lot of that standard childhood nightmare of being chased by a gorilla, except not as exciting.
this movie is billed as a spoof/comedy,but it's not really funny.there are 1 or 2 mildly amusing moments,but mostly it's just silly,without being funny.this movie would work as an actual spy movie,except that you have the expectation that you will laugh.it's gonna be hard to get the required 10 lines of text in here,but i'll try.i think the problem is the filmmakers tried too hard to get laughs.sometimes you can go too far with a joke and it ends up as flat as a pancake.so the movie isn't really funny,but it does have 1 redeeming feature.that is the casting of Andy Griffith(TV's Matlock and the Andy Griffith show) as a maniacal nut case who plans to either destroy the world or rule it.Griffith is great in this movie.he has so much fun in the role.Barry Bostwick is also good for some comic relief.but overall,the movie is not good.the most i can squeeze out for "Spy Hard" is a 4/10
Pretty depressing overall, with Sean Connery looking uneasy and Henry Fonda inserted here and there as the U.S. President.
The movie has some good points to make, and occasionally does so effectively, but the overall distortion, low quality, lack of narration, and complete lack of a sense of humor bring this one down.
After almost two hours of poorly done homosexual-dildo jokes (as if they could be done in good taste), horrible improvised "acting" performances, and overall immature storyline, I am questioning how this movie could even have been produced in the first place.
I admit, I did chuckle here and there, but overall I was the only person in the theater laughing the least.
It has its hints at humor, but overall?
It was funny, at points, and I'll admit that as a comedian, Vaughn shines, where some funny moments got me to look back at the screen, but the overall flow of the movie was lacking, and a good plot wouldn't need funny jokes to get my attention back.
overall, i'd say that this movie could have been worse.
While a tad cheesy, the overall production values were pretty good (apart from the way they dealt with Lee)--especially for a kung-fu movie.
The sequence where Bruce Lee's face is pasted over the mirror (As others have mentioned) is truly as shoddy as it gets and overall the movie has a few alright action sequences in the beginning but it's all very sub-par stuff.
Problem is, the overall film is pretty static, and Cordell simply ain't Jason or Freddy.
But he fails worst as producer as that makes him overall responsible for putting this mess together in the first place!
In writing my report on Mr Woodcock, it would have to say that whilst potential was shown, the end result is a disappointing overall effort.
The overall atmosphere of the film isn't bad, but there seems to be a lot of gaping holes & the overall story is rather confusing and vague.
The actors were capable and the overall production quality was good.
But overall it just doesn't leave much of a good impression outside of the whole "fight for truly independent cinema" mood set by the release.
irritating, and it is a dull story, unfunny and just an overall boring family comedy.
It had some laughs, but overall the motivation of the characters was incomprehensible.
And one of the worst movies overall to boot.
However, given the all too elaborate staging of such sequences through an over use of Green Screen techninques in conjunction with an overabundance of CGI effectively renders the overall appearance as reminiscent of, as one reviewer stated, "playing a really cool video game" as opposed to providing a genuine "in the cockpit" sensation for piloting such frail machinations.
The ending is interesting, I'll give them that but one good moment simply can't fix overall bad impression this movie makes.
This movie was plagued by overall mediocrity.
To be honest I could go on and pick at this film and break the maximum word limit on this because I was so disappointed in the overall quality of horror films and how Shrooms had the potential to break the trend of bog standard clichÃ© ridden horror flicks but no!
The restoration is very good overall, although there are two or three very rough sequences.
Small point, though, in an overall great movie.
Anyway, you can't judge an entire movie by one individual scene; it's what the movie's saying overall that matters.
Watching Jeremy squirm and ultimately become frightened out of his wits was a ton of fun.The ending is a bit silly(..and rather logically unsound), pointing out another schemer out for a payday, but overall I think it's fun, if derivative somewhat.
But NIGHT GALLERY deserves more respect and attention because of its overall creepiness than for the debut of a young "genius".
Moreover, the cast overall strikes out somethin' rotten: Willowy blonde lead Judith Resnick is hot, but vapid, Earle Edgerton makes for a singularly bland and uncharismatic hero, Andy Milligan film regular Martin Barolsky nerds it up to an almost unbearably geeky extreme as the balding, middle-aged fruitcake killer, Gloria Spavik hits new heretofore untouched heights in nerve-shredding celluloid obnoxiousness as an insufferably shrill and whiny fat old bag who gets her head bashed in, and Burt Young (Paulie in the "Rocky" series) embarrasses himself royally in his less-than-sterling film debut as a pathetic, irritable, grotesquely misshapen hunchback retard named Gimpy.
The mystery is enough to keep you watching, and overall Heard's performance makes it all worthwhile.
But overall the movie was a treat.
The overall plot is the low point of the film, that I will admit.
So overall I would recommend this film.
The film's acting, direction, and script have a precision so well thought out that the effect--both at any given moment and overall --is absolutely astonishing.
The color and the lighting and the overall cinematography in this movie was especially pleasing, also.
The overall history of the French resistance is an extremely complicated tale to be retold for purposes of explaining just how this story resonates.
This movie overall was not all that great, it did however have some high points.
Reflecting the film's overall ambiguity, The Hole resides in a gray genre area between thriller, psychological horror and a straight-ahead drama.
There are rough spots in the film, extended moments that cry for editing, but the overall result is informative, creative and entertaining.
But overall, the film accomplished it's task.
To my surprise, the gory scenes are very limited and overall short.
While El Dia De La Bestia had some logic errors, such as easily finding a virgin at her late 20's, it was a good film overall.
It is obvious that it had a low budget and the overall film making isn't very good but the ideas behind the story captured my interest.
But overall her role was also really a solid one and it says something about the quality of the acting from Lorre and Greenstreet to say that Fitzgerald gave the lesser performance of the movie.
The overall feel of this film was happiness and whimsy, and it was exactly what I needed at the end of the day.
But overall, a neat serial with a good & satisfying ending.
This in no way spoils the film's impact, but the overall quality is somewhat pulled down.
The gore is pretty decent, I have to admit, but overall "Drive Thru" is a totally insignificant movie.
The ending a wonderful elegiac surprise and even though the film is experimental it remains truly mainstream in its vision overall.
It's tolerable, but the songs are dubbed as well, and as a result suffer overall.
The TV series also adds more depth to the characters that add to the overall enjoyment of the film.
add up to an overall weird experience.
Anything that feels magical in the trailer feels forced and kinda creepy in the overall film.
Perhaps this is a hard film to establish continuity but overall they succeeded.
But overall it's about being away from the one you love.
I won't lie; I was disappointed overall.
I've never heard of the composer but he truly embraced and enhanced the overall mood of the movie.
The overall 'feel' of the film is of perfection and finesse.
The unofficial sequels fared pretty well too and overall it is good dose of entertainment.
A great comedy overall with great Polish actors in comical roles.
The overall look of the film is fresh and clear.
Anna Faris and Reginna Hall were overall really funny.
But overall the funny parts overpower the not funny parts.
Although the overall structure isn't as tight as the other three, the jokes are often still 'fresh' and there's a lot of slapstick, which, although predictable, is still funny!
In the end, the narrative approach works well and does not undermine the overall story or make it seem ridiculous despite the fact that the story does have a predictable element to it.
It's overall and underrated work of minor genius, and may please those looking for a crazy tale of love and revenge.
But overall, this is a fascinating film.
A very interesting plot.Is the hero of the plot in it for the money or is he really an ok person?I saw this film in my late teens and have overall seen it about five times enjoy it on every viewing.Like most films because it has some complexities and twists and turns keeping you guessing all the way the first viewing really stuck in my mind.Well worth a watch,unpredictable in my opinion.Again why is this film not available especially on DVD?
The comment about the overall editing seems harsh.
They'll have their moments for sure but overall will be very inconsistent.
So overall, the film is horrible and it begs the question "was Al Adamson perhaps a worse director than Ed Wood, Jr."?
Although the actual music is far from fitting each individual scene, the overall presence is not only worth listening to, but also worth the purchase price.
Anyway the movies overall is pretty good, but then some halfwit has to come up with idea of the flying the US flag upside down to show what they think of this country...That ticked me off..  You know these are the same people that live in 30,000 square foot houses with a garage full of gas guzzling cars, a few airplanes, and helicopters, tour buses, Olympic size pools, who think nothing of spending $1000 bucks for a meal they do not eat... and then campaign to get the poor smucks who make %50,000 or less a year to conserve, etc.
The overall message here, however, is despicable.
However, that vexation aside, for overall tension and the sheer watchability of Mr. Jones in a meaty role, this movie gets an 8 out of 10 from me.
The movie has a nice feel for small-town New England in the fall (at least as well as I recall it from my teens), and it is quite funny occasionally, but overall it is just pleasant.
This movie was completely disappointing, not only in the majority of new actors from the original, but the overall cheesiness of the production.
The plot was rather simple and predictable, the acting wooden overall, the heroine looked older, less attractive and lively than her opponent.
It isn't, of course, for the simple reason that the movie overall isn't remotely good enough to mediate the intended visceral impact of lengthy depictions of actual sex.
However the film belongs to the gorgeous Rachel McAdams; she was feisty, charismatic and overall, just great, as she usually is.
Some of martial arts scenes are competent enough, but don't make up for the overall poor quality of the film.
The overall of this game is incredible and that's why I will always support Shadow of the Colossus.
Granted, the broader comedy relief (courtesy of Torquemadas' clownish associates played amusingly by Jeffrey Combs, Stephen Lee, and William J. Norris) I could have done without, but overall the film is commendably as intense as Henriksens' central performance.
These stories are told side-by-side interviews with other crossword enthusiasts such as former President Bill Clinton and TV's Jon Stewart who offer their own passionate opinions on the pleasure and overall importance of crossword puzzles.
Delicatessen is everything I say it is and more; and overall the film is one of the true highlights of the 1990's.
Directed by Kevin Connor this was the fourth & final 'lost world' film he & star Doug McClure made together, the first being The Land that Time Forgot (1974), the second was At the Earth's Core (1976), after that came The People that Time Forgot (1977) & Warlords of Atlantis rounded of the loose series of films which is probably my favourite overall.
I was impressed with the production design credited to Elliot Scott & the sets in particular, some of the Atlantis cityscapes were obviously just flat matte paintings but they looked good overall, from the dungeons to the higher cities which have a palatial feel to them & as a whole Warlords of Atlantis is quite a handsome film to watch.
However, it was completed, just like the dozens of other Miike movies, and just like Ichi the Killer, Gozu, Audition, and other thrillers, the overall extremes of the movie are bounded together by a relentless imagination and a whimsical logic.
Bad plot flaws damage the overall impact - the incredibly half-hearted search for the paramedics, the far too swift 'sex conversion' of the hero's buddy, the unexplained resurrection of a woman cult member, the badly answered question of why the paramedics needed to be kidnapped at all etc.
But overall it had a very smart plot, with solid acting, and a nice creepy tone.
This movie has a good bit of cursing but overall the movie was phenomenal and I loved every second of it.
This is one of the rare movies in comedy that i could watch over and over again,, this movie is sooooo , freaking funny it's like a laugh a minute,, especially how Vinny,, "bag of donuts" is woken up constantly every morning,, first the train,, then the pigs i think the owl, and o yeah the steam whistle... i can relate to that stuff, and living relatively close to N.Y. for years i can relate to the accents in the movie,, very Brooklyn if i'm not mistaken,, i loved Joe Pesci in this movie,, this is one of his finer moments ever in a comedic role,, Marissa Tomei however stole the whole show for me,, not only is she sexy and pretty she can act too, her accent fits her like a glove, Ralph Maccio,, hmm well, not everything can be perfect.. i Loved Fred Gwynne the judge,, he is so hilarious,, i just bust out every time he gets Vinny on Contempt of Court or something,, and order him to some jail time,, overall the plot was simple... yeah some of it's corny,, i guess you kinda have to be a Pesci, Tomei fan to appreciate all the slapstick,, but hey it's one of the funniest movies that you'll ever see and you won't regret watching it that's for sure,,
I was surprised how good the movie was and overall it really entertained me.
Comic book movie adaptations have a terrible record overall, and Marvel comics has the worst record of all.
It's got all the elements you could want in a Hollywood-style movie: Charming characters, plot twists, tons of gags, an incredibly beautiful leading lady, sumptuous sets and locations, and an overall sense "gee-whiz-isn't-this-fun!"
Sure there are some classic Kim Ki-Duk moments like the scene with the old man and the rope and even the wedding, but overall this is very sub-par.
"The Psychotronic Man" is overall a pretty cool flick, but sadly director Jack M. Sell wasn't quite sure which narrative tone to maintain.
The Flyboys is sure to please everyone, it's fun, funny, and an overall great picture.
The tune is typically Italian, and fits the movie well; but I'd have preferred it if it was played a bit less often, as it soon starts to get old, and the overall impact is lessened.
Though unnecessary, I didn't feel these newly-added scenes (which are brief) were too detrimental to the overall film and they tried to tie them into the 'voyeuristic' aspect the best they could.
Although the script idea originates from a real-life murder case, referred to generally as the "double initial" serial killings, which terrorized upstate New York in the early 1970s, the film's overall plot and main characters are fictional.
Anyways, this movie was partially undone I think by it's length but overall serves as a very good if it lacks some of the poetry of the writing.
overall this is a fantastic film that drags just a little bit near the beginning and end, but is perfectly acted and stunningly filmed.
overall this is a fantastic film that drags just a little bit near the beginning and end, but is perfectly acted and stunningly filmed.
Screwing up the basics can often be enough to suspend belief in the overall narrative.
She delivers most of the lines with tongue planted firmly in cheek, and metaphorically winks at the audience with every cheesy line and action she goes through....Misty Mundae is able to pull off something very few other actors could, and her commanding presence and on-screen charisma suck you in, and intrigue you in ways that endear you to her character and her portrayal, and simultaneously enable you to overlook the overall quality of the material, and whatever other shortcomings the film may have.
You will even chuckle at a few places, but overall you'll wish you saw something else.
The script and the characters are intelligent and overall it rates as a respectable swan song for the legendary studio that produced it.
Granted, it's got its flaws (the much-ridiculed silly monster hand puppet and the weak climax are both below par), but overall this picture has a lot of solid stuff in it.
There's an unreal quality about the whole thing so that the overall effect is like watching a marionette show under water.
Alan arrives in an overall uncanny and hostile environment, but nevertheless comes into contact with Roth through his amiable and stunningly beautiful secretary Genevieve.
It was entertaining, funny, sexy and overall fun to watch.
Summary: Eddie Murphy plays Jim Evers, a self-employed real estate that cares enough for his wife and family that he sometimes works too hard at providing for them and neglects his parental/husband duties, in pursuit of earning a better life for his family overall.
The movie overall had a decent story about two lovers that were ill-fated (similar to a Romeo and Juliet type of story) and have doomed a mansion and its ground to perpetual purgertory.
But besides that, the film has some great experimental editing and cinematography that enhanced the overall atmosphere and experience.
The overall theme -- that friendship is more important than money, fame and prestige -- is well supported by the plotting and character development in the movie.
The film is (as mentioned earlier) full of nudity from hot Italian babes, stylishly psychedelic touches, Satanic orgies, and an overall lack of any remote coherency.
The acting flagged in places but overall the film did portray the essential ethical conflict between being a doctor and being the hatchet person kaboshing medical procedures treating doctors thought necessary.
This is delightful, and quite smart in places, giving this production an overall slick execution, while not pushing the envelope so hard, as to detract from the work.
A good, solid thriller overall.
That aside, this film was overall a fairly enjoyable film to watch.
But overall the movie is entertaining.
is a little anal but that adds to his overall character and pans out to his advantage at the end of the film, Willam is underrated, Brandi and father are a great example of a modern day middle class father/daughter relationship, (and she FINE to!!!
What I wasn't prepared for was the overall sadness of the movie, sad in that here is a man who genuinely has a vision and a desire and the determination to try to make something of himself but whose affliction is at the same time both the wellspring of his inspiration and the source of his inability to achieve his goals.
Instead, the decision to shave his moustache is so jarring that he "jumps" to timeline A, or more accurately he jumps to timeline A but elements of timeline B are still known to him, such as the photographs of his vacation, the license in his wallet, and his overall consciousness and memories are still from timeline B.
The Split is a good heist film that starts out like The Italian Job but goes in a significantly darker direction although not to the films overall benefit in my opinion.
The DVD will give those with a home theater system a good workout and add to the overall experience...and watch it after the sun goes down with all the lights out too!
On second watching I could see the loose ends that were tied, so I was pretty happy overall.
However, "sappy" would not do this movie justice as an overall consensus of the film.
The effects are sometimes cheesy, but overall the atmosphere and film-work on this are pretty decent!
The sequences with the flesh-eating cockroaches and the encounter with the savage rednecks generate a few isolated peaks of suspense and thrills, but overall "Damnation Alley" is mostly uneven and tedious.
The original series was in its own other region- taking what more stories from the comics (if not overall style and atmosphere like Burton or Nolan)- and was able to cover some fine ground with our troubled hero the Dark Knight.
overall, it is a drama/thriller/action/spy that I found very satisfying.
The animation, while it looks good overall, is actually horrible upon close inspectionÂso horrible, in fact, that it's absolutely hilarious.
This brings to mind the overall issue of how the nuclear age affected the whole planet.
and a girl friend (NOT Katrina)ain't that great - but the overall film is very enjoyable, and seems to have quite a fan following.
Oddities took on Kaientai in a fun match, X-Pac took on Jarrett in a haircut match, Edge was Sable's surprise partner as they took on Marc Mero and Jacqueline, Shamrock took on Owen Hart in a boring lions den match, Mankind went alone in a handicap hardcore match against the Outlaws which only lasted 5 minutes but it was pretty brutal for the 5 minutes, Triple H and the Rock had a decent ladder match but can't be compared to others, and in the main event Steve Austin defended the world title against the Undertaker, overall another good Summerslam and one of the best ever
The overall concept of the show is not fresh, but delving into the fictional lives of three strong women is refreshing all the same.
His extremely mannered performance is a bit of a trial overall, in my opinion.
Then there are the scripts and the actors, not to mention the overall quality of the production -- lucid photography, theme music with echoes of Brideshead Revisited, period clothing, vehicles, etc.
The first confrontation is it's best overall scene, as it's inside an exceptionally creepy location with some great action scenes and a fantastic conclusion that is far ahead of the types of attacks generally shown at the time and becoming quite violent and brutal.
Even though the script reveals very few details regarding the lethal rat-virus, the chaotic situation in downtown Manhattan is eerily plausible and the overall atmosphere of "Mulberry Street" is tremendously menacing.
While some of the CGI is spotty, it's hardly distracting enough to remove from the overall beauty of the film and no one should allow such small issues to detract wholly from an overall good film.
Although the film is slightly flawed in several places, the overall movie is dramatically cohesive.
Sure enough there are countless rough edges present, and characters, although compelling in their quest, fail to resonate emotionally, but the overall adventure itself Â that is, the tale Â is one that will be sure to captivate imaginations and the attentions of many diverse audiences.
"The Unsaid" is overall a solid film that studies the secrets buried inside the human soul.
However, the overall impact of what happens would not be even close to what it is had those moments been excised or edited.
For medical healing and understanding, of the overall operations.
Individually, each sequence is brilliantly put together creating an overall sense of awe and wonder, and the whole story flows smoothly putting barely a foot in the wrong place.
The directing and overall technical aspects gives this movie most of its accolades.
What they show in the film of arguments and sulking is what happens in ANY band, and in fact is usually much worse - I was almost surprised there wasn't more of the taped back-and-forth exchanged in the film, given what's been said how bad it got amongst the fab four during their final year in recording, particularly on Let it Be aka Get Back (the most chilling thing overall is the presence Yoko, who keeps popping up looking like she could duke it out with Bergman's Seventh Seal Death dude and probably win).
Seen today it's highly watchable and competently done but overall I feel that Meet Me In St Louis would come off best in say another fifty years from now.
I wont even comment on the acting, sound, effects, editing, direction, and overall production of this film as they were all terrible.
The outdoor scenes seems to be computer-rendered and the overall feeling of the movie compares with the HBO made movies.
The biggest problem was that despite all the star power and the direction of the great Michael Curtiz, the overall effort is pretty awful and is only saved by a few moments here and there (provided mostly by Flynn and Walter Connelly).
The basic problem here is the script, credited to Josef Mishel and Ardel Wray: the dialogue is incredibly awkward and the overall story is at best vague, at worst incomprehensible.
The overall impression however is of quite an achievement, and one which is perhaps more mature about the unpredictable nature of love and attraction than the director has been earlier.
The film had it's moments which were mostly good comedy and some romance(or maybe that's just me being attracted to beautiful women), but overall the film was drawn out, the story was too difficult to comprehend, and I can endure long silences with no action or movement, but only when there is a purpose, and in this film I saw no purpose and lost interest through the film a few times.
Even those that simply miss out on all the symbolism and allegories for every day life will find this movie highly entertaining simply from the excellent performances and superb overall presentation.
I don't want to give too much away, but overall, Amelie is a uniquely sweet story, with a uniquely sweet soul; just like...well, Amelie.
The main character is simply a nut job 4) The overall look and feeling of it.
The lighting and overall cinematography give the film both a wonderful Victorian-era feel and a film-noir aspect as well.
This movie was somewhat of a disappointment, but overall, I still give it my approval.
But, this has made up for an overall style, mood and atmosphere of the film.
However I have to point out that Mohammad Imam's performance was somewhat shaky, but he overall gave an OK performance for his first movie.
There is that one sad moment in the film that gets me every time, something I can relate to but, overall, the entire film is captivating and leaves you wanting to know what happens with Lara, her career and her relationship with her family and Tom afterward!
Great acting (especially from the father), great music and is overall greatly directed and written.
The typical Conspiracy theorists, when working on a conspiracy theory, starts with the conclusion, and then works from there, choosing the evidence that can fit the theory and discarding and ignoring all facts and evidence that contradicts the overall theory.
it is a quite slow pace face-to-face Brynner/Douglas...i found there was some pretty heavy violence/gore but you know, seventies giallo style : (maybe some spoiler ahead) a little bit phony and fake but the image is there : the monkey torn apart, the flesh torn from the mechanic, etc...  i don't remember if it is alike the novel...but overall i think it is a OK action flick, hero flick : he stands all alone at the end, all the bad guys are out..........  and nice images too : a small rocky island, the sun over the sea  but not a typical Verne's story-on-cinema : subs, sci-fi; but the adventure seen in a lot of Verne's novels tough
While I didn't think Decoys was the worst sci-fi horror film out there I wasn't that impressed with it & overall I would probably have to say I thought it was slightly below average.
I overall liked it and grade it much higher:  8 / 10
For the overall work and amazing atmosphere, I give this movie a cheering 9/10.
While the movie does have some disturbing scenes, overall those scenes were not so objectionable that I turned away.
As an overall experience, I enjoyed watching the movie very much.
