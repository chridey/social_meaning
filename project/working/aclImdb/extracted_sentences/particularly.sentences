Having seen this film, I don't think it's hyperbole to talk about her as being the equal of Judy Garland as an actress, if maybe not quite as a singer (although her expressive, surprisingly sensual voice makes all her other peers look suitably weak - particularly as most of them were being dubbed anyway).
The musical numbers are as good as those in any other musical of the period - particularly 'Chasin' the Blues Away' at the Ziegfield, and the final performance of 'Love Me or Leave Me'.
They're in the gym of a community college, and one of them, I'll say, isn't particularly bad to look at.
Cagney's portrayal depends more on our, as viewers, knowledge of a gangster's past (particularly Cagney's gangster characters).
I donÂ´t consider this movie gives an answer to that, but it represents one over-exaggerated view - a particularly well-carried out view.
I wish the movie was longer though, with more Go Bot and Rock Lord characters, particularly the more obscure ones, like Steamer.
The trouble is there just isn't anything particularly good to say about it.
The cast is brilliant from the top to the bottom of the credits, and the lead, Steven Mackintosh, is particularly outstanding as the trapped innocent attempting to piece together what he's fallen into.
There are some interesting themes here, particularly the idea of female servitude.
Mitchum and Holden work particularly well together.
Colonists in New France generally took greater care than other Europeans--particularly the Spanish and the English--to have amicable relations with native people's they encountered.
The Hurons, particularly, do not want any invasion of their privacy and culture and are openly hostile to the priest and the Algonquins.
The film isn't particularly frightening, although it has a couple of jumpy moments.
The film, unfortunately, badly lacks pace and several shots run longer than is necessary - apart from it being somewhat repetitive (particularly during the possessed nun's sex-and-death rampage and her subsequent attempts to cover her tracks, which scenes may have influenced the first half of THE ANTICHRIST [1974]; SATANICO PANDEMONIUM itself was partly inspired by Matthew Lewis' celebrated novel THE MONK - which Luis Bunuel, friend of the director and my personal favorite film-maker, adapted for the screen {but didn't direct} around this same time...and which I managed to catch while in Hollywood early last January!)
The films ending is rather prolonged and is also somewhat weak, this is particularly noticeable because of the strong meat which preceded it, but Zalman King does deserve credit for ensuring that it was not made glaringly obvious long in advance.
Parks has aged badly over the years, but his lined face and booze-and-butts voice has played to his credit, particularly in stone cold killer roles in THE CHINA LAKE MURDERS and on WALKER Texas RANGER.
I love the photography throughout the film, and particularly the wonderful scenes shot in Old San Juan and the terrific seascapes that the director used as a backdrop.
The elements of film, particularly outdoor angles from crowded streets and icy violin sound effects echo back to the great spy movies of the Cold War era and lend an almost Hitchcockesque eeriness.
Foster and Burns make for likable leads, with the underrated and always captivating Foster particularly fine in a rare starring role (Foster basically reprised the character in the oddball cannibal horror outing "Welcome to Arrow Beach").
It is not a young person's movie nor is it a particularly happy movie.
We learn those elements not in high-level drama but one of progressive mental torture going on in Marie's mind - particularly after Jean disappears beachside while Marie is basking on the sand.
When death is so sudden there can be the illusion of life continuing, particularly when a couple have grown together for so many years.
A tentative affair with the friend of a friend seems doomed from the start, leading to the shattering final scene, all the more heartbreaking for being open to any number of interpretations, none of them particularly cheerful.
A particularly disturbing moment arrives when Marie decides to embark on an affair with another man who comes into her life: Vincent (Jacques Nolot) which establishes that maybe reality for her has finally cracked.
The plot is full of stupid little holes and it's particularly funny how Nikki "coincidentally" gets into contact with Alex (the devil).
Ken Leung I thought was particularly bad.
The character's are not particularly interesting or sympathetic due to a severe lack of development - this blame can go on the writer's.
I didn't particularly see Azazeal as truly evil, even though he was supposed to be.
The people are particularly bad.
Even if you are not particularly impressed with Vanessa Williams in general, brace yourself!
There have been few other films I've seen that made caused me to weep (big, macho guy that I am ;-)), particularly those that are often mis-labelled as "war movies" -- "The Killing Fields" being another of this ilk -- when, in fact, they're really (if we're labelling things) human interest films that come about because of a war or conflict.
The scenic photography was excellent too, but sometimes the tight budget showed, particularly in the sound quality.
Some of the scenes in here are beyond horrific, particularly near the end where a massacre of civilians is made to seem quite dull and everyday to the killers.
This is a nice way of bringing some innovation to the game play, as the Dark Prince makes use of a particularly vicious razor-chain, that allows him to make long jumps and dispose of his enemies much more efficiently.
So my comment will probably be linked to the two films rather than only to this particularly strange journey, adrift in a Parisian's tramp mind.
The cast is Outstanding particularly Nastasha Kinski as the alluring Circus performer Leila, The Very much missed Raul Julia as the suave ray, Harry dean Stanton (Always a delight is on hand as hank's long suffering pal, Filmed on the stages of Zoetrope studios, the film is an Affectionate 'Love letter' to the musicals of yesteryear, Coppola even Has it filmed In standard 1.33.1 Aspect Ratio, to evoke the look of the Classic Musical.
Books are always better than movies, but science fiction seems to be particularly so.
From the first, the couple is fascinated with the pair but particularly with LoÃ¯c, the sexually ambiguous brother, (played to perfection by Stanislas Merhar).
The poverty and demoralization (particularly of women in Brazil) is explored, and the scenes are stark, turning gradually to crude, horrific and even at times humorous.
Its an interesting parable on how the government uses scapegoats such as drugs and violent cinema (particularly that of Marins' films which were subjected to much censorship) to cover up other issues.
Jean-Xavier was the one who bet everything in this particularly story.
In general, they had no script or direction, were never really edited and just weren't particularly funny.
Don't expect to be scared or particularly grossed out (unless you have a weak stomach) but do expect to be entertained.
For Prey is being bunched with the on-going, and oft exhilarating, slew of first person shooters, still in vogue and dominating proceedings, particularly on the PC.
In the meantime, a young girl, Gilliam, starts developing her own psychic abilities, particularly psychometry.
The sets are wobbly, the violence over the top, the acting stilted, the scripts hackneyed and the editing haphazard (Dean Learner has a blood stained spade magically appear in his hand in one particularly memorable incident).
The whole thing is sillier than an episode of "Laugh-In," but many of the actors (particularly Lithgow, Wiest and Bacon) are good enough to actually sell the material.
The reason for this comes out as the story unfolds but, suffice to say, it's up to Bacon and the kids (some of them played by the likes of Chris Penn, Lori Singer and Sarah Jessica Parker) to butt heads with the local enforcers of these rules and to particularly pit themselves against a local preacher (a stellar turn from John Lithgow).
What's more, the outside circle, the peripheral friends/instigators/colleagues, etc., add immeasurably to the humor and atmosphere of the piece, particularly Aida Turturro as a worldly wise teacher/friend of Dawson's, Dennis Farina as Burns' overt male chauvinist boss, Michael Leydon Campbell in dual roles as a rocker and male half of a bickering married couple, and Callie Thorne as the bickering wife.
Secondly, the film seemed to go on a bit too long--particularly at the action-packed conclusion.
I took the movie more as a study of how he changes throughout -- he starts out so stiff and rigid (Ultra Businessman) and ends up relaxed and charming, particularly in their dessert scene.
I'm amazed this pic isn't better known, I agree very much with Ebert's review particularly(SPOILER)  The last scene that kind of does take credibility away fro the rest of the pic but then again-it maybe a little to Hollywood but the movie did (somewhat) follow the book's ending which was also positive although nowhere near the film's last scene.
I would recommend this to everyone particularly Sarandon fans, fans of the romance Genre, fans of Dramas in General or just people who like to dig up films that are kind of little known.
Director Shepard does an OK job without being particularly outstanding, as a whole Oxygen is a little bland & forgettable but the solid story should paper over the lacklustre visuals.
It demonstrates how the nature of American politics does not change nomatter how obvious the truth is, particularly delivered by a 500-1 shot as was McGovern.
Here the editing is particularly effective in telling the story.
She is particularly interested in Neel in whom she sees only goodness and simplicity.
For example, at one point he discovers she has one particularly extraordinary ability.
A warrior is born who fights many battles yet it is quickly established that this young man is very much fighting human wars, quenching a thirst for power and balancing this with his love for his family, particularly his mother.
Her portrayal of a homeless child ushered into prostitution is particularly hard hitting and often heart breaking.
One scene I found particularly shocking sees Kelly, Joanne and Derek in a greasy spoons cafÃ©; Joanne is awkwardly smoking and acting tough though it is clear she is out of her depth.
The two central characters particularly shine in the darker moments in the film, the combination of there acting and the directors ability to create such a tangible atmosphere creates some truly gripping scenes.
Coming out of the cinema after watching "London to Brighton" I felt my senses reeling and the adrenalin pumping as if I had just stepped off a particularly fiendish theme park ride.
The drawbacks of this movie include a script that sometimes gets bogged down in melodrama, especially with the main villain's long-winded monologues about his evil plans (particularly at the beginning of the film).
I particularly find the ending very well done.
It was particularly timely with the riots this year in the streets of Budapest.
Most of the time, Eastwood's characters reveal themselves through their silences, and it's particularly true here.
On its own, it isn't a particularly good movie.
There's one chapter particularly stupid, 7 or 8 minutes just to make a joke about cocaine.
As for the rest of this film, it plays like a teenager's wet dream as animated and directed by a group of not particularly talented teens.
Apparently the different segments were the work of different animation teams, though none were particularly good.
It wasn't a particularly original premise or story, nor were the jokes and gags that great...and it will by no means end up in the pantheon of the great buddy dramas...  but this movie was entertaining!
This was a good, if not excellent start to a good if not excellent series and it suffers from the same problem that would plaque the rest of the series: Being entertaining, but not particularly well researched.
The supporting cast is not particularly worth mentioning, but there are lots of topless chicks to be found and that's never a bad thing.
However, there are some wonderful performances by several of the silver screen's grandes dames - Bette Davis, Maggie Smith, and particularly Angela Lansbury as the inebriated author of appallingly bad romance novels.
Before you tell me I'm imposing today's standards on yesterday's film, consider that these were pertinent issues, particularly for gays and gays-to-be, even (perhaps even "especially") in 1985.
Tony Leung's bad cop performance is a class on its own, particularly when he finds out that he's been set up and is now in an untenable situation.
Aerobics class became the next singles hang-out as the song "Masquerade" blares out, while everyone obsesses over plastic surgery and the perfect body (The Laraine Newman character is particularly pathetic).
It's a rare bit of symbolism from Griffith and while not particularly subtle it was quite a novelty for the time.
Starting in the 1920s (I believe) we get to follow the people in the small Danish town of Korsbaek, particularly the families Varnaes and Andersen-Skjern (who are constantly at odds with each other) up to the 1950s.
i particularly like the the whole maid scenario, those are some of the best scenes of the movie, like when she is making the bed and this old geezer grabs her.
"La Fille seule" is an absolute gem of a film that is particularly fascinating because its structural simplicity belies a complex, multi-layered character study.
If we take away everything around us in our modern world that has not been affected by oil in some way, from food to manufacturing (but particularly transport), there is hardly anything left.
Indeed, Grant and Dunne seem to be sharing a private joke with each other, that others (particularly the clueless Bellamy character) just don't get.
The Awful Truth is tagged as part of the wonderful genre that encompasses the screwball comedy, and although to a degree that genre placement is true, I do believe that those not particularly fond of the high octane scattergun comedies from the genre, will certainly find this offering far more appealing with its pacing and lighthearted production values.
So the plot of the film isn't particularly strong--what is its saving grace?
Shot in Australia, its unpretentious and unassuming treatment of sexual obsession is light years away from other (particularly American) films with a similar theme , such as "9 Â½ weeks".
The two protagonists particularly insisted on the testing process that parents had to go through to get their beloved one.
The quest for the mystical Shrine of the Four Elements has a particularly epic quality with the usual eclectic blend of mythical elements set against the backdrop of the Arabian Nights.
The two areas of town don't concern themselves with one another until a wannabe member of the Axe Gang, Sing (Stephen Chow) and his sidekick (Chi Chung Lam) poses as a member in the tenement to extort money, causing a series of events to occur in the tenement that wind up with most of the Axe Gang either killed or injured and Brother Sum (Kwok Kuen Chan), the leader of the gang, to do everything in his power to wreak revenge on both the tenement and its occupants, particularly those who act as its safeguards.
It just tells the stories of ordinary people, particularly those people leading insignificant and unsuccessful lives.
It is very Californiaish, particularly in some outdoors shots which are definitely not New York countryside.
That's a failing if you really want authenticity about a New York detective, particularly when you compare it to "Naked City" which was filmed on the streets of the city.
For once, however, he gave almost as much as he took: Brigid not only developed an arts reputation in her own right, she also managed to remain friends with Warhol until his 1987 death--something that very few people, and particularly those of Warhol's 1960s circle, ever managed.
Still Of The Night doesn't particularly rely on buckets of blood and graphic violence yet, thanks to skillful direction, atmospheric music and clever writing, it is genuinely jumpy from start to finish.
but the manifesto of the Edukators isn't particularly compelling.
The actors are all plausible and appealing, particularly Klaussner and the young but experienced BrÃ¼hl, whose sweetness and exuberance motivated the 2003 East Berlin comedy, "Goodbye, Lenin."
Sean Penn nails it, as does the rest of the supporting cast in "I Am Sam", particularly Dakota Fanning as Penn's precocious daughter in a performance that's sure to put her on the Jodie Foster track in a big hurry.
The movie weakens in the last little bit, going for the sappy (and highly unrealistic) ending - unrealistic particularly in the way Lucy's foster mother (Laura Dern) ends up handling the situation.
The acting from all concerned is solid, Patton and Meryl Streep look-a-like Kim Myers (Lisa) the two leads being particularly good.
Its not particularly scary but it is very spooky.
On the other hand, the prison life as depicted in the movie deeply affected me - particularly the issue of prison homosexuality and AIDS.
I found that the various twists and turns, and particularly the call-it-off ending, all contributed to the drama and moral dilemmas.
There were some scenes that I could have done without, particularly in the last 30 minutes of the movie, but overall I could watch this movie on a Sunday afternoon, before Goonies and after The Toy.
I was particularly fascinated by the sharp dichotomy between city and country in a highly developed nation the size of some American states.
On the other hand, there were a few passages where the plot seemed TOTALLY unrealistic (particularly in the end), that people just can't feel and act this way in the particular situation.
A touching story that I particularly liked: about a carreerist who suddenly realizes that his idea of leaving his wretched family behind and starting a new life is wrong, about a hooker who is trying to escape from the harrassing phone calls by an aberrant and their brothers who are also miserable and helpless.
The low quality of the film compared with more modern films show it up as a relic of its time and give it a documentary quality, making it seem more realistic, particularly in tandem with either poor acting (rehearse your lines!)
The ending is particularly weak.
I particularly liked the battle on the ropes holding up the lanterns which shouldn't work for any number of reasons but manages to actually be something special.
What captured me was the fact that it was based on a true story, particularly based on a Readers Digest article (which I would love to read).
I'm not particularly fond of the animations in this, either.
The only negative is some occultism, which is troubling - particularly the very real occult practice of reading spells backwards.
Instead, we get scene after poorly acted scene of the women freaking out about their ordeal, being interviewed with electrodes on their temples, undergoing various torturous experiments that are neither scary nor particularly intricate, and being stalked by a robed figure that the producers aped from Hostel.
A particularly impressive part, to me, was when Kirsten Dunst's character points to the number branded on her arm, and cries, "I wanted one of these!"
I guess I am the dissenting vote here, but I didn't particularly like GASMAN.
To the average American, some British accents are tough to understand and my mild hearing loss made this a particularly frustrating film.
But there were two aspects that I found particularly important.
I'm a die hard Madonna fan...I mean literally obsessed so i've seen, heard, and read just about everything shes ever done unfortunately i wasn't able to view this film when it originally premiered because of work but thankfully i caught a late night showing of it last night on VH1 hopefully they plan on showing it again cause i'm definitely looking forward to repeat viewings...now i have to say cause its only natural that people will be comparing this movie to "Truth Or Dare" after all they do share some similarities...like they're both documentaries for a Madonna tour..oops sorry but thats where the similarities end...the person Madonna has become is nothing like the person from TOD not that she was a bad person the but her life has changed so much...she's finally experienced some success with her acting (Evita)..she's finally won Grammys(something that should have happened long ago)...shes discovered a newfound spirituality...which i think has a lot to do with the changes i observed...but most of all and most importantly the biggest difference now is that shes a mother...and wife...2 roles that i know lot of people thought she'd never play...but she is and with great success..after almost 5 years of marriage her and Guy act more like close friends than husband and wife and it is truly beautiful to see her interact with her children...even though we don't get to see too much...but i think what was most touching was seeing how more open she is about her emotions and how much kinder she is and ultimately how much happier she is...i thought this movie was beautifully done hell i think the cinematography is award worthy...and there were a couple scenes when she was talking about peace that made me get a little choked up...particularly at the end when she went to Isreal to give a speech about that very subject...well i have to say the biggest difference between the 2 films is that TOD is for fans only...IGTTYAS is one anyone can enjoy or at least learn something from whether fan or not so check your local listings and when it comes out on DVD don't just buy a copy for yourself but for everyone you know
As I recently prepared to watch the film for the first time as an adult, I was a bit concerned that it wouldn't stand up to the high acclaim I had awarded it as a kid...particularly after noting the poor rating it has here on IMDb.
It also conveyed a feeling of raw realism that was particularly well conveyed by Margeurite Moreau and Brian F. O'Byrne.
Helen Donaldson as Mabel and Simon Gallaher as Frederick particularly have lovely voices and sing their romantic songs beautifully.
He was a very funny and talented man who never seemed particularly subservient.
Anderson and Burke are particularly funny and Blondell is a delight, very sassy and very sexy, she looks a few pounds heavier than in her 1930's Warner Bros. films but those extra curves look sensational on her, making her more Mae West-like than ever.
His desire to do something out of the ordinary is evident all through the film, but he is particularly audacious when he chooses to blank out the screen completely for a full 90 second.
I'd say the only down fall was the over use of sex and gross out humour, which I don't particularly mind in a movie, but in this movie it just lasted a bit too long.
I'm not entirely displeased with the movies, particularly "Blue Smoke", but they are so limited in what they can do within the time constraints of the film.
The Candyman (Tony Todd) has claimed responsibility for a series of grisly slayings in a particularly rough Chicago housing project, and Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen) is anxious to discredit the myths.
What I particularly enjoyed about the movie is the multidimensional development of the plot at the sociological, psychological, and parapsychological level.
As a child I always liked the music, particularly the "surprise party" theme that plays when the villains make their first appearance.
The cast is pretty good, particularly Marat Glazer and AJ Hammond.
The horns, the four fingered hands, the nasty teeth - it's particularly effective when he gets good and bloodied up.
On the other hand, the plethora of characters and occasional narrative incoherence can make it difficult at times to understand what exactly is going on, particularly when the story takes a decidedly metaphysical turn (with imagery taken straight out of "Contact") in the final half hour.
Some of the programs, particularly those hour-long ones, have  been ludicrous (A Neronian word?)
Drug addicts, particularly those planning to rob a store would skulk, not strut.
The stuntwork is particularly unimpressive as well.
It's particularly hilarious when the German driver gets blown up, and five minutes later someone is reading a newspaper with his death as the headline.
Some quite good action scenes, particularly the climax in the cane field on fire -- some wonderful images.
Crazy Love does not have a particularly good reputation these days, although it apparently caused quite a stir upon its release and that isn't all that surprising considering the subject matter; although to be honest, nothing in this film particularly shocked or offended me.
It's not that I'm particularly new to the films he creates or the films of Japanese directors in general -- the point I'm trying to illustrate is that you have to WANT to appreciate his films.
For the first 75% of this film, I wasn't particularly interested in the film.
The law was widely disregarded, and the post-World War I Weimar Republic saw a flowering of gay and lesbian culture, most particularly in Berlin.
Although it contained several points of interest I was not greatly impressed with the audio commentary; on the other hand, I was greatly impressed with two bonus interviews and particularly so by subject Kitty Fisher, a Jewish woman who recounts how a homosexual prisoner came to her aid--and whose advice ultimately saved her life.
It was particularly challenging to see Madison cope with suburban life and trying to understand how to be a housewife.
Daryl Hannah was even more beautiful than I remember and, particularly in the early scenes where she doesn't speak English shows why she was perfectly cast for the role.
Though Geena Davis is a great actress, good at playing particularly strong-willed women, the screenplay for "Angie" just meanders all over the place, from light comedy to the staunchest of melodramas.
Turturro's particularly good in it as the best friend, yet her character is left out of the final half hour, though she's a central character, and never returned to.
The musical score, by Jerry Goldsmith, is excellent (particularly "Angie's Theme") & compliments the movie wonderfully.
It's particularly funny how Arthur is shuttled into a variety of jobs, which he is assumed qualified for by a mere change of clothing (and very minor changes at that) and title.
The complexity of the relationship between conjoined twins is sensitively explored, particularly as Frances becomes jealous as he watches Blake's romance with Penny grow.
It's impossible to understand why this movie didn't get access to a wider audience, particularly since co-joined twins were, and still are, a slightly hot topic of the day.
I went in with mediocre expectations, particularly because I don't have much affinity for movies dealing with artificial intelligence.
Neither one of them was particularly interesting or realistic.
In my opinion, it is a "must see" for everyone aimed particularly at the Black bourgeois.
that I actually found myself laughing out loud many times, particularly when both leads were locked up under "arrest" in adjoining cells and touched hands through their respective windows -- now that is cinema!!
The husband, as played by Ogden Stiers, seemed particularly dense.
Alan Pakula was therefore breaking new ground, particularly as he approached the subject from a controversial angle, tackling the question of war guilt- not the legal and moral guilt of those who perpetrated the Holocaust, but the psychological guilt of those who survived it.
Kevin Kline and Peter MacNicol are excellent, the cinematography is beautiful (particularly the shots of Brooklyn Bridge) the score is haunting ...
This movie hates men, a particularly strong version of self-hatred.
There are elements of black humor, especially one particularly depraved scene involving one of the men and an office intern.
The cast chosen are all attractive, with athletic, toned bodies, their attitudes and mores appropriate for each stock character, represented by the actors / actresses without a hint of depth..they are designed specifically one-dimensional, representing the hunky bad boy, hick cowboy, Latina chick with an attitude, gay and slightly chubby goofball, shy Asian girl with martial arts skills, black intellectual(..his dialogue, particularly when he speaks "scholarly" is as artificial as it gets), hot beach bunny who comes from money and is easy to seduce, etc.
The heartache only grows, where it comes away with a swelteringly damaging climax and the closing shot is particularly haunting in its forced predicament.
My complaints about the actual subject matter of the film are minimal, as, despite some revisionist history, there apparently was some Communist infiltration of parts of the US government (particularly the State Department)--as shown by the release of records from the Soviet archives in the 1990s.
Sadly, despite the timeliness of the movie, they sure didn't do a particularly good job of it.
The music is particularly good and the dancing is first-class.
The acting is great--Lugosi and Karloff are great (I particularly liked Karloff's cool hairdo).
Jared Harris is particularly bad, but no one in this is remotely good.
I don't particularly like violent films, I'm not a huge action fan, and I dislike thrillers.
There are some weak points to the film, particularly in the early going, where belief is stretched too thin before you are drawn down into another world.
Karloff and Lugosi are particularly impressive {check out the chess match sequences}, lending the film its timeless quality, with Karloff's Poelzig apparently being based on real life occultist Aleister Crowley.
By the way, the excellent character actor Robert Keith has a particularly gritty supporting role---real gritty.
His make up consisting of slicked back widow's peak hair gives him a particularly sinister look.
The interest I have in abnormal psychology (particularly sexual) is deep and passionate, and although I am pretty well adjusted, my curiosity borders on the creepy-even to those that know me well.
It is not sensationalist, nor particularly exploitative and it is based on the true events.
Nor could she sing particularly well.
What is particularly creepy about the speech is that, for all of its strangely optimistic sermonizing about how "the human millennium will be fact" and how the computer will set about the task of "solving all the mysteries of the universe for the betterment of man" -- outwardly the Utopian dream -- the message Colossus is presenting is set against the dreadful backdrop of "disobey (me) and die."
I wasn't particularly gob smacked or incredibly impressed by the film after reading a lot good things about it, but it's the performances and the look of the film that kept me glued and amazed.
The character's are very strong here & I particularly liked Ben who gets some really good dialogue as he tries to explain things from his own perspective & what he has seen prior to meeting Barabra.
The film is brimming with exceptional acting - O'Toole turns in a particularly vicious and strong performance as General Tanz, but everyone holds their own.
It is particularly a tribute to Toulouse-Lautrec and, of course, to Jean Renoir father, Pierre-Auguste.
As a Turk with an interest in Russian history, I particularly enjoyed the film.
In those days, as actresses neared 30, studios became less interested, and Tierney found herself in roles which she was not particularly right for - or that wasted her talent just to fulfill her contractual obligations.
The colors are particularly good in the opening minutes.
All of the dialogue in this film was well-written, but Squier's lines are particularly eloquent and his references to books and historical figures are interesting.
The supporting performances are also of note too, particularly that of the excited grandfather often ready with invented tales.
The hilarious image of the Royal Family teetering on the brink of the roof of Buckingham Palace made Christmas Day 2005 a particularly joyous one for me!
Visually beautiful with pretty characterisations and some fine acting particularly from Julie Walters.
Incidentally, I'd particularly recommend the longer version rather than the 108-minute version, as that fills in some of the plot gaps that other reviewers seem to be querying.
Also, it is rather formulaic particularly in the middle of the film ... the whole misunderstanding part is so cliched.
And, there are obvious nods to not only Se7en, but Silence of the lambs (1991), also, particularly the cinematography and scene construction.
The last point is particularly interesting considering that the film never tries to outdo some notorious Italian horror movie of the early 1980s or Category-III-romp from Hongkong's 1990s.
She alone gives her role any gravitas at all; the other characters (particularly the female offspring) have clearly trained for their roles by watching crappy American reality TV shows.
I particularly disliked Hester, a whiny daddy's girl who's revealed to have had a fling with sister Mary's husband--and still manages to treat HIM like the bad guy, as if it didn't take TWO to dance that tango.
This movie, along with Pedro Almodovar's films, really opened my eyes to European films, particularly those with a signature style.
I didn't particularly LIKE the actors playing her parents but I even really liked them in these roles, very much so.
In many ways, it's a unique Peanuts story (particularly for being a musical, dramatic and emotional motion picture).
Starting with the American's murder, the story revolves around the search for the killer and I didn't find that part to be particularly interesting.
One reason why the film wasn't so popular is that just a few years earlier, the first Emmannuelle film, based on a supposedly true book by Ammanuelle Arson, was released with much hoopla - and seen by many people, most of whom did not particularly like it, myself included.
Of course, the style and look of the first film were mostly borrowed from Species and the Alien series (particularly Alien 3) so this one follows suit.
Some of the scenes are particularly entertaining and most of them have a repartees in shayris.
It was not particularly black either.
It notes her extraordinary pre-TV life including early destitution, particularly hard for someone from a once "good" family.
The characters are all severely lacking in charisma, particularly the so-wet-you-almost-don't-feel-sorry-for-him cat, the animation is lumbering and predictable, the musical number is flat and the story doesn't build naturally, instead resorting to a tacked on and completely unsatisfying finale in which the cat does a too-sudden about face and metes out a workmanlike beating to each individual rat, a production line revenge that is less than thrilling to watch.
Poor Yvette has one of those days which justifies the age-old clichÃ© "sometimes it's better to stay home in bed": her car is stolen by a creepy backwoods hick nutjob (an intense, jittery Robert Carradine, who's genuinely frightening in a rare full-blooded sicko fruitcake part), she's wrongly put in the hoosegow by the local yokel cops after loutish bartender Britt Leach tries to sexually assault her, kills one particularly unpleasant hillbilly fuzzball after he brutally rapes her (the rape scene itself is quite graphic and upsetting), breaks out of jail and subsequently goes on the lam with tough, but tender-hearted career criminal Tommy Lee Jones.
There are few pauses in a Fleming picture, and sound is particularly useful to him, because we can hear the actors to spit their dialogue at each other or punctuate the drama with gunshots and slammed-down whiskeys.
Although I particularly like the 1946 version of this classic western story with Joel McCrea, this 1929 version of The Virginian has a lot to recommend it, not the least of which is Gary Cooper in the title role.
This is a pretty good movie, particularly the hanging scene, the shootout at the end, and basically any interaction between Cooper and Huston.
(Note: very interesting comparisons can be made to later westerns, particularly "Shane" and another Cooper film, "High Noon")
Absolutely not, but critics of this movie have conveniently forgotten that most Hindi films do not have scripts that are particularly original.
That having been said, the musical numbers, particularly the play-within-the-movie run the gamut from being fun to beautiful to heart breaking.
I was particularly struck by one song not on the soundtrack, "Ishq Ishq".
:-o - I also particularly enjoyed the running joke about Aman and Rohit being a homosexual couple - one could indeed ask oneself who is really in love with who here?
She sleeps around a lot, dumps her boyfriends after one month, and in one particularly annoying scene, hears a song she likes on the radio, turns it up, and starts dancing wildly, much to Claire's bemusement.
However, I would not recommend it for the squeamish, or prudish, or the particularly emotional.
Anyone who doubts this need only sample a few episodes; particularly from the first few seasons.
To get back to my point though, to consider a show better than all the competition during a particularly bad year, no less, is quite an accomplishment on the part of the writers.
But 6 and particularly 6b were beautiful permutations on the themes developed in the more muscular first three seasons.
I was particularly struck by David Kay's comments: Obviously a man of high principle-Presumably choosing David was one of White House's unexpected blunders...I cannot imagine Bush choosing a man of integrity by design!
Sorry to sound like Scrooge, but after seeing these films once again in the late '90s, I did not particularly enjoy this late '60s Disney movie favorite, nor its sequels.
Still, any Hitchcock fan should see it, and Hitch works in his trademark cameo in a particularly clever way.
I couldn't care less about most of the guest performers brought out to share the stage, particularly the always anemic Eric Clapton and the pointless spot for Julian (son of John) Lennon.
Also particularly interesting is a three-way conversation between Berry, Little Richard, and Bo Diddly who go into great detail about their early careers, music, business, and how racism negatively affected their careers and their recognition as the earliest purveyors of rock and roll.
That's something you rarely see, particularly with musicians of this caliber, and if you love Chuck Berry music, you'll really love these rehearsals tapes.
Inevitable comparisons are made to works of Haneke, particularly to Funny Games.
The acting ranges from very good to pretty poor (particularly from guest roles).
Though I thought him to be needlessly bizarre in the beginning (particularly due to his gawky appearance), he turned out to be one of the best characters.
Eric was particularly amusing, as he effortlessly proved that not only the T100s in the Terminator movies are devoid of human emotions.
I believed him; **(here's the spoiler)** particularly when he's burning his magazines and he tells Miguelito that they're the type of people who don't forget, that they're the type who get their precious belongings and burn them.
That scene in the film is particularly pathetic and tonally wrong; but from the screen test, you can see that if David Vincent had played that part, he could have carried it off with aplomb.
The sub-plot with Wildsmith, as the diabolical, deranged scientist, really off-sets the tone of the rest of the film, particularly her scenes in her apartment, taping collective photos and clippings of Lynn on the walls.
I, particularly, like the strong female characters portrayed by Angela Alvarado Rosa and Sheryl Lee.
And I can't forget the particularly comic relationship between the doctor played by Benben, and his "thug" friend, Junie.
In fact I found the details on the drilling captivating, particularly the way those scenes were filmed as a ballet with the roustabouts moving to the rhythms of their work accompanied by the clanking of pipes and chugging of engines.
It is based on a bleak view of how an apocalypse would affect Japan, or more particularly Tokyo.
Yet, despite this not being a particularly attractive story, the haunting audio and visuals keep sucking me back every 5-8 years into this bizarre tale.
I had seen the first film in this series, as well as the David Chiang movie "The New One-Armed Swordsman", and I wasn't particularly thrilled by either one, to be honest.
I particularly liked the bed-wetting and the dirt.
This is a very dark family film that lacks all of the standard, corny Disney clichÃ©s (aside from the animal friend, but here he doesn't talk... and he isn't particularly nice at first).
particularly the staircase scene a retelling of the classic scene form battleship potempkin is brilliantly done.
I suppose his acting may have not been particularly bad, but his character seemed so manufactured and out of step with reality that he simply couldn't be taken seriously.
Treasury agent Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner) is working in Prohibition-era Chicago when he realises that a fair bit of crime, particularly bootlegging, is going unnoticed.
I was particularly impressed on how the creators captured Aquaman's (A.C.'s) underwater life.....IMDb lists the pilot under 2006...It's 2007 now...I hope they didn't drop the show; otherwise, the channel's executives have their heads up their asses.
The acting was not particularly good and the scripts could have used more polish.
This is a remarkable occurrence because I sort of loathe television, particularly sitcoms, and most especially family sitcoms.
The mid-80s atmosphere could have provided all the necessary spunk and attitude that would have provided the perfect touch to a unique story as this (Phillip and Marlowe are not the only ones trapped in a cultural generation of their own...I particularly love the deadly disco kids a penchant for cursing), but once again, a scrap shooting budget posed lots of limitations not to mention.
She looks particularly beautiful in this film and her confusion regarding her changed husband and sadness over her marriage is quite touching.
Overall, it's not particularly good.
Eventually, the four join forces to clean up the gambling-house owned by Wallachâs long-time enemy (and former partner) Kevin McCarthy: this is an elaborate and mildly suspenseful sequence â climaxed by a shoot-out between the gang and McCarthy and his (anonymous-looking) henchmen on either side of the gambling table during a particularly busy night.
This one particularly lacks acting skills, the director needs to go back to school and the special effects artists work here is an utter joke.
This is particularly hilarious because the dolt just sits there as a puppet pokes at his foot with a freaking toothpick until he falls down, at which point a big fat Blood Doll pushes a dumb-bell off a coffee table, killing him.
Shortly after a stupid ending, in which a midget flies across the room, Mr. Mascaro comes onto the screen and announces he particularly didn't enjoy that ending and thus an alternate ending comes up.
A lot of other IMDb users have complained that this episode is preachy, and I agree to a certain extent, but I also think that any film or story or TV show that shows the dangers of government can't be all bad, particularly given the astonishing political banditry that we have witnessed in America for the last 8 years.
Even the dolls themselves are bland & look cheap, none of them stand out as being 'cool' or particularly threatening.
Likewise Virgil doesn't have any particularly exciting scenes presumably because his small head made these logistically difficult.
One scene where the madman corners Virginia in an elevator is particularly laughable because of the botched delivery of the lines.
Two scenes I particularly remember:  One is when the Japanese, on the pretext of surrendering on a beach, have a machine gun hidden on the back of one of their soldiers.
This was not a movie that I particularly liked watching (perhaps it's just not my favorite genre) but it simply was one fine made movie, that is effective in basically everything it tries to achieve.
With little exposure beyond HBO screenings, Stardom continues to be true to the reality TV trend, yet, while it was ahead of its time, particularly in comments about full frontal nudity and Meg Ryan that unfortunately have come true, Arcand's film is often so subtle its droll satire flies over the heads of an unreflective public failing to grasp the humor and truth of the informed filmmaker.
Well, I particularly think that documentaries are much more important than fiction films if they are done well.
There are some disaffecting matters here though, particularly the patronising of the southern negro, all "yes'm'" and "clap yo' hands" - even if this is the way old Dixie treated its coloured inhabitants it's still painful to view the coarse stereotyping.
Wyler contributes some particularly well-directed scenes, with Davis' entry to the ball most memorable.
I wish (with many here) to touch an exposed nerve in fearful Mexico, particularly of its muggers, thugs, kidnappers, and rapists, who (as in this film) could be easily eliminated if every upright, middle-class, middle-aged citizen got himself a weapon and used it at least one time a week... We are tired of being frightened, endangered and ripped-off daily...
This happens particularly with Marcy's character, with the suggestion that things aren't quite right, and why was she visiting the all-night drug store?
Even the supporting actors are excellent, though I really did not think that Fay Bainter (playing Davis' aunt) deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress (though she got it), as her role was pretty small and not particularly transcendent.
The highlight is the awful acting, (particularly of Blackenstein himself), which makes for decent joke material, but I can't say we consistently laughed our way through this one.
The acting is generally very good, and the performances by the leads are particularly strong.
Well, to be quite honest, particularly in comparison with Atonement which did the novel perfect justice, this film completely ruined the book.
It has its positive aspects: beautiful English countryside; quasi-Vaughan Williams soundtrack; some good cinematography, particularly in the excellent opening scene, which is by far the best part of the film.
One is left with a sequence of meals and dinner parties which provide the backdrop for a chronicle of Joe's deterioration, without particularly managing to illuminate it.
I was particularly interested to see Albert Bassermann appearing in this film and recognized his voice immediately because of his next and last acting performance which was in the famous 1948 film "The Red Shoes" in which he had a fairly significant role - not bad for an actor nearing 80 years of age!
As someone who will never give up the experience of going to the movie theater to be part of a crowd in the dark, no matter how sophisticated home theaters get, I particularly admired one sentiment: in the world of Saving Star Wars, what matters most about Star Wars or any great film are the happy memories of sharing movies with people we love.
It wasn't that this movie was particularly bad.
As a long-time Holmes fan, and particularly of the Jeremy Brett interpretations, I was fully prepared to dislike this one intensely.
Aside from the earlier-mentioned telephone disparity and perhaps too-routine use of fingerprints, I was particularly aggravated by the reference at the end to James Whistler's famous work commonly known as "Whistler's Mother.
This production was not particularly accurate with regards to the Holmes stories, but it was an enjoyable program and is worth watching.
But the execution is what raises the bar here, particularly in the first third when the police bring in all the usual suspects.
It does not flinch in showing the horror that existed in Auschwitz-Birkenau and particularly in the crematoria and gas chambers.
I was particularly impressed with the performances of Steve Buscemi and Harvey Keitel.
Actually, you don't to see a particularly dastardly Darren McGavin, so it's not all bad.
Seems to feature nearly all scenes as location, or hand-held camera and it seems at times like a particularly effective episode of a 50s TV cop show - except that the content is much more brutal and sharp.
Most of the actors sleepwalk through this film(the Red Skull's daughter for example looks particularly sleepy) and there is hardly any adventure to speak of.
there is some light relief particularly in the video store where the young Lenny (Mads Mikkelsen) sorts the video "returns".
Bettis receives particularly good support from Landau, Rance Howard (father of Ron and Clint) as the aged and solicitous Chas, and Greg Travis as the expectantly sleazy landlord Byron.
I particularly was very impressed with the initial death with a hammer: without being explicit and only listening to the beating of the hammer, the scene is very impressive.
Even for pre-Hayes code cinema, this one is particularly smutty.
It appeals particularly because it has so many elements I love in a movie -- dancing, powerful women, horses, sexy men riding said horses, humor, fighting, making up.
I thought the movie was well done, but as a second generation white American it did not have a particularly deep impact on me.
All around the acting is wonderful, particularly the young boy Carlitos, played by Adrian Alonso.
Meanwhile, Allen has his sort of guardian angel/devil in one at his ear, Humphrey Bogart, pecking away at him to be more than what he is, as he's ultimately the most impressive man in Allen's life, particularly after seeing Casablanca.
Of all of Allen's films this one for me has the most timeless moments, particularly involving his many dating mishaps.
This isn't a terrible episode, but I thought it was a particularly generic and boring entry in the series.
Also, the bugs are sort of fake-y and not particularly scary.
The idea of going inside his TV and having an adventure particularly seems to appeal to him.
None of it was particularly great--and I found myself dozing off again and again.
The story is contrived and theatrical and not a particularly exciting one.
Astaire and a particularly funny Rogers, on the other hand, are breezy and sharp with the little screen time they do get.
It's not particularly bad.
The German characters range from stupid to stupider, from the parachutists that attack the secret submarine base and talk with terrible accents, to the Navy officers who question prisoners and yell a lot but never appear particularly menacing.
Though the elements are there, particularly the 'runaway' element, it's very weak.
And the lighting was still far from particularly brilliant.
We have to watch them again these old films, these first talkies, to ,be able to appreciate what modern films have to offer but also what we have lost along the way, a lot more than we may think, and particularly the magic of black and white illusion.
The ending, rewritten to give him a dramatic death scene, is particularly melodramatic and implausible.
There are some surprisingly dark moments (both in light and tone) particularly the opening scene and the nighttime exterior shots are simply magical.
The clash of cultural ideologies, as witnessed through the interactions between Alida Valli and Joseph Cotton, is particularly impressive.
"The Third Man" is a flawless film of intrigue and suspense, a summit of perfection within the genreÂ It is one of the most literate thrillers ever madeÂ It is superb1y acted by an ensemble working in an understated, effortless styleÂ Its cinematography includes some of the best black-and-white work ever doneÂ Its score of haunting zither music is still remembered, instantly familiar to anyone who ever saw the film, and now thorough1y identified with most people's impressions of ViennaÂ Finally, the direction by Carol Reed is exemplaryÂ Rarely has a motion picture represented the collaboration of so many exceptional talents... "The Third Man" may be the greatest film made in Britain since World War IIÂ   The night city terrain of "The Third Man" is unique: occupied postwar Vienna, baroque, bombed-out, decadent, patrolled by Jeeps containing representatives of the four occupying powers, an American, an Englishman, a Frenchman, and a RussianÂ  Corrupt, world-weary people hang about its fringes: the overly suave Rumanian, Popescu; the frayed violinist, Baron Kurtz; the atheistic collector of Catholic antiquities, Dr. Winkel; Crabbit, the tired head of the Anglo Cultural Center; and Anna Schmidt, the Czechoslovakian girl friend of Harry Lime, an obscure actress with forged papersÂ   Moving among them are three extraordinary principals, Holly Martins, a typical Greene creation; a hack American writer; a used- up second-rater; Colonel Calloway, a Scotland Yard type, chief of British Military Police; and Harry Lime (WeIles), the corrupt two-bit racketeer, a fully immoral, totally unreachable villainÂ   These characters wander through rain-slick night streets, in and out of shabby cafÃ©s, over the rubble of bombed-out buildings, even into a terrain vague dominated by a huge Ferris wheelÂ  The Vienna of "The Third Man" is a vast city that seems emptyÂ Its streets are always damp, and water rushes through a system of sweet-smelling sewers underneathÂ It is a world of slinking cats and biting parrots, of people taking advantage of each other without pityÂ   "The Third Man" meets the test of complexityÂ The characters interact, their stories conflict: A man who is supposed to be dead turns up alive, there is a question of whether two men or a "third man" carried off Lime's "body," there are conspiracies, deceits, and double crossesÂ   Reed owes debts to Fritz Long for some of his ideas: the geometrical shots, the montage of evidence, Welles' whistling, etc., but Reed has his own original visual style, particularly his use of a slightly tilted camera to produce so-called "Chinese angles," employed to project danger, foreboding, a twisted universeÂ He is also capable of providing suspense in the tradition of HitchcockÂ   "The Third Man" is unique in the genre for its realismÂ Despite the complexities of plot, the characters are understandable, dimensional, emotionally genuineÂa tribute to the fine ensemble playing and special, low-keyed acting style that is the cinematic equivalent of Graham Greene's writingÂ  Carol Reed was knighted for his excellence as a British filmmaker, and for a body of work that is notable for its good tasteÂ It is this taste, of course, that works so well in "The Third Man," but which has destroyed some of his other films, such as "Our Man in Havana," which require a certain amount of excess to make them workÂ
Musicians will find this video particularly valuable.
There is real philosophy here too, not particularly deep, but a millionfold more witty than anything produced by The Matrix movies.
This dramatical tone is also what drags the movie down somewhat, as it can be too intense and too much to swallow, particularly if the topic's are new to you.
I particularly love seeing Oliver Hardy playing a rare supporting actor role very late in his career.
I love the dialog in this film - particularly that of Grapewin but also of Wallace Ford as the "Great Luvalle" and Fred Kelsey as Sheriff Jenks.
This is particularly true of Ralph Bellamy, who (along with his Oscar-nominated performance in 1937's THE AWFUL TRUTH) proves once again that he is the ultimate straight man.
But everything about Salvation I loved Â the acting, the dialogue, the plot, the violence (the execution scene and the break-out from prison were particularly well-done, fun and brutal at the same time), the soundtrack, and most of all, Eric Mabius himself.
This movie also paved the way for future stars particularly Richard Dreyfuss, Ron Howard, and Harrison Ford.
The editing is particularly good, depicting the experiences of all main characters as they go through the last night of celebration before going off to college.
Time is a speeding train.We must embrace the good times of our life,particularly those of our youth,while we have them,because they are gone before we know it.This is the lesson I get while watching American Graffiti.This is not just a classic film with featuring a heavyweight Hollywood line up in their youth,it is one of the ultimate lessons of life.Times change,people change,and those changes take place with a lightning fast speed that we never seem to see coming.We owe George Lucas and everyone involved in the making of this film a great deal of gratitude for teaching us this.Also,who doesn't fall in love with Suzanne Somers while watching this.We see her only for a moment,but that's all it takes.WOW!
I particularly liked the performances by the kids.
At present Black and white films are not much wanted, particularly by new generations, but the present can be well accepted by them.
There are some nice lighting effects too; I particularly liked the 'morning mist' events, when the citizens of Bramley End begin to turn the tables.
We are not spared the horrors of war, I think particularly of the scene when the telephone operator having summoned the courage to kill her German captor is killed trying to contact someone for help, you don't see anything but because of that it is all the more powerful.
The dating scenes are particularly fun - personal highlights for me.
A good look and feel to it though, and a scene with a low-flying plane on fire that then crashes out of sight is particularly eerie.
Unpredictable action is revealed particularly at the end but also throughout the movie where we do not know constantly what is ahead of us, like it is the case with the future.
Part1 is particularly offensive at this, because he leaves out far more story than he includes, and because he contextualizes events so poorly while intruding his "edgy" style of flashbacks and flash-forwards.
However, while certainly lighthearted in comparison with Corbucci's DJANGO (1966; which I should revisit again in a couple of days) and especially THE GREAT SILENCE (1968), it's a more balanced proposition than COMPANEROS (particularly with respect to Palance's performance - quietly menacing here as opposed to the campiness of the later film) and, thus, superior to it in practically every way.
IL MERCENARIO is very comparable to the better COMPANEROS which has particularly a much better cast.
It is particularly striking that this film is able to detail the human emotions, and the bond between brothers so well.
This isn't particularly scary but it does have some creepy moments and is not at all bad.
The movie was well-regarded for many reasons particularly it's smart writing, great acting, and direction.
Well worth a watch, particularly if only to find an alternative to the inaccurate representations of autism which Hollywood thrives on.
The interviews with cast members like Harry Dean Stanton, Tom Skerritt, Jenette Goldstein and Michael Biehn were particularly enjoyable.
For the most part this is a sunnier and funnier than usual noir, particularly light in tone when the action goes south of the border, and some of this is probably due to the simpler charms of Payne Â no Bogart or Mitchum though effective enough Â but also the screenplay which keeps the hoods and pretend-hood switching guns and one-upping each other often enough that it becomes more than a little comic.
Setting: The places are very nice to visit, particularly the ones on the Esthar continent: Esthar City (a hi-tech metropolis), Tears Point (a place with statues and nice art) and Lunatic Pandora (find out for yourself) Summons: The summons (called Gfs) can be found in different circumstances: some have to be fought, some have to be drawn from enemies and some can only be obtained through special conditions and there are a number of secret ones as well.
All of the heavies were good, but I particularly liked Van Cleef and Brand (the latter with his magnificently pock-marked face).
The interview with Dee Snider about the PMRC is particularly hilarious.
What was particularly good about this was that whilst Dunn did posit who he thought created heavy metal as a genre (Black Sabbath), he does provide video footage of bands which piqued my interest in the subject and which could perhaps be argued to have created the genre themselves.
"Dr. Kildare Goes Home," made in 1940, is a particularly interesting entry into the series.
But this is also not particularly important--nor is the film unless you are watching it for historical purposes or if you are curious to see the most famous Black singing cowboy.
However, on this particularly boring afternoon, I decided to give it a watch.
The performances of the cast are exquisite, particularly David Strathairn as Whistler, the blind tech wizard.
The other regulars are good except Barbara Bain, who is not a good actress, nor is she particularly pleasant to look at.
The intention was to pump some life into it, but devotees of the series like myself were not particularly pleased).
The characters are a little wet, particularly our soulless hero, yet Karen Mok's engaging sidekick Ying Ying is a worthy substitute, and the delirious spurts of action make the whole experience quite compelling.
Dragonblade is first and foremost an animated children's feature, produced on a shoestring budget - particularly compared to the sackfuls of money thrown at the likes of Shrek.
A "must see" for those interested in drama, and particularly in Ty Power's development as a serious performer.
While THE MECHANICAL MONSTERS is far from the worst of the lot (that honor goes to THE MUMMY STRIKES), it's also not particularly noteworthy and is typical of the low quality of the series.
The guy does not end up with the girl, the protagonists don't end up successful or particularly happy except in their friendship.
The plot, while not particularly deep, acts as a sort of clever satire on most comedy-adventures.
Most people are captivated by genius no matter what the area of expertise, and genius in a young person is particularly fascinating.
The guy doesn't believe that his wife would like him back--particularly with the injury.
It could have been a really good movie, but it's dragged down by the rest of the cast - particularly the overacted, one dimensional "mad artist", the seedy atmosphere and the corny score.
It's entertaining enough if not particularly memorable, but works as a meditation on corruption and greed and the machinations of people in certain positions of power.
And the repeated use of visual effects stock footage was particularly annoying in this episode, like that same image of the laser from the ice gun shooting across the fleet.
I remember seeing Pretty Baby back in '78 but I do not recall being particularly shocked.
Aliocha's furlough is so short (48 hours) and it's such a long way to his dear home.His journey becomes an odyssey ,but ,unlike Ulysses,his happiness will be short-lived.He and the girl form one of the most touching,lovable and innocent couple you will see on a screen.Their simple joys ,particularly when they share the soldier's food,or when they meet again in the desert station,are the ones which make a life worthwhile,even in the hell which surrounds them.
During our screening at a particularly tough part for the title character, I heard people in the theater say "No, no..." The level of "buy in" and suspension of disbelief is high.
Long has a particularly good early role (even if he hadn't quite grown into his nose at this point!)
Her brothers, Juan, Joffre, and lastly, Cesare, are well cast and very believable, as well -- particularly Cesare.
It seems really contrived, particularly because several of the characters were absolute caricatures.
The sheer audacity of a children's cartoon about sex Â particularly given the typically innocent and wholesome image of Little Red Riding Hood Â is something to be applauded.
I originally saw this film shortly after the release of Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill and while I was impressed by the amount of bloodshed, I didn't hold the film in particularly high regard.
While Darcy seems to be taking a repressed liking to Elizabeth, she is unaware of it, and grows increasingly hostile towards him, particularly after learning from George Wickham that he behaved quite badly towards him.
It is faithful to the book, particularly capturing the spirit of the book and the energy and constant tension of the story.
They decide to set some seismograph's up near the base of the volcano to measure it's activity, the group set off but hadn't counted on there being a 30 foot genetically created 'supergator' that kills & eats anyone it comes across & it's heading straight for the holiday resort where it has plenty of tasty humans to pick from...  King of the rip-off cheapies Roger Corman strikes again, this straight-to-video Sci Fi Channel creature feature was executive produced by Corman while it was co-written & directed by Brian Clyde & isn't anything particularly special although it passes the time harmlessly enough if you don't expect too much.
It seems just about every tourist on Hawaii is traipsing through this particularly patch of forest where the supergator lives, there are random people like models, dope heads, fishermen, lovers, waterfall watchers, random guy's driving jeeps & vulcanologist's walking around.
The acting isn't anything particularly memorable.
Charles Durning is OK as "Sperm Whale," but the rest of the actors, particularly Tim McIntire and Perry King, are extremely annoying; mugging it up, trying to be cool-funny.
King has a particularly regrettable scene with sexy dominatrix Phyllis Davis and then kills himself!
I'm sure that all the actors involved in this rubbish (particularly James Woods) must cringe at every mention of it.
The treatment of homosexuals as simpering, lisping queens is incredibly offensive, particularly the gentleman in the park walking a pink poodle and savouring an encounter with 'a naked man tied to a tree'.
The cast of terrific actors are particularly embarrassing in their thankless roles, none more so than Lou Gossett Jr, Charles Durning and Robert Webber (the latter especially degraded by his part as a callous superior officer with an immoral personal agenda).
"Little Red Riding Hood" is just one basis for this theoretical school; Edmund Spenser's _The Faerie Queene_, and particularly Book I on the Redcrosse Knight, is another.
Most everyone in his life, but particularly his wife, pays a price for his lack of insight.
Lady Snowblood isn't the most widely known Samurai Film in the International movie market, but it is certainly worth a viewing, particularly for those into Samurai/swordsplay pictures.
I was surprised to find a stylish film with a solid story (which can actually be unpredictable at times), adequate action sequences (spruced up by heavily stylized blood spurts) and good acting (particularly from the female lead).
Some may be turned off by the latter part, particularly if they fail to see it as intentional.
Apart from the gorgeous layouts, the brilliant gags and the wonderful performance by Mel Blanc, 'Robin Hood Daffy' is also notable for how Jones uses the characters, particularly Porky Pig.
Although it originally premiered as a miniseries on Italian television, "The Best of Youth" arrived in America in the form of a not particularly viewer-friendly, six-hour-plus, all-at-one-sitting theatrical release.
My interest waned a bit during some segments, particularly the historical ones that aren't explained that well.
The series is particularly good at capturing the camaraderie amongst old male friends over the years and the intimate interactions of members of a family, particularly with children, with a strong theme of the importance of both as an anchor.
This was particularly devastating to General Dallaire and he details his frustration, guilt and subsequent depression in a very moving way in his excellent book.
But the filmmakers have decided to point a blaming finger at the "West" particularly the United States for ignoring the plight of the Rwandans and allowing the genocide to happen.
Richard Griffiths is a particularly smarmy but amazingly understanding Lord of the Manor.
The story had me captivated from beginning to end, with stellar performances by all cast members, particularly Claire Danes and Billy Crudup (who I truly believe is Oscar worthy for his portrayal of Edward Kynaston).
Although it takes place in Restoration England, the themes throughout are universal, particularly male/female roles and gender identity.
The air-borne combat is made more open, particularly when playing as the US, which has access to three different types of planes, a transport helicopter and an attack chopper(and that's in addition to the special abilities).
Although a bit of weepy, well done, particularly Angela Landsbury's performance.
Namely, if you're a strict fan of recent American "scare-core" movies and you don't particularly go for foreign films, you should probably steer clear of these.
There are no particularly outright scare moments, but the ambiguity of the story and the elements of the story are why the short can be a little disturbing.
The film actually deals with some particularly relevant issues, particularly the things that we do to be considered attractive and to return to former glory, but the means by which the film makes such a commentary is very unpleasant.
There is nothing particularly compelling, also Dumplings does make a particularly strong effort and Cut is particularly vibrant, if a little shallow.
The music is downright nightmarish and particularly the chewing-noises, made when Mrs. Lee eats the dumplings, sent cold shivers down my spine.
And Harry puts her through her paces as they attempt to track down this particularly volatile gang, who seemingly put little value on human life as they cut their swath through the city of San Francisco and pursue their own `for the people' agenda, which in reality means they want to get their hands on as much cash as possible, and plan to hold the city hostage to do it.
But, as usual with her movies, it is Irene Dunne who makes this almost unwatchable, particularly in close-ups, when her ever-visible tongue threatens to flop out of her usually open mouth.
The only problem is that it all gets a little tired, particularly at the end with a prolonged scene having to do with Grant in the attic.
As others have pointed out, the script has some holes, particularly the fact that a woman returning after 7 years gets no publicity.
A high-powered cast for this type of cartoon - particularly Matthau - helps enormously.
I get that it's a homage, but it's just not a particularly effective one.
The one fault i'd say is that the passage of time is not particularly well expressed particularly right at the end of the film when what seems to be a present day Ewan is wearing the exact same outfit as in the next scene which must be set sometime after.
I find it hard to believe that this ill conceived script ever made it past treatment stage, particularly when so many established UK film companies like CH4 were involved in its development and finance.
The characterizations are three dimensional, lived in, particularly those of Bainter and Hull as Lupino's folks.
The basics of this tale (for those that know them) survive intact its retelling through the particularly distinctively visual, sometimes abstract or symbolic approach of Webber and Watson, and its protagonists are all clearly identifiable and well portrayed by the actors.
The movie begins in a pretty strange way, particularly when we consider the year it was made in.
I am particularly struck by the comments of people who actually knew either the real characters or the actors who portray them in this production.
While I must say that I don't particularly like beauty pageants this is a film that I found to be engaging.
The murders are very mean and cold-heartedly illustrated (the death of a young unintelligent boy, strangled amid squealing pigs is particularly unsettling) which probably makes this film the most disturbing of the entire 50's decade.
What is particularly interesting is the many characters he plays in this film.
But regardless of the reason, in my opinion it doesn't add up to a particularly good film.
4) I particularly appreciated the acting of Neil's father.
His particularly unorthodox methods of teaching soon make one realize that poetry is not something to do with rhyming words or fantasy lands, but that poetry is in effect a direct means to ones disposition in life, a disposition which would ring success in all avenues.
He's actually not particularly believable as a crusading district attorney out to bring down a ring of contract killers.
That being said, and Bogart being Bogart, this is still a top-notch noir thriller, with some of the best character actors in the business (Ted DeCorsia, Roy Roberts, Jack Lambert, Bob Steele, Zero Mostel) filling out the cast, a dark, oppressive and somewhat claustrophobic tone, and some particularly--considering the time in which it was made--gruesome moments (the scene between sadistic hit-man Bob Steele and gang member Danny Dayton, when it slowly dawns on Dayton that *he* is the intended victim, will make your hair stand on end).
*Anyone dies/explodes/gets shot in a particularly amusing/gory way.
It particularly sounds worse when whining or screaming.
This tragic love story isn't particularly new, but the way they interwoven the eastern culture with the western.
As Dum and his colleague raid the hideout of traitors to Fai, the film plays a particularly extravagant stunt twice, offering the title card "Did you get that?
I watched the (allegedly) uncut, letterboxed rereleased version, and apart from an unpleasant rack scene, it's not particularly strong stuff.
The film is about a particularly evil judge (Christopher Lee) who takes great delight in sentencing people to death and maltreatment.
DELICIOUS LITTLE DEVIL is particularly valuable in that it's the first of her silent comedies to rise from the archives and costars the legendary Rudolph Valentino as her beau.
A particularly funny(that's right funny) part was when the shark trapped a group of people and they were all moaning and crying.
Then again, the entire cast was wonderful, particularly Chris Noth, Brad Johnson, Tom Berenger, Dale Dye, and especially scene-stealer Gary Busey.
The film has exciting cavalry-Indian battle scenes, and the second clash is particularly novel in its execution because it is done by Indians.
In a way, The Circus isn't a masterpiece, nor a perfect film, nor even a particularly great one -- but in another way, it is all those things and more.
The gods were particularly punishing to heroes with too much pride.
The opening 'Lilium' is particularly powerful, and differing versions feature prominently throughout - lending its intensity to emotive scenes.
His comedy is admittedly quite bawdy, as Benny makes men look like idiots and lectures mangling the English language, but I like bawdy and particularly it suits Benny to a tee.
The quality is a little grainy and washed out, but the shorts are still a lot of fun, Tuppertime especially is priceless particularly with the vicar who comes on the air with his flies undone, and Benny is as wonderful as ever.
The film has some nice scenery and entertaining scenes, particularly the shark capture.Rush hour director Ratner has made a great film, which only really lacks style and good pacing.
It certainly wasn't funny nor was it particularly entertaining.
The movie could use more of an ending, and it does treat itself as being "true" particularly at the end.
Filmed on location in Camden, Maine with some interiors at the studio, the movie has an authentic feel, particularly in comparison to previous pictures shot entirely on backlots.
I don't particularly like scary movies, that's true.
Seeing naked or nearly naked men, particularly within the context of homosexuality, does not offend me, it just does not interest me.
The movie is painfully unfunny and most of the characters are awful--particularly Dana Carvey's disgusting character.
What's particularly intriguing is that the film doesn't condescend to its audience.
Willie Best and particularly George Reed provide additional fine work.
The satire seemed to me to be to be quite precise - particularly in its analysis of the average actor's life - which is a lot more like "For Your Consideration" or Ricky Gervais's brilliant "The Extras" than anything you're likely to see on Entertainment Tonight that is for sure.
Guest and Levy fully capture the superficial pandering that occurs when the buzz is in full swing, and they particularly ridicule the ignorance and outdated thinking of those who find themselves in this lightning-in-a-bottle situation.
Furthermore, having such recognizable actors as Claire Forlani and particularly Sandra Oh show up for bit parts in For Your Consideration is more distracting than anything, and breaks the illusion of the self-contained world that worked so nicely in Guest's previous efforts.
This documentary takes a very honest and unflinching look at modern-day racism is suburban America, particularly how people like Bill Riccio take advantage of kids who have nowhere else to turn.
In contradiction with some other comments, I didn't found Agents Secrets a particularly good psychology study about secret agentsÂ So don't expect a Simenon-like experience, with a relatively bleak plot as an excuse to paint vivid psychological portraits.
I found these particularly funny in the "hijack" episode (which is also my favourite episode).
I particularly like "Look Out East".
The fact that none of the characters are particularly memorable, the fact that the news stories are not particularly surreal and the fact that each "channel" starts to feel repetitive even before the end of the episode are all deliberate.
Bill Paxton looks particularly lost as the psychotherapist in love with Aurora.
Well, after Jon Stewart last year, I guess that anyone might seem a little weak, but I liked how she did (particularly that trick with Scorsese).
As Audrey, Walden is stuck with seriously bogus wise-cracks which are groan-inducing, particularly when she challenges Ice Queen to combat.
And yet, "White Rabbit" proves its value by laying the groundwork for a lot of the themes that will be dominant in the future: Jack's leader role; the Jack-Locke "man of science, man of faith" dynamic (the dialogue in this scene is particularly well-written); father-son relationship problems; ghostly manifestations on the island (already introduced in "Walkabout", but now made more clear), specifically connected to the characters; flashbacks that go back to the character's childhood; the realization that the survivors will probably have to stay there for a long time; etc.
Sun thanks Jin for getting her water, and he replies "That's what husbands do," although up til then, we hadn't seen Jin as a particularly desirable husband, and the next episode, "House of the Rising Sun", gives a closer look at Sun's perspective of how he has been on and off the island.
So, this really is a rather uneventful film, and the only thing you can say about it is that it's not particularly badly made and features OK acting.
Perfectly acceptable Irwin Allen drama, with some funny special effects - I particularly like it when they put a water tank in front of the lens, trying to simulate a high-water mark for a "dry shot" scene - and some even funnier acting.
The dancing in this film is amazing, to be sure...you will wonder how people can move like that, so fast, so crazy, particularly when you see a 4 year old girl or a 300 pound woman do it.
I particularly enjoyed the scenes in the publisher's office, and of course all the scenes between Harold and Jobyna!
By this juncture, the old Marx Brothers routine had become a pale imitation of a caricature of its old self..  AS a Film or more particularly as a Marx Brothers starring vehicle, we must give THE BIG STORE ** Â½.
Tony Martin has a song early on in the film that's okay, but doesn't exactly fit the tone of the film, and later, he does another "big musical production number", called "The Tenement Symphony", that is bizarre, to say the least, but not particularly funny.
It's also not a great way to introduce anyone to their work (as they're likely to not be very interested in seeing more), and there are far better films for casual viewers who are not particularly interested in the Marx Brothers.
Otherwise the film could be used as a textbook example of lazy, sloppy screen writing and a checklist of mainstream romance centered (if not outright 'rom-com') comedy clichÃ©s, pounded into the audience's head through drawn out, dreary slapstick lacking the necessary acerbic spark to be any sort of funny, and a particularly wearisome array of cathartic emotional speeches.
One scene has Kate Hudson's character lying in bed with her fiancÃ©, expressing her sorrows at how alone she feels and completely ignoring his attempts at consoling and comforting her - while a particularly insulting moment in a film chock full of them, it also demonstrates how utterly unimportant the men in the film are whatsoever.
I do however agree that both Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway (particularly) are fine actresses, and are both very pleasing to the eye.
Columbo always knows how to work a prime suspect and does it by being fascinated in their work particularly chess.
One particularly astounding display of gunplay features Lynn, clad in a tight white body suit, calmly eviscerating an army of bad guys in a shiny high-rise.
The chess environment serves as a particularly appealing and suitably competitive back-drop to this episode for it facilitates an individualised battle of wits between Columbo and murderer.
The plot is refreshingly original and well-thought-out and the script adds different dimensions to those found in the usual Columbo story, particularly as the murderer has to have two separate attempts at killing off his rival.
I particularly loved the scene where Clayton plays chess with a series of fawning opponents as Columbo grills him.
Chandler-esque detective yarn, great atmosphere, clever dialogue, and perfectly cast (particularly Michael Dunn, probably the greatest Little Person actor in Hollywood history).
Woody Harrelson does a fine job with his role, and plays a particularly interesting character.
Who cares whether aspects of the show are predictable or whether it is particularly realistic?
He has quite a few effective moments, particularly when it comes to displaying the supernatural strength of the undead.
One of the most annoying aspects of this film is the incessant product plugs, particularly those of Gap, which will not even be around in 2054.
Spielberg is to be particularly congratulated on how completely he has avoided the unimaginative dystopia of "Blade Runner".
It's dark, compelling, and disturbing- particularly in a scene where he has to exchange his eyes for protection...
Much has been said of Chaney's inappropriateness for the part: well, I liked him overall and he was quite effective in his various confrontations with Paige (particularly during the climax, one of the best in the Universal canon) or vampire hunters J. Edward Bromberg and Frank Craven; he may not look like a ladies' man but then Lugosi himself was past his prime in THE RETURN OF THE VAMPIRE!
There is not a wasted moment in this film, and I particularly liked the first scene with the windy backdrop, adding an air of foreboding to what was unfolding.
I found this series to be a well crafted and accurate view of a particularly dark time in history when ambition and zealotry brought terrible violence to western Asia.
Louise recalls her story, which mostly revolves around her unrequited love for a particularly callous man named David Sutton (played marvelously by Van Heflin).
Personally, I think he does just fine, particularly during the final scene when he finds his coffin ablaze and rails at Robert Paige's Frank Stanley, yelling "Put it out!
What is particularly shocking about this film is the way in which director, Curtis Bernhardt baits his audience with snippets of murderous intent that are played out for maximum effect and then, later exposed as merely the ravenously dangerous thoughts of the film's protagonist.
Script, photography, direction, music are exemplary, the 4 leads are memorable, but Crawford is particularly riveting.
This is the perfect film for a rainy Sunday afternoon particularly if you've experienced any type of loss be it love, a death or that sweet innocent belief of true love and happy ever afters.
These people do not talk or act like real people at all (Pfieffer's speech at the end is particularly horrible--give her credit for saying it without gagging!
Despite its pedigree, LUCKY LUCIANO is not a particularly good movie.
Well, in an old film, particularly a Three Stooges short that is 68 years old, you're going to get a lot of strange name-calling.
As Roger Ebert said in his review, brilliant, literate film noir with excellent performances...particularly Milla Jovovitch as the femme fatale.
On a positive note (at least for us guys) Milla Jovovich is particularly sexy in this movie in her wardrobe and brief Stockholm-syndrome-fling with Jackson.
It let people (particularly non-gamers) see what the players were visualizing without looking silly, and the art landscapes were nicely drawn.
The film opens with a particularly gruesome death scene - which got my attention straight away - and it is suggested it was caused by these people using voodoo dolls.
The child actors are particularly fine.
It packs a rather mean punch and while not particularly memorable, it's still pretty good entertainment.
Although most Americans have little knowledge of his work other than Star Wars, Alec Guinness produced an amazing body of work--particularly in the 1940s-1950s--ranging from dramas to quirky comedies.
I particularly love his comedies, as they are so well-done and seem so natural and real on the screen--far different from the usual fare from Hollywood.
One sequence, where he tries to run a dance hall at the end of the pier and is merrily strutting his stuff on the dancefloor with some local hottie when the authorities arrive to complain, is particularly memorable if only for the mad grin on Guinness' face as he boogies.
The result is that Chaney's character achieves full pathos, despite not being a particularly subtle performance.
sometimes we get caught thinking 'why would he do that' when a character commits a particularly selfless act, and I think that is a big part of the writer's intent.
His voice-work, as an imitation of Williams', isn't particularly great, and I feel it was a bit of a let down, considering how versatile Dan's voice is in real life, and here, he just sounds like a mildly tweaked version of Homer Simpson.
This film is worth watching only for Dan's appearance; if you're not a fan of his work, and you are a fan of the original, then seriously, avoid this one if you don't particularly feel like ruining what the first one did to you.
But the standouts are Leigh Whipper and particularly Roman Bohnen, who play Crooks and Candy, respectively.
I'm not a great fan of Gary Sinise's remake, particularly as to how the ending was handled.
It's not a black-and-white film that particularly exults in its black-and-whiteness.
It's particularly gory and bloody, but this just makes it all the more realistic.
Thankfully, there's one actor that shoots to the moon and outshines everybody by a mile, particularly for this kind of project.
A thriller with supernatural undertones and a particularly intriguing plot, it certainly stands out from the main body of his work - there are action scenes, and they're well handled, but this is much more of a character-led mystery.
Ricco has the violence I've come to expect from this kind of movie Â including one particularly nasty scene that makes something like the cut-off ear in Django look like child's play.
It's not a particularly gory movie, but there's plenty of stabbing and butchery going on to please the gorehounds.
She attempted to capitalize on her sex appeal with various movies particularly "Modesty Blaise" a sexy action film in the 007 vein.
If you LIKE pain and want to see other Jerry Lewis monstrosities, see most of his flicks after his breakup with Dean Martin (particularly Slapstick of Another Kind) and avoid The King of Comedy (where Lewis did an excellent job playing it straight).
This overlooked gem has no less a fan than Martin Scorsese, who particularly loved the waxy floor opening credits sequence.
But, as usual with her movies, it is Irene Dunne who makes this almost unwatchable, particularly in close-ups, when her ever-visible tongue threatens to flop out of her usually open mouth.
The only problem is that it all gets a little tired, particularly at the end with a prolonged scene having to do with Grant in the attic.
As others have pointed out, the script has some holes, particularly the fact that a woman returning after 7 years gets no publicity.
I really think that Ms. Crawford ("Eva Phillips") kept a bunch of writers on-salary to write these movies particularly for her.
There are some great supporting performances as well, particularly from James Earl Jones, Willem Dafoe and Henry Czerny.
I have read some quite negative reviews of this film, with many being upset by the lack of coherence with the book despite taking it's characterisations etc...I agree that the film does not follow the book particularly well but it is a film, for film watchers, not a book or a film for book readers so stop criticising it on that level.
We found this particularly amusing since, a half-hour previous to this point, the movie depicted several dozen canvas tents exploding.
The other characters are similarly situated and nicely contribute to the flow of the story (the subplot with Okazaki and Kanae is particularly ingenious.)
The acting is terrific, particularly Miki Nakatini as Mai, burdened with a psychic capacity she doesn't want and drawn into the mystery against her will.
Maybe Nakatani is not to blame; Mai isn't a particularly strong heroine.
She's also not particularly attractive.
While Corey and the cast, particularly Lucille Watson, perform ably under Vincent Sherman's direction, "Harriet Craig," which was based on a Pulitzer Prize winning play, is Crawford's show.
There are many memorable scenes in this film, but some that I thought were particularly good were the scenes where Harriet visits her mentally ill mother in a sanitarium.
Director Zacarias creates some pretty decent moments, the sequence where the hand reforms & is inter-cut with footage of real mummified bodies is particularly effective.
But all these seem like nothing compared to one particularly mean-spirited subplot, in which a young American girl, Sara, is raped by one of Hamdo's soldiers.
It also deals with some very compelling character studies, particularly in the cases of the children held prisoner at Hellywood.
Lemmon, Falk and May all play your stereotypical neurotic New York Jews (Lemmon is affecting a particularly embarrassing accent), which is supposed to be inherently funny but isn't.
I particularly enjoyed the hypothesizing about "Suicide TV," and the skewering of America's obsession with all things sensationalized.
Not one to be particularly impressed by the vast majority of so-called "great" things, it took me a while after my first viewing of Life Is Worth Losing to absorb what I had seen and several repeated viewings shortly thereafter to understand I was witnessing a truly great comedian, a genius, THE master of his craft.
The high kicking carnage dished out by Cynthia, particularly in her HK movies is just hot, really darn hot!
But the parked car wasn't particularly low to the ground.
But there are some problems with the script as well, particularly in the crew's interaction with one another.
Mr. Spock is given merciless hell by the others any time he makes a decision, particularly from Dr. McCoy and a specialist, Lt. Boma.
The acting was superb throughout but especially by Eddie Spears, August Schellenberg and an actor I particularly admire Michael Greyeyes.
I sort of liked the main characters (particularly Fiona Loewis'), to be totally honest.
Much of the plot centres around some genuinely comic sequences, and as such doesn't necessarily come across as particularly true to life.
I particularly appreciated his low- angle wide shots.
I'm just an average Joe, watching a movie to be entertained - not particularly looking for the higher message.
The performances from the three leads are brilliant, particularly Adrien Brody whom I thought was going to be out of his Oscar-winning element but actually fit in so well that I preferred him to the rest of the cast.
Best of all is Carne's style, completely unrestrained, unafraid to go for 'gag'-like effects (the mugging of dandies for buttonholes is particularly piquant), beavering through fairy-tale sets that do for London what TOP HAT did for Venice, completely at ease with the farce, yet still pulling off evocative shots that reveal the emotional reality behind the nonsense.
The air-borne combat is made more open, particularly when playing as the US, which has access to three different types of planes, a transport helicopter and an attack chopper(and that's in addition to the special abilities).
On the whole they were brilliant, particularly 'In Angel Gear', and most had the same feel of Dogs In Space.
I particularly like the ending of the story.
While there's nothing particularly wrong with format, that's all there is to this film, it just repeats over and over as he tours different cities.
I must admit that I am not particularly drawn to action movies, but after seeing Frequency I have tried to change my attitude.
Graham) is particularly amusing.
Played by John Doe, Trucker is as sensitive as he is wise, although neither trait is particularly apparent whenever Zo (Alice Krige) is in the room.
Jensen Ackles stole the show--anyone who watches Supernatural knows he's got great comedic timing--but the other roles were well-played, too (particularly Clea DuVall), and the story/characterization unfolded believably (for a rom-com) and enjoyably.
Elizabeth Shue is particularly wasted--emoting to beat the band in a role that is one-note (well, one-and-one-half) and tiresome.
We only know history (particularly ancient history) from bits and pieces passed down through the ages.
Certain sequences (particularly the red light district near the beginning) feel as though we are on some kind of dark ride, gliding past a series of rooms containing all manner of curiosities.
Though Nino Rota composed a substantial amount of the score (particularly the oddly phrased melody heard at the end and the new emperors parade), a great deal of the music is either world folk music (such as the Balinese Monkey Chant) or avant garde electronic compositions (Ilhan Mimaroglu, Andrew Rudin, and Todd Dockstader among others).
One can admire Fellini for tackling such an ambitious concept and it is due to he and his collaborators (particularly Danilo Donati) that this film achieves so much.
I wasn't particularly enthralled with the idea of this film before seeing it but there was nothing else good on, so I gave it a try.
I am not particularly a fan of David Fincher and his work.
There are many useless scenes that could've been thrown out (particularly this one scene in which it shows all the things, which could've happened to prevent Daisy being hit by a cab, which leaves you thinking in the 5-minute section that feels more like 30 minutes which left me thinking "when will this end???").
Somehow, amid all the chaos, Yun-Fat and particularly Leung manage to lend some dramatic pathos to their roles.
Not particularly.
The film doesn't display this as a horrific event, but rather as part of the scenery, cannon fodder; the film even gets pretty despicable amusement from this, particularly in one scene involving a baby (don't worry!
The soundtrack was appropriate but not particularly great.
Chgarlie has said this tour is when the bulls..t level reached its highest point, particularly when Truman Capote and Princess Radish show up.
The craziness of tour life is captured in some particularly amazing and unforgettable scenes.
In reading some of the comments from other posters on this board, I was struck by the number of those who took issue with the picture's overt message about guns, particularly the number of times the subject was brought up and reinforced throughout the story.
It's a very personal movie from a man who, particularly in the early years of his career, openly explored his own morality.
Michael Scala is particularly good as the leader of this crew, constantly irritated and harassing the others but in a good-natured way.
I particularly liked Skyhawks because most of my immediate family are/were licensed pilots (Dad, Mom, me), and it was near unbelievable to see a kids' show devoted to our passion.
The cast were superb, particularly Barrie as the conceited 'Rimmer', the scripts cleverly exploited the fine line between comedy and sci-fi, and for my money it was one of the best sitcoms of the '90's, alongside 'I'm Alan Partridge' and 'Father Ted'.
It's a strictly TV cast, particularly Ward and Linden Ashby.
He is nicknamed "Singapore Sling" by the pair, is tied to a bed, and is humiliated in various ways (one particularly interesting one being when the Mother urinates in his face while administering electroshock.)
Nikolaidis main inspiration clearly goes back to the golden years of widely acclaimed noir-cinema, particularly Otto Preminger's "Laura" and John Huston's "The Maltese Falcon", as the primarily storyline introduces a lonely detective desperately seeking for his lost and unreachable muse Laura.
I particularly enjoyed seeing Pai Ying in a heroic role as Gen. Shih, and hawk-faced Miao Tien as the evil Commandant's lieutenant.
The character development of Ku, is particularly impressive - initially refusing to grow up and take on responsibilities such as marriage, and eventually becoming a cunning freedom fighter and protector of a child.
The fight sequences I did not find particularly thrilling except for the monks (they were exceptional).
All this takes place in the most beautiful Chinese countryside, sometimes bathed in light (the use of sunlight and the monk is particularly impressive) and sometimes in dramatic thunderstorms, making the film even more of a delight to watch.
Like I don't particularly like it in horror films(with some exceptions) where for the first 10-15 minutes they immediately introduce the main characters and try WAY to hard for them to automatically be likable.
The tone may often seem a bit maudlin, particularly the scene requesting audience participation near the end, yet this film was released in mid 1947 and life for the intended audience was as bad as or worse than our fictional couple.
All in all, a worthwhile film, particularly for those with an interest in Kurosowa or postwar Japan.
There also happens to be a little explosion, a little explosion caused by the cigarette that Luchino dropped when being pursued by surveillance for having an illegal substance, which doesn't particularly mix well with some fuel that got spilled.
This one does the intellectual dishonesty in a particularly coy, pseudo self-effacing manner, making it in its own way even more dishonest.
Anyone out there who's ever studied under a particularly brilliant professor will know exactly what I mean- they usually have quite earth-shatteringly amazing ideas and thoughts that they are woefully unequipped to communicate to the rest of us mortals.
Thora Birch must be trying to earn indie cred by appearing in this right around the time her career was taking off, and she does have one of the better moments towards the beginning involving playing a Russian roulette-type game with an almost completely loaded gun, but the fact that the gun is loaded is the only fascinating part about this scene because her acting isn't particularly stellar.
They were particularly good at the round where they were given two completely random lines to incorporate into a sketch.
O's repression and sense of honor make him the sympathetic rival, particularly when it becomes clear that he isn't restrained from engaging his enemy, but rather he doesn't know how to act on his own behalf.
The film's biggest flaw comes from the confusing mix of languages, particularly the use of English.
However, the large majority of human rights abuses, particularly those committed against civilians, were committed by the RUF and their allies, the Armed Forces Revoluntionary Council (AFRC).
This is a totally awesome movie not because of awesome special effects, not because it is particularly well written, not because it is at all believable because trust me it's not very realistic at all.
The acting was okay and the CGI was not particularly great, but what do you expect from such a low budget film?
Even the performances are all pretty good, at least as far as these "B" movies go, although the script gets progressively more desperate as the movie goes on, particularly during the excellent TARANTULA style finale when the giant spider wreaks havoc in the city.
One does get the sense that Jolson is particularly uncomfortable in front of the camera (as he would be for the remainder of his career).
This is particularly true of Police assigned to quiet residential areas or central business districts; who have never worked in some of the hell holes of precincts/districts where the low guy on the lowest rung of the socio-economic ladder collides with the most brutal, unspeakable street crime.
Oddly prescient (it's even projected onto a large screen), the technology is otherwise hilarious, particularly in the explanation of the murder technique.
The plot is not very clever, and though some of the characters are interesting (particularly the male lead and his two masters), they all dissolve into not very clever and not-as-funny-as-they-could-have-been stereotypes once the central plot comes into focus.
With limited screen time in the second half of the picture, George Macready as the prosecuting attorney, and Barry Kelley as Judge Drake offer solid support to the courtroom drama, particularly Kelley who's called upon to rein in the opposing lawyers who viciously snipe each other.
It stars Humphrey Bogart in his first film after leaving Warner Brothers, though it comes off like a Warner Brothers film made in the 1930s - it has a real "Dead End Kids" feel to it, particularly in the beginning.
* Explosions which resemble the aftermath of a particularly spicy vindaloo than huge bombs being detonated.
But the trial scenes which take up a substantial part of the film suffer from the usual procedural inaccuracies and are not particularly effective dramatically.
His trophy wife isn't particularly interested in him and he longs for his long dead first wife and his idyllic youth.
There's no explanation given as to when this is supposed to be taking place, but that doesn't matter, we can clearly tell that this is the 1970s, due to the groovy "space-age" decor and the fact that several of the cast members have a sleazy 70s porno look to them, particularly Alex Cord (which sounds like a porno name anyway!).
The one thing that keeps the movie from being better is the overall silliness of the situation, particularly the death scenes.
One begins with some particularly graphic (possibly real) shots of a slaughterhouse.
The life of the shanty-dwellers in the third segment is particularly grim.
I saw other films at the festival (particularly "Fingerprints" and "Last Rites of the Dead") that were made for much less money and yet were a thousand times better.
It feels like another film in a long line of by-the-numbers supernatural thrillers that have come out of Hollywood in the last five years such as Stir of Echoes, Hide and Seek, Secret Window, The Sixth Sense, The Exorcism of Emily Rose, Skeleton Key, The Mothman Prophecies, Bless the Child, The Forgotten, The Others etc, etc (Some of these films are quite good, but you get my point)   I have become very bored of creepy houses (this one was particularly un-imaginative) creepy cornfields, creepy little girls in night dresses, creepy dolls and scarecrows, creepy children's drawings, creepy children's songs, windows blowing open in gusts of wind etc, etc   It is also frustrating when EVERYTHING vaguely frightening is accompanied by a thunderous drum beat, even things like a shot of a child's teddy bear hitting the floor during a flashback!
I remember this as a rather odd affair, very male, not particularly woman friendly.
Weisz is as ephemeral as footballing success, particularly as she is a device and not really a woman in this drama, and footballing success is as ephemeral as happiness itself, so the movie reaches a predictable conclusion particularly if you know anything about the tournament.
The film resembles a sitcom in that the humour arises out of the situations in which the characters find themselves rather than from any particularly witty dialogue.
I particularly admired the ending (spoiler ahead): sticking the "bindi" on George Washington's forehead - an excellent subtle invitation for a critical look on what drives work (and inevitably life) that the movie did not pretend to tackle head-on yet illustrated throughout: after all, placing the missing piece isn't foreign to Seattle.
These include the wonderfull supporting cast of section 8 that dwelled at the resort, particularly Ed and Fitz, that Dave led.
Some pedantic souls might quibble about the authenticity of Andrea's West Ireland accent (she's from Dundalk on the east coast), or notice the less-than-convincing simulated violin skills (she's a pianist & tin-whistle player by trade), but no-one can dismiss her emotional depth or charismatic screen presence, particularly in this short-subject film.
What I particularly liked about the locations visited was that producers for the most part avoided Europe (save for Russia, which was interesting) and visited other places, more interesting places, like South America and the Middle East.
I was actually a bit surprised to see a French film that realistically depicted the Soviet Union--particularly in the later years of the Stalin regime.
They weren't particularly great dramatic actresses, they just riveted our attention with their visual and physical comedy.
Besides some of the horrible acting, there was a weird part in the plot that I didn't particularly like.
Besides, i particularly appreciated the acting of the crazy girl, Hye-jeong Kang (which i already saw in Old Boy) which is also probably the best character.
Penn gave a delicate yet fierce performance particularly at the end, when she lashes out at Will for all the preceding predicaments that he had caused.
Matt Phillips is particularly effective, funny and even touching, showing the vulnerability of his character even through drag.
This movie is a touching human interest story and gives the average viewer a better appreciation of the overwhelming challenges faced by those who must deal daily with disabilities, particularly adjustment to quadriplegia.
Perhaps the animals would have looked fake in Technicolor, but they are quite impressive in black and white, especially the predatory allosauruses (although they are rather cute in close up when they fastidiously lick their digits after a particularly juicy chunk of flesh or snarl like Elvis Presley.)
I thought Lewis Stone particularly impressive as Sir John Roxton.
Most of the scenes involving the dinosaurs are exciting to watch Â particularly a nighttime assault from a hungry Allosaurus Â but there just isn't enough interaction between the humans and the dinosaurs for it to be magnificent, though I'm aware that technical restrictions would most certainly have played a part in this.
She gets berated by all the townsfolk- particularly the religious folk for having a child out of wedlock and under such strange circumstances- yet nothing gets in the way of her own determination of what she thinks is true.
Parts of this film really had me squirming, particularly towards the end.
Alonzo resorts to extreme measures to make sure he can win Nanon back, but in true Browning fashion, he meets a particularly gruesome ending.
Peter Cushing,(Dr. Vernon Stone),"Monster Island,'81, was a very helpful doctor who loved to help everyone in need and was particularly helpful to Angela and her over heating spells, even her car over heated !
In this case the status quo is a love triangle with some other interesting British type characters and interesting British atmosphere, not to mention giants Lee and Cushing playing remarkably believable people, particularly Cushing, whose character is so believable in his errors as well as his attributes.
Enjoyable British sci-fi outing of 1967, which sports not only a venerable Cushing-Lee pairing, but exciting scenes of overheating 1960's British automobiles to boot (the steaming, hood-up MG scene will be particularly horrific for current/former MG owners who've ever dealt with this aspect common to certain vintage British cars).
The graphics really are great for the SNES, though the magic spells don't look particularly great.
I thought this episode was particularly average - there are many more worth watching instead.
I laughed at a few of them, but there was only one joke in the whole episode (that was not farce, slapstick or Friz F) that I thought was particularly funny or clever (I do not want to give away any spoilers).
I did not think this short was particularly bad, but it is not one that I will be watching again.
Inside the Starkadder fold Flora encounters a resistance to dish washing modernity (the twig versus the hand mop); the rumor of an unmentionable misdeed once perpetrated against her father; the oft-cited permanence of the Starkadders on their environs; and the matriarch's frequently mentioned trauma after having witnessed a particularly odious occurrence inside the outdoor log pile storage facility ("...something nasty in the woodshed").
This film has a warm fuzzy feel to it which stops me being particularly vitriolic about it, but I can't seriously recommend it to anyone either due to the rather slow pace and predictability of the whole affair.
One thing that is particularly striking is that he is able to use long, unshowy takes (some lasting several minutes) simply because his actors are up to the challenge, giving the film an unforced, natural flow.
Also, while a few of the actors were dreadful (particularly "the champ"), the film was far less static than most of the early sound era.
Neither the script nor the acting are particularly bad for an early talkie, it's just that everything and everyone in this paint-by-numbers film about the boxing world is so completely conventional and forgettable.
But as much as I enjoyed both of these fine actors, I was particularly impressed with the work of Daniela Bianchi from From Russia with Love fame.
A pretty good crime drama of its time, on a par with PUBLIC ENEMY, LITTLE CEASAR, and others of the genre,good acting, too.Excellent acting by a very young Lew Ayres, an up-and-coming yet unknown James Cagney, here listed way down in the cast of players as a secondary, and I particularly enjoyed the fine characterization by pre-Dracula Dwight Frye.
I would like to have seen a better resolution of the Ricarno/Mileaway relationship, particularly since Cagney's character just disappears after his 'confession', and even more so because of his heavily implicated fling with Ricarno's wife - very risquÃ© stuff for the 1930's.
If you were to watch this film without sound, you'd be hyper-aware of the wonderful camera set-ups and editing, particularly during the prison break, when the screen is filled with jump cuts of men's legs running.
the movie just lags..  the nerdy girl isn't particularly interesting.
Several stories run throughout the film, including a particularly amusing one starring Mia Farrow, who goes through a "My Fair Lady"-esquire transformation.
I am particularly inclined to agree with his statement about boy crooners; I would have to say the same about boy bands.
We did not particularly care for the ending - it is possible that a terrorist might have not had his identity discovered.
Fritz Langs film work work particularly "M" (a film about a child molester and Serial Murderer) made a profound impression on the Work of Hitchcock .It would be a strange coincidence that in his Last American Film Friz Lang Would Pay Homage to him in "Beyond Reasonable Doubt" This film has all the trademarks of the latter Hitchcock s films and is greatly enhanced by the great use of film montage of German Expressionist Films to which Hitchcock learned his trade and made a point of his style This Film has been Remade four times as recently as 2009 and the second even starred Novello himself however there's is no comparison There are some who say Hitchcock was always a bit of a silent film director with his use of great lengthy scenes without dialogue, and if you watch this u can see why everything in the stories plot comes across clear as a bell its not a dodgy DW Griffith with too much montage to millions of Credit cards to Tell you whats happening, you can see exactly whats going on, you can tell when something horrible is going to happen to the sweet blond victim , and you are given that same 'suspend belief' that's in all the Great Hitchcock Films of his Golden Period .
What makes the lodger character (Ivor Novello) particularly creepy is his unusual behavior in turning women's pictures away from view and the borderline malevolent interest he takes in young Daisy Bunting, a fair haired girl who has all the prerequisites for the Avenger's next victim.
The Lodger was the feature which Hitchcock himself described as his first true film (it was actually his third complete one), and film historians, particularly auteurists tend to focus upon it because it is it introduces themes of murder and suspense that Hitch's name would later be synonymous with.
This character's mindlessness, particularly in his final scene, was idiotic to the point of insult.
Candy is an important movie because it doesn't pretend anything else is important besides falling between the knees of a beautiful, nubile, not particularly bright young woman.
One particularly accessible film about the crusades is Cicel B. DeMille's 1935 epic adventure The Crusades.
Consequently, it can still touch some of the 21 century viewers, particularly classic movie fans.
"Take the Cross to your hearts," as he says to the people in England gathered to join the crusade is a particularly powerful moment.
Even the ostensible hero of the piece, the 14-year-old boy who becomes the servant of chanteuse Gong Li, is not particularly remarkable: not intuitive, not very smart, and certainly not a winner.
This is the same maudlin and uncomfortable theme running through another Lloyd short, NEVER WEAKEN, and I think it was not particularly funny (is suicide ever really a funny topic?).
It's particularly a trip for those of us who are truly "children of the 80s."
From the way that the characters interact with each other, particularly Sandler and Barrymore, it is obvious that they are in love.
While the humor is definitely not clean in nature, it's appealing to older adolescents and adults, particularly those who grew up with the toys and cartoons they most often utilize in the show (transformers, thundercats, rainbow bright, smurfs, scooby doo, gi joe, etc.
In addition, Margaret's parents, particularly her mother, become alarmed and angry when Margaret asserts her independence as she gets older.
I was impressed by the acting, particularly Harvey Keitel, who plays police detective John Woods.
Moore and Willis (who went on to marry after reportedly meeting on this film) are particularly effective.
Excellent cast, with Paulette Goddard particularly effective.
Here, marriage to a handsome man and financial success - long the expectations of many young Korean women - are not depicted as an absolute guarantee of security and/or happiness, and turning 30 without being defined is hardly the end of the world, particularly for Korean women who remain adaptable to the changes happening around them, rather than being pressured to fit a mold as their ancestors were.
The being itself is a series of monsters, not particularly as scary now due to the advancement in special effects(..or as effective as say Bottin's work in THE THING or Stan Winston's work in PUMPKINHEAD), but effectively grotesque when they pop up on characters..the monkey creature is quite a ghastly creation.
Not as gory or violent as it could've been, probably due to lack of budget(..for a Band production, the film looks great, particularly the underground facility and it's devastated state due to natural and unnatural factors), but director JS Cardone is able to build the dread quite nicely due to the fact that the being could be anywhere and mimic certain things(..this was perhaps what many believe was ripped from THE THING, I guess, because an animal is used by the being to trick characters).
Uma Thurman is particularly good as Debbie, a painfully neurotic, almost psychotic twenty-something girl.
That's not particularly unusual, but what is unusual is some of their reasons for doing so (of the X-Men dissenters, I mean).
The characters aren't particularly involving, either the "good guys" or the "bad guys."
The on screen transformations is particularly spectacular, in terms of the way Saleem looks when the film starts (a beautiful young man), to the way he looks when the fanaticism begins to swallow the love he has for his mother and lady love as well as for life as he knew it (a ghost of the boy he used to be) and finally, years later when a chanced glancing at a telly screen leads Zubeida to spot the man she once loved giving a religious speech on a political channel (a mostly unrecognisable Saleem).
In a film so subtly wrought, it is unusual to be struck particularly by acting performances but for Shilpa Shukla is a revelation.
What I particularly love about this film, besides the fact that it is technically remarkable, is the fact that it does not glorify death or killing.
What I particularly love about this film, besides the fact that it is technically remarkable, is the fact that it does not glorify death or killing.
As conceived by writer-director Mike Davis its an over-the-top send-up of every action film ever made; a wink and a nod (as well as a parody of) to the bloody overkill of "Die Hard" and "Rambo", the gleeful excitement and charm of "Indiana Jones", the cornball abandon of "James Bond", the who cares of "North by Northwest", the heroic terseness and ease of "Bourne", the ultra-stylized and preposterous overdrive of "The Matrix" or anything ever made by John Woo (particularly a love for "Hard-Boiled"), and even in one scene the splendid lunacy of "Raising Arizona".
Character development, too, slows down greatly and by the later seasons, the cast has become quite unchanging, resulting in increasingly stale jokes (particularly those concerning the monk, who's ironic traits start out as mildly humorous but grow tiresome when the jokes associated with them appear repeatedly).
Also, the character designs (appearences) were brilliant and at times among the best I have seen, particularly with the band of seven.
(Keep in mind our friend Rolfe Kanefsky had "Nightmare Man" in theaters and distributed on DVD everywhere, and his quality isn't particularly stunning.)
But all of the performances stood out, particularly Judd Nelson, who makes us completely forget about The Breakfast Club while reminding us that he can still act.
A minor gripe is the sound - the recording is not particularly good and a lot of scenes are completely silent, apart from the audible tape hiss.
Regardless of what any one else says, this is a well done movie particularly considering it is her first with writing, directing and scoring credits.
Yes, few times Woody Allen's name came to my mind because Adam Goldberg seemed doing homage to Woody Allen's character, neurotic, unsecured, and whining - and not particularly good one.
In fact, you'd wonder if honesty (100% no holds barred revelations) can offer you less headache, particularly when your partner has to discover some parts of you that you want hidden away, either for reasons of being ashamed, or just because you want to protect him/her from possible hurt when they find out the truth.
There are elements of 'Amelie' and the classic Woody Allen comedies such as 'Annie Hall' and 'Manhattan', particularly in Adam Goldberg's neurotic response to the chic scruffiness that is Paris.
While the film sometimes relies on stereotypes (particularly with some of the minor characters), it also presents rich, fleshed- out characters that are clearly individuals with their own histories and experiences that they and those around them have to contend with.
Gordon-Levitt was particularly brilliant in his role.
And the cast is also quite good, particularly lead Glynnis O'Connor.
And among the supporting cast, I particularly like Sidney Toler as tavern owner Turgis.
Lorissa McComas is particularly funny in it's take on the actress obsessed with the 70's murdered star; and Amy Shelton-White steals the show, she could be more than a b-movie queen.
What makes this click with so many horror buffs, in particularly those who love lesbian vampire films, is the one-time star Yvette Stensgard, a gorgeous Scandanavian child-woman who looks absolutely innocent (particularly when her eyes fetchingly cross), even the moment before she rips open the neck of her next victim.
I particularly liked the colorful costumes and the way they brought the innovative set to life.
I rated it quite highly for many reasons including Judy Davis' acting, the strength with which the director was able to convey its message, the strong supporting cast, the exquisite shots (particularly in their composition) often lengthy in duration that so wonderfully show what action/adventure films cannot including again subtlety, nuance and the ability to make the viewer actually think-both during and for long after the film is viewed
You can't help but love the part where his Captain comes into his office, kicks his feet off the desk and gets stuck into him for nosing into a case belonging to Homicide, particularly, since when he comes back into the office and tells him how much he loved that outburst.
And although the characters are all fairly cardboard, the cast is good and I did particularly like Claudine Auger's super-bitch Renata.
The murders themselves tend to be fairly original, particularly those that befall a precocious batch of horny teens who stumble onto the family estate (anyone who's seen Friday the 13th will see the inspiration for that movie right here).
After years of hearing about the brilliance of Bava and his contemporaries and the influence they had on modern horror, particularly slasher films (which I'll admit to having a morbid interest in), I finally watched this film last weekend.
The beheading was particularly ludicrous: there were holes in the back of the "neck" of the decapitated body!
This movie is particularly weak.
There was some good humor, particularly regarding the dog.
The scene where Garbo is on the phone trying to find Barrymore, and the one towards the end with Lionel Barrymore and Wallace Beery are particularly bad.
Other than that, "Grand Hotel" is not particularly concerned with social or political problems--it's strange to think that it takes place in Weimar Germany and just two years later, the Nazis would take over.
The reason this is a lesser effort from Corman is that much of the car chase sequences were lifted from other movies he produced, particularly "Moving Violation", "Eat My Dust", "Grand Theft Auto", and "Thunder And Lightning", albeit with new footage and different sound effects dubbed in.
One scene is particularly funny, the one of the check point when Adel Imam met Talaat Zakaria.
This is an energetic, emphatically violent, lively (and very mean-spirited, unfortunately) horror sequel with spectacular gore (particularly in the unrated director's cut) and performances that are actually something approaching decent.
Mr. Fairbanks survives the attack, and infiltrates the offending ship (as "The Black Pirate"), vowing revenge, particularly due to the death of his father.
Neither of the protagonists is particularly attractive, not in the conventional way, and I didn't feel that anything was shown for pornographic purposes (although that would have been OK with me).
It's all downhill from there, and the film's climax is particularly absurd, as Crawford makes up with lover Robert Montgomery immediately after shooting him!
My late father, who didn't particularly care for actors, loved movies.
The film then hovers uncertainly between being a comedy (unfortunately it's not very funny), a drama (not particularly interesting) and typical French pseudo-intellectual film where people sit and talk.
Other than that, this is an amazing film, i would recommend it to anyone looking for something that is not particularly scary but nonetheless highly entertaining.
But Williams is particularly funny.
But one death, at least, near the end of the film, is particularly brutal in its abruptness.
The other scientists look over John Agar's shoulder while he reads a particularly puzzling plaque and rattles off allusions to The Gilgamesh Epic.
Fredric March was a wonderfully versatile actor, particularly good in comedy, but James Mason, behind his trademark suavity, sadism and insanity, always had a sadness and resigned loneliness, a great generosity of spirit that was just right for Norman Maine.
In addition to the breathtaking scenes of the Tibetan plateau, better seen on the wide screen than on TV, in a range of extremely challenging weather and geographic elements (one scene in quick sand is particularly harrowing), the views of Tibetan towns and quotidian life in the mountains are an intriguing sidelight.
As for the humor, I don't mean to be rude to those reviewers whom have written elsewhere criticizing Sorcha Cusack's performance, but I'm afraid they simply don't grasp British humor - particularly, the "understatement", which is present in almost every line of many of the intimate dialogs between Jane and Rochester (both in the novel and in this production).
This is one particularly hilarious portion of the film that will really tickle audience's funny bones.
Not for everyone, perhaps (the reception in the US has been particularly poor), but one of the best low-budget British films in a long time.
This is no I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE, so don't panic and assume you'll see anything particularly upsetting or disturbing.
None of the acting is particularly good, but it's simply just another piece of this amusingly, agreeably cruddy hoot of a horror film.
My favourites were the dead man balancing himself out, and particularly the final death scene.
Lead actor and co-screenwriter Paddy Considine is terrific value as usual and is surely well on the way to becoming one of the UK's premiere screen actors and all of the supporting cast are terrific particularly Toby Kebbell who plays the intellectually challenged brother (the actual descriptions used in the film probably breach review guidelines) and Gary Stretch - who'd've thought he could act?
I agree that certain elements of its narrative (particularly the pacing, as well as a few contrived interpersonal moments) felt tacked-on or inauthentic, and were perhaps invented to couch the story in a modern-day milieu that could appeal to audiences before "surprising" them with the political content of the film in its second half, as the mystery of the main character's history is unraveled.
I have seen some rather hideous films in my life, but frankly this one qualifies as one of the all time worst, particularly in light of the immense talent of writer & director Stephen Norrington, an otherwise fine cast, and some incredibly gifted technical people such as the editor and the cinematographer.
And the acting, particularly in the beginning, is 'obvious' and a bit tiring.
He was particularly good at showing the physical effects of years of solitary confinement.
So a dull blog and home movies--how could anyone find this particularly engaging?
I don't often find myself so enveloped in documentaries, particularly those that stop pursuing their apparent narrative ten minutes in and take on a totally new and divergent direction.
SL&V has marketing written all over it, from the title to the stars (admittedly not as famous during the time of the shoot as now), and in its focus on sex and masturbation, particularly.
This is when the two kids start to realize their parents particularly Bernie, have clay feet.
There are some very funny moments throughout with the brothers particularly Frank's stream of profanities in frustration at the tennis lessons (no doubt from his competitive father in several sequences) and Walt's stone-cold declaration that the musical piece he will be performing, Pink Floyd's "Hey You", was written by him as an original work!
This English production was directed by John Hough & Howling IV: The Original Nightmare was the fourth entry in the Howling series of films which currently number seven, I can't say it's a particularly good good film but at least it's 100 times better than the dire Howling: New Moon Rising (1995) which was about as much fun as being anally raped with a large vegetable.
It's not even a particularly well-made film, and I noticed several errors in continuity.
At the end of the day,i have seen worse,but also a lot better,Facinelli and Regan do well in their roles,and for Christian Slater,he yet again made this movie worthwhile for me,despite the fact you only hear his voice.It doesn't really get your immediate attention,but if you be patient i think you will agree that this movie is actually worth watching.I particularly enjoyed the scene outside of Regans house,smart effects with the flash grenades,i gave this movie a rating of 7/10,which i feel it deserves.I read a comment from another user that has the opinion that Christian Slater cant act!Which is an insult to myself,i own every Movie that Christian Slater is in except Name Of The Rose!And i can ASSURE you that this man is a Very talented actor.
I don't particularly like Barbra Streisand's personality.
The mysteries aren't extraordinary or particularly byzantine.
I'm not particularly a fan of his; in fact, I'm hard-pressed to remember any other role he's played.
Playing off the title of "Whatver Happened to Baby Jane", it is not ruined by its television look and feel because of a particularly memorable performance by Geraldine Page.
Director Francois Ozon steers this movie toward being more "image-heavy",meaning that the stuff we see here:the swimming pool,the interior of the house,the village,the physical appearance and demeanor of the characters,particularly SArah and Julia are all very important to how we view and understand the film.
As far as romance, there are other Elvis movies that are much better, particularly Viva Las Vegas.
I particularly liked the fact that the film is not sleazy, gory and violent or any other factors one usually sees in today's films.
Although this is not Monroe's best film, there is nothing particularly wrong with her portrayal of Elsie, who comes across as a typical Monroe character- empty-headed and flirtatious, but basically decent.
Although older man/younger woman love-stories were as common in the cinema of the fifties as they are today, this one seems particularly incongruous.
It's not a particularly well-written film at all.
I say all these things only to the special few with the capacity to digest film this way, and I don't expect that to be a particularly large group.
The music, particularly at the beginning is too loud and threatens to drown out everything else.
The stimulated sex, particularly the gay stuff, quite hot.
Peter Sarsgaard, Campbell Scott and particularly Patricia Clarkson, give layered, complex, award-worthy performances.
The acting was amazingly realistic--particularly from Jean-Louis Trintignant in the lead.
I wasn't particularly fond of butchery.
He is a real scoundrel and not particularly likable,...that is, until he meets the woman of his dreams, the princess.
However, there were a couple of scenes in the movie of which some of the up closes of the actor's face in certain scenes look real rather than animated, particularly in the scene of where Beowulf encounters Grendel's mother.
As with the story, rather than beginning with King Hrothgar murdering Grendel's father, it opens with the King having a party of drunkenness and very inappropriate nudity, particularly for an animation film.
The  performances- particularly by Cher and Eric Stoltz as Rusty and Rocky  Dennis- are fantastic, the camera work (by the great Lazlo Kovacs) fluid  and superb, the make up won an academy award, the music perfect, and the  story, well, it's almost too good to be true.
There are no big surprises or twists, the episode is not particularly funny or anything.
When going into the theatre to see this I in two minds - it was my first 3D movie and I had heard good things, however I wasn't particularly taken by the concept or the trailers.
In fact, all the action scenes are stunning in 3D, particularly the climactic battle with a top-notch, fire belching monster of a dragon.
I wasn't particularly struck with the physical realisation of the monster, but the performance is knock out.
And the acting is indeed a joy to watch, particularly the great Tony Shalhoub, who is so often under-used.
Plotwise, the film is a bit slow and visually not particularly striking.
It is a fine counter-point to the often loud and vulgar fare from Hollywood and in many ways is reminiscent of a foreign film (particularly the excellent German film "Mostly Martha"), though it was made in the good old USA.
The food seems to become a character in itself, particularly the pasta colossus, the timpano.
Rey particularly is brilliant in the role of Matthieu, where he can play exquisite, charming, despondent, yearning, rage, and complacency all in great measure.
Conchita- played by two actresses- is sometimes (particularly on a first viewing) indistinguishable from one another, and it adds to the maddeningly seductive power she has over her old, aged rich follower.
The fight sequences, although dated very badly because of sheer physical deterioration, were particularly entertaining and amusing.
I find this scene particularly entertaining, because my brother went to college with the son of a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon, and in this doctor's office, almost the exact same thing was on exhibition....
And the pace and tone are somewhat uneven, particularly towards the beginning.
Nor is it a particularly approachable film.
Jet Li in his third US movie again plays credible and hard and does not compromise his great ability in the martial arts by use of embarrassing buffoonery as Jackie Chan has chosen to do(particularly in RUSH HOUR and its sequel).Li engages in a long series of well choreographed fight scenes against a variety of foes including a lone fight against a gymful of karate students(another nod to THE MAN FROM HONG KONG)and faces a particularly nasty villain in the form of the excellent Tcheky Karyo who is on peak form here.
One particularly amusing scene is when Jet walks into a police station to go after the bad guys.
Luc Besson's script isn't particularly distinguished, but hey, at least it's more comprehensible than the Romeo Must Die's plot, a move which I will probably refer to many times in this review.
Neither characters are particularly sympathetic in the sense that neither is particularly human.
It is impossible to fault this made for TV film - the principals make an attractive couple; the period is well evoked; the settings are suitably glamorous and the supporting cast is particularly strong.
What particularly convinced was the abdication speech, in the context of the film this "historic given" rang absolutely true.
There are some other good performances, particularly 80 year old veteran Richard Johnston as Wallis' nemesis, prime minister Baldwin, and Julian Wadham as Edward's not exactly loyal private secretary Fitzhardinge.
This film is truly a gem which presents a strong anti-war message, one which is particularly interesting considering the time it was made (1933 being the year that Hitler achieved power in Germany and the 1930s being the period of appeasement).
"Celebrity" now is synonymous in describing those who have no talent at anything accept appearing on shows like BIG BROTHER.The amount of people who have earned a career,and a lucrative one at that,from this programme since it's debut has been astonishing.Brian Dowling and Kate Lawler are just two examples,but the most remarkable was that of Jade Goody,who didn't even win the series she appeared in.She came a cropper in 2007's CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER after her misguided behaviour towards Shilpa Shetty.Now having sadly passed away after a battle against cancer,it is arguable that unscrupulous media types exploited her naivety and inarticulacy (which was in no way particularly her fault) when she was not especially conscious of such events.
What I did not particularly like was the cat, Begemot.
Ellen Barkin is particularly fetching as Penny Priddy, while Jeff Goldblum stakes out his turf with an engaging feverishness that is all his own.
Anyway, watching Columbo catch him is particularly worth it especially sine you don't feel for Hamilton's character as a victim.
Don't get me wrong, this film isn't terrible by a long way but it isn't particularly good either and despite a lovely style, Coppola can't take the ball and deliver on the substance front as well.
I agree with other comments here that many dialogues are 'still born' because the text was transferred from the book too literally with no dramatic adaptation, particularly when Bulgakov's 'author's' commentaries were used in the dialogues.
The two main ideas for me of this all-American Horatio Alger "rags-to-riches" story are:   1) Innovation in conflict with the stale old dead way of doing things (out of collective ignorance and blind obedience to authority)Âcall it the Pleasantville barrierÂand   2) Man against the state, particularly the US state and its insidious methods of coercion working in harmony with cartel business interestsÂcall it the Kleptocon barrier.
I wasn't particularly annoyed by most of the casting excluding Margarita.
as cheap as the movie was (and i don't mean that as necessarily bad) i couldn't help but to feel some compassion for derick and derwin, particularly the part after derwin gets beat up and derick has to do that presentation by himself.
His was a particularly sympathetic soul and friend of Claudius.
I particularly loved the performances of Derek Jacobi, Sian Phillips and Brian Blessed.
Samuel Fuller as Van Meer is particularly good and is given the best lines in the film.
It's very similar in feel to Halloween 4, which was a complete waste of time - there's a feeling that nobody knew what they were doing during the whole creation process, particularly the music composers, who were obviously filling time until they were discovered by Philip Glass.
Sam helps the family, foiling Hale at every turn, but the past is catching up with Sam...  Arquette, Culkin, Levine, and Taubman as the daughter are particularly good, and the story tries to be light-hearted and moral.
It's directed well and the performances are uniformly very good, particularly Tom McCamus.
But that's just the movie's way of completely dropping your guard and fooling you into thinking you know what's going to happen, and it's particularly effective with long-time horror fans like me.
If you want an action fest don't bother but if you want to be challenged, surprised and in one particularly poignant moment actually moved then check it out.
Secondly i didn't think the use of a hand-held camera was a particularly good idea.
Wilson's dialog is particularly solid as he talks about the act of murder and considers it both a business and an art.
An excellent title sequence helps, particularly as the stories it introduces are generally interesting and sometimes moving.
If you're a horror film junkie, or even if you're not (for example, my boyfriend doesn't particularly like horror films but is fond of intelligent comedy and was right beside me laughing for this one) you should DEFINITELY see this movie!
A particularly eye-popping scene is when she struts through the men's room and the men get all freaked out and start jumping into the pool.
Midler's show-dominating tour-de-force portrayal gets sterling support from an exceptional cast peppered with stand-out character actors: David Keith as a bashful soldier, Jack Starrett as a country music road manager, John Dennis Johnson as a rowdy hick jerk in a hillbilly bar, Jonathan Banks as an oily TV promoter, Don Calfa as a smarmy music biz leech, Victor Argo as a bath house locker room attendant, Will Hare as an amiable grocer, and, in a particularly chilling and startling cameo, the great Harry Dean Stanton as a cold-hearted a**hole country singer/songwriter who flatly tells Rose right to her face that he thinks her singing stinks.
It's low-budget and goofy, and it's not particularly intelligent or emotionally deep.
This show appeals to a certain type of audience - it's not particularly clever but it's enjoyable to watch if not taken so seriously.
Tiresome, repetitious and plodding, this trundles through a series of barely-linked scenes, none of which are particularly unexpected, most of which are reheated from the first film; meanwhile Linda Koslowski does very little and does it even more wetly and woodenly than before.
I found the plot line to be weak, although some of the humor was good, particularly the parts dealing with cultural differences.
This isn't a particularly great Tom and Jerry cartoon, but considering it was made during the absolute best period of animation from MGM (1941-1956), it still is a very, very good cartoon.
Once again, the cartoon has excellent production values and I have no major complaints other than the fact this wasn't a particularly memorable cartoon--just an average Tom and Jerry toon.
"Texas Tom" isn't particularly one of my favorite Tom & Jerry's cartoons, but still it is great fun.
I would recommend this movie if you're in the mood for a bit of gritty realism, but don't expect to feel particularly upbeat afterward!
What I particularly liked about the locations visited was that producers for the most part avoided Europe (save for Russia, which was interesting) and visited other places, more interesting places, like South America and the Middle East.
Peter Falk and Tyne Daly make a charming, believable married couple.Tyne Daly's speech about some tough times early in their marriage is particularly moving.
There's a chance for a slice of life movie about a bookie who's as ethical as such a profession will allow him to be and what happens when the vultures want to muscle in--a particularly annoying plot point by the way, since Falk's character has said he's retiring in a year and we believe him.
There were times I had turn away from the screen, I don't particularly like viewing feces, those segments I couldn't wait to get over.
The similar styled shows on television, as well as many of the other shows, particularly the so-called "comedy" shows are almost always misrepresented as "wholesome family entertainment" when in fact they are thinly guised (or not so thinly guised) sadism, racism, and/or pandering to any number of the lowest human traits.
I particularly enjoyed the prostitute show (especially the way she bashes the men after having sex with them) and the "what would you do for money" show; where people are asked to do various disgusting things for $$$   Comedy never tasted so good.....
At the end of the movie Elliot says that "it's a long story"; very long, indeed, particularly when one considers that there isn't enough actual plot to even fill a 25-minute TV episode of any "Tales of the Something or Other" type of show.
(***)  (Read also pajak3's excellent IMDb comment on this movie - the sentence "there is no such thing as a lighter side of crime" is particularly spot-on, especially when we're talking about murder)
A particularly well played and haunting dream sequence will stay with you long after your first viewing of the film.
Quite often I don't mind the changes if they make sense or add something to the story or if the change is accompanied by some particularly affecting performance.
Twin Town is much more of a comedy, and is much more difficult to understand, particularly if you're not familiar with welsh accents.
I was particularly impressed by Rod Serling's voice over narration at the beginning of the story, a hallmark that lent gravitas to the tale that was about to unfold.
Denton is explored thoroughly as a character and Serling's writing is deeply touching, particularly as Denton reveals the reason he started drinking excessively in the first place.
Although the movie momentarily loses momentum here and there, particularly when the psychiatrist and Harbour on separate occasions take time out to discuss the grim pathology of their family histories, it breathes its last somewhere in the middle when the focus shifts from Wilbur to Harbour.
Despite the excellent restoration work, many of the remaining scenes have unfortunately decayed beyond repair, and, particularly during Ned Kelly's climactic stand-off, the image has a tendency to strangely distort.
It's more a drama than anything else, only the drama isn't that well handled or particularly interesting.
All in all Cop isn't a bad film, it's just not a particularly good one either.
By the end of the film Woods has been suspended from the force for repeatedly over stepping the mark, but at least he has his prey in his sights and won't let something as the Law get in his way.......  Not a particularly original script and it sometimes stalls & loses emphasis and a sense of direction.
The violence shown in the movie is not particularly explicit; and that's possibly why the film didn't get a rousing reception from some circles who were hoping for an exploitation flick.
I particularly loved the music that played throughout the film, it really added the entertainment.
Tiffani Amber Thiessen never fails to make an excellent TV movie and A Killer Amongst Friends is proof that the pretty blue eyed brunette can act superbly as Jenny Monroe,the attractive,and adored teenage girl who is envied by her friends,particularly Ellen Holloway played by Margaret Welsh who nailed the performance as a conniving and deceitful teenager whose jealousy leads her to brutally murder her best friend.Holloway only becomes more hated throughout the plot when she fools Jenny's heartbroken mother Jean (Patty Duke) into believing that someone else killed her daughter,leading her on a wild goose chase for a killer who doesn't exist.Patty Duke's performance was so captivating that you can feel her pain and her grief from the time she was told her daughter had been murdered,to when she discovers the horrible truth about the killer.
The film doesn't crusade for allowing bad language, but rather shows how silly it is to take language so seriously, particularly when Mothers Against Canada invokes a war with our neighbors to the north.
It pokes fun at everyone, white, black, Jewish, Christian - but particularly the stupid and the bigoted.
Occasionally, Bowers' film takes on a grim feeling, particularly when Dr. Tenma turns against his son.
The victim took a whole year to die a particularly slow and nasty death - much worse than Jesus in The Passion - while the others were dispatched relatively quickly.
OK, so the low budget was apparent and the acting was not great at times, but the story kept me gripped throughout and some scenes really freaked me out, particularly at the beginning of the movie.
`Se7en' is all about harsh style and gruesome substance Â while it's probably not a film for everyone (particularly the squeamish), it is one of the most moody, memorable films made in recent years.
In fact, the whole movie seems to hurry through without giving key characters enough time to build up their emotional worth, particularly Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow).
The pair share numerous classic moments together, particularly in the mock 'fight' scene.
A stand out film dealing with a particularly unpleasant Serial Killer, "Se7en" (along with "Silence of the Lambs"), is something of a milestone in this genre.
He had a long, successful career that wasn't particularly distinguished.
People I particularly liked in this movie where the drug addict gangster and the lead girl, they all act surprisingly good for this production and I loved it.
I particularly enjoyed the fact that whenever someone talks more about the legend of Bloody Bill the whole tone of the dialog changes and they start using words and phrases normal people don't use in everyday conversation to make it sound more dramatic.
The moment when, visiting the home of his fellow detective (the excellent Takashi Shimura) Murakami smiles for the first time in the movie on meeting his colleague's children is particularly moving.
Several scenes reminded me of Orson Welles' later film Touch of Evil, particularly an extended montage sequence with a similar feel to the famous opening shot of Welles' film showing a disguised Mifune walking the streets as he attempts to track down blackmarket arms dealers accompanied by a cacophony of street noise and Latin-jazz-big band music.
He explores in depth the social and economic conditions in postwar Japan which led many young people--particularly returning veterans--to take to crime, and also the particular circumstances which motivate the acts of Yusa (Isao Kimura), the criminal.
Impressive as some of the later films of Kurosawa are - "Kagemusha" and "Ran" for example, I have to confess that it is his early work, particularly those set in modern Japan as opposed to its feudal past, that I find myself returning to with greater pleasure.
It sags a little in the middle, but the chases at the outer ends of the film are wonderfully done, particularly the penultimate sequence where the cop pursues his prey through vegetation where city and countryside meet.
The minor characters were hammy and unconvincing, but once on the boat the three main characters were very good, particularly Patsy Kensit and Elizabeth Hurley.
What follows if a very smart, often disturbing parade of lives of people who happen to come in contact with a particularly hideous dress.
This is a particularly hard-hitting and suspenseful depiction of an ordinary man (Frank Lovejoy) down on his luck as he tries to provide for his family and hold on to his self-respect at the same time.
But, of course, movie-PHD Quentin Tarantino held up this man's work, particularly this film, to such high esteem he took the title (if not the skeleton of the subject matter) for his latest opus.
Reading Scott's bio was informative: not a particularly happy life and career, despite his impressive seventy total credits.
She was particularly fascinated with his steely green-gold eyes.
There is probably more comedy in some of the off-stage scenes, particularly the courtroom repartee, than the stage performances which seem designed to demonstrate why he irritated a lot of people at the time.
In this followup series, the movie bounces from the sub war of the Pacific to diplomatic meetings throughout the world (particularly in the USSR) to the horrors of the concentration camps.
The acting, particularly by Mitchum, Seymour and, most especially Gielgud, is consistently excellent.
It's an enjoyable film, with some great performances particularly for Jack's best actor performance, and Kineear's wounded likes of Simon.
I have never seen footage of a Bruce concert/performance, but I have several as music files and have listened to them many times (particularly the Berkeley and Carnegie Hall performances that are also undoubtedly CDs now); Hoffman captures his verbal mannerisms perfectly.
Ann Peacock did a fine job adapting a film which is not particularly suited to the cinema.
The fact is, nobody particularly cares to hear the truth 99.999% of the times anyway!!"
The movie is a tasty blend of slapstick humor, the perils of interpersonal relationships and a particularly brilliant bit of artifice involving a mantel and a doll-(keep an eye out for it towards the end of the movie-it happens rather quickly!)
I particularly liked the scene where he sought out the Russian Minskov, where he goes about without a clue to try and straighten things out with the mobster, only to have him call and threaten him loudly over the phone, in the sudden presence of a passer-by.
There are good supporting performances all round particularly Peter Fleming as Mcall.
I note particularly (and probably few would think of it) Victor Mendoza.
The lovely Irenne Dunne is always wonderful, but she's particularly good here as Julie.
You could also mention the conscious use of the camera - I particularly noticed a scene where the camera is placed on the stairs, thereby filming primarily the legs of the Roger and Julie.
Stevens, perhaps the ablest filmmaker of the era next to Hitchcock, saw the profundity and catharsis in it, and the receptive, insightful control and room to allow his particularly personal vision to make it feel like the experience cinema is meant to be, a chronicle ensuing the life-changing happening of falling in love, and the innate personal longing to make a family and a home with the one you worship, and the trials and grief that can be as intense, though never really more, than the pleasure and gratification it begets.
The screenplay is particularly well-done, in that we see the family unit, how much Ruehl and the grandparents love their children, and the build-up to ensuing tragedy.
Some of the shots are tremendously difficult to achieve (particularly the flying scenes) and as well as being densely varied, they give the movie a 'non-cheap' moniker.
Sam Shepard's portrayal of Mr. Yeager was particularly good, and I enjoy watching this film... every October 14th.
One thing I particularly enjoyed about the film was the introduction of Chuck Yeager (Shepard) and his contribution to history by breaking the sound barrier, and then the periodic simultaneous comparison of the accomplishments of the astronauts and the Air Force and civilian test pilots, as well as exhibiting their eventual mutual respect.
The cinematography is appropriately both beautiful and colorful, particularly at the Villa outside Paris.
The cinematography is particularly fine.
While SOME older cartoons are truly insulting and awful in how they depict minorities (particularly awful films featuring the character "Black Sambo"), this one can only be seen as insulting to someone so devoid of a sense of humor and so politically correct that practically nothing is funny to them and everything is offensive.
Whether or not you like this movie will probably depend on whether you like seeing movies where the leading characters aren't particularly bright or likable.
SECRET OF THE BLUE ROOM is competently made, with atmosphere to spare, but doesn't particularly stand out from this type of film and this, I guess, is one of the reasons why it isn't well known today.
The series has a hint of a 70's, retro, kung-fu movie / "Shaft" feel, particularly early on, driving home the cool feeling.
Also the characters are not particularly likable so you don't care if they are killed or not.
This must have been quite frightening on the big screen, particularly after being accustomed to the more distanced style of the first sixty minutes of the film.
I always enjoy seeing Harry Carey in a movie, and this role is particularly neat, since he was one of Wayne's idols.
If you love a good Western, particularly if you're a John Wayne fan, 'The Spoilers' is a MUST!  
It was abominable in some scenes, particularly when one had the already daunting task of penetrating thick Italian accents.
I didn't particularly like this movie, mainly due to it's lack of storyline and acting.
Miike and screenwriter NAKA(Masa)MURA borrow liberally from other westerns particularly the landmark "Italiano-Westerns" of Sergio Leone (Fist Full of Dollars, The Good, The Bad & The Ugly") and Sergio Corbucci (Django) as well as the so-called "Acid-Westerns" of Alejandro Jodorowsky (El Topo) but adds in his own unique aspects and New Wave flourishes to create a Japanese version of the classic western albeit with a decidedly Japanese look and feel.
That's because this is a perfectly dreadful film in just about every way--particularly in how the characters were written.
Oddly, no one in the group that then heads back to the island appears to be an archaeologist or anthropologist--just a motley crew of adventurers who look nothing like the sort to investigate--particularly the slutty lady whose only interest in life is sex.
What's particularly disappointing is that the plot is just outlandish enough to have made for an unusual and effective horror yarn.
It is particularly enjoyable to be able to say, "He used be Captain Peacock", or "Sapphy's Gran", or "Mr Roper".
I even thought that some scenes, particularly the dinners, were slightly reminiscent of Kubrick.
One part I found particularly unnerving was the idea that we are all looking for a secure place and that the actual threat can come right from within.
While I have of course heard the name Mizoguchi Kenji, the only films of his that I have watched are Ugetsu (1953) and The New Tale of the Heike (1955) and while I did enjoy both of them, mainly the former, for the most part I did not have a particularly strong interest in watching Mizoguchi's films because at the time I was embroiled within the filmic worlds of Kitano Takeshi, Iwai Shunji, Miike Takashi, etc.
The movie is marked by some good set pieces; particularly horrendous is the sight of a murder victim shoved into a fireplace.
The other problem with all the cuts, is the loss of drama that was intended with this show, particularly the song "Dance of Death".
Excellent cast, with a young Tom Conti particularly outstanding.
I found the screenplay particularly unconvincing and the direction quite uninspired.
The character of Jen is like many mothers, particularly Chinese mothers - strong and resilient.
If you have not, then you probably will find that the film is a tad contrived and clichÃ©d--particularly regarding the romantic triangle in the film.
It's not that I particularly have anything against pornography; but what's taboo now and what was taboo over three decades ago are different things, and besides that; you can only watch people having sex for so long before it begins to get dull.
Although this was one of the first productions of the mainstream cinema to deal with erotic subject-matter frankly, it is not particularly explicit.
This is particularly apparent in the second half of this film when the heroine, after being jilted by one of her lesbian lovers (the oddly named Bee), takes up with the elderly Mario, a man who, despite his grey hair and advancing years, fancies himself both as a lover and as a thinker.
I watched the film on DVD and was particularly amused by Honore and the formerly lovely Emma de Caunes trying to convince me in a supplementary interview that "none of the sex is gratuitous" and that "every sex scene serves a purpose".
Khan always particularly excels in roles like this, where he plays the simple, sensitive, generous, happy and struggling middle-class guy.
I did not read the book, I haven't read a Grisham novel since the nineties (when I was in High School)...That being said, I have enjoyed hiss film adaptations in the past--particularly Runaway Jury, The Rainmaker, and A Time to Kill.
The commanding Police Lieutennant(Pedro Armendariz), seems particularly driven, even to the point of being fanatically determined to capture and see each and every Priest in his State* executed by the firing squad.
When focusing on the actual chase and flight from the Mexican police it works very well (particularly with a hammy but effective informer played by J. Carrol Nash).
Despite not being particularly religious myself, I was sufficiently moved by Christianity's noble plight for survival, though I wasn't overly fond of the film's ultimate assertion that the lieutenant's hatred of religion stems directly from his secretly believing in God but being unwilling to admit it.
I particularly liked the Green Screen effects, which (to the untrained eye) are seamless.
If it is hard to actually say the opposite, the point is that to make a plot that's original or particularly thrilling wasn't the goal.
I particularly liked Dame Diana Rigg as Baroness Lehzen and Penelope Wilton as the Duchess of Kent.
I had missed this film during the many years since it was made, and caught it by chance on a Friday afternoon, after a particularly long and hectic week.
John Mahoney's performance is well-delivered, and an interesting performance, in contrast with his more pleasant persona in "Moonstruck," also -- and particularly juxtaposed with his likable presence in the long-running "Frasier" series.
Cher is particularly noteworthy as the public defender assigned to the case.
This film makes clear how dreadful daily life was in Taliban ruled Afghanistan, particularly if you were a female (not that it's much fun in other Muslim countries) and we quickly sympathise with the central characters in their struggle for survival.
And gold is an apt visual metaphor, particularly when juxtaposed against the black satin of a tuxedo lapel or the wintry Manhattan night scape, for a world seemingly vanishing right before our eyes--a world too sleek, too soignÃ©, too genteel to survive the steam roller of galloping blue-jeaned egalitarianism.
The dialogue is a never-ending delight, full of great one-liners, yes, but also some equally cherishable, marvellously pompous sermonising and theorising from these slightly preposterous yet strangely loveable people (particularly Charlie Black).
He's pretty good in this role and I doubt if gay people would be particularly offended by his role.
I don't think you could accuse this one of being a particularly good film, but it is fun for the genre.
I particularly liked the performances of David Morrissey as Bradley Hellstone and Stephen Mackintosh as John Rokesmith.
I particularly liked the performances of David Morrissey as Bradley Hellstone and Stephen Mackintosh as John Rokesmith.
The style of direction was excessively hectic for my tastes, and the sequence where Richard imagines he is a character in a video game was particularly eccentric.
Leonardo DiCaprio's lead character is not particularly likable, but that's nothing new for him.
My only complaint was that they might have toned down the language, particularly with all the f-words.
I was particularly impressed with his acting this season.
What Oliver Stone manages to do is portray the negative in the 90's, particularly American pseudo-culture in the 90's.
IMHO, Miller wasn't a particularly good writer.
In terms of the the African experience in the west, in relation to slavery and all the bigotry and racism suffered by us, particularly today as we continue to struggle for equality in all areas of our lives, Sankofa is a true and honest depiction.
I know I viewed it at a particularly poignant time in my life, as a young, hopeful female student in our nation's capital, but I feel confident that this story can affect any and all people fighting (or hoping) for rights, freedoms, or dreams they've yet to achieve.
Kudos to all concerned, particularly Hilary Swank who couldn't have been any more compelling as the heroic Alice Paul.
The direction is fine but nothing exemplary, and the performances are all solid but not particularly memorable.
The film surprisingly enough doesn't feature any sexual footage, but the soundtrack is wonderful and particularly the exterior filming locations are stunning.
There's also some rather humorous gay moments, particularly with an obviously gay hat seller who sells Power his own hat, and is then told by Power to throw the other one out.
While the film is not particularly emotionally satisfying (to say the least), on the cerebral and aesthetic level, it delivers big time.
It may be exaggerated, and at times, even humorous, yet its approach is undeniably refreshing, particularly in relation to how the disabled manage to still engage in an active and healthy sex life.
The film's worst crime may be never allowing us to particularly care for Bob (or anyone) as much as we did for D-Fens in Schumacher's film, yet even despite its relative superficiality, He Was a Quiet Man remains a thoroughly entertaining, inventive and quirky film that will have nihilists the world over utterly dumbfounded (myself included).
While this film certainly doesn't stand out among these many films, it certainly is good and worthwhile--particularly if you've become a Randolph Scott fan like me.
I particularly loved the barber's chair scene--I wasn't too surprised by it but it was handled well.
Each of Lynch's films explores the mind in terms of Jungian philosophy, focusing particularly on The Shadow; however, Inland Empire goes further in this direction than any film previous to it.
It is a realm where a character, in the present case particularly the characters played by Dern (the press clichÃ© is 'career-defining performance'), turns into other characters and turns again.
It's badly directed by Richard Benjamin, Jessica Harper is totally wasted in a small role, Bill Macy is TERRIBLE (he seems to equate screaming as acting) and I don't find alcoholism particularly funny.
Joe Bologna is particularly good as the star of the show.
With the exception noted above, there isn't a missed beat from a single cast member, and Bologna and Kazan are particularly notable.
I particularly liked Willie the Xenophobic Scotsman.
I could make few spoilers that would seem significant, though points do jab out at you; particularly in the sense that expected explanation or fruition occasionally seem on the cards.
The character development is exceptional -- particularly the relationship between Jane Wyman and Michael Wilding.
Jane Wyman and Richard Todd did particularly well in this film.
This film is cute and watchable even today--and that's something you CAN'T say about many of the very early movies--particularly those of George Albert Smith.
While not great or amazing like the contemporary films of Georges MÃ©liÃ¨s, this is still pretty good and watchable--particularly the slapstick ending!
Rather, it's that the film does not seek blame or create unfounded obstacles for the character - particularly racial ones - instead enabling Chris' triumph as a personal one unencumbered by social or political context.
All-in-all this film is a must have if you are a fan of the genre, and a decent pick-up if you are not particularly fond of these types of films.
The 'making of' is a gift to filmmakers, particularly the examination of the camera rigs.
Gangsters, reporters, dames in distress (and even a particularly dismal 'car chase scene') - all the traditional trappings of the 'noir' genre, but given a slightly humorous edge by Ayres' enjoyable performance as a wise-cracking reporter.
This was really one of my favorite films...serious and well-acted, particularly by Dennis Quaid as Doc Holiday, taking nothing from the other fine actors in the cast.
I was particularly saddened that the writers chose to trivialize the friendship between Doc and Wyatt by basing it upon a few meaningful looks and friendly handshakes.
I don't particularly like either of the Morgan Earp characters in either film, but Virgil Earp again is portrayed much better in Wyatt Earp than Tombstone's Sam Elliott, who basically does his usual and plays Sam Elliott rather than a character.
The performances were uniformly good, with a skeletal Dennis Quade particularly fine as the doomed Doc Holliday.
The other adult characters are essentially movie idiots (Keenan Wynn and Roddy McDowall are particularly offensive -- I hope they were paid well), while the hip, turned-on teens in the film protest the Vietnam war and lecture their elders on sexual freedom and openness.
I mean, high school is a particularly sexualized place being that many students are entering in relationships for the first times in their lives.
Not a particularly good WWII yarn, but worthwhile for Anthony Quinn's commanding performance as a bitter sheepherder who is asked by the French Resistance to smuggle scientist James Mason and family across the Pyrenees.
I also enjoyed the lightsaber duels in this series, particularly the one between Anakin and Asajj Ventress.
There is a particularly soul-killing scene featuring Zohan and two friends playing hacky-sack with a cat.
Although I found myself laughing at quite a few parts (particularly when the Zohan was on the job as a soldier), there were also a lot of parts where I was thinking to myself "Come on.
Dubbed and low-budget, this horror movie is long, boring, and not particularly interesting except for the parapsychologist whose presence and storyline is wasted, Kevin McCarthy completed wasted, and a plot premise that held promise but wasn't fully utilized by a script that seemed to wander.
Fortunately Mr. McCarthy gets to continue to perform in contemporary roles even now, particularly SLIPSTREAM (2007).
This is possibly Dolph's best score, particularly in the context of it being a genuinely good little film.
Every single film critic's review of this I could find - Leonard Maltin and Roger Ebert being two of these critics whom I particularly respect - have given it a pitifully low rating.
I found Fairuza Balk's acting performance particularly compelling.
We are never 100% certain if in fact he had a daughter but I'd hedge my bets that Kerrigan is too sharp to fool his audience into false beliefs (I recognized one gut-wrenching clue when William mentions to a ticket clerk he lost his daughter on September 11th) particularly Lewis' gentle interplay with the natural born Breslin, a very excellent young actress who also shines in her sad, shy Kira, a child who is suffering as well inside and eventually blossoms into happiness and can see that there is more than meets the eye with William (who's final act has all the suspense of a melodramatic thriller in what the audience fears his truth to become).
We alarmingly get to understand his mind even as we fear for his safety and others around him, particularly each time he drinks a beer.
The people who briefly interact with "Keane" are excellent character actors who create whole, almost as damaged individuals with just a few lines, particularly Tina Holmes as a coke head and Amy Ryan as a single mom with significant problems.
And the reality that Lodge Kerrigan and the actor, Damian Lewis, create in 'Keane' is one that is particularly difficult to create - it is a reality of a person on the edge of sanity, a reality that few people who are sane enough (if anyone can be considered sane in this business)to get a film made would ever have experienced.
Tenka no Hadou Ken is particularly interesting because not only does it give us a glimpse of Inuyasha's father, it also provides a peek at the inner workings of his brother Sesshoumaru, one of the series' more inscrutable characters.
Accuracy of age, particularly where children are involved is paramount when making films.
Neither character had much to do with the story, particularly Holliday, who was on camera just about long enough to be out-gunned by Cardiff in a not very satisfying showdown.
The soundtrack is an eclectic mix and fusion of various influences, from electronica to jazz, and the theme used for chases is particularly catchy.
The writing plays to West's strengths as a comedian, particularly his surreal delivery of lines that no one else could say without cracking up.
It's a lot of fun and I loved the mix of humour and nasty gore moments (the brief bios of each person were particularly enjoyable).
I can understand why some people wouldn't be able to stomach this film, particularly when Kate (Phoebe Cates) tells the story of why she doesn't celebrate Christmas.
Lang's roots in German expressionism are evident here, as shown particularly in the design of Fonda's isolated prison cell, during a fog-enshrouded prison break, and in that final, heavenly shot.
Given the themes of this movie, it is particularly sad that it is such a boring and plodding exercise in poor film-making.
I don't think you could accuse this one of being a particularly good film, but it is fun for the genre.
Performances by Julie Walters (as Bernie McPhelimy), newcomer Nuala O'Neill (as her daughter), and Ciaran McMenamin (as an IRA activist) are particularly well done.
I did not find any of the characters to be particularly interesting, nor did I appreciate its stereotypical and racist demonizing of middle Eastern culture - as if Egyptian women really behave or look like that!
The ending was particularly inane...obviously designed to lead into a sequel, which thankfully never came about.
I was particularly blown away by the art direction - the settings are twistedly beautiful and the lighting evocative of a west end stage musical.
The ending is particularly clever.
I could see bits and pieces of his other films, particularly parallels with Fanny and Alexander.
Well despite the insights, the movie was very long and occasionally tedious--particularly for the Bergman novices.
Sonu Sood and Ila Arun are particularly wonderful, as is Nikitin Dheer in a remarkably compelling debut performance as Sharifuddin Hussein.
Forgetting this the picture is sharp and the colours strong and autumnal, and particularly well done during the night time scenes outside.
Sensationalist and exploitative,it concentrates on the subject's sex life and drug addiction,a particularly unpleasant shot of Miss Ross sprawled unconscious over the toilet is my defining image of the film.
There is just something about it that I never tire of, although there is nothing particularly unique about the plot.
I particularly liked Emma Thompson's entrance Â the camera zooming towards the manor from several different directions before she storms the screen.
The set design is particularly eye catching, especially Imrie's house, personally it reminded me of Hansel and Gretal.
It's particularly frustrating given the talent involved.
Despite some hairspray style slo-mo montages and some awkward construction in the middle, the film manages to make it's potentially clichÃ©d story both involving and convincing, not least because of Giovanni's great sense of place and motion, with his fluid camera-work particularly striking.
I particularly liked the ending and thought that was a very clever bit to end such a film with.
The scenes of these tenants being moved to a soul-less huge apartment complex where every room is the same and people just sit on benches waiting to die struck me as particularly horrific.
Everyone fears a serial killer, particularly when Aubrey disappears.
I'm not a fan of Lohan particularly, but this film looked good.
I don't think Ghai tried to show NRIs in a bad light, because such differences and difficulties are to be expected in any kind of transition from one country to another, particularly when moving from a conservative and traditionalistic society like that of India to a liberal country like USA.
I recommend 'Pardes', for its story, music and superb star cast, particularly Khan and Mahima.
There's a decent amount of gore, including the previously mentioned fish-hook death, and a particularly decent leg-blowtorching-to-flesh-removal that is pretty choice.
Santitos has many wonderful things: great photography by Xavier Perez Grobet, some good acting, particularly by Demian Bichir, and the supporting actors, excellent art direction, a nice sense of humor, a good music score by Carlo Nicolau.
George S. Kauffman & Moss Hart's GEORGE WASHINGTON SLEPT HERE was one of Broadway's most successful comedies of the early 1940s, a bright and witty tale with a slightly Americana tone that World War II audiences found particularly appealing.
This is a particularly comical coming of age farce that just runs from one outrageous skit to the other.
We watched this the other night because of the reputation of the cast - particularly Mark Gatiss and David Tennant - not to mention the "iconic" nature of the name Quatermass.
Along for the ride are his indispensable Knights of the Round Table, particularly Sir Lancelot...
I enjoyed it particularly because all of the characters from the cook to the main characters were very likable, and in spite of the brief nature of the film, I felt that they were still well developed.
I particularly was touched by Yossi's nuanced statement of his relationship with Jagger to Jagger's family and the rest of his platoon by being able to answer the mother's questions of Jagger's personal favorites, and how certain characters were oblivious while others knew what was going on.
There is something that is particularly moving for me about his movie.
Furthermore, because there is so much about these characters that we do NOT know (like Lior's mother), we, like her, find the conclusion of the film to be particularly wrenching.
But I was particularly impressed with Helen Flint playing the vamp who Linden gets involved with when he was drowning his sorrows.
While I don't particularly care for Led Zeppelin or Jimi Hendrix, I can appreciate that they are above average talents, just not my cup of tea.
On my first viewing, I wasn't particularly impressed with this movie but I liked it a lot more on the second and by the third - when it's magnificently transferred on DVD - I was fan, too.
This is a good visual film, particularly when it shows the inside of this incredible mansion where a lot of the scenes take place.
Fulvio (Oliver Platt) comes home after a particularly stressful confrontation and enters the dingy, cluttered kitchen of the home he shares with his wife, Gloria.
I didn't particularly care for the plot, and it is ironic how the film tries to show that women can be independent (a big theme for the 1930's) but at the same time it portrays white women much more superior to black women.
A moment earlier on in the movie is particularly offensive when she is asked to hold a goggle eyed, smiling "darkie" pose to model the sign for the pancake business.
Maybe actors are not always particularly exciting and the directing skills are still under development, but it deserves a 10 for the pure display of genius!
As you might imagine, there are some great lines, particularly in the medieval sequence.
Then suddenly one night, after a particularly tender moment between the two lovers, Tong walks away into the darkness of an open road, while Keng returns to his post in the jungle.
Yet, "Tropical Malady" also brings a romantic tenor to the subject as it implies that the love between the two men has somehow moved into a more meaningful and primal stage, one bereft of the constricting and deadening rituals placed upon it by a civilized world (my suspicion is that is why the filmmakers chose to make this a love story between two men rather than one between a man and a woman, though, frankly, the Thai society we see doesn't seem to be particularly condemning or homophobic in its response to the lads).
His soundtrack is also a major player in the film, particularly in the jungle scenes where the natural - and not so natural - sounds become an intricate part of the mood and drama.
Finally, every scene is shot with a real urgency to it; particularly well done are the nightmarish confrontation 2/3 of the way through the movie and the poignant and shattering ending.
Regardless, the bad acting and silly script is very watchable in a salacious and laughable sort of way--particularly if you enjoy laughing at such films as REEFER MADNESS, SEX MADNESS or HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL.
I particularly loved it when two of the bad girls just told a crook that they shot a cop---and then this crook picks up the phone and tries to call the police!
It's particularly embarrassing that all the American flag waving, done ad nauseam in the second episode, was created by Canadians.
What was particularly disappointing is to see again that Hollywood still fails to confront the fact that meaningful, long-term relationships exist between partners in which the woman is significantly older than the man (including a large number of theatrical pairings).
The film might have been improved had David and Rafi achieved any kind of a meaningful conversation, but since they failed to do this, being too preoccupied with bedtime gymnastics or quarreling, we were denied any access to the thought-processes behind the decisions they made, particularly the most important decisions, to go for a baby (on David's part), and to separate.
In short, this was not a particularly insightful or helpful film.
Not particularly enjoyable as a thriller, certainly not scary and why the DVD still carries an 18 certificate in the Uk heaven only knows.
None of Owen's pranks, and the situations that arise from them, are particularly original, clever, or compelling and so when you come to the highly predictable end you are almost relieved.
Oh, and the subtitles were some of the worst I've seen, particularly in all the business-related discussions (Eigenkapital equity translated as "Personal Capital", Abschreibungen as "Deductions" etc.).
I was so excited to hear the books were being adapted into a mini-series, particularly now with the CGI possibilities out there.
And it didn't even look particularly fast or thrilling, summing up the movie well.
There's not a person that I cared about, not a scene that was particularly interesting.
However, seeing as I enjoy Westerns, but I'm not particularly a fan of them, I didn't forgive a single one of them.
If you're like me, and can enjoy a Western but not particularly a fan, then ignore it.
hard to tell if the acting was particularly bad (although i can say  with certainty that at least 'the partner' was really awful..) as the  actors had NOTHING to work with.
Most particularly, her voice is in its nature contemporary and middle class, with its very modern inability correctly to pronounce the letter 'r'; it is unsuitable to the role of an eighteenth century aristocrat and Empress.
Second, the story wasn't particularly interesting.
A rich Japanese so-called businessman, who can afford a classy Leica camera, he just can't afford a team of professional traveling guides to show him around, particularly in outback.
The acting is all fine, particularly the lead man and the voice on the phone (you'll know what I mean when you see it, it really is a lead role even though you never meet him) but there are so many wholes in the story that it never came together for me.
As other reviewers have already pointed out, the insertion of archival footage from previous mid-40s Curly shorts is what proves to be the downfall of this particular episode--which is something of a shame, since I found a lot of the new scenes to be quite hilarious; particularly the opening scenes with the stooges making their homemade brew (I'm sorry Moe, the crock skidded).
There's some tame sexual scenes that feature no nudity, the girls aren't particularly good looking & there's zero gore.
Harry endures Charles' verbal abuse and philandering, dutifully cleaning the flat, fixing Charles' meals, and tending to his own bedridden mother who lives with with them both (the scenes between Burton and Cathleen Nesbitt as the mother are particularly distasteful).
I thought this film had no focus; it was bad not particularly due to bad acting, or directing, but the lack of purpose.
The problem of this movie is that most of the characters are not particularly sympathetic.
- Derek has a cell phone (obviously, since he used it to call Stacy a number of times) and neither Rachel or Joyce called him about all the silly goings-on around his (Derek's) life, particularly the fact that the dog, Bob, has superhuman powers.
Speaking of money, its not like they were particularly constrained by budget.
It gets particularly silly in later seasons when the ship is seriously threatened by shuttlecraft (I kid you not).
(it IS however writer R.J. Robertson's best, but compared to House 4, Munchie strikes back, or Beastmaster 2, that's not particularly a ringing endorsement) Dexter accompanies Marisa to Transylvania in order to get to her uncle's funeral and subsequent viewing of the video will.
.......Nor particularly noteworthy on the filmographic CV of Gary Daniels sadly, although he does at least get to show off some pretty cool martial arts moves.
A drug smuggler is trying to make a boy into his coke mule, but Taskin stops him through a poorly choreographed fight scene that includes some absolutely horrendous acting, particularly from the boy.
Unfortunately for Ted, this gas is of a particularly nasty sort: it transforms him into a zombie-like creature.
The idea for this story seems to arise from a number of sources, most particularly the silent classic THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI, the various versions of DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE, and THE RETURN OF DR. X--the latter a particularly peculiar B-flick featuring an unexpected Humphrey Bogart as a lab-created vampire of sorts.
He particularly seems to be fond of the fast-forward filming style.
There is a particularly nuanced supporting roll performed with aplomb by a young upstart actress who never quite flew so high in her later years; Jennifer Lopez as Booker.
Sadly Sword Of The Barbarians, whilst not totally without its merits, is hardly a particularly memorable entry in the genre.
Some really spine-tingling make-up effects showing what the mutations and disease cause to humans(and particularly the fruit and cattle)such as opening wounds bursting forth maggots, slimy puss, and beetles!
It seems to suffer post-production problems, in script particularly, as characters vanish, while others make such preposterous choices which could cause irreversible results(..not to mention a ridiculous ending which leads us to believe that nothing was done in regards to the crisis of the film, written off as no threat or danger to the communities surrounding the farm whose soil and water could cause a national outbreak).
It's a shame because the leads hold up their ends and are terrific, particularly the actor who played the brother.
It doesn't even do a particularly good job of capturing the mood of the era, though it's inevitable, of course, that some of that comes through.
A group of particularly dumb people hook up at rich man's house, and do dumb things and get themselves killed.
Boll's co-writer and producer, Dan Clarke, particularly pays close attention to detail in the script to give the story the realism it richly displays.
"Tarantulas: The Deadly Cargo" is not really unwatchable, but it's also not particularly good, unless you're up for a nostalgic "movie of the week" fix.
It's an ambitious project and I feel bad for rating it so poorly, but it's rather pretentious and just doesn't offer enough gruesomeness for the particularly blood-thirsty.
The other stories are not particularly interesting and even annoying.
What's not so good: the product-placement goes from blatant to, at a key point, annoyingly unbelievable; the framing device, particularly at the end.
There is no suspense because some of the things that unfold (particularly the ending) are so implausible that it is an insult to viewers.
The film goes to great lengths explain this with the useless 'Chromotic Radiation' nonsense, in fact Horror of the Blood Monsters if full of stupid inane scientific babble which means nothing & Carradine's character is particularly guilty of this.
It was particularly fun to see real life mathematics prodigy and physicist Brian Greene play a scientist in this movie.
Writer/director Mark Young's script is extremely weak, with it's 'undercover cannibal' plot device being neither particularly convincing nor totally unexpected, and there is plenty of banal dialogue to bog down proceedings even further.
All this is particularly disappointing giving this is the same writer/director (Annie Griffin) who made the brilliant TV series 'the Book Group'.
There are quite a lot of characters, some of whom are quite funny, but very few of whom are particularly likable and attractive.
All except one particularly foul-mouthed girl, who is thankfully given minimal screen time and an extra bloody death, but I digress.
I suppose it was inevitable, even unsuccessful films get sequels these days, particularly those of the horror genre.
However, for those who don't particularly know or care about the Pixies already, loudQUIETloud is among the most hopelessly ineffective documentaries I have ever seen.
The Sheriff and his deputy, the nuclear plant's executives, goons, and whistleblower were are particularly bad.
The ending is particularly bad.
Possibly too high, particularly when Hollywood is producing poor quality films aimed simply at getting butts on seats.
Historical dramas of course have to manufacture a lot Â particularly conversations that took place behind closed doors.
I even have to wonder if the director understood what the movie was about, particularly distressing in this case as the director wrote the script!
There's one sequence near the beginning that I found particularly smart, showing how the assignment for murder is passed on to several involved parties and thus creating a complex structure that sadly never gets properly clarified.
Aside from a brief shot of Jacklyn Smith in a bikini and the requisite "Charlie Girl" snippets, there was little of the cheesy T&A exploitation that the show became known for (particularly in its first season).
Despite a large budget and the usual MGM gloss, this is not a particularly good movie.
But considering Crudup is reduced to a one-note death-obsessed Neanderthal, and Duchovny ends up speaking jive during a particularly bigoted note in the script, and the whole thing wraps up like a teen drama on the CW, I think I'm on pretty solid ground with my assertion.
The editing is particularly jarring, with quick cuts of inanimate objects inserted rapidly, something David Lynch does much more poetically in his work, most notably, Twin Peaks.
i quiet had a laugh at this aspect particularly.
It moves slower than an Ingmar Bergman film played at quarter-speed, the attempts at drama (particularly those in episodes 26, 50, 52, 68, 77 and 78) are laughable, and it is also afflicted with a problem not uncommon in anime: it's mostly made for the fans.
In the movie's feeble defense, all of the performances are very good, particularly Christina Ricci (good as always, I suppose) and the girl from wings.
Plimpton is a young actress who is difficult to cast; she's tough and direct, but her toughness isn't engaging and her direct, no-nonsense manner isn't particularly feminine or fetching.
But I don't particularly like it when movies fail to entertain me, as "Bloodeaters" did.
I've got no idea why this film was banned, as while there are gore sequences in the film; none of them are particularly gruesome, and I reckon that whoever made up the actual 'Video Nasty' list decided to take this film out of circulation because it's a zombie film.
Not that I particularly have a problem with a ban on this movie; it's not worth seeing anyway.
None of the characters are particularly interesting and you won't feel any sympathy when they die.
A handful of scenes work (particularly the moments between Muni and troubled youth Billy Dee Williams), yet the doctor's relationships with his eager-beaver nephew and stalwart wife are sadly artificial.
That scene was particularly frustrating (thank God for picture-on-picture) but the rest of the movie wasn't any better.
The heavy metal soundtrack particularly made me laugh, mainly because it reminded me of the horrendous 80s rock.
It's a shame that Pare ended up in this sort of z-grade rubbish, particularly after such a promising start in "Eddie and the Cruisers".
The ridiculous girlfriend, the annoying townsfolk, the idiotic clergyman, the bratty kids -- why would anyone, particularly anyone with a life long ambition to get to the seaside (Slater's character), decide to stay in such a dismal place?
Blood Lake (Quick Review) This particularly awful film revolves around a group of poor-acting kids in a cabin on the lake wherein somebody starts killing them.
Awfully familiar thriller stuff that takes longer to play out than it should and ends with a particularly overdone, overextended climax.
So overall, not a particularly good film.
Produced & directed by Michael Feifer one has to say that Grim Reaper is awful in every just about every way & it takes a horror film buff with high tolerance levels to sit through all of it's eighty odd minutes, as for those who aren't particularly interested in the genre you probably wouldn't last much more than twenty odd minutes.
It's so bad and so unremittingly awful that it's a lot of fun to watch--particularly with friends.
While some of the riffs (particularly those about the long pauses in the dialogue) are very funny, overall the episode is too inconsistent to rate too highly.
I also thought that the film looked amazing, particularly the dragons, with the effects only let down by some shoddy looking explosions at times.
The cinematography is OK in a 70's "Movie Of the Week" way, and the young romantic leads are decent looking, if not particularly striking.
For some of these offensive cartoons, I have recommended people watch them--particularly for their historical value.
So, the film is offensive, poorly made and not particularly entertaining--everything you'd like in a cartoon, huh?!
The fist fight between Quinn and Van Zan is particularly brutal and engaging.
It doesn't help that the movie looks often derivative of other films that have successfully portrayed the specifics of perception in children (the soundtrack mimicking Thomas Newman is particularly painful in that respect).
Reno 911 is particularly brilliant in its editing.
It's not particularly funny, it doesn't work as a 'documentary' because you learn nothing slightly interesting or fascinating about the characters nor do you gain any insight when you see them or him in action, and the acting is so unnatural that it comes across in some parts as a bad improvisation game, it doesn't work as a gangster film because the majority of the film is spent on dull conversation.
The location shooting was beautifully done, particularly in Paris.
I found the screenplay particularly unconvincing and the direction quite uninspired.
I particularly remembered the exterior shots of the projectile and how it obviously wasn't moving, and the ridiculous "meteors" that were just balls with flares attached to them.
The jungle locations are beautifully photographed by cinematographer Joseph Biroc, but never come across as particularly dark and foreboding.
I see some people adore it for its sheer badness, but I didn't find it particularly amusing (save for a couple of scenes and dialogues) in that aspect.
I collect crappy horror films, particularly the "creature flicks" and I have to confess that Troll 2 is my run-away all-time favorite.
Rent it on a particularly bad day: you'll forget everything irritating in your life, and be weirdly involved in a world of badly-clad midgets; suddenly wondering if baloney sandwiches or urine could possibly be the solution...
Most of it isn't terrible--none of it is particularly good.
It is not particularly well done, however, it is very interesting to residents of the Treasure Coast because of its historical significance.
Everyone looks half asleep and not particularly interested in the stupid film they were making.
Basically "The Lodge" is just another run-of-the-mill horror flick where you have 1) a desolate location; 2) some good looking young adults; 3) a sub-par story; 4) even more sub-par acting, and 5) the feeling that you don't particularly care who survives.
While it DOES feature a brief glimpse of nudity and plenty of over-the-top scenes, it also occasionally actually has some decent acting (I love the old man who owns the soda fountain--he's great) and writing that make it rise slightly above the rest of the films of the genre--particularly towards the end.
If you like this sort of craziness, so be it, but the average person out there will not be particularly pleased with the film as it just seemed dumb and the characters seemed so unreal.
It's not a particularly good film, but to whole-heartedly savage it would be a touch harsh as there are just a few interesting elements which drag it up above "awful" to somewhere in the "slightly-below-average" category.
Furthermore, the entire cast was beautiful; particularly the women.
While a small time drug dealer is out for the ultimate score, the outcome could mean the end to a way of life, particularly for Scrapple the Pig.
Admittedly it doesn't help that said scenes are incompetently executed thanks to shockingly bad special effects and shoddy direction; some of the miniatures are glaringly obvious, and I particularly hope that lead effects house Industrial Light and Magic didn't do the CGI bullet train shots.
Neither of the lead characters was particularly compelling or empathetic.
Making a documentary about a philosopher is a particularly difficult proposition; with most other subjects, we welcome and enjoy varying interpretations, but, with philosophy, we tend to resist variance, because the very aim of philosophy, at least until Post-Structuralists came along, has always been to arrive at the Truth.
The juvenile behavior of the crew, particularly IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MISSION, was abominable.
Ultimately, it a silly movie that stands as a mundane bit of film making, and not a particularly good war film at that.
Both films attempted to cash in on the brief resurgence of action / sci-fi ushered in by Star Wars: A New Hope, and probably did not do particularly well.
I wouldn't particularly recommend this film as it's nothing special.
However, the trite life-lessons orientation of this modern-day fairy tale escapes their idiosyncratic grasp, and the result is a superficial slog with a particularly narcissistic perspective.
As an anthropology major, she sees life as a series of Museum of Natural History dioramas (a particularly contrived device used repeatedly in the film).
The story's resolution feels particularly pat.
The second kind of experiment involves no sex but lots of particularly idiotic violence.
That said, there are some nasty moments, particularly the treatment meted out to the young girl at the orgy; she ends up hanging naked upside down in a shot that recalls the aforementioned distasteful cover shot.
The first film could have been seen as a statement on the breakdowns of family units, but writer / director Craven obviously didn't care about making Part II particularly intelligent.
They've got a great idea, it could have been particularly enjoyable but for the reasons mentioned above.
I liked the minimalistic directorial job and some scenes (particularly the end) were rather interesting, but all in all it's hard to believe this film is from the same director of "Bullit" because it lacks of nerve.
Yet, this isn't particularly any different than the endless chain of gialli circling the market, so to combat this Bianchi put naked flesh across the screen almost through the film's entirety.
Some of the special effects, particularly the long shots of the thing, which resembles a tornado funnel made out of rock, are well executed.
From start to finish, hardly a minute goes by without either a bloody stabbing or some gratuitous T&A from one of its delectable female stars, which is great news for fans of the genre, particularly if they enjoy their movies on the 'trashier' side.
The story may not be anything particularly special, but the marvellously un-PC content (slutty women are treated like dirt by chauvinist men), endless hot Euro-chicks, and a magnificent funky soundtrack make this one a guilty pleasure.
The electrocution sequence was particularly mean spirited, but any credibility gained is certainly hindered by the fact that *every* victim manages to flash her heaving breasts before being executed.
IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM, DO NOT READ FURTHER, THERE BE SPOILERS HERE:  I'm going to go out on a limb here by going against the grain of the previous reviews, because honestly I don't think 'Ultimate Avengers 2' is particularly good.
The main problem with the miniseries is that it is not particularly well written.
Once you get over this initial disappointment, there are moments and contributions that suggest what could have been, particularly Trisha Mortimer as the 'love-keeper' who manages to breath life into Prattens inconsistant dialogue and Voda Barnes who although over-written is suitably sexy as the Au-Pair.
At 98 minutes the film is too long and would benefit tremendously from a ten minute trim, particularly the scenes where various voodoo practioners stop the narrative dead to deliver pages of expository mumbo jumbo in an attempt to give some kind of spiritual context to the proceedings.
This film stood-out from others of it's kind, by portraying the teen violence as particularly vicious.
There's no actual story and particularly the first full hour of the film feels like a compilation episode of "America's Funniest Home Videos: The Bad Kids Edition".
The gangs' last crime on the beach and particularly the denouement form the undeniable highlights of "Just for the Hell of it" because these sequences are shocking and vile, and the use of make-up effects in these scenes finally state clear that you're watching a H.G Lewis' flick!
Furthermore, nobody finds this particularly alarming.
I was particularly amazed at Curtis' horsemanship when he stopped the runaway midget stage coach.
the mannered failure of the principal actress to - well - act is  insupportable, and the annoyance is not decreased by a sense  that the director doesnt particularly care, in fact might prefer it that  way.
I had no need to hear what Gore Vidal had to say, particularly when he went on about Lennon representing "life" and Nixon and George Bush representing "death".
There were some pretty interesting interviews, particularly the one with John Sinclair.
There'sonly about seven people in the entire film none of which are particularly likable.
I consider time-travelling movies particularly interesting most of the time.
About this movie, there are a few things i particularly dislike.
It's particularly annoying when characters are made stupid so that screenwriter get the story the way he wanted.
It's probably because that is what struck me from the very beginning, particularly when there is so much going on in the opening sequence.
I was particularly amused at the fact that the main 'stallion' was portrayed by at least 4 different horses that were not even the same color (watchers can thrill to the feeling of the magical color changing horse!)
Whilst Suzanna Ling is somewhat convincing as the unhinged heroine she is not particularly sympathetic or interesting as a protagonist and little time is spent in the script developing the character or going into the details of why she is the way she is beyond her contemporaries thinking she is weird because she lives at the morgue with her mortician father (shades of Six Feet Under).
The story doesn't seem particularly original or interesting and the performances weren't too hot, either.
The killer Baboons are just people in monkey suits, nothing particularly spectacular.
Overall Primal Force isn't particularly good, but it ain't particularly bad either just sort of average & I think a decent helping of blood & gore would have helped no end to improve it!
The movie takes a little too long to get to the new mutations, so none of the thrills really begin until then, but the action is exciting when it's there, most particularly in the final half-hour.
it's not particularly sexy, and even if any girl-on-girl stuff will get you off, you will at some point see a partially nude Baldwin.
For example, we cut in one scene to the lead (Mimi Rogers') character's teenaged daughter sitting forlornly in front of her school, which -- despite its rather formidable-looking concrete and steel construction -- has just been torn to shreds by a not particularly strong tornado.
It's not that the story is so bad, although it's not particularly outstanding in any way, but the acting is just abysmal on the part of the two lead characters, meaning those other than the regulars in this case.
However, the imitation is not of a very high caliber, lacking the flaire and technical skill of a Tod Browning, a Romero or even, and this is particularly embarrassing, a Michael Bay or Roger Avary (I suggest the people responsible, especially the director, graciously commit harikari immediatly).
The acting went from bad to worse, at times getting so bad you couldn't concentrate on the movie - you had to stop and marvel at a line delivered particularly badly, wondering why it wasn't edited out and if that actor was possibly a funding source for the movie.
But keep it in mind if you feel particularly in need of love.
The story is mildly charming, but not particularly dramatic.
Director Tobe Hooper's masterful talent for crafting a raw, rattling and uncompromisingly fierce intensity that slowly, yet surely builds to a nerve-wracking fever pitch in the harrowing last third (the infamous diner table sequence is particularly horrifying) has never been matched or surpassed in either any of the subsequent sequels or in the needless and atrocious overly graphic remake.
The thing that particularly annoyed me was the style of the movie.
No... A lot of the scenes looked although they had been filmed on a sound stage, whose sets were not particularly impressive.
His acting is particularly wooden in this role, but Cheryl Ladd - good god, her performance (a la Pussy Galore in the film Goldfinger) would have stopped any other career cold.
I don't particularly care about the characters either.
I wasn't particularly offended by anything in the film although I can imagine some people would be.
Utter tripe, but worth viewing for:  1) The fight scene between the Russian officer and Strike Commando near the end - particularly the head clash after running at each other head on from 20 ft.  2) The Russian officer managing to utter his final word: "Amerikanskiiiii!!!"
For great comic shorts particularly pertaining to Batman.
And it begs the question (particularly being that this is a "fan" video) who walks around daydreaming about what it would be like if Batman got raped?
In fact, it's dumb and not particularly interesting--and those are the best things I can say about it.
Outside of one memorial scene involving a meet hook; the movie is not particularly gory by today's standards.
The film grows progressively (and unnecessarily) lewd and at times downright dreary (particularly the out-of-place climax).
In a particularly cruel evening's prank, Grizzle's garden is destroyed, Charlie is reduced to self-mutilation because of the stealing of his pup, and the lowly barn in which he lives is destroyed by fire.
I think that Steve Corwin's estate should be considering legal action considering the particularly unflattering parody of the"Crocodile Hunter".
The story is very human, particularly the interaction between Clemons and his second in command, Ohashi.
City Limits find initial appeal for it's readily identifiable cast (particularly if you're a regular viewer of obscure films such as these) which includes John Stockton,Rae Dawn Chong, James Earl Jones, and briefly Ricky Benson.
Shahid Kapur was particularly disappointing playing the role Ben Stiller played in the original, no laughs for him at all!!
The film is gorier than either parts 4 o5 although two bloody murders don't make this particularly good, there's some slashing & bloody cuts & Tunneller sticks his drill into some guy's groin & his wedding tackle.
The only Puppet Master film I have left to watch in the series now is Retro Puppet Master (1999) which I can't say I am particularly looking forward too.
), seems to be there simply to drop in on his cavewoman from time to time and get his younger protÃ©gÃ© out of trouble (particularly during an exceedingly unpleasant attack of the 'boils').
I like that the After Dark horrorfest opted for indie projects in 2006 (even if it was more economical), and some had real merit to them, particularly Unrest, Reincarnated, The Abandoned, and The Hamiltons (Penny Dreadful was fun enough, just padded though with extra victims).
I did not have particularly high expectations for a TV movie, but I do like the Arthurian legends, and this movie was a butchery.
I particularly liked the fact that these circa 1939 daredevils did almost all of their action scenes in double breasted three piece suits!
The script, written by Spielberg himself, isn't particularly compelling.
But it's not a particularly memorable one, either.
But the film has it moments of sly city humor (I particularly like Jimmy Biao's character, Stienberg) and other elements that may make it worth watching.
In short, there's nothing particularly desirable or appealing about this guy.
Albright's sometimes hammy performance as Dimmesdale seems particularly overdone.
Having said that, it's rather bland and unemotional at times (which, admittedly, fits the stereotype of an early Puritan community) although in the few scenes in which there is emotion (I think particularly of the closing scene with Dimmesdale's public confession) that emotion is well portrayed.
Not a particularly good film.
This is surely the gayest film of all time, particularly in the final battle scene, in which one of the main protagonists is wearing a woman's blouse.
Though brutal in places, particularly during the final confrontation between Daniels and Mandylor, the film actually *downplays* the gory carnage of its source material, which will disappoint those expecting a more faithful adaptation.
The original "Gloria", a 1980 John Cassavettes film starring his wife Gena Rowlands, was an instant classic; be it his direction, the acting (particularly that of Rowlands, who so deserved her Oscar nomination for her performance as the titular character), the gritty look of the film, the authentic New York City locations in all their pre-Guiliani glory, or the screenplay, the film worked on just about every level.
One doesn't have to be particularly wise to mob life to understand that a Mafia capo isn't exactly going to let someone with that much knowledge just walk away.
I don't particularly want to because I can still remember it vividly 16 years later.
The movie's conclusion felt particularly flat to me.
But the European original is full of great acting (particularly from the villain, Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu), a tight storyline, and, of course, a wickedly brilliant ending.
I particularly love the worst schlock from the 1950s and 60s.
A particularly powerful moment was when he slammed the car door shut so hard the window crumbled into pieces.
This episode in particular is particularly awful - the first half absolutely does not make use of its creepy setting.
VIEW FROM THE TOP is not particularly offensive but a considerable disappointment considering the talent involved,and La Paltrow's career since her Oscar nearly a decade back has not really developed as it should've done,not surprising when she takes on roles as trivial as this.Maybe she's being punished for that notorious acceptance speech..........
It is not a good story nor does it have particularly good dialog, and I don't understand how a sane person/studio could decide to buy the script.
One is burnt alive in a tanning bed, a girl is attacked by an army of spiders which seem to have made a home underneath her skin inside a bite that protrudes(this is done through CGI, but is particularly skin-crawlingly effective), one's penis is fried on an electric fence, and another is sliced and diced with a broken whiskey bottle by the ghoulish Mary herself(this death is said to have occurred by a falling candy machine..one almost kills him before Mary attacks).
It all sounds better than it actually is, it's very spread out & isn't particularly graphic.
The acting isn't particularly good and the dialog is a bit cheesy at times, but this is still a fun movie for those who like these low budget horrors.
I do not remember this one being particularly horrible or anything, I just remember it not being as good as the original and that I got a bit bored during this film, another thing that did not occur during the first film.
Not particularly enjoyable crap either.
I was particularly unconvinced by Sabine Timoteo's performance, whose talent restricted her to screaming rather than actual crying.
I didn't think the script was particularly bad for a horror but it was about as scary a basket of kittens sitting on my grans knee.
The rest of the cast appear in primary rough sketches of characters, with Enrique DÃ­az and Camila Facundes particularly contrived in their artificial roles.
This film particularly hard to endure on a TV screen, as it fully belongs to a big one.
Outside of its contrived humor not being particularly funny, the reason I really dislike this film is its portrayal of mental illness for humorous effect.
Okay, I'll admit before I go any further that I don't particularly like the Matt Helm films.
The film is gorier than either parts 4 o5 although two bloody murders don't make this particularly good, there's some slashing & bloody cuts & Tunneller sticks his drill into some guy's groin & his wedding tackle.
The only Puppet Master film I have left to watch in the series now is Retro Puppet Master (1999) which I can't say I am particularly looking forward too.
Moreover, there's ponderousness in GuÃ©diguian's style and it is particularly true when the film turns to comedy.
All right, Robert GuÃ©diguian introduces his characters with a lot of affection and tenderness (particularly Marius) but it is not sufficient enough to make this movie pleasant.
He is a brilliant actor and I have found his other work to be particularly enjoyable- emphasis on OTHER.
Trust me I love horror but this season and particularly this episode just doesn't cut it.
There's a little more bloodshed, a few more victims and more screen time for Chucky but all in all this movie is not particularly fulfilling.
There is one particularly creepy sequence where he's able to manifest a spider TV dinner upon one unfortunate victim.
Overall, while this was a very interesting film, I didn't particularly enjoy it.
Whilst not a massive fan of Sean Connery at the best of times, in this film he is particularly attrocious as the Egyptian Alien with a Scottish accent who dies to the sound of Scottish Bagpipes.
Its stories are not particularly memorable, and it is never at any time even remotely frightening.
Beginning in Circa 1880 it was a popular live entertainment particularly for the 'middle class'.
I put a question mark after spoiler alert because the fact that they off themselves in the end wasn't particularly shocking.
I did not find it particularly disturbing or all that depressing, what I mostly found it was boring.
This film is not particularly noteworthy in itself, but as a benchmark in the development of science-fiction on the big screen.
While not particularly clever, it managed to have an odd charm to it that kept me tuning in every time a new episode was released online.
And Baxley's treatment of the script, particularly his choice of music, leaves a lot to be desired.
I didn't find it particularly good, and I've read a lot of post apocalypse SF.
The voice acting, while pretty good, isn't anything particularly special.
Only Tracy gets any laughs, and those are few enough (his frozen reaction to learning that he's going to be a grandfather is particularly good).
Nothing else in the film really stays with you - it's pure filler, particularly the last minute he's-lost-the-baby gambit.
I was laughing all through the film, particularly when those who made it took themselves seriously.
Apart from this I found nothing particularly good in this film.
Meg Tilly in the role of Karin is particularly troublesome.
The ending is particularly disturbing, where everyone gets shot and dies... but nevertheless, Bonnie and Clyde this isn't.
What kept me watching it is Kay Lenz: she's both endearing and feisty, and she looks particularly sexy when she's angry.
For some strange reason I particularly find the contestants more attractive when they're in their natural state and in their element than when they're back in the studio, all "glammed up" and civilised.
It's interesting enough to watch but not particularly great or unique.
All of the subtlety and ambiguity that made the original so fine, so artful, is discarded and instead the characters and their motives are simplified to the extent that any particularly aware third-grader can grasp them.
Van Damme is particularly "off" in this movie, like he's just going through the motions until his hangover subsides or something.
The blown up 16mm to 35mm image on the screen looks awfully cheap, the ongoing use of grand camera moves and particularly the frequent split screens pretending some artistic merits are just annoying and do make no sense at all!
There is a particularly bad scene in "Harvey" that not only proves my point about how bad the film is, but also make's public an obvious flaw that the majority of an audience would miss the first time watching it.
The story is kind of the same, but there were differences from the original that made no difference whatsoever, and no member of the cast particularly stood out.
Hollywood in the Seventies, among other things, was an era of catastrophic, all-star attempts to recapture past glories particularly its musical heritage and therefore it's small wonder that SEXTETTE ropes in some uncharacteristic cameo appearances by contemporary music stars like Ringo Starr (as an Erich von Stroheim-like director), Keith Moon (as a flamboyant fashion designer) and, weirdest of all, Alice Cooper (as a piano-playing, bellboy crooner sporting a curly-haired wig)!
User federovsky's comments are to me particularly perceptive.
Most sixties sex comedies today seem about as offensive as a seaside postcard, and a lot of the material in "The Best House in London" today seems bland and harmless, if not particularly funny.
Some may say that's no bad thing, but I think there is a glimmer of talent there, particularly in Kate Todd.
Furthermore, the characters, in addition to being unattractively designed, are not particularly compelling.
T.J. Kuenster's dozen songs, on the other hand, are mediocre to bad, particularly the owls' Bach-style numbers, although the ones for Chanticleer are admittingly a lot of fun.
But I beefed an awful lot in my Thumbelina review, so I'll start off with the good: Some of the voices, particularly Eddie Deezen (Who later immortalized Mandark) and Phil Harris (Who deserved a better last bow than this.)
These random musical numbers felt like they came out of some particularly bad Gilbert and Sullivan operetta.
That classic comment of Woody's regarding sex, "This is the most fun I've had without laughing" doesn't particularly impress me with its brilliance.
It is indeed sad that so many people seem to praise this mindless, uninspiring, unoriginal, and not even particularly amusing pearl of wisdom as though it had virtually descended from the gods on Mount Olympus.
My family rented this film and I was not particularly looking forward to it, what with the negative comments on IMDb.
And anything that does happen is often ludicrous, especially a particularly stupid sequence with 50 Cent going crazy and holding hostages in a fast food restaurant and then getting shot by a police sniper.
At least Un Posto Ideale Per Uccidere isn't particularly offensive or nasty Â it's just a routine thriller with a splash of sex and nudity, obvious plot developments, a fashionably downbeat ending, and a toe-tapping soundtrack that is blissfully unrelated to the events on screen!
Not particularly.
One may miss the jangling ambient noise of Platform and Unknown Pleasures, though, and particularly the informative TV broadcasts of the latter, which always fit in context even though they may speak to us more than to the characters.
A person's life story could make a very interesting film, particularly when the person has had as much adversity to overcome as Reynaldo Arenas.
First, it isn't necessary for a movie like this to be smart or particularly realistic, but it should have some integrity so that we can actually believe in the characters.
The film piles bad jokes one on top of the other and beats to death what wasn't particularly funny the first time -- the Italian chef who pines for Marty, the FBI agents' jokes about how hot Marty supposedly is, etc.
He borrows heavily from Ozu, particularly a scene that is reminiscent of Tokyo Story and makes something that is uniquely his own.
While it is set very particularly in China, it achingly proves the universality of the twin globalization pulls of modernization and immigration over the past three hundred years around the world, recalling films from "Hester Street" to "The Emigrants (Utvandrarna)," and films about cities in throes of developmental change, like "Atlantic City."
These are universally recognizable young people - they rebel against and yet feel tied to their families and regretfully break ties with old friends; they fight with their siblings but bail them out; they get lonely, a bit homesick, and bored; they are jealous and ambitious; and they constantly compromise, particularly the women bargaining with the oldest currency.
At first, they look to us as swaggering city sophisticates, as they dress-up in international costumes for a park revue, surrounded by emblems of international commercial culture, like fake Louis Vuitton bags and movie posters, such as of "Titanic," They jealously and zealously call each other constantly by the most modern cell phone and text messengers, particularly from the encircling monorail that at first seems like a symbol of modern technology, but is really cobbled together from airplane parts--though one woman wistfully notes that she doesn't know anyone who has been on a plane- a frequent response to a call is "I'm on the train."
It seems particularly tasteless to me and potentially horrifying for someone who actually went through the trauma of that day, let alone lost someone in the event.
I realise he is a figure who polarises opinion, and he is not particularly popular here in Scotland but he most certainly is not the bloodthirsty little thug portrayed in this film.
I recommend Carol Clover's book, 'Men, Women and Chainsaws' or Adam Rockoff's book 'Going to Pieces' and the documentary of the same name for more on these rules.The documentary is particularly excellent, filled with clips from movies like this (movies that think they're slasher pics because they are sequels to slashers) and 'real' slasher classics.
Her supporting actors were equally wooden, particularly the earnest,caring boyfriend/psychiatrist and the naive and sugar-sweet best girlfriend.
The first two in the series were fairly simple, fun films, relying mainly on Eddie Murphy's performances but nevertheless with strong backup from the rest of the cast (particularly in the first one), and a certain eighties 'cool' factor that, while obviously dated, still charms.
Sure there's some half-decent stop-motion animated monsters but they are particularly disappointing in comparison to other stop-motion efforts of the era and the stock footage used from STANLEY AND LIVINGSTONE (1939) perks things up slightly as well towards the end but aside from those short moments of excitement, well there's lots and lots of walking.
If you're a fan of any of the actors (particularly Cushing), give this a shot, but I found myself mostly bored by this effort.
Its hardly scary stuff or that particularly exciting as a whole, but there are some enjoyable moments thrown into the mix.
Krishna who may or may not be responsible for gang of murderous zombies on the loose in London, but the real 'stars' of this flick are the unintentional humor and the relentlessly kitschy soundtrack (the end title theme is particularly memorable, in that "so bad, it's good" category).
The cast take great pride lampooning the British kind of stage acting, quite animated in their expressions, really letting it hang out unrestrained, but I didn't particularly find very much really gut-bustingly funny..maybe, I'm not part of that crowd targeted.
None of them are particularly any good, but I just like the legion of other Pinhead fans, watch them with the hope that one of the sequels with be as good as the original HELLRAISER.
And, of course, A. R. Rahman's score is terrific -- particularly when pouring out of a theater's surround-sound system!
What is particularly amusing is the presentation of the One World Ruler.
The problem, though, is that even if you do know who everyone is and what the references were about, it just wasn't particularly funny.
The character's are bland & forgettable as is the dialogue, the giant squid isn't in it nearly enough & doesn't do anything particularly special when it does make an appearance.
I don't want to waste much time on this but two scenes were particularly poor & deserve comment.
Karen Black was unforgettable in her performance, which transcended genre expectations, particularly for a made-for-TV movie.
You don't even have to be particularly clever or witty to do this either, the movie pretty much mocks itself.
Let me preface this by saying that I am definitely a fan of Bale's previous work- particularly American Psycho, and I thought training day was awesome.
Certainly this isn't the first film to do this, but that makes it even more problematic because by now filmmakers should know what to do and what not to do, particularly when you are working with the slasher genre.
In regards to the latter point, I didn't feel that Robin came across as particularly noble in this movie (although he does decide to return the taxes to the common folk) but rather he seemed interested primarily in Marian (Uma Thurman).
There's some good swordplay involved - particularly when Robin and his men crash Marian's wedding - but in the end it all seemed a little too simple.
There's some original material (particularly about Robin's background) which fills in some holes from the common legend, but not enough to make this a truly good movie.
But on the other, the story is so ridiculous, particularly the final twist, that you can't take it seriously.
He isn't particularly worried, as there are others in line for succession well before him.
All of the fights take place in areas clearly inspired from beat em up video games but unfortunately none of them are particularly well choreographed and have no real interesting touches so it just comes off as tiresome.
I might mention here that the implication is that the trees have created so much pure oxygen that the fire is particularly violent.
There were immediate problems from the very beginning (such as using a calm voice when it should be awed, and the exact opposite as regards the music), but I liked the fact that none of the crew members were either particularly heroic or evil, but just ordinary people.
Come to think of it, the men in the film often come across as boys, particularly when in the presence of the women in their lives (whether wife, girlfriend or mother).
At times I found myself thinking that I could have been looking at a painting - particularly in the scenes that showed the city of Toronto.
Overall, you won't be neglecting yourself anything particularly special if you decide to skip this unfortunate little disaster.
I just saw TROUBLE IN STORE and didn't particularly like it.
I didn't particularly like the film, as JUST MY LUCK seemed an awful lot like a Jerry Lewis film--with broad humor and comic bits that were overdone--with every last bit of comedy squeezed dry from the skits.
During one particularly frenzied attack, Taeko slips and falls downstairs breaking her neck.
In many peoples minds child abuse is a taboo subject, and, rather like the way that the phrase 911 has become iconic, the subject of child abuse, particularly child sexual abuse has become a metaphor for the most unimaginably awful thing that can happen to a human being.
A particularly bad scene is when Donald Pleasance is telling someone something, and then they cut the scene and he finishes the sentence several minutes later!
You see, there's nothing particularly intelligent about them...just condescending and fake!
I particularly despise the use of killing a child for nothing more than shock value.
Neither is particularly good at being sarcastic either.
The 'Last Days of Patton' movie and book paint a picture of a brooding, dark figure based on undocumented, unreferenced, and unsubstantiated claims that appear to have been fabricated as a crude character assassination and are totally at odds with facts and published reminisces of people who knew and worked closely with Patton, particularly Eisenhower and Bradley.
Written & directed by Cartney Wearn I watched Pray for Morning last night without knowing a thing about it, the title is rather vague & could have referred to anything so I didn't go into it with any great expectation yet I still found myself disappointed & not particularly having a good time.
The film spends far too much time showing annoying American teens wondering around this old hotel in the dark, it just doesn't make for particularly entertaining viewing & gets very boring very quickly.
There are many examples of this seamy genre, particularly prevalent since the late 1980s, the film under discussion here being perhaps the most financially rewarding, earning more than 30 million dollars above its production cost of $750,000, but only a rabid fan of this cinematic category may consider it to be an artistic success, as well.
McTiernan holds up his end of the film admirably as well -- he uses the claustrophobic nature of the office building to great effect (particularly in any scene involving an elevator shaft), and he keeps the film rolling at a rollercoaster pace, building up the anticipation of the audience before unleashing the action.
The animation is amazing, particularly with the children.
The costumes were particularly awful.
Having said that, some of the music â particularly the childrenâs choruses â is quite pleasing, though...
It's not particularly effective for horror or thriller approach, but it is a good movie in the way the one actor plays the double roles and the color and movement Tsukamoto captures.
Krishna who may or may not be responsible for gang of murderous zombies on the loose in London, but the real 'stars' of this flick are the unintentional humor and the relentlessly kitschy soundtrack (the end title theme is particularly memorable, in that "so bad, it's good" category).
She's got a particularly intriguing face.
I particularly disliked the characterisation of the relationship between Holmes and Watson - it seemed that Holmes held Watson permanently in contempt which is not something that I felt when reading the stories.
This was my first experience with a film festival, particularly with a world premiere.
This is a super-low budget film that isn't horrible, but it isn't particularly good either.
They're not particularly interesting and to me, and in fact, are annoying enough to give someone the homicidal twitch.
The passengers never really seem to be in direct personal jeopardy, particularly with odds of about 1:10 (including the terrorist flying the plane) and yet they seem too paralysed with fear to do anything.
The Lord's Prayer sequence was particularly crass.
The acting is particularly bad and while I'm not one of those who considers Blair a bad actress I think in order to keep working she had to accept roles such as this.
Unfortunately, none of the stuff is particularly interesting.
Of all the actors, the one who deserves the biggest round of Bronx cheers is Borgnine, whose performance is utterly awful--particularly when he, believe it or not, transforms into a ram-man late in the film.
Jordan Brower is appealing as Eric and has particularly good chemistry with Jesse Bradford.
There is a particularly chilling scene of Callew ending up in the morgue with a sheet over his face.
However, some bad films manage to be bad but not particularly watchable--they're just dull beyond belief.
Now you'd think perhaps with a title like this that there might be some sexy cave-babes, but frankly none of the well-groomed ladies looked particularly attractive--even if they all had nicely permed hair!
It is particularly annoying given that the "plot" chosen to replace it is so bog-standard and predictable.
While waiting, they begin to tell their innermost secrets about their marriages--particularly the details of boredom or infidelity.
Sorry to disappoint, it's always a good thing for somebody's pet project to reach the screen, particularly a serious French attempt at grabbing an international audience, but this movie is ruled by a director who needs a tougher producer and an editor who has the capacity to say "no" more often.
Everything is telegraphed in advance--particularly with the tree cutting.
This movie was fairly weak on the dialog, the acting wasn't particularly convincing, and the action was spotty.
There are a number of good and interesting scenes in The Paper Chase (I particularly like the scene on the frozen lake and most of the study group scenes), but as a whole, they don't add up to much.
And every scene, particularly those with the actor playing Andrew Cunanan are stretched out with the most appalling acting I have ever seen.
I particularly enjoyed the portrayal of Pitt the Younger.
My boyfriend works on films, particularly war movies so its not like I have no clue what I am on about.
This silent film is somewhat heavy on its use of intertitles (which do inevitably suffer in translation), is not especially distinguished in its acting and as a comedy not particularly funny.
The problem with this show, particularly episodes like BOTH of these, is that I found no empathy for either family in both episodes.
The most shameful mess was how often the story ripped off other considerably more brilliant deep sea crisis flicks, particularly "The Abyss."
Maybe they couldn't even afford a 4th grader, particularly if he was working for scale.
the scene in which the kids kill the priest was particularly upsetting.
I love movies with a slow, contemplative pace, such as Visconti's, and am a decided admirer of European - particularly French - films, but this one just produced an endless stream of yawns.
The sex scenes are particularly disturbing.
Perhaps had I stuck it out Id have got my reward but in the first half this just didnt have anything to excite me, make me think or particularly want to see how it ended up.
The acting, particularly that of young Kiziuk and the late Jack Warden as his kindly uncle Baruch, is superb.
This series about slaves coming to America is not particularly good, or well made.
Sean Penn is stranded in a strange city where everybody seems to realize his problems and his struggle, and insist on being particularly mean to him, just for the sake of being mean.
I recognized these clips--particularly the scene with the pilot bleeding from the mouth.
The Breed starts sometime in '...The Near Future...' where homicide detective Steven Grant (Bokeem Woodbine) & his partner Phil (Reed Diamond) follow up a lead on a particularly nasty serial killer who's running around at the moment.
I particularly enjoyed the showdown at the end.
Quite often I don't mind the changes if they make sense or add something to the story or if the change is accompanied by some particularly affecting performance.
The weird drunken Thai hooker lady-boy in the Frank-N-Furter costume who spends most of the movie swigging from a bottle and laughing hysterically at nothing at all is particularly noteworthy.
With a fraction of the gore that fans have come to expect from the genre (the only memorable moment being a fun piranha attack), particularly dreadful acting, and a group of unlikeable characters you actually look forward to seeing being eaten alive, I found Tarantini's movie to be one of the weakest Italian cannibal films I have seen.
I've been studying cinema in university for more than a year and stumbled across two Jean Renoir films including this one who was particularly painful.
The characters all seem to be from different cultures & from different eras which really is jarring, particularly in the 1960s - 1970s laid-back style of Carradine.
This movie would have been plenty creepy if there was some payoff every so often, but unfortunately it just keeps building up and building up to a climax that is neither particularly scary or surprising.
The songs aren't particularly memorable, and the choreography is uninspired.
As for the Americans, most didn't look or sound like actors--particularly "Beverly Hills" (a.k.a.
And why waste time re-doing segments from the show, particularly the entire "Daydream Believer" video?
I was looking forward to seeing this, particularly as it features Sean Penn and marks the only film ever to have been allowed access to the inner sanctum of the United Nations in New York.
The climax with the megalomaniac mastermind is just plain foolish, particularly when we've seen how a real mass murderer ends up in "Downfall (Der Untergang)" - devoid of regrets or self-awareness, whereas here complex national politics are reduced to issues of individual actions and consequences.
For a big budget film, the cinematography and make-up are distractingly harsh, particularly Penn's pancake shmear in a NYC January vs. Kidman's porcelain doll look; maybe they had lighting restrictions due to their much touted filming actually at the U.N.
While this doesn't sound particularly exciting, this growing feeling of paranoia and the increasing madness of the lone character propel the story.
Watching this film because of John Lennon's endorsement and a short synopsis I had read, I found myself very upset about what I saw and disappointed with the story as a whole (particularly the second half = the acting and plot went downhill very quickly).
If I were from this age group, I would be particularly offended by this movie because of the way it portrays teenagers.
It would seem that his connection with De Sade's writings - particularly those that concern the corruption of innocence (which is to say the majority of De Sade's work) - speak to Franco in a profound way.
And Robert Downey Jr., an actor I love, does the best he can with the material - but he does fall flat in several scenes, particularly a horrible scene involving him waving a gun around next to his pool.
You can't quite imagine how so many people seem to know and admire a guy who has never had a job, isn't getting work as an actor, dates homely women, and doesn't even seem particularly funny or charming.
"Dodge City" doesn't boast a particularly complicated morality, a particularly nail-biting plot or a particularly rich set of characterisations.
Damn it's particularly spiteful stuff, though not terribly gory, but it had its fair share of bloody moments.
Most of the family members hate each other and are not particularly happy with their awkward ruination.
The acting is atrocious, particularly from the slow child in the title role.
But in the late 1940's and throughout the 1950's, many Technicolor pictures, particularly from 20th Centory-Fox and Warner Bros, were re-issued in black and white --- all that rare and beautiful Technicolor work relegated to the ash can by Hollywood cheapskates.
The film ended almost immediately afterward, with the whole film void by Sebastian's whole story build up meaning nothing and a horrible half forced, paedophilic ending with a particularly young and innocent acting girl.
However the most breathtaking landscape shots appear to come from matt paintings, and Curtiz doesn't handle the wide open spaces of the west particularly well.
Alas, none of them have particularly memorable roles to get their teeth into.
This may rank as one of the low points in the history of British TV;12 "celebrities" are flown off to some exotic tropical Island to see if there is any mutual attraction with each other,hopefully leading to sexual attraction.The word "celebrity" once had rather more respectful meaning for most of the 20th Century;mainly with those who had achieved fame because they deserved it,through endless hard work and great ability at their chosen field.In the 21st Century,particularly in the UK,it is now mostly associated with tawdry,dislikable,intractably pointless excuses for human beings most interested in seeing their names in equally reprehensible tabloid newspapers or c_______ magazines.
Supporting cast (including the interesting Laird Cregar, playing a sort of bullfighter's critic full of hot air and flattery) is overtly-colorful and animated (particularly during the fight sequences), making Power's protagonist seem even more one-dimensional.
But with the exception of Anthony Quinn and that memorable dance sequence he does with Hayworth I found the rest of the cast - particularly the young actor Rex Downing who played Juan as a boy - unconvincing and altogether uninspiring.
But it was very bland, which I do not fault the performers for at all, particularly the women who played the angels as they really did look like them.
The production of IN THE WAKE OF THE BOUNTY, particularly on Pitcairn Island, was related in a book by the director published to coincide with the movie's release, In the Wake of the Bounty--To Tahiti and Pitcairn Island (Sydney: Endeavour Press).
Supporting parts are low-powered and under-developed, particularly the pivotal character of Puck.
As executed by writer/director Zak Penn, the poker scenes are particularly languid and lifeless and utterly incomprehensible to any non-poker players who may happen to be a part of the audience.
Things escalate rapidly from there, and Mulder and Scully wind up in the midst of occurrences which are particularly baffling even to them.
Warner's Brothers B unit goes for a straight exploitation plot, but manages to stay within the Production Code nonetheless, resulting in a movie that is neither amusingly salacious nor particularly well made -- a look at the plot outline offered by the Internet Movie Database will give you a rough idea of how silly and coincidence-actuated it is.
Now, having said that, what makes this movie a particularly bad piece cinematic endeavor is that Scott and company are afraid to allow the force of that insight to shine through.
On the other side of a particularly one-dimensional, racist "script" are the Somalis, who are presented with even less personality than the soldiers--their video game objective is to yell, wave automatic weapons, and act like utter psychopaths.
The love story bit dialogue between Bond and Vesper particularly is yawn inducing with no chemistry between the actors on screen, and Vesper's suicide at the end particularly contrived and unbelievable.
I didn't find the first few scenes of the movie fit in particularly well with the rest of the tone, but it was a minor annoyance.
Being neither American or particularly patriotic, 'Old Glory' was never going to have much of an effect on me and, while I do recognise it as a handsome piece of animation, it's a misfire in the entertainment stakes.
Both are set in a similar time period, both feature a lot of over-the-top performances and both have a silly musical style about them (though the music in THE ASSASSINATION BUREAU was a lot more annoying--particularly the singing).
She makes efforts to befriend the prisoners, particularly the beautiful & innocent Marie, but the wicked old headmistress constantly boycotts her.
The script by Klenhard & Tom Walla is far too pedestrian for my liking, nothing significant happens for long stretches, in fact when I think about it nothing particularly significant happens during the films entire 90 plus minute duration.
Technically the film is fine but wholly unadventurous, there's nothing particularly wrong with it but nothing particularly good about it either.
Anyway he's after her and not particularly concerned about how he gets her back.
The aging "second generation" cast members look awkward, particularly Spanky McFarland, who is really too old to portray a kid.
Now, I am generally a fan of bad movies, particularly bad horror movies...
The only problem is, none of the characters are particularly interesting.
The relationship with his blind roommate is not particularly drawn out either (you're half-way through the film before you realize it's his roommate, and not a relative).
The leads aren't very likable and I didn't particularly care if they got together in the end.
Davis is watchable, although her performance is variable; Montgomery gets more annoying as things progress and is particularly done in by the strained plotline.
However, watch for Stephen Graham's portrayal of particularly crabby heart patient Travitt in the year 2000 scenes.
Also, the plot and story are not particularly involving or believable.
But it's not the kind of concept we Brits are particularly good at.
episode really stands out, particularly since Natalie is a cloyingly quirky character that no real person would stand working with).
Yeong-ae Lee's vengeance-seeking protagonist is an inaccessible anchor for the film and is not particularly charismatic.
While these particular elements of plot, character and location have probably never been brought together before, there is nothing particularly novel about any of them.
The main theft scene was well-done, and the technical wizardry of the thieves quite impressive (particularly given the 1967 production date).
This is before you even consider the petrifying inclusion of shots stolen from Star Wars (particularly one shot of a TIE fighter exploding before the FAlcon, which reappears at least 10 times in the film) in the wrong aspect ratio and the shocking inclusion of music from Indiana Jones.
Typical kinda situation where the cop, instead of being professional or even particularly smart, takes more than a professional interest in the suspect, with predictably sexy results.
It's not particularly innovative or original, in fact it sticks to an age-old formula and is pretty forgettable.
Coppola did not learn his lesson (the way he edited this movie is particularly embarrassing), and he returned to the genre in the '80s with two mega bombs, "One From the Heart (1982)" and "The Cotton Club (1984)."
A throwback to the 1930's screwball comedies, this has a very flimsy plot which allows the aging cast to act like complete nincompoops, particularly as the film goes on.
The sub plot of a romantic triangle among Clay, Foster and Amy Connors (Cathy Downs) wasn't particularly necessary for the story, and didn't wind up contributing to the finale.
Chill Wills' performance is particularly annoying.
The artificial rocks have a particularly phony look about them.
He's not particularly witty, especially for a professor, and he does really annoying things like show up uninvited to spy on her while she's out with her brother and then cover it with a lame excuse.
I wanted this film to give me more, and if I now want it to I have to put in the hard work which after having viewed the film I don't particularly want to do, and to do it this way around isn't as much fun either.
But the camera is merciless, particularly in close up, and this film production presents us with the middle-aged Leslie Howard, Norma Shearer, John Barrymore, and Basil Rathbone in roles that would be better served on the screen by much younger players.
Now Lou Costello was no saint; he was known to have a short fuse, he and Abbott fought bitterly on occasion and even went for months at a time without speaking to each other off the set, he gave many of his directors a lot of trouble and he had a habit of "appropriating" furniture and props that he particularly liked from the sets of his pictures.
I didn't find it particularly "brilliant," nor for that matter, very engaging.
Oh, I almost forgot, I will give Martel this: speaking from the somewhat limited experience as the son of a pathologist and a nurse, Martel DOES manage to capture how deliriously boring and maimingly monotonous a medical convention can be (otorhinolaryngologists no less, their motto would rightly be "fun with phlegm"), particularly when held in a craphole motel (think Leaving Las Vegas' witty "The Whole Year Inn"-cum-"The Hole You're In") and further exacerbated by a tediously planned dramatization of how to conduct a patient interview (a device Martel must have found brilliant since she devotes exponentially more time to this than anything else).
Made in Italy, and financed on the cheap by Universal, "Raw Wind in Eden" isn't a particularly good-looking movie, but there are some compensations for its tatty look.
It was never a particularly good show and in the ensuing years it has never really had much of a cult following (except, maybe, among gay audiences who imagined more in the Starsky-Hutch relationship than was ever intended -- something immortalized in a Halloween episode of "Will & Grace").
Yet, neither particularly admired for its quality nor beloved for its unintentionally humorous mediocrity, the show has lingered in our consciousness, even as many that were far better and more original have faded into oblivion.
Steve Johnson, who provided the gore effects in the first film, also does the make-up FX for this one, and he does a pretty good job; particularly impressive moments include a woman's tits transforming into demon hands and a wonderful snake creature with a huge lashing tail.
Despite the very interesting cast no one is particularly good (and Theresa Russell gives one of her really bad performances, which unfortunately by now outnumber her few very good ones).
If so, it is unconscionable, not to mention misleading, particularly to tell people that marihuana is worse than cocaine and heroin.
Unless a film is particularly artful, I will rate it according to its entertainment value, not necessarily its technique, theory or method.
Star Wars was never particularly impressive under close scrutiny.
Their sort of humor is what you might expect--Burlesque style skits and not particularly inspired ones.
As for the quality of the film overall, this isn't a particularly bad film for the first half and it does have an interesting plot twist (Dracula finding love).
The visual world is stunning and inventive, particularly the sets, but I was not engaged.
Through some careful shots and repetitive music we see the story pan out as any other romantic comedy would and there are minimal surprises to generate a good watch, particularly when the humour is gross out and shamefully degrading to the actors.
The acting is utterly abysmal - particularly Kelly LeBrock, who is totally talent-free.
First Knight is not a particularly good film of King Arthur.
Sean Connery was not a good choice for playing Arthur, they got a Scot playing an English King and even though I'm a Bond fan, Sean Connery is a particularly good actor after that.
The film was also not particularly loyal to the Arthur legends and this is another example of Hollywood butchering an English legend, similar to Robin Hood films.
But, for 1944, it was unusual to see color films--particularly horror films.
There are some technical problems--the sound, particularly, is spotty in places.
There are good people and evil people and none of them are particularly complex.
Anyway, Android of Notre Dame is no better than the others, and it isn't particularly disgusting either, and that is a achievement when we're talking about Guinea Pig films!
The script sometimes writes checks the F/X can't cash (The legs and flying saw blade scene is particularly unconvincing) And the movie concentrates so much on the anatomical gross out it starts looking like an alien autopsy film.
Not simply the photography, but the design and particularly the locations (Eastern Montana) which are at once authentically American and otherworldly.
While this certainly isn't nice, at least he had the decency to pick some people who weren't particularly pillars of society!
I knew nothing of this but the fact that it was adapted from a novel by the brilliant Ian McEwan (which I had not read), was directed by John Schlesinger (whose A Kind of Loving, Midnight Cowboy, Sunday Bloody Snday, Far From the Madding Crowd and particularly Darling I have always loved), and starred three actors I liked - Anthony Hopkins, Isabella Rosselini and Campbell Scott.
There's plenty to make this an unconvincing story, but I'm sure that viewers will mostly be interested in its nostalgic factor, particularly since it's young stars include pre-fame Stephen Dorff and 80s mischief comedy regular, Ami Dolenz.
That film's particularly large cast rivals this one and the direction and script are a lot better.
The acting is terrible from all involved, Stallone is even more wooden than usual, Stone is just plain awful & not particularly good looking in this while the usually superb James Woods is left trying to make the best of a terrible script & a rubbish character but even he ends up looking somewhat embarrassed.
Nor does it particularly excite the viewer.
In one particularly bizarre sequence he's gliding around on some sort of a wheeled dolly like a wax statue.
The first two Glenville films were not very good, but competent efforts in the slasher genre (with some particularly disgusting gore sequences in part 2).
I don't think Ghost Lake makes itself particularly clear & that has to be down to the script & Woelfel, I don't think Ghost Lake comes across as a straight horror film as instead of going for scares & gore it tries to develop a complex mystery which just isn't that interesting or engaging, imagine a low rent The X-Files (1992 - 2002) episode.
The acting didn't impress & I didn't like any of the character's particularly.
The acting by the kid who plays Patch, and by Peter Fonda, is particularly poor.
The dialogue was inane and insipid, the situations completely unbelievable--particularly the pornography subplot, which I can only imagine was meant to be quirky, but fell very flat.
A particularly endearing moment was when Al tells the camera, `I thought this would last forever,' after describing a romantic moment shared by the couple.
Directed by Peter Manoogian for the 'killer toy' specialist's Full Moon Demonic Toys doesn't rank particularly high in this horror film sub-genre as far as I'm concerned.
An obtrusive reporter convinces his girlfriend-editor to travel to Yugoslavia, more particularly to an ancient abbey where he and his archaeologist-father searched for the tomb of a fella named Ilok.
Regretfully, this is particularly true of Taylor, who is... shall we say... extremely ample.
Nope, the flick was just a mediocre flick that didn't do anything particularly right.
At two hours long, it is a true endurance test, particularly considering that I would have gotten up and left after 10 minutes (or, rather, not gone at all) if I hadn't been dragged to it by someone else.
If your expectations are so low that nudity in a non-adult film is sufficient to get you to watch a movie, particularly given how easy it is to find nudity and near nudity on line without going to an adult site, then this is probably the movie for you.
The performances aren't horrible, but the two leads are not as charismatic, particularly Montgomery, to get the plot from point A to point B as per the story, and the movie finally fails on the weakness in the plot, particularly towards the end of the film.
as he assembles his A-Team Â a giant played by Carry On veteran Bernard Bresslaw, an elfin bowman who talks like a constipated Dalek, a not particularly short dwarf and Patricia Quinn's witch with a particularly naff line in sorcery involving, er, smokey eggs.
That one seemed particularly strange, but made all the more strange by how the killer had no motivation to kill.
"Dead Calm", however, works as a thriller because it emphasises tension over actual violence and gives us characters, particularly the young woman played by Nicole Kidman, whom we can care about and with whom we can identify.
Not a particularly pleasant couple and not what any sane person would consider 'comic relief'!
One particularly disgusting scene involving peeling flesh is clearly unsuitable for kids, and I can imagine this giving young children nightmares, as hokey as it is.
takes on a particularly bitter resonance.
I had heard that this documentary was particularly brutal and difficult to watch, but I thought it was important to see just what was going on in Iraq before the US dismantled Saddam Hussein's regime.
I was convinced the inevitable transformation was going to be in his speaking patterns so i wasn't particularly interested in his views on love, because I'm sorry, i don't mean to be offensive to anybody but having a speech impediment as BAD as that, is something i couldn't bear to hear for the rest of my life, you have to try and do something about it.
I saw this film about 20 years ago and remember it as being particularly nasty.
The last fight sequence, however, is handled particularly well.
It's kind of amazing this clunker ever made it beyond the idea phase, particularly with talents such as Murphy and director Ron Underwood (CITY SLICKERS) involved.
I've never seen her look anything less than fabulous, but her waist looks particularly long and slender in this movie.
if people insist on labeling this under that category, were particularly popular around the time of this film.
Then it would not be a particularly good movie but it would be less aggravating.
The film is not particularly gory though.
That said, I don't think it's particularly well made, well written, or well acted.
After MM discovers that his parents have been paying SJP to date him (this isn't a spoiler; this plot device is revealed early on), he uses a particularly crude word to tell her to go away.
It's just as well because the script is poor, the acting (Douglas and Fawcett particularly) is laughable in some places, and the special effects are on the point of being disastrous.
However, Hector turns out to be a particularly unstable droid, particularly when the randy robot develops a liking toward Alex.
If I were to single out one aspect that is particularly like fingernails on the blackboard, it is Catherine Keener as Lee.
Glowing supporting cast performances, particularly the heartwarming rendition of Ram Dass, played by Tariq Alibai round out this WonderWorks production.
But great isn't anywhere to be found anywhere here - story, performances, and particularly the absurd courtroom hi-jinks.
Janet, a doe-eyed blonde from Cedar Falls, falls hard for Brett, and she does not take it particularly well when he comes clean about his engagement.
I was particularly impressed with how the Merill character turned out-- she could have SO easily been the stereotypical vampy-sexy-screwed-up character, but she was so fragile and so NOT in charge of herself while still remaining appealing-- and with Cherry Jones, of course ("Sit down, Shelly"), and Sean Hatosy is heartbreakingly dear -- could he possibly be anything other than a small-town cop searching for stronger self-esteem?
In other Kitano films I have seen, such as KikujirÃ´ no natsu, Sonatine and Zatoichi, there was violence (particularly in the latter two) BUT there was also a certain likability of the main character--even when he was not a "good" guy.
The decision to shoot on a soundstage is particularly disastrous, since it never looks like anything but a soundstage, and this despite having a good cinematographer (Tony Pierce-Roberts).
It's particularly spooky because the building is an ex psychiatric hospital in which the owner years ago went mad and slaughtered staff and patients alike.
: By the way, I was particularly disappointed with Jennifer Ehle, who I have loved in each and every role (Pride and Prejudice, Possession, Paradise Road).
In one particularly awkward shot he is naked but his hands are covering his best parts.
What is particularly interesting is the many characters he plays in this film.
None of the other acting performances are distinguished- Pedro Armendariz as Temujin's loyal brother Jamuga is about the best- and at times they verge on the ridiculous, particularly Wang Khan and his scheming shaman, both embodiments of the western stereotype of the 'wily Oriental'.
While deliberately elevated, formal, often slightly archaic, language was something of a convention in epic films, much of the dialogue here has a particularly stilted flavour to it, along the lines of 'You're beautiful in your wrath' and 'She is a woman- much woman.
But worse are the montages- aside from Bratz, which is in a league of its own, this is some of the just, well, inept editing I've seen in many a moon, particularly at the beginning and end where it seems as though nobody even watched the f***ing last 9/10ths of the movie that came before or after it!
But my review is as follows: -The story is confusing, more supernatural than ever -The acting is horrible, particularly on Adrian's part.
Unfortunately, none of them are particularly interesting.
As a result, her message was certainly not subtle nor was it particularly convincing.
And I personally was particularly impressed with the discussions about love, sex and young parenthood which are all dealt with in a surprisingly tasteful and very matter-of-fact way making it sound and feel as if it were an important and meaningful touch added to the film's already tedious and heavy subject matter.
My memory of this movie (which I saw on video in the late 80s) was that it was a fantastic example of 80s/Michael Cimino controlled excess - or, that it rocked, along the lines of To Live and Die in L.A. (which, to my mind, is a preeminent movie from any era, but a particularly gorgeous 80s gem).
There are a few particularly funny moments, but many of the jokes fall flat, due to either poor delivery or them just not being funny.
Scenes were completely drawn out, particularly a sex scene that had my friends and I looking at each other thinking "when is this going to end."
The plot goes kind of in this order: intrigue, a little teaser of violence, more intrigue, a little completely irrelevant sex, more intrigue, the introduction to a couple of particularly lethal and ugly guns, and a violent shoot out full of explosions.
Sorry,...I just didn't particularly care for this film.
The production looks good (particularly when Valli is led down into her cell, or when Peck inspects her glamorous bedroom), but the courtroom showdown is rather rote, as is the finale.
Laughton is particularly good - loathsome yet real-seeming.
A few particularly ridiculous things to look for, if you watch this movie anyhow:  1.
Unless you are easily distracted by Laura Antonelli, I wouldn't say that there is anything particularly noteworthy about this weak Italian comedy.
It does get dull at times, particularly the beginning as it starts off slow but it becomes funnier as the film continues.
What I particularly liked was that although it didn't give in to Maria's cynicism, neither did it pull any punches as to the way the world really works.
This episode of ST:TNG is particularly troubling in two ways: the questions and issues it initially raises, and the ease with which it evades actually probing or answering those issues.
This is just one more of Hope's mistaken identity comedies, and not a particularly good one.
I particularly loved the villain's dash toward the sea (?)
Considering that Abbott and Costello had a whole lot of films behind them and some clout, I always have wondered why they agreed to do some seriously bad films--particularly in the latter part of their careers.
She has allowed herself to be used by a man, not unlike her unfeeling father, and her protrayal makes us sympathize with her, particularly when she finds she's pregnant and the man refuses to help her.
Saphira as Rachel Weisz wasn't particularly well cast; she sounds a bit young and not very wise, as Saphira is supposed to be.
However, depending on the viewer's mindset, the shock-tactics might appear to be a little old-hat, particularly in a society where many of the incidents detailed are rife.
Also, whilst this is admittedly fairly grim stuff thematically, with endless scenes of humiliation, rape, murder, and the suggestion of cannibalism in the film's final moments (or so I understoodÂthe whole soup thing was fairly confusing), there is nothing particularly shocking to see: a very weak neck slicing, a couple of off-screen axe attacks, and a headless chicken.
On the plus side the eighteen-year old Uma oozes sex appeal and a sleazy sort of glamour which must have attracted Tarantino to her, and there are some gritty, realistic performances, particularly from Buscemi.
While not particularly interesting on its own, Anger's commentary is interesting--especially regarding what happened to this actress later in life.
Chris Klein is particularly bad in his attempt to be the bad ass.
M. Bison's entry into the early set was particularly painful to listen to, and Balrog's cheesy entrance into the scene was so god-awful that I was actually pining for the time when he held a video camera as Chun-Li's cameraman back in 94!
The sound quality is particularly bad.
The exterior sequences are competent if not particularly exciting and there is a nice sense of the rugged countryside at times,but much of the movie is static,almost stagey in nature.The fight in the ship's cabin is clumsily handled and I feared some of the scenery was actually going to collapse under the weight of the flying bodies.
Ending is particularly sudden and illogical.
The acting (particularly by Alicia Fulford-Wierzbicki) and cinematography of this movie are so well put-together that it makes the movie's horrible cliche of an ending that much more painful and embarrassing.
"Les Ã©garÃ©s" will not make me change my mind.It's certainly a cinema de qualitÃ© with polished pictures,good directing.But his movies (and I've seen a lot of them;"Barocco" "les soeurs BrontÃ©" "j'embrasse pas" the ending of which is particularly infuriating)do nothing for me.
I unfortunately own a copy of this movie, and I spring it on people when I'm feeling particularly evil.
The sword fights lack energy, and the amateurish acting, particularly by Monique Gabrielle, is laughable.
In this episode, he was not particularly mean to anyone (anyone innocent, anyway) and was very good to Minnie.
Still it has held up well, with some nice black and white animation, plus the music is absolutely wonderful here, particularly in the sword fight between Mickey and Pete.
Keira Knghtly, while attractive and talented enough, was particularly ill - suited for this film.
He is not particularly handsome or charismatic, he can't even speak English, but the town leader's vivacious, sultry wife, played by Keira Knightley, falls in love with the Japanese man and urges him to take her away.
It does reach a certain level of hysteria in the second half particularly when the 50-something Dunaway/Crawford replaces her ill 20-something daughter on a soap opera.
The 16-minute "Joan Lives On" speaks specifically to the film's cult status with Waters and Crawford impersonator Lypsinka providing particularly comic insight to its gay following.
The characters of Khaila and Charles Lewin are particularly overlooked.
I particularly liked it whenever we were introduced to other time travellers, particularly the shrink - yes, that was a surprise to me, very clever.
What has been happening, particularly most recently, is that academics and others such as liberals have been holding up a mirror to conservative America and conservative America doesn't like what they see, so they try to shift the blame on liberalism by screaming anti-patriotism.
Jackson loves the slow-motion work so much that we have to endure some particularly dreadful sequences with the Hobbits (most notably the already infamous bed scene) and at the end (where I really thought Frodo was going to give Sam a full-on smacker!).
The film's efforts toward the end to generate some artificial excitement were particularly cloying and lame.
When they acted like they were together it wasn't believable, Baldwin particularly seeming the most uncomfortable out of the two.
Setting aside wetting my pants at the Japanese stereotypes that come through (nationalistic, cold, emotionless, particularly enjoyed his partner wearing kimono on his time off, having a huge house with a rock garden, and a subservient wife who bows and doesn't talk back - oh I WISH!
It was about a jewel robbery gone bad and particularly focused on a psychotic killer within the gang and his evil deeds.
It's not a particularly memorable film, but there are some funny scenes.
Coming hot on the heels of Hammer's full-blooded color version, it would have been a daunting task for anyone I presumeÂ   Of course, it goes without saying that Karloff gives it his all (particularly during a rehearsal for the upcoming TV show in which he narrates straight to the camera his ancestor's diabolical deeds) and sometimes it's hard to watch him simply walking around the castle as the evident strain this is having on his legs is palpable and there were a couple of times where I could have sworn he lost his footing!
but also made the parts of the narrative and the revelatory climax particularly incoherent!
I could therefore immediately sympathise with its teenage characters particularly the lanky, awkward Gregory, desperate to impress both his friends and the girls.
Harrison Ford's performance is just okay; I was particularly amused by the "slicked-back hair = evil guy, floppy hair = nice guy" idiocy perpetrated in the personal styling of his character.
Erica (Ada Pometti) is particularly sexy and has a great but brief sex scene.
He doesn't do or say anything particularly funny, either, but just by being a stoned hippie and saying "dude" and "man" he still manages to be funnier than everything else.
The acting is average at best & no-one stands out as being particularly good.
The collie dog used for the film is a beautiful animal but, let's face it, not particularly gifted for the camera (most of the time, she hovers about on the edge of the frame, constantly looking to one side for directions).
In its favor, we do get Alessandro Alessandroni's score Â which has an agreeable 'hard rock' vibe to it particularly redolent of Led Zeppelin's music!
He wasn't particularly good, but he wasn't terrible.
Around this perceived pinnacle swirls "adult" conversations of understandings of life, and particularly love.
During the epic battle, scale disappears, and the pipe-organ (which they fight on) changes size and hight several times, particularly when they are falling past it.
Bad performances from everyone including Ron Perlman, who is usually very convincing in aloof shadowy roles (particularly his TV role as Beauty and the Beast's Vincent), simply underscores the bad dialog, the silly story line, and the listless direction.
Kate Hudson's performance at times conjured images in my head of Jan Brady, and I found that particularly amusing.
Granted, the visual effects and gore are impressive, particularly the chap who gets his face melted by fly vomit, but these effects don't manage to inspire the same amount of revulsion the original Fly did.
Martin's transformation is particularly unimpressive; even a scene where he pulls one of his eyes out to reveal an insect eye fails to impress.
The acting, particularly Cat's, is pretty wooden and predictable.
The story (taken off the novel of Lois Duncan --- Gallows Hill --- who was also behind "Stranger in Our House" and "I know What You Did Last Summer") might consist of messy plot details (trying to be too clever at times, than letting it flow), an terribly incoherent staged climax (which is risible for all the wrong reasonsÂ and so are the flimsy attacks sequences) and bestowing a heavy-handed script, but in all it keeps you wrapped within the shallow mystery thanks to largely the agreeable performances (of mainly not particularly likable characters).
of course, the movie is predictable, particularly the ending, which I felt needed a little more polish.
I don't particularly like scary movies, and this is a perfect example of why, because they're stupid, but I wanted to see this because I do like the original Freaks.
Now, I don't know the movie Freaks however I wasn't expecting the story line to be particularly original but it was worse than that.
The plot on which these caricatures are hung, however, is paper thin and the final gag is particularly strange and grotesque.
Not a particularly auspicious entry in the Philo Vance series.
Visually beautiful with pretty characterisations and some fine acting particularly from Julie Walters.
Quite frankly, I am not particularly interested in what JFK did or did not do with Marilyn Monroe ..doubtless, those people who are interested in this sort of thing will find some pleasure in the work.
Matthew did a good job i guess, but i still don't particularly like him a lot.
Kris Marshall is particularly unconvincing and looks uncomfortable in the role, even though this is the second series.
The home family scene was particularly intriguing in "How To Lose A Guy...," the quality of the photography went from professional quality feature film to a something not home video, but less sharp and informal.
The ending is not particularly unexpected.
None of the characters are particularly likable so there's one big problem there, go ahead and die, the viewer might wish.
The make-up effects are quite effective, particularly during those notorious organ removal sequences(..and a marvelous reveal of Amber's ruined visage).
The plot details here differ with most other versions I've seen thus far and particularly Sweeney Todd's motivations to kill the customers that set foot in his barbershop aren't as convincing as usual.
The script by Leonard Lee is based on the novel 'The Return of Sherlock Holmes' by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle as isn't really a mystery, it's more of a thriller & not a particularly good one either.
Ross, who is credited here as Alexis Dubin, plays Betsy, a counsellor at a summer camp which comes under attack from the legendary Madman Marz, a vicious disfigured killer who is particularly handy with a length of rope and an axe.
There have been less than a handful of really good monster movies ("Alien", "Aracnaphobia" and "Tremors") in the last quarter century, so no one should expect SciFi Channel movies to be theater quality, particularly their "Creature Features".
(I particularly liked the truck load of dynamite that caused a boffo fireball -- but didn't blow up the truck.)
What happens next is like a long and not particularly good talent show or perhaps a poor man's version of a Judy Garland/Mickey Rooney musical!
Although the actors were particularly talented especially the very handsome Mr. Schnaas as the killer Karl, They could not save this movie.
The most eminent scientists from every race and from all corners of the world (this aspect is actually what makes the film special) combine their knowledge and promptly organize a large-scaled expedition to research why the intelligent life forms on Venus tried to reach for other planets and, more particularly, why they haven't tried again ever since.
There was too much obvious work in front of the blue screen and the situations were so preposterous that I eventually gave up on the film after enduring too much of a particularly ridiculous chase.
The only problem is that Dehner doesn't like the notion that Stanwyck has been getting it on with an Apache, nor is he particularly fond of the prospect of raising "another man's leavings."
What i don't particularly like about Green is when the joke runs too long, or the joke isn't funny to begin with.
It's been best done in movies as various Robin Hoods, Zorros, and Lone Rangers, but has also served uncounted zero-budget "B" westerns, costume actioners, serials and cop pics since fiction film first unspooled, particularly during the pre-WWII period.
The cinematography is great, particularly for a 60s movie.
Height, a glamour model in her second movie, is particularly energetic in her roles.
Also, it doesn't always make sense and particularly the last half hour is confusing.
And the costumes for the grand finale, especially, are embarrassingly ridiculous (and quickly take the `grand' out of it)-- particularly the white dress Merman wears while delivering the title song; a creation so horrendous it defies description.
To be honest none of them were particularly good, but all of them beat this rubbish.
Similarly the CGI was okay, although nothing to be particularly proud of.
It's not an awful film (particularly compared with some of the other components of this multiple feature), and it has the advantage of having been put together by a crew who knew what they were doing.
I could go on in a similar vein about Troy and Mr. Fox, and indeed on and on... but unless the TV versions rapidly evolved into the characters I have known and loved for a decade, they are not anyone I know, nor particularly would want to know.
Burton looks particularly woebegone.
It's sphincter-punckeringly banal, like the outpourings of some particularly dumb socialist under-graduate who thinks he knows all about the world because he's glanced through 'Das Kapital' in between drunken campus orgies.
I particularly disliked the son who is, I think, supposed to be sexy and cute and the main attraction for us gay guys.
I was particularly struck by what a sweet and pure performance that Sondra Locke gave as Mick.
The lack of anything good about this film is particularly disappointing, as it was the last film Gary Olsen made.
The biggest for me, based upon the tragic ending, is that in life, it is not only what people do in their lifetime that makes them special, but what they add to the lives of others around them (particularly strangers) that matters.
The latter half of the film is particularly bizarre, with plot holes so large that the entire film seems to be progressing at random.
Imagine, if you can, coming across the bloody remains of a particularly bloody road kill, the body parts of which are strewn hither and yon.
The plot strand of the young bride forced to get married under the threat of rape is particularly offensive and what is laughable is the expertly millennial sex that this putative virgin enjoys on her wedding night.
Something about this I particularly enjoyed was the tongue in cheek, often self-mocking sense of humour, with such things as a zombie frequenting a video store, and its subsequent choice selection of tapes to rent, and there is a plethora of other in jokes which should please real fans.
One defender of this "movie" asks its critics what they themselves have ever created, particularly in film.
That makes it especially sad that the action sequences, particularly the fights, are shot in such a choppy, flash-flash-flash manner that one can't see what's going on.
During a particularly depressed part of my adulthood, while I was grappling with the reality of having an unloving father, one day I found myself thinking about this movie.
Anyway, the acting isn't particularly impressive from any of the cast, but it's not terrible either, especially considering the time in which it was made.
One such particularly humorous and frankly baffling scene has our heroes marching into an elite social club whose members appear to be made up solely of bigoted (and disturbingly unattractive!)
The villains aren't particularly well fleshed out.
While the ghouls are not particularly scary looking, the continued and relentless attacks are effective scenes.
Back to the main point: There aren't any positive Asian imagery, particularly for Asian males.
The acting is fairly good - particularly Johnny Lee Miller, who makes an excellent Edmund.
After a particularly traumatic incident at work,he takes the day after off to recuperate.
The Stephen Carabatsos script creates some problems for the acting (particularly Nimoy, Barrett and Kelley), and - like his previous effort "Court Martial" - makes the pace a bit inconsistent.
None of this is particularly interesting nor is the clichÃ©d character interaction between our group of main characters, some troubled teens from LA out in the woods with their counsellors on some kind of bonding.
This film has a warm fuzzy feel to it which stops me being particularly vitriolic about it, but I can't seriously recommend it to anyone either due to the rather slow pace and predictability of the whole affair.
Especially funny is how quickly the characters of the film get over the bizarre circumstances and begin to worry about themselves, particularly Shepherd's quick transition from disbelief that his character has entered the real world to anxiety about his reputation.
The Purple Rose of Cairo is neither deep or particularly involving; the characters and relationships are, for the most part, stereotypical and symbolic and lack any real intense exploration.
There is nothing in the story particularly catching, and the characters themselves are not as likeable as those of "A Christmas Story."
The majority of the sentences refer to "crap" "poop" "t*rd" or "sh!t" and there is one particularly disgusting scene in which the Father (Robin Williams, this movie's selling point) gets sprayed in the stuff.
One will not learn much from this piece of media as it is not particularly informative.
Jason-Leigh's accent and acting are particularly hammy.
There are many many many wasted scenes, but one that particularly comes to mind is the sacrificial chamber scene.
And just to make them fiercer, as if it were needed, let's make the Aliens so that they can open their mouths as wide as a Muppet, particularly Guy Smiley, can.
I didn't even particularly like Pedro's girlfriend, Yolanda.
I would have particularly enjoyed seeing Katie's dad die in a freak laptop computer incident.
That being said, this movie features some of the funniest lines I have ever heard in a movie, particularly from Michael Keaton, who made one of the GREATEST entrances ever in what was his first film.
That being said, this movie features some of the funniest lines I have ever heard in a movie, particularly from Michael Keaton, who made one of the GREATEST entrances ever in what was his first film.
I just couldn't respect this film much, particularly in light of "GoodFellas" and other Scorsese masterpieces.
The acting was not particularly great as well despite a rather stellar cast.
Appropriately enough, I am finding "Night Shift" an excellent viewing for the night time, particularly as I am settling into bed.
The President and Americans, particularly military officials, all come off as war-mongers(the throwaway line about the fallout, oh *please*).
The great Lee J. Cobb is particularly wasted in a do-nothing part.
But from what I sat through, no matter what the pretentious intentions or justifications behind the film are, all that you're left with is the kind of boredom you'd get from watching someone else's particularly dull home movies of their kids.
Consequently, there are plentiful felicities throughout (not least an early rendition of the Burt Bacharach/Rod Stewart song "That's What Friends Are For") in the way of situations (notably a running-gag involving Winkler being chased by a hound let loose in the corridors of his apartment building) and dialogue (particularly when, ending up in prison and being accosted by a murder-happy cellmate, Winkler sarcastically thanks Keaton for having made possible his acquaintance with Peter Lorre's son!).
and John Dierkes (as a particularly vehement believer in the Jekyll 'legend' despite being in their employ - or, so it seems, since he's always hovering about the estate!)
Sean Connery is the lead and the supporting cast includes a particularly bad Natalie Wood as a Russian interpreter, Brian Keith as a Russian needing her services, Karl Malden, Martin Landau, and Henry Fonda (proving again his chronic need to appear in all the really BAD disaster movies of the 70s...ROLLERCOASTER, CITY ON FIRE, TENTACLES).
Unless you particularly like one of the actors or simply must see every film in this genre, there isn't much to recommend this.
And it's not particularly true to that age either.
How about saying 'In the tradition of a particularly bad, 80s, made for television scatty fantasy horror which are deeply tedious and insignificant'?
Some of it was interesting, but I really didn't find most of this to be particularly engrossing.
As an example, if Marie has goals and ambitions, in spite of whatever feelings she may or may not feel for Loic, why would she commit suicide, particularly if she had already sent him from her life.
His scenes are decent, amusing, quirky as his fans have come to expect from him, but nothing particularly outstanding in his long career of solid performances.
Another capital error of judgement - and unfortunately also an insult to good taste - is the way they rewrote the farewell scene between Jane and Rochester after the aborted wedding, a scene, by the by, which in all the modern adaptations has received a particularly brutal treatment.
I have also noticed a shift in his story telling style particularly his use of a lot of "Hollywood special effects" instead of the use of natural surroundings to create that distinct Shyamalan style of storytelling suspense which I loved and saw in his previous films.
It just wasn't believable nor was it particularly funny.
But though Leaphorn knew about it all, he didn't live it in the mystical sense, not being particularly religious himself.
In the first series we met elderly but defiant Slyvia Ashburton(Renee Asherburn)who refuses initially to sleep beside Eurasian girl Christina Campbell(Emily Bolton) but gradually the woman start to see each other as people and strong friendships are formed particularly when the women build a new hut,much to the surprise of camp commandant Yamauchi(Burt Kwouk) When Cockney prostitute Blanche(one of my favourite characters)is caught escaping with Debbie(Karin Foley)whose mother has just died,the whole camp is punished with a real feud developing between the English and the Dutch,headed by the formidable Sister Ulrica(great performance by Patrica Lawrence)and the selfish Mrs Van Meyer (Elizabeth Chambers) the feud is resolved as the women work towards Blanche's release.
Anyone who is interested in what prisoners-of-war (and in this case, particularly women) went through will love this show.
I am so sick of them, particularly of her, what was at first her appealing acting style, the same in movie after movie after movie, now makes me want to shoot the screen.
Erica (Ada Pometti) is particularly sexy and has a great but brief sex scene.
The most unfortunate thing about this movie is the waste of, particularly, an excellent actress like Susan Sarandon but also for wasting Seann William Scott, who has been far better in other comedies (even the American Pie series had more humor and came across as more realistic than Mr. Woodcock) and has also done well in some dramatic/action movies, with comedic qualities in his performance, as in Bulletproof Monk and the Rundown.
I've liked some of Toback's other work, particularly "Fingers", but this thing feels like a really boring home movie on autopilot.
Embarrassingly miscast, Thaw struggles with accent and intent as he blunders from one scene to another, and he is horribly betrayed by a great clunking script and ghastly supporting actors - Ba is particularly awful as Harry's reluctant sidekick.
As a young lad, I was particularly impressed by Yvette Mimieux.
A particularly bad sequence is White picking out dancers from square states (don't ask).
In practice, however, it plays out in the manner of a particularly charmless Saturday morning cartoon.
One is so particularly stupid I found myself wanting them to get their sticky end.
Now this might be really hard to take, but having the actors (particularly Shelly Winters) overact so severely actually made most of it seem rather funny instead of realistic.
Sadly, however, both actors were pretty limp here--particularly Scott.
The evocation of 60's London gangsters is particularly good - and cleverly utilises the stylised look of the likes of Performance and Blow Up.
There are also some creative "surrealist" moments in the film (particularly during the shrinking lover b/w portions), but I found them to be more flashy and "oohh look he's being different" than intelligent and thought provoking.
I'd never thought particularly highly of jim sheridan before seeing this but after seeing it i thought even less.
Sofia made the blunders in filming and keeping the scenes from the fate of being tossed into the cutting room trash bin that are particularly unintentionally humorous in being unabashedly pretentious or idiotically embarrassing.
-Contrary to popular opinion, I do like parts of the music score (particularly the main theme and the one in the scene where Gawain re-encounters Linet, which gets reprised at the end of the closing credits).
Certainly harmless in itself but overlong and not exactly rewarding in any way; strangely enough, the director had already tackled the story a decade earlier in GAWAIN AND THE GREEN KNIGHT (1973), which is yet another film that I haven't had the opportunity to catch up with since missing out on it on local TV in my childhood...though I can't say that I'm particularly looking forward to it now!
The story revolves around Sean Connery challenging all the knights at a particularly wimp-filled castle to use his own axe to chop off his head.
1" is a particularly bad film, as it's not.
Every time you cringe at a particularly awful line of dialogue, you take a shot.
I don't particularly care about the characters either.
Despite the stringing together of numerous interminable takes, nothing of interest happens and the setting is not particularly inspiring, largely because the director doesn't seem to know where or when to shoot his indulgently wasted footage.
I wouldn't call Legion of the Dead particularly scary & the action scenes lack a certain spark although the zombie mummies are quite cool.
However, the story is very disappointing, and I particularly liked two scenes: the nudity of the gorgeous and sexy Claudia Lyns, and the funny line of Sheriff Jones, when he says to his skeptical assistant: "- Just because a chicken has wings doesn't mean it can fly."
Director Jeannot Szworc gives a decent job: the rhythm of the action is not particularly raging but he is able to render the mood, the atmosphere of comic-book perhaps also helped by the photography and the scenography that gives the right color to the images.
What is particularly disappointing about this film is the sudden absence of fundamental elements that we have come to expect from a Bond movie; scantily clad women, witty one liners, memorable action sequences Â and above all else Â a certain amount of seriousness on the part of the actors to suspend the audience in the art of make believe.
8/7/08: It was absolutely shameless and cruel last night, the way the judges handled the choosing of the 40 finalists, particularly Hasselhoff, with vocalist Queen Emily - taking advantage of her overly-emotional nature, putting her through the torture of "we don't want to break hearts," blah blah blah, when we all knew damn well she was going through.
I enjoy all types of fighting (the real kind) and consequently, I find myself being somewhat critical of film fight scenes, particularly when they involve obvious mismatches.
This film did some things well, particularly the jump shocks and setting up the atmosphere with the Black Brothers and the Lonely Twin, but the dialogue was pretty rank and unbelievable (no teenager in the history of the world has ever talked like that) and the ending twist was pulled out of a hat, in an illogical way, that the film had at no point built up to.
The deaths are pretty unimaginative particularly considering the whole stoned aspect.
If anything this film did two things make me laugh at the poor acting, particularly Haun's wooden acting & it also made me slightly angry at the representation of Ireland.
When Tara (Lindsey Haun) takes a particularly bad mushroom, she fills her mind with horrific visions of the past and of her friends' future.
Directed by a former cinematographer (his debut and unquestionably best effort), the period atmosphere is exceedingly well deployed throughout Â thanks to Stephen Dade's probing camera-work and the elegant production design, particularly the mansion's interior.
He receives some wonderful assistance too from his assistants, particularly Cathleen Nesbitt as a spooky maid of all work and Robert Montgomery as a vampire-visaged servant.
The performances to watch out for are those particularly from Gould and Cannon.
Group or open sexuality, for the uninitiated straight first-time "vanilla" male, particularly in the same room/bed with another male, can be a very stressful situation.
The cast,particularly Dyan Cannon (Best Supporting Actress- NY Film Critics)and Elliot Gould, is perfect.
So many visually stunning scenes, particularly the one where Elena is in bed with Victor.
All of the actors are fantastic, particularly Francesca Neri, as Elena, and Liberto Rabal, as Victor.
We found it particularly amusing how protective and neurotic Gidget's father (Arthur O'Connell) was, and how he wanted her to date suitable college boys.
More a clever idea than a solid story, the tale is not particularly suspenseful; bit it does displays a cool sense of cynical irony.
In flashes some of the cast are excellent, particularly in portraying the interrelations of the group members, but only in flashes.
They also managed to fit a love-interest into a prison movie (hard to do and not particularly convincing but fun to watch nonetheless).
That made it particularly fun to watch again recently.
Something exceptional is presented by way of action sequences, in fact, where attempts at re-enacting simple events on film often fail; namely, the interdiction of a convoy carrying prisoners and a particularly realistic execution scene.
I wasn't particularly a fan but I knew what to expect.
Alex De La Iglesia has made some good films (particularly La Communidad) but this is not one of his best.
But in the end, I didn't particularly care for this film.
The cast is excellent, with Peter Lorre particularly impressive in one of the best performances of his career as an alcoholic who thinks too much and does too little.
Only after the initial intriguing premise is set in motion do we discover to our amusement that all the characters we've become interested in are fairly despicable, particularly Geraldine Fitzgerald as a sociopath and nymphomaniac.
I believe that there is an industry-wide conspiracy to deny theatrical access for independent films, particularly those with multi-cultural casts and themes.
All performances are great, particularly Michael Greer and the late Kevin Coughlin (1945-76).
It is particularly puzzling, that Kevin Coughlin's movie career should have ended after this, his most successful film.
The acting is for the most part excellent, particularly in the case of Jan Rubes, who plays Benjamin's grandfather.
The serial killer-clown continues his murder spree in the local high school, but his teenage victims Â and particularly their parents Â appear to have something in common, namely a dark secret about a prank that horribly ran out of control and killed a nerdy kid on his 18th birthday party.
The concept is as old as the slasher-film itself, yet the writers pretentiously act as if they re-invent the genre and particularly the comical aspects miserably fail their effect.
The performances are incredible, particularly Anthony Franciosa as the crazed mafia killer and Paul Benjamin as the small thief turned murderer.
In other words, at that time, low frame rates and cheap animation was the norm and compared to the rest of the animated films it was lovely--particularly the painstakingly drawn backgrounds.
It's well worth seeing--just don't expect anything particularly better (or worse) than most of the other 247392 versions of the tale.
Everything is top-notch-animation, voice-casting (particularly Sim reprising his performance as Scrooge), production values.
But despite being a highly entertaining movie, Drive-Thru isn't particularly scary.
There's some great dialogue between characters, particularly Mario and Nicole when they first meet and there's a few funny moments too.
On the down side it's nothing particularly new or original & while it's not a complete rehash of the original it can feel pretty similar at times & there's just so many buddy buddy cop flicks out there Another 48 Hrs.
Don't misunderstand me, I'm not a particularly religious person myself, but I think I'm intelligent enough to know that men of god don't go around drinking whiskey, and killing people with baseball bats, then running away, and of all the nerve, starting a new ministry.
I particularly liked Robbie Benson's performance.
Something I often find bothersome in 'time travel fiction' is that there is usually a large chunk of the storytelling dedicated to the tedium of explaining 'how' time travel works, particularly when time travel is merely a device to aid the storytelling.
As others have noted, Jason Robards' performance as Brutus has real problems, particularly at the start.
Agneiska Holland does a great job at bringing out all the subtle little points and details in the story and great performances from her young cast, particularly from Kate Maberly as Mary.
Some of the worst acting you would ever want to see (particularly the waitress who was Peralta's girlfriend - this would be an example of overacting at its absolute worst) allied to inept, wooden screenwriting.
Ewing is a very unlikely hero, a kid out of his league against a far superior foe..but the film allows him to become a worthy adversary, because of the very fact that he's not particularly your prototypical knight-in-shining-armour.
The acting is OK (Leslie Nielson particularly funny as the whack President of America) for this type of movie and we shall be expecting a fifth installment shortly.
While there were only two that were particularly negative(and I won't claim that they're in the wrong... in fact, they bring up good points), I found my expectations lowering... and not being much of a fan of documentaries, and having little interest in history, they weren't high to start with.
He stops at a crime scene that is particularly seedy.
A death occurs, and although Chris is innocent of it, it looks like the blame will fall on him, particularly when Bert forces Chris to make repeat visits to the club.
Why it didn't get greater exposure at the time or since baffles me, particularly as two of the principle characters have since become "famous" , Hugh Grant and Kristan Scott Thomas.
As the title suggests, Flo becomes inconvenient, particularly after Jules dies suddenly.
'The Bad and the Beautiful (1952)' is an excellent drama about Hollywood, but it's not quite on par with the similar show-business satires of previous years, particularly Mankiewicz's 'All About Eve (1950)' {which concerned the stage, but tread similar territory} and Wilder's 'Sunset Blvd.
As I am not a fan of either I was not particularly amused.
That said, neither the subject matter nor the direction particularly suits a cinema presentation; I strongly suspect that however strong the box-office returns, they will be comprehensively eclipsed by the video and DVD sales because this is a deliberately small-scale and intimate movie.
What is particularly fascinating about this one is that Romero, a non-political man, comes to the realizaton that there is no such thing as apolitical, apolitical ultimately being complicity, and recognizes his responsibility to take a stand for his people, despite pressure from Rome to refrain from doing so.
I liked this, as life, particularly in the case of the holocaust, is far from certain and it seems to work well.
(the scene in which she's riding the coin operated horse is a particularly good scene in this respect.)
We live in a particularly distressing age of movie making where the most basic aspect of any movie, THE STORY, has fallen to the wayside.
The cinematography is excellent, particularly during riding and water hole sequences.
It's not as if the horror content is particularly scary, although it's not for want of trying.
It's not particularly violent, with not much in the way of gore (it *is* rated PG).
The supporting cast actually has something to add to the production, particularly Monty Woolley as pompous Professor Lang and Leon Errol as Patty's vaudeville father.
Because of the intense violence, particularly against women, it is a disturbing and difficult film to sit through.
The performance of Tommy Lee Jones could be the best of his career, he brings out a much more emotionally quiet side in Charlize Theron than we've before seen, the short performance of Susan Sarandon is particularly powerful, and all of the soldiers are played with a feeling of sincerity.
I particularly loved the game of cardboard wrestlers they palyed on the beach and the fireworks.
If not particularly daring, this film offers a nice throwback to melodramatic, episodic films of yesteryear; e.g., THE LOU GEHRIG STORY, the film about Dizzy Dean, etc.
manmadhan is a must-watch flick for all movie-lovers,youngsters and particularly the NEW GENERATION GIRLS.the theme of the movie was very apt to modern times and the taking of the film was good.specifically the screenplay of the movie was too good,very appreciative on simbhu's part.in other movies they really do not show to the viewers,on the screen,something which turns out to be......-i just don't wanna reveal.simbhu is too young to make someone like me to expect such amazing work from him.becoz i always thought simbhu lacks smart looks.but only after watching manmadhan did i realise that for an actor -his/her looks count nothing at all-all that matters is the FINE SKILL OF ACTING that lies within him/her.simbhu's performance as a "pretending to be a psycho" in the beginning of the movie was really cool.Oh no...!!!!!
I was shocked that this was as poor as it was, particularly the lack of structure.
But I can still most heartily recommend Season One to anyone I meet, and most particularly recommend this fantastic episode.
Comedy is particularly satisfying when it deals with the shortcomings of human nature, not when it denies natural emotions and intellect as this story does so inexcusably.
The combination proves effective on its own terms though not particularly transcendent as a memorable piece of film-making.
The three sections don't flow together particularly well, but that doesn't take away from the fact that this movie is a must-see for pro-lifers and pro-choicers alike.
I thought the show was excellent and particularly enjoyed the skit with "The Frightened Brothers" which I believe included Martin Short, Chevy Chase, and Dan Akroyd.
There are two main subplots which revolve around the 1941 Pearl Harbor attack - first is the relationships between MP Colonel Jason Forrest, his wife, and varied others under Forrest's command, notably his XO Captain Calvin Lanford (a particularly effective performance by Robert Wagner).
Similarly Victor Rasuk is exceptional, particularly given the dearth of actual lines he has.
As a lover of horror films, and a particularly keen fan of werewolves, even I found this film to be a total piece of crap.
He seems to be battling his way through a particularly intense bout of constipation as he strains to expel the stomach-churning lyrics.
were all amazing, and the script was pretty good, the actors really let it down, particularly Mr Sands, the lead actress and the professor - I couldn't take any of his scenes seriously!
I particularly liked the irony of the bloodsucking mosquito's conversion to lawyer.
Though these revive every so often, it's not particularly satisfying over 90 mins.
Before you start viewing an early Chuck Norris flick, you certainly don't have particularly high expectations; you just want to kill two hours painlessly.
Far from essential then, but definitely worth at least checking out for genre completists or those particularly curious about it.
Heck, I don't usually even like documentaries, but I felt as if this funny, courteous, kind, assortment of people was inviting me into a particularly enjoyable party in which nobody was a wallflower.
The change has engendered a diverse number of celebrity fans, several interviewed here in entertaining snippets - a particularly caustic Jon Stewart, Yankees pitcher Mike Mussina, the Indigo Girls, filmmaker Ken Burns in a somewhat zen-like state, a wry Bob Dole, and Creadon's biggest get, an ingratiating Bill Clinton who conquers his puzzle with surprising zeal.
I wish particularly disturbed by the way she exploits her own family.
Poe's story had already been turned into a film by Roger Corman as he directed Pit and the Pendulum (1961) staring Vincent Price although this 90's version has next to nothing in common with Corman's flick other than the title & even that was changed to The Inquisitor for it's US DVD release, the script by Dennis Paoli is pretty good here, the character's are better than one would expect with Henriksen obviously having fun playing the part of Torquemada as he's a character with some depth even if not a particularly likable one although I'm not sure about that silly hair-cut.
While there are plenty of torture scenes The Pit and the Pendulum surprisingly isn't that graphic, there's some blood splatter, someone is impaled on spikes, a rat is sliced in half, people are burned at the stake & various scenes of torture which aren't particularly intense.
There are some truly great set pieces in the film particularly when the whole house starts to get into the same rhythm as the love makers on the top floor ( ripped off by an American Beer company I note in an advert ) and the botched suicide attempt too - hey I said it is darkly amusing!!
The kind of picture that we unfortunately just don't see a lot of anymore, "Warlords of Atlantis" is not particularly memorable but is a definite pleasure to watch in any event.
What makes this action drama particularly moving is the comparison between the extended family of a Sicilian crime boss and the clannishness of the hillbillies.
I thought the complete 'realisticness' was particularly superb.
Or when things start getting particularly disturbing (necrophilia, yeah) and the juxtaposition of father to mother in these scenes is extraordinary in deranged comic timing.
His purpose is somewhat unclear but he somehow brings the family closer together, not that any of what they're doing is particularly Ozzie & Harriet but they're still doing things as a family again.
Miike plays with multi point of views, particularly during the opening scene, in which the girl takes photographs of her father before they sleep together.
The closing credits obligingly give a cast list, particularly helpful in identifying the celebrities of yesteryear who've faded into obscurity:  At The Police Station: Wallace Beery, Buster Keaton, Jack Hill, J. Farrell MacDonald, Edward G. Robinson & George E. Stone.
And since none of the imagery, dialog or plot element is particularly engrossing, we can't take a "mind trip" as if this was a Lynch movie either, because use symbolism in this film is weak and immature.
I notice it particularly in regard to my black cat, Pluto, a fiend from hell.
When I think of it, all three share the same concept - playing the differences between the cultures, mentalities, ways of living, talking, doing things, even cooking - Europeans versus Americans, particularly British and Americans or New Yorkers versus Southerners in My Cousin Vinny.
They make me laugh more than anyone else in this picture, the scenes I particularly laugh the hardest at is when Vinny has been invited by the prosecuting attorney to go hunting and he doesn't know what to wear and Lisa goes into a tirade about the deer being shot and his brain lying on the floor and not caring what the "son of a bitch" who shot him was wearing.
But this is far too close to home not to be uncomfortable nowadays, particularly as the 'joke' comes not from Stan's ignorance but from cognisant racial mockery.
In this set, I found "The beginning of the end" by Jim Griffin, a particularly thoughtful and well-written mini-essay, and I agree with all of his specific observations.
In one respect, this is Laurel and Hardy's best movie, particularly in terms of comic timing.
I was particularly amused by such features as Anna adoring her catechism class, the presence of a violently anticommunist Cuban domestic worker (hence the title), the succession of nannies exiled from different countries torn by ideological conflicts, Anna singing "Ay, Carmela!"
I don't particularly like animÃ©, but it's not as bad as you might think.
The whole cast is wonderful, but I was particularly taken by Rachel Weisz and Adrien Brody.
I particularly enjoyed her goofy/passionate reactions when she's kissed by Adrien Brody's character, Bloom (that's the only name he's addressed by in the film; it's one of the few things that's never explained), and we realize this is the very first time Penelope has EVER been kissed by ANY man!
Robbie Coltrane and Maximilian Schell round out the cast quite nicely indeed, particularly Schell's colorful turn as the dangerous Diamond Dog, the Fagin type who taught the brothers everything they know.

Robbie Coltrane and Maximilian Schell round out the cast quite nicely indeed, particularly Schell's colorful turn as the dangerous Diamond Dog, the Fagin type who taught the brothers everything they know.
But of course there was not much to deliver from the script and to remember particularly to start with.
And I particularly loved the use of sound during the final action sequence in the film.
It's not a particularly happy or comforting movie; it's not quite creepy enough to be unsettling, and the director undercuts Megan's madness by showing us what she is hallucinating (showing off, by the way, some really terrific make-up effects); so the viewer is never really sure if, like Haley Joel Osment, she really can see dead people or if she's just going bonkers, or possibly both, the latter caused by the former.
There's plenty of explosions but the film is badly edited and the fights sequences are particularly dull, despite Seagal's participation in them.
Not that it's particularly "scary" in the typical horror film sense, but because of the human suffering and injustice involved.
The rest of the cast is fine, particularly Jessica Amlee as "Amy" and Gabrielle Rose as the mean "Mrs. Locke".
It is made worse by the emotionless delivery of most of the lines, particularly by AnaÃ¯s and Hugo.
i'll never quite be able to fathom what the state of mind was like in the 70's, particularly in Italy (the origin of this film).
Bonanza's "Adam" was a particularly unlikable bad guy as the law officer who conducted himself and the duties of his office to satisfy his own personal greed and needs.
It's a little repetitive and in places quite harrowing and bloody scary for a younger child, particularly the rather dark ending.
The Death of Hammer") and those connected with the film (such as Christopher Lee and the film makers) were very disappointed in the film as well--particularly the sloppy ending that just didn't work at all.
No one over the age of 13 will be particularly impressed with this.
The dialogueÂfrom a script credited to four writers, not counting the story creditÂis particularly sharp, especially in the scene where Cooper turns the tables on Columbo and insists on giving him his undivided attention; this time it's the suspect interrupting our clever detective with irrelevancies.
Sheen, though top-billed, has little to do and isn't particularly charismatic when he's on screen.
Packard Walsh (Nick Cassavetes) is the leader of a local gang of thugs who terrorise a small town & force other drivers of particularly nice cars to race & forfeit their car if they lose, which of course they always do.
The correspondent in Budapest Â Prof. Roth Â hasn't been heard of in a long time and, since his input is particularly fundamental, Alan is assigned to travel to Hungary and meet up with him.
The effects Â and particularly those during the finale Â are shocking and masterfully nauseating.
He overacts in all three roles but is particularly bad as the father.
I'm not particularly a fan of Eddie Murphy, but I felt sorry for him, as well.
The production design of the mansion and the ghostly special effects are very cool, particularly a zombie attack that pushes the PG rating to it's limits.
They are not particularly interesting, and they can't even be articulate about why!
There's also some really gritty fighting, particularly in the town towards the end.
Randy Travis comes reasonably close to making his poorly written character believable, but the movie wouldn't have been particularly different without him (and his accent isn't exactly typical for Colorado sheriffs, either).
Regardless, the acting is well-done - Vincente Parra plays a particularly relatable man, one with whom the viewer can sympathize.
The production values are pretty good, the English dubbing is tolerable and the acting (particularly the two male leads) is competent, if not excellent, throughout, plus there are even a couple of black comic suspense scenes worthy of Hitchcock, particularly one with some neighborhood bullies playing keep-away with Marcos' bag.
The "Cannibal Man" title is silly particularly because there really isn't any cannibalism in the film.
Then, one particularly uninspiring evening a friend lent a copy of it to me and I skeptically watched it.
I was particularly charmed by Laurence's description of the "perfect woman" and even more charmed when (as if I might have missed it) it was replayed!
I particularly liked the technique of going back in the story to fill in the gaps of the storyline.
It is the kind of film you discover by accident (it doesn't have a particularly high reputation), but by God it really moves and is enormous fun whilst on.
The end of the death scene proved forever and all time Shia's acting skill, because when he sees his dad's dead body his expression conveys the fact that he's dead with no need to show the body at all, that takes skill...  Short hand, Kale spies on people, one particularly hot chick is his focus for a while, but later he turns into a sleuth trying to catch a killer Kale is a nonconformist, that fact likely added to my liking the film...
Derailroaded might be about music, but Wild Man Fischer isn't particularly musical in any conventional sense.
Naturalism, my pals, naturalism was often interwoven with melodrama and stridency, in Maugham as in T Williams (--the difference being, naturally, that Maugham was a remarkable writer, while T Williams, a hack--)Âin other words, psychological exploitation, _dramsploitation; RAIN seems a quite peculiar drama, well handled and intelligently crafted, it looks peculiar, striking, unusual, fundamentally exciting and intriguing, with a pretty good pace and sharply devised roles and Mrs. Crawford's particularly raw and convincing performance; and most of all, it has those things, those twinned things we call gusto and brio.
It is merely a symbol used to highlight the idea of identity and, more particularly, the extent to which a husband and wife are aware of each other.
Unhappily, however, aspects of his dream remain, most particularly, a post card that he wrote out in his dream.
I particularly enjoy the scenes on the train in the US where Holmes determines the location of the various people while Watson acts out who they are.
But one stereotype is particularly of interest.
"Ultra Warrior" is particularly bad, though, because the plot and all the exposition exists simply to hold together bits of other movies.
It is strongly recommended for anyone who lives in the West, particularly in the USA, and is skeptical of the propaganda that is constantly spread by the current U.S. administration and certain special-interest think tanks and groups.
Other random things I must criticize: George Peppard's accent isn't particularly badly done, I guess, but it sure is annoying.
The film's main merit, aside from Hoffmann's performance is the art direction, beautiful sets and lovely costumes, particularly the brief underwater scene with the mermaids.
The main storyline is pretty interesting, though nothing particularly remarkable.
It makes all the live action films look painfully silly, particularly the later ones and is truly worth hunting down.
This obviously takes place in the dialog of the characters, particularly those of Cheadle and Guy Pearce.
Tilda Swinton is particularly rude and hostile as a pediatrician with the bedside manner of a crocodile.
It is speculated in the film that Dolly told Kerr-McGee that Karen had gathered some particularly damaging evidence against them, which indeed Karen had done.
While I'm not particularly a Meryl Streep fan, Karen Silkwood is a role she was obviously born to play.
It just comes off as Oscar bait, particularly for star Meryl Streep.
She changes, however, when she realises that the management of the plant have a cavalier attitude towards the health and safety of their employees, particularly the risks of radioactive contamination, and that, worse still, they are doctoring x-ray photographs of the fuel rods in order to cover up potential defects that could prove disastrous.
The first half of the film, which concentrates as much on Karen's tangled personal life as on the main theme of nuclear safety, can seem particularly slow.
I am surprised and very disappointed to find out from the remarks of previous IMDb reviewers, particularly my fellow Australians, that they cannot obtain a commercially published copy of this movie.
The documentary side to this is not particularly good.
I particularly like the use of split-screen imagery and the filmmaker's wonderful job of conveying the mood of that time and place.
Probably the only movie ever made about a terrorist hunting super-model, James Toback's thriller is not particularly good.
The old saying "One swallow does not make a summer" is particularly apt when discussing this film.
I never intended to watch this show in the first place because I thought the name of the show was ridiculous and I don't particularly like Brooke Shields.
I was particularly impressed with how the father and son relationship, appropriately played by Kitchen and Ovenden (who even bear a physical resemblance to each other), evolve over several episodes.
Apart from its classic murder sequences (particularly the first with its bloody pay-off), this one has an original, audacious structure (criticized at the time because it was not understood) with the narrative following minor characters every once in a while and veering off into seemingly unrelated subplots - a half-century prior to Tarantino's would-be seminal PULP FICTION (1994), but also Luis Bunuel's THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY (1974)!!
The problem was I didn't particularly feel any sympathy for any of the characters (well, only the first victim) and the film's final revelation is rather flimsy and truly unfulfilling.
This film is particularly effective in building suspense in a series of scenes that show various characters walking--a saucy Spanish dancer strolling along the street, a frightened teenager making a night-time trip to the grocer, a young woman rushing through a cemetery at night.
The parts in which Annabel demonstrates her techniques for self mutilation, as well as her mother in Singapore discovering what her her daughter has been doing in America for a living are particularly gut-wrenching.
Jim Mickle and writer/lead star Nick Damici simultaneously grab the opportunity to process a whole cargo-load of social and political criticism into the screenplay, particularly emphasizing the the war in Iraq and the problematic housing accommodation in big cities.
this movie is a burning attack on the hollowness of many modern American values, particularly for young people trying to find their way through high school and early adulthood.
It's pretty rare when I am at a loss for words, particularly when I am weighing an opinion on a film.
Vi seems innocent, but if you pay close attention, you'll notice she's not particularly sincere.
Treadway is particularly good, while his character is basically the usual stereotype, a boy who feels he is more than what he really is, who wants to make a difference, goes on a grand adventure.
I particularly liked the scene where they escape from a jam with a little help from God (or Allah).
Thirdly, the pacing is rather slow and drawn out at times particularly in the middle half.
The myriad big-name character actors are slightly distracting, particularly Bill Murray and Tim Robbins, but all turn in OK performances.
While all the actors did a fine job, I particularly enjoyed Saoirse as Lina.
The pacing, particularly during the middle act, could have been a little tighter, and you often get the sense that there's a lot of footage missing from this cinematic cut, yet as a whole, City of Ember does enough, and with the right amount of originality in tact, to cover up the rough edges.
Furthermore, the special effects work, although a little obvious during certain sequences involving humans, is noticeably strong; particularly when a giant mole-like creature appears.
This film has a couple of shortcomings with plot, particularly the neat ending, and there seemed to be some difficulty with the continuity of locations (the family house, for instance).
The characters are really well developed, particularly Belle, the Beast and the many implements of the house that play significant roles.
The characters are not particularly complex (hence the "slight"-ness of the film), but are still pretty well-drawn.
Indeed, particularly on "Get Back", "I've Got A Feeling" and "One After 909", the Beatles rock out just as good as the Stones (arguably the Stones always did rock a bit harder than the Beatles.)
that the band was breaking up, they were irritated and irritable, that John and George (particularly) did not want to do the film but Paul talked them in to it.
What they show in the film of arguments and sulking is what happens in ANY band, and in fact is usually much worse - I was almost surprised there wasn't more of the taped back-and-forth exchanged in the film, given what's been said how bad it got amongst the fab four during their final year in recording, particularly on Let it Be aka Get Back (the most chilling thing overall is the presence Yoko, who keeps popping up looking like she could duke it out with Bergman's Seventh Seal Death dude and probably win).
I particularly like it when he attacks the faux news (noise) folks for the prostitutes they are to the fascist "upper" hand now running into oblivion what was the American Republican Party.
The cinematography is impressive, and I particularly liked very much the sequences when Vilma Banky dances in Touggourt beginning with a close and opening to the whole place, and when Ahmed chases Ghobah and Yasmin in the desert.
Robert Wagner, resplendent in Cromwellian wig and Sterling Hayden are particularly bad, with poor Janet Leigh looking shocked to be in the film at repeated intervals.
This is the ninth Falcon film, and a particularly good one.
Not one of the characters is particularly likable in their roles.
I was attracted to this one by the cast, particularly Jimmy Cagney and William Bendix.
It's great to see James and Jeanne working together, particularly in this story, where he's playing an Irishman and she's Polish - but she's got his face.
The way Joe relates to the various characters, causing them to easily open the hearts and souls seems contrived today and perhaps seemed that way even in the late 40's, but I suspect Saroyan was not particularly interested in "realism".
To witness the final stages of Brundlefly is particularly disturbing and Geena Davis' reactions mirror exactly how I felt when watching with disbelief.
Goldblum's performance is particularly good as the nervy scientist Brundle, but I think the main reason for the film's achievement is its structure - very subtle, very well made.
So it's obvious with better direction (sorry, Curtiz just doesn't have it here, though he was usually a wonderful director--particularly in romances and adventure films) and writing this SHOULD have been a lot better considering the money Warner Brothers spent to bring all these stars together.
The scares are fantastic -- particularly one in the shadows and who comes out of them.
As Roger Ebert said in his review, brilliant, literate film noir with excellent performances...particularly Milla Jovovitch as the femme fatale.
On a positive note (at least for us guys) Milla Jovovich is particularly sexy in this movie in her wardrobe and brief Stockholm-syndrome-fling with Jackson.
I was particularly impressed by the stellar job turned in by William Powell, showing more depth and sensitivity than in most of his films, especially in the climactic scene.
This is a formulaic film that is very reminiscent of many of Clark Gable's films of the era (particularly SAN FRANCISCO) as well as the crime dramas that made Warner Brothers so popular in the 1930s--though this film IS from MGM.
There are some melodramatic sections in the film, particularly the beginning and the courtroom scene which contains a very dramatic speech delivered by Powell.
I particularly love the lighting in the film; firelight creates creepy shadows across the sets and really sets the mood for the darker scenes.
There is always a question when you watch any film from a different culture as to how well it will communicate its themes, an issue particularly associated with Japanese films, fairly or not.
This is an enjoyable, multi-levelled film that will particularly appeal to a European and American audience - just because it is so different.
One particularly wonderful scene shows AmÃ©lie helping a blind man across the street and rapidly describing what's happening around them to give him a picture of the world he doesn't get to see.
I was particularly impressed by Ivan Desny as Madeleine's backstreet lover, Emile L'Anglier.
Also, I've heard the ride to finish this film was a tough one particularly for the filmmakers so they have my respect for seeing it through.
One of the great things about the internet having become a semi-official film distribution channel is it giving people the chance to view films they never otherwise would have had a chance to see, particularly first time film-makers and those trying to make a name for themselves.
The cast is top-notch (rare for an independent film with no big "stars"), particularly the two leads, Vigdis Anholt (who plays the title role) and David Morwick (Director, Screenwriter and Producer as well as co-star).
A lot of the local stuff that showed there was only so-so but this one really stood out for us - first of all there were tons of people waiting to get in to the screening dressed like the film's major characters (particularly Erin) which surprised us.
This is an insult to women, particularly Latin women and the stereo types in this movie set women and Latinos back at least 20 years.
I was particularly concerned with the fundamentalism segment of the movie.
Schwartz delivers a film that is in no way exceptional nor particularly memorable, but it is entertaining.
I'm a bit apprehensive over the Holiday Carleton character, I actually found her to be somewhat pathetic, particularly when she trades lip locks with Cotter after he slaps her around with a towel.
The negative I noticed in the film is that some of the supporting cast really didn't seem like very good actors (particularly his blonde girlfriend).
Rosamund John provides effective support as loyal wife Diana, despite the absence of conflict between them to provide a cheap motor for their scenes together (particularly memorable is a scene in the kitchen where Diana has to reinforce her husband's faltering resolution to maintain his integrity at the cost of his employment... while trying to get him to chop the parsley!)
The William Walton score (now known as the "Spitfire Prelude and Fugue") works particularly well.
Although it seems dated particularly with the black and white film, it is none the less worth your time to preview this movie.
The soundtrack on most broadcast copies is rather poor,but the quality of the music score is beyond question.The composer ,william Walton was commissioned at the time but his music was not thought particularly noteworthy .It was not until the 1960's his music was accredited rightly in my view as a work of sheer brilliance.
The bestiality of the pirates is well shown in the movie, particularly a singularly tall actor who in one scene wears women's clothing to particularly unsettling effect.
I use quotations marks because the supposedly super hot sorority chicks aren't particularly attractive.
None of which particularly ruins the film.
The Sleeping City affects a pseudo-documentary style that also came into vogue as a complement to the new cinema-veritÃ© look (a chase through the bowels of the massive institution stays particularly sinister).
I particularly remembered the poise of a very young Martin Sheen.
