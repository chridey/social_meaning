All the characters are fantastic, and i thought the story was awesome, plus Bruce Willis, Meryl Streep And Goldie Hawn are all simply amazing in this!.
Meryl and Goldie seemed to be having a blast here, and It was great To see Bruce ham it up in a different role and he pulled it off perfectly, plus the ending is hilarious!.
Streep and Hawn had wonderful chemistry together, and the effects were really awesome, plus The plot was really cool as well!.
Sure it's hammy but damn is it a lot of fun to watch, and it's extremely underrated as well, plus the costumes were fantastic!.
Meryl truly deserves her reputation as one of the best actresses of all time, and i thought the shovel duel was hilarious, plus the funeral scene at the end was very amusing.I can't believe this only has a 5.6 rating as it should be much higher in my opinion, plus Goldie and Meryl's constant arguing was quite funny.
Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn have never been so good (plus this is the only film in which Bruce Willis doesn't do his trademark smirk even once).
Another big plus was the soundtrack: a lush, haunting score throughout.
It just seems impossible that one man, Bulldozer, even armed with a big club, can control a group of twenty plus hostages.
The only good point for this turkey are the competent diirection and good cinematography - plus the fact that the French video wasn't pan&scanned.
Based on a fairly successful novel by Swedish writer Harry Kullman, cheap production values not used to their advantage plus clumsy, deftless direction, sink this agent thriller, despite some tight scenes... and as a Swede, hearing my compatriot actors spouting really dodgy English accents just doesn't help much...
The general lightness of tone might indeed startle in light of the subject matter, plus there's even an astonishingly erotic moment when Marie imagines herself being groped by both husband and lover in an elegant masturbatory fantasy.
Every cliche in the book is here, plus red herrings that have absolutely nothing to do with the plot that seem to be pursued way too far.
Then, to have the original band member, plus the entire Zappanele audience, blow before them in praise (literally bowing!)
Initially I was hesitant about the purchase because I wasn't sure if he would enjoy the movie, plus it was long considering he'd never watched anything that for that length of time.
when he sees Duwayne staring at himself.Why?Belial laughs wickedly after Duwayne explains about wanting to be normal.Again, I ask why?Sure, they had a nosy reporter trying to expose them,but not much else.Gore and violence seems like it was just thrown in, to keep the audience awake.But even the violent scenes are poorly executed.The one liners thrown in by Duwayne after a violent act,made me groan in pain.I wanted to throw rotten eggs at him.At least Freddy Kruger knows how to throw in funny oneliners.Then there is the scene that made me cringe(BRRR).If there's something I never want to see in a movie,its this.I never want to see ugly people naked or have sex,and I never want to see ugly monsters naked or have sex.It had belial and Eve having sex,ARRGHH!Eww, that was something I can live without.I'd rather have my toes cut off!And that painful excuse for violin music sounded like it was played by a dog.Woof!The musical score is Laurie Anderson bad.When Duwayne tries to get it on with Susan,we find out,(SURPRISE)she's a marsupial.And she has a disfigured sock puppet pop in and out of her pouch.The biggest pisser of all, is the fact this was a ripoff of "Nightbreed",a much a better movie that came out a few years earlier.The freaks in that movie were better made,plus the story and plotting were well written.Watch "Nightbreed" instead of this dreck.0 stars for this junk.
The DVD is exceptionally visual with running film commentary by Coppola plus many other bonus features.
Despite all the efforts put in by the unconventional leading players Frederic Forrest and Teri Garr, plus Raul Julia, Natassia Kinski, and Harry Dean Stanton in some clever and juicy supporting roles, and even a couple of moments of real, genuine heart and heartbreak (the latter being of note when Forrest tries to sing "You are my sunshine"), t's just too thin a story to nearly justify all the effort put into it.
On the plus side, "Camp" has a lot of energy and loads of affection for it's young characters.
The aliens themselves are quite realistic and original, a plus for the film.
The annihilation of the officer corps plus Stalin's disregard of warnings from the British and his own intelligence services (he had his own spies executed for warning of the pending Nazi attack)left Russia almost completely defenseless.
The aliens themselves are quite realistic and original, a plus for the film.
A werewolf tossing quips, forces it anally on one helpless female, doesn't waste possible tattletales in Derek and Sam right away, plus hearing him speak face-to-face with victims seems awfully awkward.
), Sam Bottoms (of "The Outlaw Josey Wales" fame--my very favorite movie, by the way), plus Kim Delaney (pre-"NYPD Blue")!
All the characters are cool, and the story is very entertaining, plus Jackie Chan is simply amazing in this!.
I really liked the opening in black and white when they showed the twins as kids, and I loved the reference to Stallone and The Rocky movies with Tammy's(Nina Li Chi) boyfriend Rocky, plus it has some pretty good fights in it too.
I actually found this to be more of a Comedy, but that's OK because it was highly enjoyable, and I think this should be higher then 6.0, plus the ending is absolutely hilarious!.
As always Jackie does some amazing stunts, and the scene where Jackie and Tyson(Teddy Robin Kwan) escape on the boat is pretty exciting, plus while some of the humor is incredibly silly I couldn't help but laugh at it.
The scene where Boomer plays at the Orchestra and does John Ma's work is a scream, plus the fight at the car wash is also hilarious!
Get the DVD as it's got all 6 episodes plus some really sketchy and random extra scenes.
Also, when you consider what is out there in the theaters these days at $10 dollars a head (plus, all the other "necessary" expenses - food, soda, etc.)
Rajesh Khanna and Asha Parekh as the lead romantic pair , are quite endearing, in this combination of a little romance, mystery, villainy, and cabaret numbers, plus wonderful music, with meaningful lyrics, and this otherwise commercial movie , succeeds in engrossing you in it's plot line.
After reading the positive comments here and seeing the 1 star rating on my digital cable guide, I decided to give it a chance (plus, I'm a big Alan Arkin fan after seeing him in 'Catch-22', 'Glengarry Glen Ross', and 'Little Murders').
Their ability to encompass their complex characters and become them, plus the chemistry between the two, helped carry the story.
1970's 'After School Specials' plus actress Rosanna Arquette has combed New York (mainly) and found 80% of the musicians/singers/songwriters that folks almost have forgotten about and asked them for their thoughts.
Ms. Arquette gushing over them is always a plus for an ego booster, and we know these folks need an ego booster in their final days.
Not only that, but we get some nasty views of the alien's early victims that it was studying, plus some gross after the fact corpses.
However, technicality, these are perhaps the films two biggest plus points.
A few scenes hinted at some promise to the movie, such as the "blink and you'll miss it" battle against the Ice Dragon, but ultimately these random skirmishes, plus the anti-climactic climax do little to save this movie from the DVD bargain bin.
There's a lot of nudity delivered in a very dark and nasty feeling style, so that's a plus for the film, but the whole film needed a writer and an editor.
beforehand it's 3 hours plus.
So I don't mind their sweet harmonizing every so often, plus the songs themselves aren't bad (I can't dislike "The Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy").
'(Her sexy body and amazing legs are a plus for this movie.)
So many people could have been cast here, you look at the amount of actionb stars there are out there, even the like of Don the Dragon and Gary Daniels, Billy Blanks can act better than this guy plus they are all martial artists.
On the plus side: I think the whole last bedroom scene really works.
I bought this movie from a video store that was going out of business and the cover caught my eye, plus reading the very brief and cheesy back sold me into buying it.
Both the men have to enter a fighting tournement to get near him and the fights are brilliantly staged plus the two men have to fight the emperors guards who get in the way through the film.
Solid writing and direction by Ng See Yuen, great physical performances by John Liu, Hwang Jang Lee and Wang Tao plus some nice stunt work by Yuen Baio make the Secret Rivals one of the very best films of the kung fu genre.
After the token black fifth wheel is snuffed out, the survivors (plus a young woman who escaped an earlier sacrifice attempt) stumble onto a very small town inhabited by (surprise!)
The biggest plus of the movie, like other RGV movies there is no sugar coating.
Another plus point of the movie is the focus on the story.
In addition to the interviews with Brigid herself, there are some other great current interviews plus the requisite archival footage.
I have added this to my collection along with the better known documentaries on Edie, Nico, and of course Warhol himself, plus some of the original films (such as Chelsea Girls).
Another big plus was the cinematography.
I liked how they tried to go for something different (it's quite bizarre at times) and it had a lot of gay undertones, but i found it very amusing, and all the characters were great, and did there jobs very well!, plus the score was excellent!
The Opening is great, as is the ending, plus if you look closely, you will see that's Robert Englund driving the bus , in the opening.
Robert Englund is GREAT here, he is creepy, funny and was a lot of fun to watch, plus he really liked to mess with people's minds, and he had a lot of great Quotes!
The character of Freddy Krueger is kept with his three distinctive elements : the right hand four finger claws, the hat and the black and red striped pullover, plus of course his ugly mug.
And just imagine trying to provision that ship with its crew of 5000 plus with 1940's technology!
You just get some themes thrown in that never were mentioned before (so what are the childhood pictures supposed to mean and why was the strange box introduced into the plot heavily in the beginning to be dropped off in the end) plus a totally open and disappointing ending that I had the impression to have seen more than once before.
This movie gives you a great insight into the world of the Renaissance Festival, plus it's mighty entertaining!
Each & ever one of them plus others were about flawless under John Cromwells fine , polished direction., The Sets were magnificent, so good in fact, they were used in the 1952 version) I will also have a review of this version.
Forced dialogue all through the movie, plus I felt the director had been playing with as many different camera techniques as he could think of - ending up making a big mess of waste.
Oh man,"Hausu" is an extremely weird and grotesque horror parody.It is also supremely stylish and visually mindblowing.The plot of "House" is quite easy to describe:seven schoolgirls travel to visit grandmother at her spooky old house.It's not clear whose grandmother she is,as every character in the movie is referred to by a nickname and they all call the old woman Ojii.The house turns out to be a demon that wants to eat them and grandmother is apparently a cat.Words can't describe how positively bizarre this movie is.It plays like the cross between "Suspiria" and "Beetlejuice".There are plenty scenes of kitschy humour plus some scares for example when one of the girls tries to sneak the watermelon out,she finds a human head down the well instead.One girl is even eaten by a piano in a very gory fashion and the dead victim's fingers are still playing the piano after being bitten off.9 out of 10.
Not just because it's genuinely scary, it's also intelligent (unlike 80% of all the slasher movies), it's extremely well acted, and it's serious which is always a plus in my book.
The mythology behind the story is one of the film's major plus points, and director Bernard Rose does a good job of building it.
The great music score of Philip Glass fits perfectly to the movie and is another plus.
Plus if you want any extras who want no pay, there's a huge fan base out there plus plenty of ready-trained re-enactors.
The martial arts in here are nothing short of excellent as always plus all the Venoms were in this one, all 6 of them.
I watched this movie for a bit of a laugh plus it had the Hoff in it and lets face it after Knightrider the Hoff is one cool dude!
The film has other plus points, mainly in the shape of Australian cult icon Bruce Spence of "Road Warrior" fame, and the direction of Peter Wier.
It also has director Peter Weir's film The Plumber (1979) as a bonus, plus interviews with Weir about each film, as well as trailers.
Croatians want to kill serbs, and serbs that want to kill croatians, plus bosnians don't differ.
When I was really young, even though I saw the caricatures of Humphrey Bogart, Peter Lorre and Edward G. Robinson - plus the scenes from "The Jazz Singer" and "It Happened One Night" - I couldn't interpret anything from them, but of course now I can.
A baby, plus many more twists and turns to follow.
Well, this is a well-done film, with absorbing plot - plus Barbara Stanwyck gives a real star performance here as Lulu - acting up a storm, she's just great and really helps make this film a good one.
The only plus, so to speak, is the extremely funny interview with the to actors.
Another plus is the film's purposely awkward, infectiously gawky musical score that, like most music in Japanese films, is recurrent and sustained, a repeated series of only a handful of melodies that are very memorable.
In this day of $100 million plus movies with special effects that drown out the dialog and stars with out-sized egos and paychecks to match, a film like Jonathan Demme's minor masterwork, "Melvin and Howard," would be lucky to get a video distributor.
Any film that features Valerie Harper, Beth Howland, and Julie Newmar before they were stars ... plus Leslie Parrish (author Richard Bach's wife!)
The rest of the film might be taken as the events which would ensue were they to be aimed at the men who shop at the 7th Street pleasure shopÂ The goons and the proprietess plus a black con crony of the men drive to the woman's country home, where a trio of students are enjoying a vacation romp.
No major names in the cast - a huge plus.
), performing satanic rites and playing the organ, murdering (and stuffing) wives and daughters, settling ownership of virgins with a nice game of chess, fainting a lot, flaying each other alive, listening to stupid ass cops with feathers argue over whose home town is prettier, plus a line that EVERYONE should have implanted in their brains: "Supernatural - perhaps.
Okay, this is NOT a great film and the plot is quite silly at times (plus, the version of this film performed on the Carol Burnett Show is possibly better), BUT I liked it.
The superb acting from a top-drawer cast constitutes as another substantial plus: Susan Clark as Forbin's loyal assistant, Gordon Pinsent as the amiable president of the United States, William Schallert as a CIA director, Dolph Sweet as an army colonel, and George Stanford Brown, Robert Cornthwaite and James Hong as computer experts.
This, plus the cool camera tricks make this a standout film.
Incompetent directing, a general disregard, and an "let's get through it" mentality, a sloppy lack of attention to detail of character development, sloppy story writing, plus more.
A must see for those interested in French music hall (including a song by Ãdith Piaf) and for the wonderful 10 plus minute cancan finale.
Leslie Howard is charmingly, fatalistic, Bette Davis has never been more cute and innocent and this could be 100 plus film actor Charlie Grapewin's finest performance.
A little gorier than your average American thriller (which is a plus...) but not an all-out bloodbath either.
Having said all that it's a very decent film with plenty of blood, gore and surprises, plus its always good to look at.
All three, plus a brilliant ensemble dance to perfection.
I wouldn't have admitted it when I was younger but the scenes between Lila & Snoopy plus Charlie & The kids saying good-bye at Snoopy's farewell party did make me sad.
Especially "Me and you/A two man crew/Side by side we're united" plus the title song and Charlie Brown's solo "It Changes".  
The soundtrack of Fanaa is a big plus point.
Even more time is padded with endless scenes of characters sitting and/or lying in bed talking (and often forgetting their lines), plus topless gitterbugging from Cookie Mueller, people riding around in cars and Mink Stole ("the religious whore") and Divine walking down the street.
The songs are ear-catchy and added a plus point, not a waste like many Bollywood's movies.
Unfortunately one movie plus one other movie does not make even one good movie.
Although a few situations might have been developed more realistically (hence 8/10 stars), the movie flowed and kept my full attention despite it's two hour plus length.
Such arguments seem pointless to me anyway, since the basic premise both of these movies, plus 'The Thirteenth Floor', 'The Truman Show', 'Pleasantville', et al are so blatantly appropriated from Philip K Dick's SF of the 1950's.
Being that gorgeous Rachel Ward agreed to costar in this was a plus...shows she had a tremendous sense of humor let alone shedding any ego.
Disc 2:  Disc 2 contains a number of rehearsals plus a piece on what a nightmare it was to work with Chuck Berry on this project (which was, after all, to celebrate himself!).
A lot has been said about the great scene in the movie where Chuck continually criticizes Keith's guitar playing on "Carol", but that is nothing compared to what he put the producers through, between constantly asking for more money, being late or not showing up, plus an incredible experience at one of the prisons where Chuck spent time in his youth.
As a result of that (plus a publicity photo that made him look white), Chuck got booked in venues where he could not play when he showed up.
Pacino gives a grand A plus performance as a Long Island Jewish producer and halfway through the movie I forgot he was Al Pacino.
There were good episodes in Season 4 and 5, plus some good moments even in the bad episodes, but overall the show just wasn't the same.
On the plus side, Psycho Town does manage to build a smidgen of atmosphere in places.
On the plus side, the ghost effects were pretty slick - even if the blood was totally unrealistic (like thick paint), and the model/monster effects were only at the Clive Barker level.
plus, snoop dogg is in this.
For fans of all of the above, plus Hedda Hopper in her last role not playing herself, I highly recommend you definitely seek this one out!
The battling of the sea creature named Nadia is also a cool plus.
Although Marie's lover only existed in the tongue of gossip, the sequences with Tyrone Power added a passionate romantic flavor to the story, a definite plus with its dramatic contrast to the understated Marie/Louis relationship.
Thousands of yards of satin & lace, a then gigantic 1.8 dollar million budget plus hundreds of extras made this movie one of the most opulent epic's of the 30's & shall forever shine as one of the most glamorous ever made.
Also, a major plus to this movie was the incredible cinematography.
This guy is action nitro glycerine times a thousand plus infinity.
also, though the middle 40 minutes has no godzilla, what many people fail to mention is that it has a big ol' UFO that flies around and blows things up, plus a pretty good bunch of plot advancements.
It is about 25,000 pounds in gold bars placed in strongboxes and taken by armed security guards to the railway station...  'The First Great Train Robbery' is about the fastest pickpocket you'll ever see, a suave and daring gentleman who never tells the truthÂ It is also about a bunch crooks that can steal your heart with the company of a fascinating disguised mistress who suspects that her father breaks his own regulation for each morning of the shipments...  'The First Great Train Robbery' chronicles the grandeur and hypocrisy at all levels of England during the Victorian Era, and proves that the cleverness and prowess of a criminal mastermind is elevated to heroic status...  With excellent photography of Ireland beautiful countryside, and great music score by Jerry Goldsmith, plus the costumes and sets, Michael Crichton's movie gives train heist's fans the pleasure to enjoy a very entertaining period thrillerÂ
If you are a Star Wars fan, it is a plus, but it is not necessary to get a feel for the story and its well-developed characters.
Star Wars Veteran, David Prouse, is a plus in this wonderful film!
The cool soundtrack is a big plus too.
"Ghost World" is an excellent low-budget cult-movie nominated for Oscar in the category of Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published and awarded in another twenty-five (25) prizes plus twenty-four (24) nominations in different festivals.
The overall production is excellent (the brightness and colors in the photography, costumes and sets is stunning)... plus it pulls off the impossible by successfully steering toward dead-on seriousness near the conclusion to drive it's point across.
It's too bad Andre De Toth didn't contribute more to the noir cycle, because on the evidence he was a natural (plus he was married to early-noir icon Veronica Lake).
Feeling he has failed his country, plus realizing his old girlfriend is now old with a family of her own, Cap is a determined, meloncholy hero with nothing to lose.
When Leo realises what has happend; the loss of both Louise and his Child, plus his death, the takes control again; but in a way I won't tell.
And on the plus side, you can always mute the movie and play whatever on top of it.
This is drama plus.
Now all four of them plus a friend are on the long journey life looking for happiness and instead they get trouble.
Maybe it's because "Explorers" only sports three main characters, and "The Goonies" has seven (plus Sloth) ... but I'd hold this movie up with that one any day.
= 3 / 4. but plus 1/4 for Angela Bettis's + the killer's acting = 3 1/4.
Set on the campus of State College, it tells of the lives and loves of Nigel, Betty and Duke, plus one father figure professor of Biology (John Halliday).
Think of the worst Indian Bollywood film ever made, plus the worst Finnish TV theater ever made, and add a few Troma movies.
I give this film 10 votes out of 10 for vibrant use of Latin-American Magical Realism plus Best "guys dancing with guys" in a bar in Nowheresville scene ever.
Ash is the focus of course, a few new characters and poke are introduced, and its good to see Tory make friends with those plus and minus pokemon.
Directed by Ted Post (who noticeably helm Clint Eastwood in 'Hang Em' High' and 'Magnum Force'... plus made the weird horror 'The Baby'), it's tautly handled in very candid, no-frills way.
Burt's character's cynicism, plus the viewers' historical knowledge of how things turned out for the US military in Vietnam, makes for some powerful moments.
Anyway, this does have elements of "The Most Dangerous Game" and "Naked Prey", but it's got a few twists and turns to it to keep it interesting, plus the locales are great for most of the scenes.
"The Front Page" is a favorite of Hollywood's, remade many times - three versions under its original title, a TV series, two TV productions, plus the film "Switching Channels."
Not for me - Because of the message - i like it and give it a ten plus.
The bulk of the footage has four "sexperts" (sex therapists plus a gynaecologist) sitting around in a living room, swilling gallons of tea & coffee and talking earnestly about sex.
All the characters are cool, and the story is pretty good as well, plus Jerry O'Connell plays a great funny lead!.
For me though Ryan Reynolds stole a lot of the scenes, as he is absolutely hilarious, and it has some great eye candy in Bridgette Wilson and Alyssa Milano, but they also give good performances, plus it's very well made and written.
One of the funniest parts in the movie for me is when Ryan Reynolds announces at a wedding that he is a raging homosexual, and also when he thinks he has slept with a man, plus it's good natured as well.
All the characters are extremely likable, and this reminded me somewhat of Tomcats, only better and funnier, plus it kept me guessing throughout, as I was actually expecting it to be predictable.
I'm not usually a fan of Direct to video Comedies, but this one is an exception, and I really liked the ending too, plus the whole cast seemed to be enjoying themselves.
Another plus is ALL the acting is good.
That thriller is "The Experts" plus a good touch of humane and human depth.
A great plus is that the actor who played Ichi is the same actor of the movie "Ichi the Killer".
How ironic then that his execution has sparked a 'cult of the revolutionary' that has not diminished over the intervening 40 plus years since his death.
Amazing visuals, brilliant story of love, hate and war, plus believable characters.
Another plus point for The Mercenary is that it does not suffer from the messy plotting of Corbucci's previous westerns, having instead a very tight storyline from Franco Solinas with screenplay by another Leone collaborator, Luciano Vincenzoni.
By great good fortune, the fifty plus year old print is well preserved.
But in three films under Phil Karlson's direction (plus Robert Florey's in The Crooked Way and Allan Dwan's in Slightly Scarlet), he ended up one of the most convincing ordinary-guy protagonists in the noir cycle.
I managed to catch this three and a half hour (plus) made for TV movie in the wee hours of the morning on Lifetime Movie Network and I didn't even fall asleep!
Back in the 70s I really loved this show but that mainly had to do with there not being a lot of sci/fi shows on TV at the time plus I was only 6 years old and didn't know any better.
One plus, at least from my perspective, is that there's far less actual violence directed toward animals.
The problem with both films is the fact that there are elements of racism involved, plus the fact that World War II is often mentioned.
Out of ten I give this movie a ten plus.
Judge Reinhold, is also wonderful here, he is also HILARIOUS, seemed to be having a lot of fun, plus he he had a lot more to do this time around, and was very likable.
For the genre, this is about as good a film as you'll find--plus, it has cute penguins and Edna May Oliver!!
On the plus side, it does have some good action sequences (this was in the days before horses learned to gallop in slow motion), and uses the Indians as enemy only for dramatic effect and not as a source of derision.
Girls you have some of the top good looking men in the movie that's a plus.
Okay, George C Scott is the kind of actor that never works on my nerves and he also was the only reason why I kept watching as this movie sucks... You can write thrillers and spionagescenarios but please don't forget that an average watcher cant follow thousand plots in 100 minutes, director John G Avildsen doesn't even give us the time to let us discover who is who as from the moment a new personage appears he ends up being shot three minutes later plus you are wondering what the hell it's all about....
Think of a modernized "Oliver" with Robin Williams as Fagin to a group of homeless, musically talented kids...plus extra elements of romance and intrigue, and you will have a bit of an idea about this movie.
He was arrogant and passionate at the same time, plus very handsome.
At the ball, Jane Bennet becomes close with Charles (much to her mother's delight) and Elizabeth seen to be a little taken with the imposing nature of Darcy, but his aloof nature and continuous rebuffs, plus a harsh commentary he makes of her within earshot hurts her deeply: her pride has been hurt; hence, from now on, she will have nothing to do with him.
Well neither worked for a certain 40 plus black woman.
On a totally pointless note, I'd like to mention a strange plus of "The Best of Youth" - much of the cast is totally gorgeous.
There's a strong supporting cast - especially Rupert Everett (who deserves a Supporting Actor nomination) - plus plenty of laughs, stunning visuals and a script to die for.
You'll find buxom babes with barely a stitch on (always a plus in my book!)
All the above plus a well written and nicely paced story line, a gorgeous cinematic backdrop of 'Frisco and the adjoining Bay area and a more understated execution of this film makes it a little different from the other "Harrys".
The characters are fun, and even though they've been done a million times, you still like them, plus they're very real.
Speaking of which a lot of stuff didn't really fit the atmosphere or realism of the film, plus some things(such as the buried alive thing) didn't really call for what they were doing to the scene, and all in all around the last 20 minutes kind of transcended into a very realistic horror film to almost a monster film.
The episode is exceptionally well written and acted, plus it is very profound in its message about death and the afterlife--and all handled in a very engaging and deft style.
"Hellgate" is a cheesy horror flick that will satisfy only the most undemanding fans of horror genre.The acting is terrible and the script is cheesy beyond belief.There is a fair amount of blood and gore including a nice decapitation scene,unfortunately the special effects are lame.The only reasons to see this stinker are a fish on steroids and re-animated turtle plus Abigail Wolcott as a hot zombie girl.4 out of 10.Only for fans of truly mindless zombie flicks.
While the Lewton movie was marvelous and horrifying, this one seems worth seeing as well because it is more realistic and unflinching (with some very brutal murders), plus it sticks much closer to the facts and mirrors the real decisions in the courts.
The movie is at times downright meanspirited, but it is a MOVIE for Pete's sake, plus, it is nowhere near as raunchy as the National Lampoon articles it is based on.
The Broadway star, Ed Begley Sr., had a friendly face and a good deal of warmth; Robinson is scrappy, defensive, plus he looks like a thug.
He's just annoying and we don't even get the satisfaction of watching him die in an amusingly ironic manner after being inflicted with his presence for an hour plus.
The set designs were so colorful and dreamlike, plus the story was actually involving, the constant bits of ironic humor really got on my nerves.
What this film needs the most is to be released in Widescreen at it's 2:35.1 aspect ratio(plus with the 3-D process)on DVD.
King Kong was a waste of 3 hours plus of my time.
The topflight supporting cast constitutes as another substantial plus: Kathryn Harrold as Thorson's loving, but long-suffering pregnant school teacher girlfriend, Eli Wallach as a crusty bail bondsman, Levar Burton as a nice young guy who befriends Thorson, Ben Johnson as an ornery sheriff, and the ever-creepy Tracey Walter as a crazed, vengeful ex-con with a personal grudge against Thorson.
Over 13 episodes (plus the OVA) I got to care about several of the characters and this series managed to have more impact than many other anime series that have a far longer running time.
If you are like me and enjoy animes that are not as long (Only 13 episodes plus a 25 min OVA!)
Ghost Game tells the tale of two couples & close friends, Abbey (Shelby Fenner) & Nate (Peter Cilella) plus Dara (Alexandra Barreto) & Randy (Curt Cornelius) who decide to get together for a camping weekend.
I also thought Carol Kane was wonderful as Rudy's wife Annie and Dom Deluise was as funny as usual as movie mogul Adolph Zitz, one thing you probably found annoying was Gene Wilder's constant screaming and going into hysterics all the time but he does it brilliantly, plus the character of Rudy was very high-strung kinda like Leo Bloom right?
we even get to hear the rest of the gang sing which is a plus point.
That's an unintended plus.
The Seven Seas Navigator is docking in Paradise Island in the Bahamas for a solid weekÂThey're having a nice promotion for the maiden voyage, calling it the Diamond Cruise: a gem exhibit whose star attraction is the third Napoleon DiamondÂ It's, allegedly, the only priceless remaining 'cute little rock' Max Burdett and Lola Cirillo haven't stolenÂ   The unlocking Special Agent Stan Lloyd of the FBI (Woody Harrelson) suspects that the two are planning to purloin itÂ But how could they with six cameras plus 24-hour rotating guards, unbreakable polycarbonate display?
If nothing else, this would be a good documentary for actors to see in order to witness the transformation of script -- plus to find some incredibly moving monologues!
Like a Marx Brothers film, this didn't have much of storyline, just a bunch of comedy bits by Fields and Bergen, plus a love interest between Bergen and Constance Moore, who played "Whipsnade's" daughter.
That depends on you but honestly, this movie is one of the best of its category with amazing acting by both main actors (Leonardo Sbaraglia as Nene and Eduardo Noriega as Angel) plus extraordinarily good cinematography.
In short, great make-up fx on the antagonist (and nowhere else unfortunately), but thats about all this movie has on the plus side.
A great plus are the beautifully shot underwater scenes, short but crystal clear, crowned by a final duel under surface.
Excellent action and fight scenes plus the women are all ultra hot.
Thanks to a fantastic script, it's well worth seeing--plus, the plot is so bizarre and creepy, that it's a real guilty pleasure.
And a BIG plus for Endless Waltz is that Relena didn't scream to Heero when he obviously couldn't hear her.
You'd actually meet some real people like the ones in the movie, plus eat well for a reasonable price as we do.
As you can see in my profile i'm from Belgium so i saw the original version of this movie ( and it rules by the way :-) ) but when i heard that there was going to be remake done of this movie i thought "well maybe it wont be as bad as every other remake" ( cause American remakes of movies are always less then the original ( no offense ) examples: The Grudge, The Ring ) but again i was wrong, choosing girls in bikini's as the bad guys(girls) was a bad mistake same as choosing Queen Latifah as the cab driver and the way that the story is brought on to screen is also really bad, i also thought that a good point would be the car itself cause in the third original TAXI ( TAXI 3 ) the story wasn't that good but the car was one of the plus points, but that doesn't apply to this movie, so i'll give you one last advice : don't go and see this movie but try to get a hand on the original TAXI by Luc Besson and i'll assure you you'll have a great time  greetings from A.V.
All the characters are wonderful and very likable, and it keeps you guessing throughout, plus Tom Cruise is simply incredible in this!.
This is a movie that requires a lot of concentration, because it's one of those films you have to pay strict attention too, and the plot is seriously awesome, plus one of my favorite moments in the film is when Cruise chases his own eyeballs!.
This is up there with one of Spielberg's best films and believe me he has done a lot of brilliant movies, and This is one of Cruise's finest performances,plus it's full of awesome twists and turns so don't blink!.
It's extremely well made and written, and for once I agree with Roger Ebert's review!, plus you will really root for Cruise's character throughout.
plus while i'm not a huge fan of Colin Farrell he did a fantastic job here and really impressed me!.
Max Von Sydow was also excellent, and the special effects are simply stunning, plus the chase sequences are awesome as well!.
I saw this a couple years ago and was unimpressed, however after upon 2nd viewing, I must say It deserves it's praise, so if you didn't care for it the 1st time, give it a second viewing, you may change your opinion.This should honestly be in the top 250 in my opinion, and there are some fantastic creepy moment as well, plus I loved the depressing atmosphere it had at times, and This is almost like The Fugitive except it's set in the future, plus It also has some very funny scenes in it as well.
Cruise had excellent chemistry with Samantha Morton, and I especially loved the dialog, plus some scenes really had me on the edge of my seat!.
Steven Spielberg does a spectacular job here with amazing camera work, fantastic angles, awesome use of blue,excellent lighting,great slow mo shots, and plenty of other uncanny shots as well, plus he kept the film at an extremely engrossing pace.
It's one of the fastest moving films as well, making it seem like there's no real stop and that's always a plus.
However, in this case having her play some supremely beautiful "goddess" actually works since the film is so often played for laughs and doesn't take itself too seriously--a definite plus in my opinion.
Knowing that Lon Chaney Jr. played the Wolf Man and that Burgess Meredith played Penguin on the old "Batman" TV series (plus Rocky's trainer), it might seem hard to imagine them co-starring in a serious movie.
Plenty of laughs plus enjoy the film that really made Jim Carrey a star.
And I love Jafar so his 'winning' is like a plus.
They're let off after a night in jail (plus experience a cathartic jail-cell baptism) and no charges filed.
Almost had a plot, another plus.
No idea what they were going to see, but we got to see Tibbett rehearse those glorious numbers plus perform "Si puo" at the end.
They then challenge him to a game of baseball where Bugs has to play every position, plus having to catch up where the Tea Totalers left off, behind 96-0 or something close to this score.
I mean, you have Mariah Carey & Whitney Houston, Boyz II Men, Take 6, BeBe & CeCe Winans, Steven Curtis Chapman, Alabama, Randy Travis and Linda Davis, Toby Keith, Charlie Daniels, Clint Black, Carman, plus an all-star song of which the actors and artists sing together.
Lots of fun, good performances, plus the song "The Acrobat's Daughter."
There's also Henry Czerny and Harris Yulin as the me leading the war of behalf of their President (played expertly by Donald Moffat) plus there's Joaquin De Almeida, Miguel Sandoval, Raymond Cruz, Tim Grimm and of course James Earl Jones.
Some good make-up and special effects are a plus again however, but overall it leaves much to be desired.
The old gas stations, furniture and women's fashions, plus the modern auto's in the 1930's made this a great film classic with all these young actors starting out in their film careers.  
But there are also moments of brilliance, plus there is added value from the momentum of Ringu.
The scenes where Dennis had to escape the heart, plus the parts where he gets to see thru Martin's eyes etc really made good effects.
Also Robert Picardo camping it up superbly as The Cowboy, one of his most memorable creations, plus the great pairing of Fiona Lewis and Kevin McCarthy, who memorably says to his dog before feeding it: 'Never beg, never beg!'
Joe Dante binds it all together with magnificent verve, plus Dick Miller makes his trademark appearance!
On the plus side it may be good for a laugh if you're drunk at home with some mates, although it still doesn't have the drunken laughter appeal of something like Python or any of the 70's and 80's cult movies.
On the plus side, the brilliant and then beautiful Elaine May (future director and writer of many a film flop) may be the greatest crazy Jewish American Princess ever portrayed on film.
On the plus side, "The Galileo Seven" is a superbly tense, suspenseful episode, including excellent character development of coolly logical, emotionally remote Mr. Spock.
Another plus is one of the most remarkable casts ever assembled - Michel Simon is immensely touching as the bemused gardener forced to abandon the comforts of his mimosa for the chaos of life on the run (private property being the conservative definition of self); Francoise Rosay is incomparable as the grande dame, besotted by social propriety, yet seething with untapped lust; the young Jean-Louis Barrault is a little callow compared to his seasoned elders, but endearingly impudent - the scene in the greenhouse pond with Rosay is a mock-classical treasure.
It's good for one watch, even for those who want it right away, and then to move on along as it's now four plus years gone anyway.
Burt Lancaster shows he is an actor of such quality and class plus almost perfect as the quiet man, on a mission for bloody revenge.
The soundtrack is a plus, too.
Another big plus is Jeannie Berlin as Grodin's hapless bride, a woman with the social graces of a blind hippo.
James Nesbitt & John Thomson, appearing as well as a couple of faces from the hilarious `Royle Family' plus the superb Lesley Sharp (Clocking Off, The Full Monty), Melanie Hill (Crocodile Shoes) and others.
His slow motion style, balletic gun play have never been better, and the one steadicam shot which goes into a lift, between floors and features many deaths and explosions, plus dialogue, is awesome, and must have been a nightmare to film.
The show is also capable of being more intelligent than ever given credit for plus it has moments of impressive drama and wit.
The absence of Grant, plus a move onto film, and Chris Barrie only appearing in a handful of episodes, resulted in Season Seven looking a bit patchy.
There's a ton of style injected into these proceedings, plus plenty of Castellari slow motion, and the usual gore (though not so much as Jaws).
The characters weren't properly introduced and there were too many of them (plus their clothes and hairs looked ridiculous).
Lots of coupling, ethereal angst,   Two of the sisters plus the author (and his double), all possibly dead (all possibly fictional), on the island of conception.
It's got direction and it maintains it the entire 100 plus minutes of the film, which is a nice departure from the disjointed mess I've seen so many films become.
Marci (Lana Parrilla), a college student working for a student newspaper about extraterrestrials and other supernatural phenomena, plus two male co-workers (Nick Swarts and Mark Phelan), head out into the California wilderness following a report of alien sightings.
Someone is selling DVDs of the entire series on sell.com ($55 plus shipping) and I bought the series.
I was 19, got paid US$15 plus lunch, and it was great fun!
The only major plus this film has that raises it to almost-mediocrity is the idea of television being a topic of a film as early as 1930.
The members of 1 Giant Leap, while pushing the cutting-edge technology of the 21st century to its limit and utilizing their own fierce intelligence and consummate musicality plus a list of collaborators ranging from Michael Stipe to Kurt Vonnegut, Asha Bhosle to Dennis Hopper, have done just that.
It's good to see where Reeves and Mortimer started out, plus there are others who appear who went onto fame, such as Charlie Higson.
And then we see Gary Daniels fight this chunky guy.The camera poorly shows them fight like almost the whole time we only saw a part of their body's plus the camera was sideways and nearly upside-down.
Daniels talks to this guy who in prison on a filthy bench for 15 plus minutes!What a waste of film and time.Is all the guy was talking about was I gotta stop taking drugs and get out of here.If I wanted to a conversation like that I'LL talk to MY next door neighbor.
On the plus side the effects were good, the direction wasn't bad and the acting was generally sufficient (given what they had to work with).
On the plus side, however, in THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY the sub-plot at least comes off as being relevant to the main story, at one point even providing Fields with an opportunity to reveal a softer, more complex aspect of his twisted character.
The movie's finale consists of the troupe's performance of "The Drunkard" plus a couple of songs and, best of all, The Great McGonigle's juggling act.
And again Mickey Rooney is the center of attention here, I was once more amazed at this young actor's ease, the complete confidence that he exudes plus the vulnerability.
5/10 Well it was Mark Henry and not even the great Angle could get a match out of him, plus this match was so predictable that i couldn't even be bothered to concentrate, saying that there was nothing special to concentrate on.
Overall a good night for shock value, plus the super cruiser weight match, the ending was very annoying, but not for Undertaker fans.
EAST WEST vividly illustrates the hell of this 20 plus year regime in a sweeping epic, in my opinion, among the best of all time.
Cute boys were also a plus!
Tanguy (Eric Berger) has it made; 28 years old, fluent in both Chinese and Japanese and earning good money as a teacher whilst completing his ph.D. A regular girl friend who's anxious to set up light housekeeping with him plus all the spare tail he wants.
The humor also is a major plus, as there are several laughs spread throughout the film.
On the plus side, at least I didn't watch it all!!!
On the plus side, little as it is, some of the characters were mildly entertaining in the sense that the acting was so terrible.
It's an excellent script and good directing--plus everyone turns in an excellent performance.
Last it has Still Galleries & Notes by Ray Harryhausen plus one last thing Promotion Piece about The Lost World Puzzle.
If you liked Mystic River, Reservoir Dogs, Goodfellas, Godfather I & II, and various cop & robber shows on TV over the past 50 plus years you'll love seeing this realistic portrayal of a little self-destructive crime family that could be operating in any ethnic neighborhood in any larger city at anytime in history.
Undaunted, Flora presents a cool brow and an almost impervious demeanor plus an extremely persuasive power to influence.
(Others may see this as a realistic plus.)
This film has virtually everything you'd want from an action comedy, plus the Hong Kong influences, one shot fight sequences, etc... and the fights are amazing.
All the characters are really cool, and the story is a lot of fun as well, plus Mark Dacascos and Kadeem Hardison are simply amazing in this!.
It's also a great "Buddy" "Buddy" flick as well, and it's very well made and written as well, plus I was lucky my friend recommended this to me, otherwise I would have gone thinking it was just another straight to video Action film!.
A lot of it works dude to the wonderful chemistry between Dacascos and Hardison, and the fight choreography was also fantastic, plus the guy in the white coat at the end looked awesome and was very cool.
Brittany Murphy does great in another kooky role, and I thought the ending was great, plus it has some very sly humor as well.
plus this is one of the best straight to video films I have seen!.
There's a great cast, who seem to be having a lot of fun, the film pays homage to Jackie Chan movies at points plus the fight choreography is well thought out.
Presumably it was late evening with most people staying safe at home, but it looked like a hundred plus people were after the innocent victim.
On the plus side, the acting is above-par by all the actors(the adult male leads look startlingly like a young Liam Neeson and a Gaelic Antonio Banderas), the location footage is gorgeous, the period "feels right", and the title namesake is very well executed and most believable.
It's anthology of four (plus wraparound) stories that vary in quality from the average 'Jibaku' to the pathetic 'Golden Breasts,' we're given quite an array of 'terrifying' tales.
It also wasn't offending to the Hearing people in my class, so that is a plus for any Hearing person looking at this movie.
Realizing that it would probably be a good idea to move the conflict off of the Earth (which has just gotten over a long on-planet war), the captain of the Macross orders the use of the ship's untested "fold" system to warp the ship to the dark side of the moon; the warp is initiated, but it brings the small city that had grown around the Macross with it, plus, to the horror of all involved, they find themselves just outside orbit near Pluto (that's what you get for messing around with technology that you don't know how to operate!).
I think these are a plus to the mood and execution!
Tasteless exposure of nearly every embarrassing thing you never want the world to know about your family - plus a few more things that make watching this movie quite uncomfortable.
His character is dark, evil, and mean, plus he behaves an animal.
That show progresses and goes somewhere, plus it has really good animation too.
Two gals and five guys (plus two teenagers who appear in the last 30 minutes) enter a big, old, creepy mansion where soon they find themselves trapped.
James Riffel's "Dead Dudes in the House" has to be one of Troma's best.There is plenty of gore,some scary scenes plus a lot of cheese.The plot involves a group of young people going to fix up an old secluded house and falling victim to the murderous 100 year old lady named Abigail who proceeds to slash them up and bring them back as zombie-like killers.
Six stars for the "Dudes", plus a star extra for making it this far.
You warm up to her by the end of it, plus she ends up making some quality decisions as to who to really hang around which only increase her worth in this thing.
The film has plenty of old dark house atmosphere plus the effective relentless howling of the wind and the pounding of the rain.
A butcher shop owner/operator (Nancy Travis) for a leading lady that may be wielding her cleaver in the off hours plus her curiously flighty sister (Amanda Plummer).
On the plus side, this one would have probably made a decent Tales From The Crypt short.
This is a film about the conflict between the Turks and the Armenians, yet in the film all the commentators are from Turkey plus some from its geopolitical ally, the US.
How lame is that, plus is Drake suppose to be one of the seven monks, because they never said.
The solid cast contribute admirably sincere performances: John D. LeMay makes for a refreshingly unlikely hero as the nerdy Steven Freeman, Kari Keegan likewise impresses as the sweet Jessica Kimble, Steven Williams almost steals the whole show with his colorful portrayal of flamboyant bounty hunter Creighton Duke, plus there are neat turns by Erin Gray as the spunky Diana Kimble, Allison Smith as Jessica's cheery gal pal Vicki, Steven Culp as opportunistic TV newscaster Robert Campbell, Billy Green Bush as the hard-nosed Sheriff Ed Landis, and Rusty Schwimmer as feisty, foul-mouthed diner owner Joey B. William Dill's slick cinematography gives the picture a properly moody look.
the characters are simple, but every single character has a certain something that makes them interesting, plus you don't just have one type of comedy in the characters, physical comedy and jokes are writen all over the place, from wannabe snobbish to down right hilarious.
The scenes where Malone freaked out over Lon's parents being deaf and dumb, and her subsequent tirades, plus Chaney apologizing for his parent's physical handicaps - come on!!
On the plus side are the lead performances.
Biggest plus: A daring try to make film out of Swedish history.
The only problem with this movie is that it's way too short, but in it's short running time it says more than most Hollywood movies say in their 2hr plus running times.
This TV miniseries version looks much more like film than the 1983 version (which has the best Jane ever, Zelah Clarke), and this is a visual plus.
The music score on the home video edition is, like most by Carl Davis, a big plus.
The appearance of some of the original Real World casts was a plus, and then the actors came in to play and ruined it all.
On the plus side however the 2-dimensional characters are engaging, there are one or two great jump-out-of-seat moments, tips of the hat to not only the original movie but also HG Wells' novel "The Invisible Man", effective use of music (which is all new - not a rehash of Goldsmiths original) and an overall sense of fun (That's Executive Producer Paul Verhoeven shining through, I think) - despite the nasty moments!
Cameo appearances by "animals" are a plus.
The series is about the danish police force's Unit 1 - a kinda FBI-style team that help solve murder cases all over the country, and the cases they work on, plus the influence that their jobs have on their personal lives, and the price they sometimes has to pay to be a part of a top police team.
What makes it a very good movie is basically two things: wonderful performances by an ensemble cast that was hand picked (and will definitely attract lots of sci-fi fans, with well-known Trek alumni plus Alexis Cruz from Stargate/Stargate SG-1) and the fact that the underlying plot of the mother daughter relationship IS very interesting and very well played out.
Albert states the antique store is a business but the IRS states that it's a hobby so now unless Albert can prove it's a business he will owe the IRS taxes on the $36,000 plus penalties.
I assure you that for the acting of Geraldine Page and Ruth Gordon, and the throughly wicked Mrs. Marrable, plus your desire to be entertained, the movie is worth watching.
This movie further benefits from fine acting from an excellent cast: Page really sinks her teeth into her juicy evil old bat role, Gordon projects her usual winningly spunky charm as the endearingly feisty Ms. Dimmock, plus there are sturdy supporting contributions from Rosemary Forsyth as sweet young widow neighbor Harriet Vaughn, Robert Fuller as the dashing Mike Darrah, Mildred Dunnock as the timid Edna Tinsley, Joan Huntington as Ms. Marrable's bitchy niece Julia Lawson, and Peter Brandon as Julia's conniving stockbroker husband George.
Gerald Fried's score is expressive and stirring, and certainly a plus.
There are some great actors giving good performances (at times melodramatic - but that's the nature of the script more than their acting abilities), plus (suprise!)
This segment reminded me of The Red Shoes (also starring Shearer) but was thankfully MUCH shorter and interesting--a definite plus for those like me who really DON'T like ballet!
These three leading ladies were certainly chosen for their youthful radiance and sensitivity, and the luminous close-ups plus the saturated color and lush music by the great Rozsa (who appears as the conductor in the first segment) lend a baroque richness to each of the segments reminiscent of Visconti's "Senso," or possibly even "Il Gattopardo."
Feroz Khan made several great entertainers like QURBANI, JAANBAAZ but this is his poorest work and his last try too at direction  He seems to want to glorify himself and his son and hence made this excuse of a film  The film goes around with sub plots, sudden songs, long bike chases and then a melodrama about Feroz-Fardeen  The film has a weak screenplay and seems all choppy  THe romance angle is puerile  The film actually is laughable The film shifts from 1 plot to another suddenly All doesn't make sense and plus the scenes are so badly handled The last scene is a perfect e.g.
of a bad scene plus Fardeen's bad act  Feroz Khan makes an embarrassment of a film Music is okay  Feroz Khan is repetitive, Fardeen Khan is bad Celina is awful
Indeed, the filmmakers earned their R-rating more for the gallons of fake blood and gore that they splash over the course of the two-hour plus running time, not to mention the ghoulish sight of decapitated heads tumbling like footballs down the side of the temple, than nudity or profanity.
He said some things that upset them, plus (and most unforgivably) he's an outspoken and conservative Christian, so they're going to practice any sort of mendacity that will keep people from buying tickets to his film.
Two hours plus that rush at the speed of light.
It would seem that Poe has been reading too many of his namesake's books, leading to a rather deviant bent, a lust for married women and psychedelic dreams, plus (due to genetic enhancement) the inability to hold his drink.
All the characters are cool, and sure it may be a bit cheesy and have some bad dialog at times, but it's all good fun, plus Christopher Lambert is simply amazing in this!.
It's also surprisingly violent, and I remember watching this movie on TV as a kid, and enjoying it so it was great to re visit it, and it's pretty well made and written for it's low budget, plus it's also quite imaginative, and creative too.
All the characters are very likable,and the ending is also quite cool as well,plus there are some really impressive action scenes as well.
Kurtwood Smith is really good as the villain, and Lambert and Loryn Locklin had pretty good chemistry together in my opinion, plus the special effects are pretty good despite the low budget it had.
It had a couple of decent fight scenes, and I think this should be quite higher then 5.3 in my opinion, plus the opening is quite intense.
The uniformly ace acting from a tip-top cast qualifies as another significant asset: Lambert and Locklin make for sympathetic leads, Smith excels in one of his customary bad guy roles, plus there are stellar supporting performances by Jeffrey Combs as flaky, bespectacled computer whiz D-Day, Lincoln Kilpatrick as wise trustee inmate Abraham, Tom Towles as mean roughhouse bully Stiggs, Vernon Wells as vicious top con Maddox, and Clifton Collins, Jr. as scrappy young punk Nino Gomez.
Nice performances by Jeffery Combs(as a very amusing computer geek type)and Christopher Lambert are a big plus.
On the plus side it's got Anna May Wong, already a beauty, as a traitorous lady-in-waiting.
Dracula's feelings for Mary are genuine (Although you can't help but wonder how many times he's used this line in the 500 plus years of his existence) and you can't blame Mary for wanting to be with him (Kurt was a dull as a plastic knife).
Peter Bogdonovich's evocative direction is a big plus here, knowing where to mine the laughs and the tears and the film contains plenty of both.
All in all, the combination of director Chuck Jones and writer Michael Maltese, plus Mel Blanc as Road Runner, makes for another classic.
I recommend the Shriek Show version which includes the uncut masterpiece plus a whole disc of extras.
Don't let Antropophagous: The Beast's reputation, plus these gory factors fool you though.
The use of sepia tone at times - plus the sheer starkness of the black sands with the stark white of flares - gave this film a look that was very compelling.
This is a really intense film, that actually has quite a few shocking moments, and pulls no punches, plus Jet Li is simply amazing in this!.
Theis film really has some fantastic fight scenes, in it and the plot and story was really cool, plus i found the ending very touching!.
I was really rooting for the 2 main characters as TchÃ©ky Karyo is actually frightening as the main villain, and wanted to see what was coming to him!, plus it also had some good dialog!.
The character development isn't too bad, and the finale is great and full of action, plus, i was really surprised by all the violence!.
All right, so maybe there are two messages: The one already stated, plus, keep your wives and daughters away from Hawaii, or you may find yourself living at the Bachelor Arms Apartments.
Tony Hancock,Dennis Potter,Monty Python,Upstairs Downstairs,The Saint,Callan,Richard Dimbleby,Fawlty Towers,Morecambe and Wise,The Two Ronnies,Dad's Army,Only Fools and Horses,The Prisoner,Ronnie Barker,Steptoe and Son,John Cleese,Porridge,David Frost,Rising Damp,One Foot In The Grave..........yes,just some of the programmes and names that have been associated with British TV over the last fifty years or so which has given the country a justified reputation for the best TV in the world.But it was perhaps sadly inevitable with the natural demise of all and more of similar above individuals and TV shows that new replacements would have to be found in future generations.At the beginning of the 21st Century,some bright spark thought that a new and exciting concept called "Reality TV" was the answer to all these problems;it would be cheap to produce,featuring members of the public with secretly placed cameras around a specially built set,picking up all the various interactions and conversations,with the added bonus of assigned tasks and games,plus a public phone vote to evict various people until the last one left,who would be deemed the "winner".
On the plus side, there were some nice touches that I found very good.
The four hours plus of material is fascinating.
Yes, it was 11 hours plus long, but it is certainly worth it.
For a start our hero can escape anytime he wants, plus he rides a restored motorcycle for half the film.. so why would he want to 'run' anywhere?
This Is one of Van Damme's absolute best, and in my top 5, plus this may be Van Damme's breakout performance as an actor in my opinion (although he is always amazing).
I really liked how Van Damme tried to do something different here, and in my opinion it worked perfectly, and Van Damme and Arquette have amazing chemistry together, plus it was awesome to see how well Van Damme bonded with the kids!.
I can't believe critics called this embarrassing, and if you think Van Damme can't act, you have to watch this movie, plus Joss Ackland is pretty menacing as the main villain!.
The character development is outstanding, and the kids are surprisingly very likable, plus the movie has a couple of good scraps!.
They made those classic 20 minute plus Popeye shorts.
An additional plus, is that it deals with the difficulties facing all human relationships, whether gay or heterosexual.
There are so many lovable characters outside the family as well, plus some comically mean-spirited ones!
"The Lemon Drop Kid" plus the most bleak episodes of "The Sopranos" = this movie.
If you waste your time & money on this you'll say the same thing my boyfriend did as we exited The Cinema Village: "That man, Peter Berlin owes me $10.50 plus 85 minutes of my life!
There was interesting commentary by Jack Wrangler, who apparently also has rooms made into self-shrines but is much more the part-hetero guy his parents must surely have preferred to his burlesque 'n' porn days (even if his wife is 20 plus years older than he, himself no spring chicken, is.)
On the plus side, there were several good laughs, it was for the most part quite wholesome, everyone does eventually live happily ever after, and the beautiful Roma put in a good performance as always.
It is hard to take her seriously plus her acting is wooden, she has a very limited range of emotions that she can express with her trout lips.
The answer, of course, is that her husband Harry Hamlin acts as the male lead plus also produced the movie.
Best to watch this as a gritty cop flick, trashy, cynical and sometimes a bit silly with plenty of misguided attempts at humor on account of leading man James Woods, always a plus, in any film.
For me, this is a huge plus, as all too often films seem derivative and dull--two words that cannot be applied to DEATH TO THE TINMAN.
The uniformly terrific acting rates as another major asset: Baker delivers a positively chilling portrayal of serene evil as Ruth, Auffarth is both brave and heart-breaking as the unfortunate Meg, Moran likewise impresses as David, plus there are sound supporting contributions from Graham Patrick Martin as the mean Willie Chandler Jr., Catherine Mary Stewart as David's cheery mom, Grant Shaw as David's easygoing dad, and William Atherton as the regretful grown-up David.
plus the guy who wrote and directed this has some talent and will probably be going places very soon.
Efron is less affected (and made-up) than in "High School Musical" performances, which is a plus.
Most of target audience probably lives in the Valley, plus a few exclusive pockets of geekdom in major cities throughout the world.
This movie is different than the normal movie, which is a big plus.
It has some decent gore scenes, but all the characters were very unlikable, and it moved along at a snail's pace, plus the only time it got interesting was the finale, as that was kind of fun to watch.
I bought this at a pawn shop for a $1, as thankfully I didn't spend much money on it, plus The Scarecrow wasn't menacing at all for me, as it was just too weak looking.
It may be worth a watch for Horror fanatics(like myself), but even then I would have trouble recommending it, and it's badly made and written as well, plus Gary Lockwood played his role extremely well as the prick of a Mayor!.
There is one amusing moment, where a couple of drunk guys try to go mess around and pee on the Scarecrow, and things go dead wrong, and I thought the two leads Elizabeth Barondes(Claire) and John Mese(Dillion) hardly had any chemistry together at all, plus as I said the only worthwhile things are the decent gore scenes and the finale.
Elizabeth Barondes and John Mese are mediocre as the leads, and I didn't really care about there characters, they were just there, plus it didn't help that they didn't have very good chemistry together.
The lively and engaging acting from a game cast qualifies as a major plus: the adorable Felice Schachter as sweet school newspaper reporter geek Bernadette, Robert Mandan as pompous principal Walter J. Coolidge, Scatman Crothers as cranky baseball coach Dexter Jones, Greg Bradford as jerky college preppie Robert Wolcott, Sue Ane Langdon as ditsy English teacher Rose Burnhart, and Hilary Beane as sexy secretary Corinne Updike.
Just as I remembered plus those unexpected surprises that time puts in evidence.
The running time is very long at 3 hours plus, but it goes by very quickly.
I love The Firesign Theater, so the other night when I was browsing through the On Demand sections on TV and saw this movie listed and featuring two of the troupe, plus other guys I generally like like Harry Shearer and Fred Willard, I thought I'd check it out.
Stallone in full "Rambo" mode, plus Swarzegenner as the "Terminator," Harry from "True Lies," or any other of his macho personas -- another half-minute.
This plus the splendid technicolor is a feast for the eyes.
While I have not seen the other versions, plus 2 more done later in the 1950's, this one is stronger than your typical western because of the talented cast & the tremendous fist fight scene between Wayne & Scott which takes most of the last 10 minutes of the film.
Everything funny, hysterical, strange and enchanting you can squeeze out of old good Westerns plus amazing Japanese aesthetics (watch the leader of Whites.
plus non-stopping action plus brilliant choreography - in short, it's your regular must see.
The director is american and this was definitely a plus.
Unfortunately, Scorcese also takes 2 plus hours to tell us this simple story.
In addition, through the introduction of a Western exchange student into proceedings, the film engages viewers in multicultural interaction of a variety less stereotypical than usual, a substantial plus right there.
Yes Emmanuelle is an x rated movie, yes the story and plot development was razor thin, but compared to all other x rated movies it is a big winner, plus Emmanuelle is erotic as hell in parts.
lack of dialog is a plus with the emotion expressed through the camera and actors.
The main character "Victoria" is played by Victoria Hamilton whose ability to express feelings without speaking is Oscar winning quality plus.
Explolsions and murder and hot women plus Jason statham equals good movie.
THE WEEPING MEADOW ('Trilogia I: To Livadi pou dakryzei') is writer/director Theodoros Angelopoulos (with influences from Tonino Guerra plus assistance from Petros Markaris and Giorgio Silvagni) creating a personal vision of the 20th century.
Seau Jorge doing David Bowie songs is a plus too.
Despite this, I still am not complaining because I liked the film so much plus Miss Oakley is a rather mythic figure already and little impact on history (though she did a lot for women's rights--at least indirectly).
Smackdown is the total package, sometimes it have his ups & downs but right now since Wrestlemania, the show is back at what it always was, a top WRESTLING show... plus you have very good entertaining...
Edge is the greatest heel of all times, MVP funny and charismatic as usual, Jeff Hardy a human highlight reel... Undertaker is the deadman and nobody can stop him, Mr.Kennedy is really entertaining and cut decent promos, Festus & Jesse are really over and talented, the champ Triple H is something... Well you have all you want in this show plus cute chicks like Michelle McCool, Victoria & Maria to make this show, really complete!
I absolutely love Denis Leary (man has the best hair in showbiz, I think - plus having a love scene with a topless Liz Hurley in Double Whammy elevates him to "God" status in my eyes), and Christine Lahti commands attention.
Although most viewers consider Nikki the central character, Nikki really needs Pammy to play off (much like Charlize Theron needs Christina Ricci's reaction shots in "Monster"), plus Pammy's scenes without Nikki are some of the best in the film and Pammy is the character who undergoes all the changes in the story, so you can't really say that one of them is more important than the other.
As many have mentioned, "He Was a Quiet Man," seems to combine elements of past similar-themed features including "Falling Down," "Office Space" and "A History of Violence," plus a few of the artistically weird storytelling aesthetics of a David Lynch picture.
He's very mysterious and enigmatic, plus he's good looking and has a sweet personality.
The only plus point I can see is it would have been very low budget.
Snappy banter plus strong performance from the leads made up for a transparent plot and lackluster 'action' sequences.
It has realistic battle scenes, competent acting plus it shows the Vietnam war from the medics' and doctors' point of view.
Her character in this film is full of hurt and regret, which the audience I am sure feel sorry for, plus she also helps save the day.
However there is a significant plus in home viewing due to a major extra on the DVD version of 'Keane': the alternate shorter edit made up by Steven Soderbergh.
Another plus side to the film is the action build-up where our heroes, along with sesshoumaru and his crew of Rin, Jaken and Ah-Uhn, along with the sword maker Totosai -i think i spelled his name right- fight the army of the dead, literally, controlled by Sounga and the man known as Takemaru.
For one, the picture is ponderously long at three and a half plus hours, and you have to be patient with the abrupt scene changes that were designed around commercial breaks and new chapters.
There are so many shots to savour, I'll name just a few which caused me an admiring intake of breath;- for example the scene early in the film with a reflected image of the at that point still optimistic newly-weds sitting by the frog-pond, the expressionist use of shadows seemingly radiating out from Fonda's cell as he paces it in frustration and what may have been the first cinematic use of the three possible "Hold the front page" headlines in the press depending on the outcome of Fonda's trial plus of course the rightly famous eerie smoky set-piece where Fonda panics and shoots his friend the prison priest.
Later, I saw it again because of the same reason plus I usually find Glenn Ford's films entertaining.
The fee for an escort back then - ten dollars plus expenses while on the date!!!
It really is a shame that in the thirty plus years of Bronson's film career that he never found anything approaching this quality.
The meaning of each scene as it is broken up, is a definite plus.
There are a numerous plus points in this blockbuster, and if I'm telling you I'm getting the DVD when it's released, I'm already giving this a vote of confidence that it's a contender to make it to my top 10 movies of the year.
Her mother really loved her, plus the fancy red hat, too.
All very relevant today 70 plus years later.
Add to that some remarkable aerial photography of skydiving derring-do -- plus a love scene which features the beautiful Ms. Kerr's bare breasts -- and you probably won't feel you've wasted 2 hours.
One definite plus is how the show is filmed.
Another huge plus is the cast and level of characterization.
This, plus the intriguing poster led me to believe this was going to be a brooding drama in the Hitchcock tradition.
I ended up seeing it three more times while it was still in theatres because it brought back the same feelings plus new ones from having watched the film from an adult perspective.
The original concept was a virtual fertile breeding ground for the creative ideas of writers seeking to birth their own ideas of how a superhero should be, plus the environment provides for an exaggerated interaction between supposed complex relationships of characters.
Furthermore, the music is divine: Siegfried's Funeral March (the sword's motif), more Wagner (Lohengrin and Parzival), plus the Carmina Burana.
That, plus another very typical male response by her father to excessive temptation by his wife's sister who, without a care for the family unit, threw her many sexual charms at her drunk brother in law.
Brilliant art direction - amazing collection of props - good music score, screen writing whose dialogs possess a very realistic feel, top-notch performances by all actors (mainly the duo plus the supporters; I was very surprised by Nancy Olson), cinematography and editing which catch that noir feel and a director (who I wish to know better!)
I had no idea what the plot was and the very tag line plus today's Mexican show business hype promised something like an "evolved-but-limited" achievement.
i truly want my money back, plus some extra cash just for how bad it was
Dull and likely socially disturbed dialogs (with some "witty" humor about the skin, German "die Pelle") plus the unnatural lightning definitely kills the aesthetic effort of the filmmakers (which is merely noticeable).
This movie is rated to high in my opinion, because there is no explicit cruelty in it (which is a plus!
It's too bad that someone took such a good name for a movie...I mean the title alone gives anyone an idea or three about what this movie could have been...(almost famous, requiem for a dream...just to name two extremes...and extremely good, creative movies with similar resources)...It's like when a band takes a great name and shoulda' just named themselves 'another lame-ass band'... Well, the same thing holds true here...a great writer could have taken the same concept (forget the name) and driven this movie into a completely original direction with some real drama, real comedy and real emo-tion...instead, we get what we get...plus now this great title is attached to this run of the mill, halfass storyline with so-so performances...
Alas, even that plus is spoilt for me by the model of Mighty Joe Young, who's made to look more like a bemused teddy bear than a ferocious gorilla (his ancestor, Kong, has bags more character in that respect).
The only big plus for the film were the great sets--they really were cool and made this B-movie look more like a higher budget feature film.
The cover looked very interesting, plus what a story line.
Kind of looks like they made it in a couple of weeks so I appreciate the effort and I think it was worth 97 minutes of my life on planet earth...I didn't watch the extra features I'm sorry to say and I was kinda bummed the way the every 'hastings' scene had the cheapest possible activity, sword fight, paintball, dog show, bus ride, drinking competition....yet there was no stunts and only 4 breasts involved plus Taj's golf cart was super slow..........hey ho!
On the plus side they don't need Van or even Taj to bust out a whole host of Van Wilder Chronicles.
On the plus side...
The movie is about 40 minutes long, so that is a plus because usually movies like this that are too long are hard to watch all the way through.
Only plus in the margin is to Bok Yun Chon for being beautiful and to Marcus Aurelius (i think...) for being partially funny.
This is extremely outrageously boring and dumb movie, what in earth did encourage Ed Harris make this movie, he thought he can make something like 'Unforgiven' plus 'Hondo' and he obviously got his head too much into some stuff that aren't important in western and in the end he made this pile of junk.
On the plus side, the actors were all fairly convincing in their roles, with the exception of Dee Snider who cant even convincingly play himself.
On the plus side, Iain Glenn makes quite a decent Alan Breck, and New Zealand puts in a perfectly adequate performance as Scotland.
On its slight plus side, it did have some nice eye candy, And the desert landscapes were quite impressive.
Toni Cocozza is a nice enough guy, but the actor playing him was so unappealing, plus the abrupt ending, has me giving this film only 3 stars.
The only plus there is in that film is the scene where you see Virginie Ledoyen in her underwear.
Indeed the characters and relationships are funny to watch, and indeed the general self-derisional plot (a movie version of a manga about the misdeeds of the manga itself, plus a bank robbery plot with hostages progressively taking the roles of the robbers themselves) could have been of great interest.
Her bug-eyed expression, which she must think is appropriate for every scene, plus her open-mouthed pout and twitchy jerking from expression to expression make this movie almost unwatchable.
And FYI, there were no 6 foot and 6 foot plus tunnel rats as depicted in the movie.
However, on the plus side, there are very good performances from Dawn Dunlap (as Laura) and James Mitchell (as Paul), and the soundtrack is quite nice.
Why is it so bad, because you have Ernest as the main character, plus very annoying children, and a silly subplot involving some company trying to take over the camp.
Also, if you could not tell by the title, the humor is very immature which can be a plus or a minus depending on your taste.
On the plus side, Rob Lowe's acting is very good & Moore's (such an underrated actress!)
On the plus side, Tyrese proves that he can act.
These were great films that I felt had thought put into them plus had a social commentary that was valid at the time of these films releases.
The problem is it's slow, illogical, and no twist and turns to make the two plus hours invested worthwhile.
I think my nationality has rendered my some point of patriotism, that the war criminal could not just get away with this, of just like the blockbuster "Pearl Harbor", in the spitting of the people of China, plus the modest performance of Harley and Trevor, I would rather delete it from my PC.
War, there are various incredibly poorly done flashbacks of Charlie and Stern plus their fellow soldiers having gun fights in what looks like a football field and some local woods.
On the plus side, the women are easy on the eye, most of the performances are pretty good, and there are some genuinely funny moments in the last half of the film.
!One star is for her plus one star for eye candy Lena Headey, makes 2 stars.
On the plus side Wesley Snipes is Wesley Snipes (be that a pro or a con) and the movie is quite engaging.
However, "To All a Good Night" is a cut above most derivative slashers, even though it starts out with the mandatory sex-obsessed sorority girls (plus one cute wallflower) and assembly-line violence, it gets progressively better as it goes alongÂcreating an adequate atmosphere of dread and giving its surviving characters a bit of personality and humanity.
On the plus side, there is a humongous body count and as I said, it's fairly amusing in an inadvertent kind of way.
Well the only thing they were able to talk about is the boom coming into view more than two dozen times plus seeing the top of the camera several times.
The back of the video box states "Come along on this tour and get it all., plus an unadvertised bonus: 84 minutes of monstrous terror."
Jodie Moore is great looking as well, and her Australian accent was a big plus.
In addition to the dismal screenplay, the director can't even properly frame a shot, plus the DP armed with a low end camcorder screws up the color balance in each shot so that every scene has a sickly green tint to it.
Hasnain Hyderabadwala & Raksha Mistry after copying COLLATERAL and making THE KILLER(2006) remake again This time their film THE TRAIN is a remake of DERAILED a film which wasn't that great in the first place  The film looks similar to Emraan's own ZEHER in fact the promos and also the songs plus the adultery theme is so much ZEHER  The film could be a decent thriller but sadly the film comes too late even the chemistry between Emraan and Sayali Bhagat is bad The sub plot of their daughter is good but the rest film however isn't as engrossing  The problem is predictability and also the feeling of deja vu plus the villain's characterization isn't too convincing and the final twist is predictable too  Direction is okay Music is a winner, especially ZINDAGI NE, MAUSAM, WOH AJNABEE Camera-work is good  Emraan is good in his part and is getting more dependable though the role is too similar to ZEHER Sayali Bhagat is weak while Geeta Basra is better much has a way to go Aseem Merchant irritates Suresh Menon is as usual, Rajat Bedi fills the bill
plus Rottweiler calmly lay there?
cranked out to fulfill their quota of fifty (50) plus features a year.
On the plus side, the look of the show is very slick and professional, but that's not necessarily an asset to comedy anyway.
On the plus side, Max von Sydow is the only watchable player in the film.
A plus side of it is, i guess, it gave off a good vibe and i was intrigued,until i turned it on.
On the plus side, the actors in ape makeup did raise the bar in terms of simian arm-swinging.
The film is high on its gore level and so reminds pretty much of Ichi the Killer, a film that is filled with cartoonish violence and blood plus sadism towards both females and males.
On the plus side, it has more scary moments than the first one (if you can get through a dreadful first half).
On the plus side there is both nice scenic photography of the New Zealand country side and of Auckland and Wellington.
PvP is another means to drain you of yet another couple of hundred hours and dreadfully predictive unless you are a dimwit, reaching ne plus ultra meaning (take a wild guess) better equipment.
I felt the casting of Harvey Fierstein and Michael McKean was not strong, plus the idea of splicing together the brothers singing instead of having each one sing his version separately diminished the impact of the song.
On the plus side, there is a small but decent amount of gore effects (severed limbs, bullets through head and neck, guts seeping out of a dead body) and the soundtrack (similar to John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN) is actually quite eerie and effective, rendering the film a tad more suspenseful than it has a right to be.
A husband (Roger Mills) his wife (Pat Kellis) plus their two children Amy (Judy Brown) and Jimmy (Kevin Hanlon) and anyone else the hippie zombies can find are attacked.
Okay, it's got Stan Getz and Astrud Gilberto, plus the Jimmy Smith Trio, so as others have said, if you like jazz, you've got two good scenes.
On the plus side there is some excellent male eye-candy.
It seems to take almost the entire movie to bring the Monster to life, and then he doesn't do anything very interesting -- plus he's one of the least interesting-LOOKING Frankenstein Monsters in movie history.
To the maker of this film: I do admire your ability to "produce a film" fast plus make many copies of it on a professional looking DVD and make a good cover for the DVD.
Horrible, I mean downright horrible special effects and real putrid acting plus the many things that would not possibly ever happen in real life or even imaginary make this one of, if not, the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life!
Yeah, I knew it involved a girl and her horse, but still, I was open-minded, plus my date wanted to see it.
It's true, Chuck has made a living some 30 plus years, kicking people in the head, he is much loved for doing so.
Count them, they are all there: the shell-shocked husband returning from a decade of Soviet labour camps, the wife who has grown independent in the meantime by having to run the family business plus the family itself, the son turned communist due to disgust for the crimes of his father's generation (and I would have liked to see that person put up communist party posters in a pub in the early 50ies, even in the Ruhr area... tar and feathers, anyone?).
To take this script, these actors and head for eastern Europe with all the medieval rental costumes of Holland ("voor al uw feesten en partijen"- no costume seems to be made especially for this movie) plus the ugliest wigs ever made borders on hubris.
whenever I think of that film after all these years and I saw it twenty plus years ago--The awful monster noises not the appalling characters that invarably pops up in my mind first.
Laughable dialogue and some strange accents, including one English actress being dubbed by another one, plus some comical 'special' effects make this entertaining for all the wrong reasons.
On the plus side, the movie itself is a fairly accurate adaptation of Verne's story; at least the book's illustrations appear to have been used as models for the rocket and the cannon.
Stupid tale plus dull, plodding dialogue equals a real loser movie.
Martin Short and Danny Glover star in PURE LUCK, and the title plus Short should be a tipoff as to the quality of this obvious tax writeoff.
I guess their wasn't much wind resistance at 160 plus.
plus he doesn't have that tough badass action aura that Schwarzenegger or even Vin Diesel have.
On the plus side the photography is good and even beautiful in the mountains.
On the sort of plus side, there was a thread of tension running through the movie and an atmosphere reminiscent of Todd Haynes's "Safe", though with none of the commitment of that movie.
Other than that, this film was the Al Pacino Scarface, sans drugs and bad Cuban accents but plus gaudy costumes: i.e.- bad, but highly mockable.
It is dazzling and Blanchett can't be denied, but "Elizabeth: The Golden Age" is like a chick-flick with explosions plus costumes, super hair, and loud, intrusive music.
Here in the UK, it was a hollow experience and we were unable to stick the 3 hours plus.
In the actual movie, she does hold (and fire) a machine gun, BUT: A) Her outfit is a formal dress under a fur coat, B) Her part is a 5-minute cameo (plus a few lines of narration).
The other members of the gang are Myron Healey and powerful J. Carroll Naish, plus others, with George Wallace as the sheriff of Seymour and William Phipps, Chubby Johnson and Holly Bane in smaller roles.
Lastly, there is an amazingly dull blooper reel plus the original theatrical trailer.
I saw it when it first aired, but I couldn't watch it again since it brings back such bad memories, plus it's so biased.
We have songs by Hill, tap-dancing duos, a comedy song well sung by a large man I couldn't find a credit for, plus Noble Sissle and his orchestra in some fine swing numbers.
I am a huge fan of "evil aliens" movies, plus I absolutely loved the original TV series from back in the day.
The potentially cool bits are the only saving grace of this one, but its still about 95 plus percent useless so Id say avoid.
The first one always made me cry even when I was older plus the music and visuals were cool so it made it a really good film but this one isn't.
of Homeland Security, in which Lawless briefs a panel wearing full dress uniforms while she is dressed in skin-tight jeans; the inevitable expression of remorse from the entomologist, prior to his bloody demise; the scene in the Pittsburgh office, with the b-day party being interrupted by a picture window full of bugs (plus the revelation that the office hunk is even wimpier than Lawless' bf); the scene in the chopper when Lawless declares she's hormonal due to her pregnancy, and just might kill everyone in the chopper if the DHS doesn't change its drastic plan; the climactic kiss that is interrupted by the buzzing of the swarm; and just about every scene in which people are warned about the locusts' pending arrival -- first, they're in denial; minutes later, they're running for their lives.
That, plus some of the outfits worn by Donna Denton, seems to be enough to warrant a point or two.
plus that "she knows the hospital" stuff... and then it takes her "one second" to figure it out?
I mean you have a decent director Jim Wynorski and an attractive lead actress, plus the theme of the film.
We've then had another 11 (inc. Freddy vs Jason), plus this one, and they have just got worse each time.
On the plus side, I didn't care.
this movie doesn't follow history its been proved that Tut was hit in the back of the head and it killed him plus Tut was buried with his his death mask on.
The only plus I give this film is the accomplishment of Jerry Reed.
Peter Brook's productions often involve wholesale cuts and rearrangements, plus hefty doses of non-authorial content.
Well it's also got interminable Hot-Wheels-In-The-Terrarium sequences, plus the most insufferably wholesome drag racer of all time.
The sheer joy he takes in her physicality proves this, plus her mythic strength and power over the male.
He is under the mistaken impression that they are after something  other than human flesh, plus they move slowly, so the remaining  people should be able to out run the dead.
I know this was way before CG animation and special effects, but good lord, the effects on Star Trek TOS 10 years plus earlier looked better than this!
On the plus side the Mexican locations on occasion look stunning & a few nice shots here & there captures it well.
It is quite filled with technical errors and the like, plus cheesy acting + dialog, but these things can be ignored.
A plus, however, is the film's wonderful poster art, faithfully reproduced on the new DVD cover and all old VHS's.
On the plus side, the scenery is nice and most shots are well lit.
I also mentioned the actresses/actors being bad, I got that feeling where you're pi*sed off at them, thinking, no, that's not how you behaved during that era plus their performances aren't convincing on any plan.
It is not without its plus points.
Another plus: the end of the movie, and of the pain.
There is, however, one big plus in its favor, the actors.
On the plus side, the little boy is cute and the uncle IS funny.
However - one plus was the Selma Blair character - although it sort of felt it was a little underused.
Actually, she had managed to hold off the tribe doing her in by keeping up the white goddess front for over six years, plus she learned their language and kept a witch doctor at bay.
it wouldn't work on his suit, plus bruce wayne is prepared for eventualities.
The initial conflict is somewhat interesting and even intriguing (a huge corporation controlling 90 percent of the Earth and a bunch of free-thinking teenagers opposed to it - plus some mysterious Darkside planning some 'renewal'), but it leads to nowhere: the protagonists talk a lot, but in the end you get none explanation.
I will start by saying, yes, I did only pay a dollar for this DVD, plus it came with "Dream a Little Dream 2", but one dollar was ten dollars too much, hahaha.
Georgia's parents would have never thrown such a big party plus she would have died in their presence.
Forget Faces Of Death, this is all real and very graphic footage of well, let's see, Medical Operations, Accidents, Autopsys, plus pictures of suicides and police photographs.
There are a few scenes that work and the blood and gore is a plus.
This movie was created by filming 70 minutes of fun house ghouls and fog plus 10 minutes of reality-show-quality acting plus 10 minutes of idiotic plot development.
In short, what ruins this film is its relentless preachiness, that, plus the fact that it so quickly became dated.
Still, on the plus side, at least Joyce got more to do than make jam this time.
The only plus side of this movie was a pretty decent soundtrack and Chris Penn.
On the plus side, the score is kinda groovy and the naked babes (it's a French film, after all) make it easier on the eyes, though not enough to recommend.
Since there was nothing on screen to indicate why it had cost that much, my brother and I have also worked out how the budget was allocated:  * Travolta's salary, plus assorted managers and hangers on: 40 million.
He finds out his  daughter was knocked up by Frankie, plus he must deal with  having two Barney Fifes as deputies.
Ms. Lohse is credited as key makeup artist and having worked on Rent Control (2002), Employee of the Month (2004), plus many others as Dead Men Walking (2005) and Dracula's Curse (2006), which coincidently has five members of The BeastÂco-starring.
The show has a great deal more depth than much of what's on, plus a large dose of simple everyday realism compared with most current dramas (where's Bochco when he's needed?)
I don't really understand much about Chinese color symbology, but this is a plus.
The only plus about any and all of these movies is the dogs they use.
For a start the character's are awful, to call them one-dimensional & bland would be too kind, the dialogue is terrible as for some reason these people can't seem to string a proper sentence together, it's an absolute bore to sit through with a predictable & clichÃ©d 'plot' although I use the term plot very loosely, all the zombie attacks are virtually the same & end up with the human character's having a karate fight with them, however on the plus side Swamp Zombies might just be the best horror/zombie/martial arts film ever made, not that I can think of any others mind you.
The baddies' arbitrary slaying of everyone is to my approval, plus it keeps the cast numbers down.
On the plus side, the movie flows fairly quickly and the action sequences are decent.
of Homeland Security, in which Lawless briefs a panel wearing full dress uniforms while she is dressed in skin-tight jeans; the inevitable expression of remorse from the entomologist, prior to his bloody demise; the scene in the Pittsburgh office, with the b-day party being interrupted by a picture window full of bugs (plus the revelation that the office hunk is even wimpier than Lawless' bf); the scene in the chopper when Lawless declares she's hormonal due to her pregnancy, and just might kill everyone in the chopper if the DHS doesn't change its drastic plan; the climactic kiss that is interrupted by the buzzing of the swarm; and just about every scene in which people are warned about the locusts' pending arrival -- first, they're in denial; minutes later, they're running for their lives.
All the characters are pretty cool, and the story was solid, plus Emily Perkins is simply amazing in this!.
I was really disappointed that Katharine Isabelle was so wasted in this as she only has a few lines, and I thought Tatiana Maslany was brilliant as the psycho Ghost as she was really creepy and unpredictable, plus it had quite a few tense scenes.
while it is good it just didn't have the magic the 1st did, and while the ending is really quite surprising, I never did care too much for it,plus Emily is able to match her amazing performance in the 1st!.
There is a freaky masturbation scene, and I love the setting in the creepy hospital, plus all the characters were quite likable.
Brett Sullivan does quite a good job here with effective camera work, solid angles, using a creepy setting, adding creepy atmosphere some good POV shots, and lots of other cool shots as well, plus he kept the film at a fast pace for the most part.
Between dreadfully dull scenes of chinwagging between Agren and Warbeck, as they attempt to discover who or what is responsible for a spate of recent murders, viewers are treated to a touch of light gore, plus some nudity courtesy of Agren's busty fashion model sister (who displays very unusual techniques when it comes to both modelling and taking a shower).
Gomez his wife Morticia (Daryl Hannah) their two children Wednesday (Nicole Fugere) & Pugsley (Jerry Messing), Grandpa & Grandma plus uncle Fester (Patrick Thomas) & Lurch (Carel Struycken) all set of for the family reunion at 'Primrose Resort'.
I'm a fan of Dina Meyer's, plus it had Jeff Fahey and Dennis Hopper.
It has great action, great production value plus the return of Sean Connery.
After about a half-dozen mainly implausible dangers, uninteresting escapes, pretty camp fires, and lame father-son heart-to-hearts, plus one tableau of emaciated prisoners awaiting to be eaten, I was looking at my watch, preferring to stick a fork in my eye than see one more faux-frightening episode.
The director leaves it up to the audience to somehow figure out what kind of reasonable scientific explanation could account for anyone surviving for any amount of time after all the oxygen-producing plant life plus everything else in the food chain between bugs and people bit the dust.
cover) plus a clever cameo by Sugar Ray (who are far underused), the majority of the songs are insufferable rap songs.
On the plus side the world would probably not have the atomic bomb, and might not have wasted billions sending a man to the moon if the South had won the Civil War.
It's not nice enough for you to forget that you're watching a really boring film, but at least the film has plus points.
: Entertainment Television station that was intended more or less to be an unscripted (yeah right) update on the ditsy, southern-tinged, child-like and obviously obese former Guess Jeans and Playboy Centerfold-cum-plus-size Lane Bryant model Anna-Nicole Smith as she attempts to piece her crumbling and severely unstable life back together after numerous career failures, long public court battles with a former son-in-law over the would-be inheritance (supposedly worth millions) that she was supposed to receive when her *shudders* 90 plus year old billionaire oilman husband died back in the mid-1990's.
On the small plus side?
If you like all of the above, plus the bad plot/acting/directing, than see this movie.
Oh yeah, plus there's an Alien about, and Dark is also a little down about that, you know how it is.
The only big plus is the very ending--it's pretty cool.
Stalwarts of British comedy acting then and later, plus George Sanders, fight manfully against one of the stupidest plots imaginable - about a government-sponsored brothel for the gentry in late 19th century London.
Imagine, a whodunit flick which is treated in a lighter vein, with lot of drama but no melodrama plus hardly any action, is what makes this fare, a surprising watchable stuff, is all can be said about the film..
On the plus side the sets are marvelous.
While my list would be HUGE, here are a few of the problems with the story: the girl's name was "Matoaka" not "Pocahontas" (this was a nickname, not her real name), she was about 11 or so and Smith an older man and so the romance in the Disney film is either disgusting or false (fortunately, there was no romance according to all but the Disney account), the whole head getting smashed like a pumpkin incident probably never occurred (Smith spoke of this for the first time 17 years after the fact and it was never recorded elsewhere before this--plus Matoaka publicly showed contempt for Smith--something that makes no sense if the story was true), Matoaka was kidnapped by the British and she did not willingly join them (as seen in POCAHONTAS II), and the natives were not "tree-hugging hippies"--but real 3-dimensional people (for good and bad).
This and the fact that we never see the cat, plus the jarring transition between the outdoor footage and the cheesy studio look of the homestead exterior made the whole film look really low budget.
A real plus for fans all over the world.
On the plus side though, I do owe the (completely unscary) chap that plays the murderer a favour.
This one has quite an interesting cast -- Giancarlo Giannini of Lina Wertmueller fame plus loads of seventies dolls -- and nice decors, but it doesn't help.
Mid-twentieth-century historical dramas are worth a look for the sumptuous sets and costumes Hollywood studios might provide, plus their big casts might draw in accomplished character actors.
Lewis Milestone's direction is another plus.
plus Madhuri Dixit didn't deserve that years award.
Not knowing all this actually was a plus in the States.
On the plus side, the make-up and effects are decent, some gratuitous nudity is thrown in, and Lance Henrisken is good in his role.
There is no real story, no one can act plus it has Mr. T in the movie.
It's a very hard film to categorise, it's something a bit different & the filmmakers must at least get some credit for trying something unusual but unfortunately that just didn't stop me from thinking that at the end of the day I had just wasted 90 plus odd minutes of my life watching total crap.
The theme song, bearing the original title "Vampire Hookers," is goofy and tasteless, like the rest of the movie, which gives you xenophobia (locals feed the sailors duck embryos) and homosexual panic (a cross-dresser at a urinal, plus the line "Hey!
The murders are also pretty bloody & squirty, so that's a plus.
Gee, that's over $100,000, plus ROOM SERVICE.
I like Chief Dan George, so that was a plus right there.
All this, plus a couple flashbacks are the entire basis for this movie!!!
(The fact that McClane often relies on his brains instead of his bullets to get out of his predicaments is also a big plus.)

A woman reporter (Brinke Stevens) is on the scene, as well as her boyfriend who works for the CIA (and looks about half her age), an FBI agent, plus there's some crazy 70+ Joan Collins-looking woman who insists on showing marks on her breast (Aaaak!)
whenever she claims she was abducted by aliens, then there's some George Carlin-lookalike doctor who teams up with a psychic or something, plus Tura Satana (from the first Astro-Zombies movie) and her dimwit henchman who looks like Vincent D'Onofrio from MEN IN BLACK who hope to cash in on the invasion.
On top of this, there's plenty of random scenes of government officials sitting around a table saying vaguely important things, plus some "doctors" chillin' in an E.R., and John Carradine's head kept alive in a lab.
The effect of the sound plus the image is a sense of dread and unease even when there is nothing out of the ordinary in the frame, few thrillers or horror films have ever been able to make you feel so off by doing so little.
Farmers would be too busy and too far away to hang out in a bar all day, they'd have supplies of gasoline and food at their farms, plus old agricultural machinery and other equipment that doesn't require gasoline and there would be people who would have the knowledge to operate it.
Then let us look at the leftwing: Stalin (killed about at least 20 million), Lenin (killed 4 million +), Mao (killed about 20 million also), Pol Pot (killed 4 out of Cambodia's population of 8 million) and Saddam Hussein (killed 4 million Iranians plus 1 million Kurds and political opponents).....
And, most of the film either was done in pantomime or was narrated--creating a film that managed to be even less interesting than either version of 1,000,000 BC--plus, unlike the 1960s version, there was no Raquel Welch as eye candy!
Lead "actress" Beverly Lynn is actually pretty good compared to most actresses in these kinds of movies... plus she's easy on the eyes, even in the scenes where she's clothed.
PS It seems Howard plus his scriptwriter now plan to turn the Bernini Mystery into a film, apparently hoping to cash in on another Brown-novel.
It's about the humans in the story, plus some extra characters they threw in.
However, she was paid 70.000 dollars plus 2,5 percent of the nett turnover, which was as good deal as she might have expected, and soon enough she took to the script, false as it may have been.
I can honestly say the only plus to this movie was that there was hardly no dialog, because the acting wasn't even worthy of being called acting.
As a horror film, it's too slow and not gory enough, plus it gives all the money shots too early.
As a romance, it's too gory and disturbing, plus the romance part really isn't shown well.
"Where No One Has Gone Before" (Episode 5, Season 1, Air Date 10/26/87, Stardate 41263.1) engages us in a fantastic journey across the universe and beyond, plus it ponders metaphysical questions of the basis of reality and introduces a new power source -- thought power.
Hey, check out my site on bad and cheesy movies (plus a few good ones) at Cinema de MerdeÂ which you can find it through the url in my email address.
It just didnt seem to be going anywhere.On the plus side Cage was good if nothing spectacular and his character was brought some humourous moments.
I wanted him to be caught, plus he was too old for the part.
The East European setting, with the old buildings and whatnot, provides the movie with its only plus -- it's very nice to look at, even if the fog machine gets a rather strong workout.
He films the fight scenes with people 'flying' through the air plus shooting & reloading their guns in a 'cool' way but they come off as looking ridiculous.
This sort of thing tows a very dangerous line...that it was more significant not that 6 million plus people were exterminated but that it was 6 million jews....according to the majority of these films and various holocaust memorials the gypsies and gays etc.
This is a plus.
The one plus point is that I could see the actress who player Melissa doing a lot more and a lot better in the future but if she continues with this kind of film she will tarnish her reputation for future non-porn films.
Pretty beat up copy, and I usually prefer to stay away from rentals, but couldn't resist, plus it had Linnea Quigley in it.
Paranormal researcher Agnes Goldberg (Judy Tatum) is hired to photograph and exorcize the ghost and organizes a team of paranormal experts that include her "mental medium" husband Felix (Rob Zapple), "psychic medium" Whitney O'Shay (Kathleen Bailey) and sexy video-tech Ginger KoWOWski (Linnea Quigley), plus three low-grade rent-a-cops for protection.
My heart rose, as I had heard much about the film and wanted to see it very much -- plus it is so hard to find and JESUS CHRIST it was sitting right there!
Sprawling duster packs everything into its 100 minute plus running time but an Indian raid.
The character development was terrible the direction was all over the place and the acting is probably some of the worst i have ever seen in anything plus add shoddy camera work and you have the likes of wicked lake even though there are some nice nude scenes there just anit nothing here i can recommend this is seriously bad.
An extra plus for the DVD menus though, they were better than the movie and better than most other DVD-menus.
I've seen a lot of films in my time that don't make an awful lot of sense, but very few have left me quite as confused as The Evil Cult, a crazy wuxia martial arts flick starring Jet Li (plus a host of other genre stars).
Twins are bad luck or something for the tribe, plus the tribe saw them conversing with that hideous, fecal, bad-god, Nukie.
On the plus side Timothy Brown isn't a bad male lead/action hero and there is a Kelsey Grammar look-alike that brought me much mirth.
The cast includes some of the top stars of 1976(year of release) Micheal Caine, Donald Sutherland,Robert Duval,Donald Pleasance,Larry Hagman & Treat William, also Jenny Aguiter & Jean Marsh plus others.
On the plus side the actor who played L was excellent, certainly the only enjoyable thing in this movie.
The script by Klenhard & Tom Walla is far too pedestrian for my liking, nothing significant happens for long stretches, in fact when I think about it nothing particularly significant happens during the films entire 90 plus minute duration.
On the plus side this happens a lot.
plus, you've got muse's "newborn" as a score (appears twice).
The film ain't much better, on the plus side the CGI effects are first rate, from ships to Lightsabers, the extras in their Stormtrooper costumes look the part (at times), made for 20 grand, doesn't look it, they should really stop boasting about this , there's a lot of film makers who could make a very good feature for the same amount, I'm a star wars fan, and love watching the fan movies, but I've seen far better done with far less.
And plus, the game is stupid, so in conclusion, I say that this game is lame.
In my opinion, the only "plus" about this show is that we get a rare glimpse inside the Playboy Mansion... but ol' Heff will be dead in a few years, and supposedly according to his own wishes the mansion will soon thereafter become open to the public.
High marks for this film since it beat the Bollywood standard of being completely incoherent and inane, although still sticking to the three plus hours.
Roshan couldn't find a nice balance between the superhero aspect of Krrish and the romance aspect of it, plus having to establish the background of the film.
There's a pop group and friends that sings a confusing song, three clumsy poachers of varying scary facial-hairyness (one having too much, one having none at all, and one just looking "blah"), and a family consisting of said girlboy (who has a pet for each day of the week, plus "Trumpy" the alien.
As an added plus (read: minus), the wardrobe choices are reminiscent of a Vanity 6 / Loverboy World Tour.
This, plus excellent (and when I say excellent, I mean awful) special effects, acting, and death scenes make Killer Ants!
The bulk of the footage has four "sexperts" (sex therapists plus a gynaecologist) sitting around in a living room, swilling gallons of tea & coffee and talking earnestly about sex.
Oh well, he probably was too expensive at the time to cast him for further Pink Panther, plus he of course at the time was still committed to playing James Bond, so no way they would had allowed him to play a different 'cop' in a different comedy movie series.
On the plus side, the look of the show is very slick and professional, but that's not necessarily an asset to comedy anyway.
Another plus is the classic disco soundtrack with hits from the 70s such as "Afternoon Delight" and a send-up of David Soul's own "Don't Give Up On Us Baby."
All the characters are simply awful, and it looks like this was made by a bunch of film fans in someone's back yard, plus This isn't even good in a so bad it's good way.
The dialog is wretched,as one of my favorite lines includes "I wonder what Mrs. Murphy's been putting in her chowder", and I thought this was incredibly poorly made and written as well, plus the effects are really laughable.
I'm sure the people that made this had a ball filming this, however It's most likely going to be a painful experience for everyone else, and the ending is terrible as well, as it made no sense, plus It was really hard to pay attention because it was so bad, and incredibly dull.
I got this in a DVD Horror set called A Taste Of Evil, along with a bunch of other Horror films, and even people who love bad movies will be bored with this one, plus this should be a bottom 100 contender on IMDb.
On the plus side: Yoda drew some genuine laughs with his "kung fu" stance, although high-speed Yoda was a bit too fanciful for my liking.
That, plus its historical importance, makes it well worth watching.
Will Mcarthy's family, his wife Donna (Rita Taggart) plus their two children Scott (Aron Eisenberg) and Bonnie (Dedee Pfeiffer) become victims of Jenke and his meat cleaver?
Jenke's execution scene is quite cool with lots of expanding skin plus bulging and popping veins.
The only plus about any and all of these movies is the dogs they use.
If you want to see an Asian take (plus a female twist this time) on the Indiana Jones formula, this is a much better choice than Jet Li's "Dr. Wai And The Scripture With No Words".
Apparently the entire crew, plus their families, friends and pets must have been the only ones that voted.
--House of Death has the most funniest death scene that is the only "plus" side to this movie  ** IF you get pierced in the shoulder with an arrow, go and scream for help.
You still get to see Jim Carrey do his quirky and funny impressions, so that's a plus.
Add pieces from Alien, Day after Tomorrow, X-Files, recent gore films, even Prince of Darkness plus a reporter on drugs sub-plot, and many other things that have no place in the story.
That and a believable story behind it...............  All it's gone in the miniseries.......A few points on the plus side: beautiful scenery, the laboratory amazing and realistic, the same for the computer graphics, viral-bacterial culture devices and the electron microscope.
The last season left a taste of I want plus, since the end was half vague.
Sly Stallone mumbles so badly that only about 5% of his dialogue is intelligible (though this is probably a plus, given the quality of the writing).Sharon Stone is nice to look at but her acting starts off bad and gets worse in a hurry.
The total 70s feel is a major plus though.
On the plus side the boys do have some amusing moments, especially Costello in the cage with one of Clyde Beatty's lions which he thinks is just Abbott in a lion costume.
Good acting by Bogie and Bacall, plus some scenes with a delightfully bullying thug, help save the film from being a total waste.
Trouble of course comes to all when a girl, with an inhuman build and deformed body, starts terrorizing all of them(plus the obligatory pizza guy and a homeless man).
The other big plus is that the film lasts only 76 minutes.
And as a final plus, I can say that for a bad film, Butchered is at the very least watchable.
One plus point of this film is that aspect of a middle class life of Lucknow city is covered well.
Another plus is that common box-office ingredients are thankfully avoided here.
By this time (1975) the humour of the double entendre was wearing thin - every line had been done over and over in previous Carry On movies, plus most of the original Carry On team had either passed away or just passed on appearing in this shocker.
plus you know when she invites him in the house and puts on true colors they are going to have a really unnecessary sex scene.
The sound effects are BAD, there's a decent 'bad' fight with a giant shark which couldn't look much more fake if they tried, plus the Ape trashes a few buildings.
If you are a giant monster film fan, this probably won't get more than a few viewings in your entire lifetime but it's good to watch and take off your list of films to see, plus to examine how badly this one was made.
Poor writing plus bad direction plus bad acting times unoriginality equals horrible strait-to-video sequels.
The only real plus is when the 2 girls break off and form their own squad filled with those dormitory protesters.
Anne Judson-Yager (who looks like Reese Witherspoon plus 30 pounds) plays new college freshman and aspiring cheerleader Whittier Smith.
It seems the writer and/or director was going for something prophetic in the name of modern relationships, but got horribly lost along the way by throwing in cliche after cliche plus a disjointed meaningless script that went absolutely nowhere.
I regret that I wasted $10.50 and two hours (plus thirty minutes of ads and previews) on this movie.
And plus it gave us something a bit different.
There are also a babe with big breast in an almost see through t-shirt at 07:38 for 3 seconds, plus another babe with huge nipples at 25:03 for 5 seconds (!)
In fact, you could do better watching a 20 minute short on skiers in the Rockies, and save the other hour plus that is wasted watching "Subject Two".
On the plus side beautiful photography and excellent performances - especially from the young actors.
Still, on the plus side former pop star and Hammer and Children's' Film Foundation regular composer Harry Robertson (who wrote the superb Hammer Transylvanian Western score for Twins of Evil as Harry Robinson - it really is outstandingly good) turns in a score that's like a demented disco combination of an Ennio Morricone paella Western and Jeff Wayne's War of the Worlds, and the film is nowhere near as soul-destroyingly awful as Marcel and Robertson's subsequent collaboration seven years later, the almost unwatchable-even-at-gunpoint Jane and the Lost City.
On the plus side: the soundtrack is awesome.
In fact, the entire first half of the movie has extremely well shot war scenes, plus surround sound used as effectively as it has ever been used.
Samuel L. Jackson (Colonel Terry Childers) lacks every amount of intensity that he brings with him in every other film, plus he is barely in the film itself.
On the plus side, it is a very visually stunning movie.
The film was started post HAHK(even the title was HUM AAPKE HAI SANAM that time) and it took 8 years to complete  When the promo was shown i was shocked considering SRK and Salman haven't shared screenspace since KARAN ARJUN and suddenly a film with them and Madz comes   The movie is regressive, outdated and could be better in 90's  The back story of Madz- Salman is so cringeworthy even there is too much sermonising  But there is one plus point and that is SRK in this film, well normally he overdoes his scenes here he is in full control and plays his role with a straight face and brings a lot of fun in the movie  Sadly the film never manages to sustain the tempo and we have tripe like GALE MEIN LAAL TIE.etc  Also it's funny to see the appearances of actors Salman suddenly in 1 scene looks straight out of JUDWAA days with his medium sized hair and with his overacting but lively acting and then he comes to 2001 days where he looks dead The dubbing too is inconsistent and also his acting which goes from amateurish and then to dead acting SRK too suddenly has short hair, long hair and also his looks keep changing and so his dubbing and acting Madz too, in 1 scene she has brown hair and then the ponytailed black hair look  The film also has the late Laxmikant Berde who wasn't much seen in 2002 Also we see Atul Agnihotri who was rejected post 1998 i feel and was just seen as an extra   Direction by KS Abdiyamaan is outdated though good in parts Music is okay, most songs sound old Cinematography is inconsistent  Acting SRK though looks inconsistent yet he delivers a wonderful performance and rarely hams which is a relief Madz is as usual, she does a good job but her role is too regressive Salman khan is inconsistent, at times lively and at times dead below average overall Laxmikant Berde is okay Alok Nath is okay in a small role Atul Agnihotri is a reject and he annoys
It is for her luminescence and the two or three funny jokes (plus great cameos by James Cameron and Martin Scorsese) that I give The Muse 3/10.
I should have known with this movie being shelved for two years, plus the fact that it lost something like 96 million dollars at the box office that this movie was going to be bad.
The acting is terrible, and i never really rooted for anyone, plus nothing happens until the last 15 to 20 minutes, and it's too talky with lots of extremely boring dialog.
Christine Moore, does good with the lousy script, however she had her off moments, still i liked her, plus she's gorgeous!,but her chemistry with, Gary Warner is off.
The only plus side to their performance is their dominance over the script that fails to evoke any comedy.
Just because it's so over the top with gunplay and sets a new standard for bgrade action films, plus there's a Baldwin brother in it, so hey...I'd give it the extra point for that alone.
Without giving away too much of the movie: There are NUMEROUS scenes where the heroes act DOWNRIGHT stupid and incompetent, plus quite often they run away like scared little girls when having an advantage in numbers during the "fights".
I think it could have been funny in a twisted, morbid, sort of way, but a bunch of prissy, "evil", dingy Valley Girl stereotypes, plus the one girl who "is really a good girl and has a conscience" didn't add to a creative or interesting story.
It's either a bad homage or straight out rip-off of the film "Heathers", which is worlds better than this, plus it features Rose McGowen reprising that same role she does in just about every film she's in: heartless bitch that never shows any emotions (the only other character she ever portrays is ditzy girl that never shows any emotions.
It was made in Philly, my hometown, and having Gabriel Byrne plus Tim Roth probably assured some decent acting, but as luck had it, Pam figured out the mistaken diagnosis before the film was 15 minutes old.
On the plus side, if you don't know anything about the WTO or other cultures, you might find this amusing.
It has some decent gore scenes, but all the characters were very unlikable, and it moved along at a snail's pace, plus the only time it got interesting was the finale, as that was kind of fun to watch.
I bought this at a pawn shop for a $1, as thankfully I didn't spend much money on it, plus The Scarecrow wasn't menacing at all for me, as it was just too weak looking.
It may be worth a watch for Horror fanatics(like myself), but even then I would have trouble recommending it, and it's badly made and written as well, plus Gary Lockwood played his role extremely well as the prick of a Mayor!.
There is one amusing moment, where a couple of drunk guys try to go mess around and pee on the Scarecrow, and things go dead wrong, and I thought the two leads Elizabeth Barondes(Claire) and John Mese(Dillion) hardly had any chemistry together at all, plus as I said the only worthwhile things are the decent gore scenes and the finale.
Elizabeth Barondes and John Mese are mediocre as the leads, and I didn't really care about there characters, they were just there, plus it didn't help that they didn't have very good chemistry together.
TC doesn't start so badly, has an okay cast of "killers" (Austin can't act but he's likable enough, plus Jones is always fun to have) and could have been a fun mindless action film, if it had stuck solely to the action, and if there had been an iota of an effort not to have so much nonsense in it.
POSSIBLE SPOILER: Says three college kids, actually four plus three antagonists trying to scare them.
and we have 4 of their video clips, plus much more!
I Wouldn't own a copy if they gave it to me for free plus paid me to keep it, honestly it is that bad!
The actors from the series are all there, the ones whose characters survived the series anyway, and that is the only plus I can possibly give this movie.
Setting a film in this city is always a plus because you are guaranteed an interesting backdrop.
That, plus an unbearably outdated '60s overtone (and you thought EASY RIDER was outdated!)
The only reason that I stopped short of giving this movie just one star was the presence of Tom Hanks and Eva Marie Saint (plus Hector Elizondo), who can make almost any movie seem really good.
Another plus is Raul Julia's fine performance as Ford's defense attorney.
The film runs only 60 minutes plus the credits but it feels much longer.
On the plus side the eighteen-year old Uma oozes sex appeal and a sleazy sort of glamour which must have attracted Tarantino to her, and there are some gritty, realistic performances, particularly from Buscemi.
I ended up watching the entire series due to a complete lack of anything else worth watching, plus I continued to hold out hope of the series improving.
All the characters are boring,and while it does have some action, none of it is that exciting, plus Steve James looked very bored in this, and i don't blame him!.
David Bradley bored me to tears, as he has no charisma what so ever, and him and James had no chemistry , plus you will be wishing Dudikoff was in this !.
The plot feels very stale, and the main villain was extremely weak, plus the finale was extremely lame.
We get Como and Stewart singing and sort of dancing to "A-hubba, Hubba, Hubba," Blaine, Como and Stewart separately and in various combinations singing "Somebody's Walking in My Dreams," Como fronting the girls with "Red, Hot and Beautiful" and crooning "Here Comes Heaven Again," plus Carmen Miranda rolling her hips and eyes while trilling her r's through "Chico Chico," the big production number.
Still it has held up well, with some nice black and white animation, plus the music is absolutely wonderful here, particularly in the sword fight between Mickey and Pete.
It's also the last time we see the Batman characters in the Fox style before their revamps on the WB network, plus, with the exception of the "Old Wounds" episode, it's Dick Grayson's last adventure as Robin.
The story pretty much follows the storyline of the play, except it is about seals, plus some (I think) pointless scenes with Friar Lawrence and a shark, and the voice acting was on the whole decent.
I think the reason there's no cross-cutting is that there's no content - some lawyer clearly wouldn't let them talk about Moog's battles with the company that bears his name (don't ask me for more detail), and all that's left is a sequence of short arbitrary rambles - still life with Gershon Kingsley, still life with DJ Spooky (who is a pompous ass), Moog picking bell peppers, et cetera, plus some wan recitations of the word 'spirituality.'
On the plus side, it was interesting to see the Moog in production and some of the performance and interview footage, but not all.
On a personal level there is nothing that I enjoyed about Sorority House Massacre, it's full of clichÃ©s, annoying teenage character's, lame death scenes, bad dialogue, situations & happenings that make no sense plus it's extremely slow & boring.
That, however, was not the part of the story that interested him, so we had to have more loving photography of carved dark wood beams and animal-skin rugs, plus a vastly overdrawn love connection between Eowyn and Aragorn.
Her parents got divorce, her sister is marrying the wrong guy, her best friend's boyfriend died and plus her best friend is pregnant.
plus it just was a bad movie.
There's some superb performances in this film from the wonderfully frustrated John Gordon Sinclair as Gregory, plus Dee Hepburn as Dorothy the stunning love interest.
The film also shows all the hilarious vice rackets that existed around 80's schools during lunch breaks, plus the pompous 'cock of the walk' bravado that naturally seems to accompany young men around the fairer sex.
It certainly features game performance by the three male leads, but the real triangle here is that of the gay male hunk, the plus size, clueless fag hag and nebbish gay guy.
Whatever the reason, short of Victoria Wood, Julie Walters and Catherine Tate, the BBC has managed to sign up most of the country's top female comedy talent - plus David Mitchell - for the new comedy series Jam and Jerusalem.
However, there are 3 plus points.
However, they were the ONLY three plus points and thats why the film gets 3 from me.
(not that there's anything wrong with that)   Eye Candy: Kate Fallon & Joan Gerardi get topless; plus more nudity in the extra features   DVD Extras: Commentary Director and crew; 22 minute Behind the scenes featurette; music video; Theatrical trailer; and trailers for 28 other Seduction Cinema titles   My Grade: F
It is double plus inadvisable that one watch this movie under any circumstances.
On the plus side the fly effects were impressive once again.
Stoltz and Richardson are quite good (plus the first film's John Getz makes a welcome return in a cameo role), and there are some effective moments here and there, but this is a totally pointless sequel, one that doesn't even come close to matching the original.
Zombies and voodoo practises form the main background in this forgettable romp of B-movie nonsense by director Jean Yarbrough, who made a slew of B-movie hokum (over 50 films) during the '30s, '40s and early '50s, like THE DEVIL BAT (1940), THE SHE-WOLF OF London (1946), JACK AND THE BEANSTALK(1952), and the more critically acclaimed CRASHING LAS VEGAS (1956)," plus a number of films with Abbot & Costello, like IN SOCIETY (1944) and LOST IN ALSKA (1952).
That's a plus for any film.
Basically, I have no idea what the main story is about, but it's a bit like Harry Potter (since the first movie, everyone begins to imitate J.K. Rowling's success, but nevertheless fails to generate everlasting appeal) and a dot of Winxclub (which seems of plagiarize the former, plus lots more from other original anime preferences), which results in a badly mixed barf bag which older audiences have to consume to imagine its horrible taste (think of one event in Fear Factor where contestants are required to pick up garbage from the road and eat it!).
The movie works rather well and has a rather good cast too, Bruce Campbell is in it too and that is always a plus as he adds a spark near the end of the movie.
On the plus side (and I include a plus side just because it is the right thing to do), it was nice to see Keshia Knight-Pulliam's return to TV and at the same time have a positive holiday movie that the whole family could sit down and enjoy.
A rather inconsistent start, The Cold War is still there, plus the global warning, and maybe the toxic assets.
There are some really creative & spooky sequences and some nice cinematography to offer, plus the great '60s atmosphere was strongly present, brought to life through the costumes, sets, and the vintage score, and providing a perfect backdrop for the story to take place.
On the plus side, Christopher Challis' scope photography is lovely and Howard Blake's score is hauntingly beautiful, but it's all too cosy to hold the interest for an hour and three quarters.
The occasional good moments and the reason why I don't give it an even lower rating happen thanks to the narration and an inspired, brief black-and-white footage from the 60's, the great soundtrack, plus Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro's performances (even though I could never relate to their characters, they fitted them perfectly).
The dialog is laughable,and the action scenes are very tame and awfully uninteresting, plus the characters all sucked!.
I was expecting this to be bad, but not this bad, as this is unquestionably the worst Lundgren film i have ever seen, and i LOVE Lundgren!,plus what was footage of Storm Catcher doing in here?.
The main villains are laughably weak, and there is hardly anything interesting going on at all, plus this has got to be one of the worst Die Hard clone ever!.
Dolph does not even have that much screen time, and he's supposed to be the hero?, and Meilani Paul is extremely annoying as the love interest, plus, this will have you snoozing.
Gallons of fake blood, evil Japanese stereotype, the "soul brother" black guy, it's all there, plus things I've NEVER seen in a kung-fu movie.
In keeping with the Amicus tradition, the film features a handful of not-very-creepy tales, plus a 'comedy' story for light relief, linked by a story-within-a-story - here played out between Price's vampire Eramus (his fangs are retractable when not in use) and horror writer Chetwynd-Hayes himself, played by Carradine.
MY GOD, the BAD acting in this movie, plus the BAD writing, the BAD production values (can you believe one reviewer on this board said, "top notch production values"?
Obligatory hunks prancing around a remote seaside Roman political refugee camp in their diapers and assorted battle garb, these boys have too much time on their hands, so Roman sexual behavior being what it was in those days, there's a fair amount of male-male hanky panky going on plus the main story of the task master guard in(unrequited)love with the Christian pretty boy movie namesake: Sebastiane.
One huge discovery every week, one week the wheel of something, the other the Holy Grail, a couples weeks some ancient lost civilization artifact in Antarctica all that combined with heavily action scenes that seemed to have been taken from Power Rangers plus bad acting, this show sucked a lot.
Yeah right, it would weigh a ton so the horses could not pull it for long, plus the Gatling gun could not be fired while moving.
Your better bets: All of the other movies I named above plus the original with Glen Ford and Van Heflin.
On the plus side, I believe the French will be unveiling a croissant for Robin on their walk of fame.
The Creature wasnt nice does not deserve even one minute of the 90 plus minutes of my life I wasted watching this piece of space waste!!!!!!!!
And not just nothing, 2 plus hours of nothing.
The ending was the only real plus.
On the plus side, the premise has promise--the story is interesting, and there are some nice shots of the woods accompanied by atmospheric music.
The only plus side is that it gave me some of the biggest laughs I have ever experienced whilst watching a film, something akin to inhaling laughing gas - strange for a film which is meant to alert viewers of the desperation of the youth in underprivileged London areas.
Scenes are lifted from Scarface & Lethal Weapon & countless Hollywood flicks while the whole plot plus numerous scenes xeroxed straight from John Woo's classic Hong Kong flick "A Better Tomorrow".
Second, why kill anyone who walks onto the property, that'll make it hard to sell pork, plus where was the sign warning people that "TRESPASSERS WILL BE PROCESSED INTO SAUSAGE."
The major baddie Mali...something was not threatening at all MMPR had more impressive monsters than this rubberized reject but I give it a four because of a hinted romance between Jason and Kimberly I mean who goes out with a girl solo and still be just friends plus they acted a little too friendly around each other flirting and whatnot and were hardly seen without each other and only fraternizing with each other if that doesn't say love I don't know what does.
All in all I can't recommend the book highly enough (plus it's really thin!)
There is some nice gore as well, which is always a plus.
Unfortunately, ten minute plus scenes of overpaid actors watching 70s style monitors in silence does not make for riveting drama.
On the plus side, the acting is OK and the bleak atmosphere well sustained.
Also on the DVD are interviews with Dan Inosanto, the stick and nunchak  exponent, and George Lazenby, plus bios of the other characters in the pagoda.
Lots of short scenes with many edits plus obvious studio cuts against outdoor backdrops.
Nevertheless, the Technicolor cinematography (Calabasas Ranch)is first rate plus production values make up for the drab characters.
Flynn and Smith have some nice scenes plus sing a fun little ditty: Reckon, I'm in love!
A hardcore sex/horror flick from Joe D'amato, Erotic Nights of the Living Dead was made back-to-back with the director's other zombie shagathon Porno Holocaust (released in 1981), and shares much of that film's cast, plus its island location.
However, there are 3 plus points.
However, they were the ONLY three plus points and thats why the film gets 3 from me.
Just like a pie in the face, one laughs, but it's not what one wants to pay $10 for, plus parking, baby-sitter, gas, popcorn, etc.
Nia Peeples was the only reason I watched this (principally) But her usual classy acting was let down by her co-stars (the noticeably and unusual wooden Dan Aykroyd) plus her great figure was mostly hidden by a police uniform!
Many shameless and creepy split-second moments, plus a decently strange ending kept the movie "alive" throughout it's runtime, though it is difficult to ignore the shlocky and convoluted premise and over-used, rambling explanation including dead Native Americans, a soul inhabited tree, and a crazy hunter with some kind of "curse" upon him...
On the plus side Lancaster got to work with former co-stars Alain Delon from The Leopard and with Paul Scofield from The Train, both films considerably better than Scorpio.
The only good thing about it, apart from the scenery pictures, is the Irish accent, and a chance to recognise some people who were in "Michael Collins", plus Lorraine Pilkington ("Monarch of the Glen").
However, as it continues on into it's 2 hour and plus running time... it begins to feel like deja-vu.
Kudos are also in order for the uniformly fine acting from a first-rate cast: Bettany is genuinely riveting and terrifying as the severely driven and psychotic main character, Thewlis likewise impresses as one smooth operator, McDowell makes the most out of one of his best more recent roles, the ravishing Saffron Burrows exudes pure class as Freddie's brassy singer moll Karen, plus there are nice supporting contributions by Kenneth Cranham as the wise Tommy, Jamie Foreman as hot-headed rival hoodlum Lennie Taylor, Eddie Marsan as sniveling toad Eddie Miller, Andrew Lincoln as vicious hit-man Maxie King, and Doug Allen as the brutish Mad John.
The Keaton/Burton combination together with Nicholsons demand that he get a gross percentage of the Merchandise of that plus subsequent sequels was a masterstroke and revived not only WB but his own financial clout.
On the plus side, the actresses playing the baddies were a hoot hamming it up being characters of unremitting egotistical sleazoidness.
and are sometimes a little forced, plus there is a lot of clichÃ©, so the genre of "kitsch" is perfectly fulfilled.
It follows the same guidelines than "American Idol", you know, a host the three stereotypical judges, an obedient crowd for audience, and some entertaining contestants plus many more that are shown only for their humiliation on national TV, that is actually what most of the public seems to dig anyway.
Aside from everything, like Dan Aykroyd's dwindling ability to write a compelling story with good dialog, the ridiculous "say whaaa" parts, and Elwood's complete change in character, what grinds my gears the very most, is the poster, it was advertised "Aykroyd, Goodman: They're back in blue" completely disregarding the existence of the great John Belushi.....  plus the movie sucked major balls if not for the music, and the kid's dance skills, i couldn't watch it....  so very sad, and unfair!
Sixteen year-old Francis Lawrence (Sandra Dee at her most innocent) is the film's title character; girl plus midget equals Gidget.
It starts out with a poor male & female who have three children and the poor man is in trouble seeking out some way to get money for his wife's sickness plus food for his children.
Bill Nighy is a plus point to this film, but still doesnt get enough funny bits to do.
I first bought this movie because i had grown up with Robotech and absolutely loved the Macross-part of it, plus that i love Macross Plus, and I thought that the original could'nt be that bad.
Ruth Sheen was the one bright spot, plus she has a lovely voice.
There's only one plus for this movie.
Actually filmed in Alabama and Tennessee (Cathedral & Cumberland Caverns respectively) this suffers from dreadful acting and screenplay, plus lack of imagination as the 'mystery' unfolds (not to mention numerous continuity & editing errors) An atmosphere of intrigue and ambiguous wonder is created to (almost) good effect at the beginning, with the opening monologue discussing unexplored wonders of the Earth accompanied by eerie music.
Doc Johnson isn't anybody's flunky and Jim Harris would slaughter all the cops on Law and Order and NYPD Blue combined plus pistol whip the CSI crew too.
In adapting Ayckbourn's stage work, he manages the impossible, which is to make the movie look theatrical but not overly bizarre, using subtle, unpretentious tricks: the speaking parts belong solely to the six leading actors (plus Rich's priceless vocal cameo), every single scene takes place indoors (and the locations are always the same), and, most importantly, sequences are linked by a metaphorical snowfall, which gives the film a poetic, almost magical feel.
It was great to see it again after 25 plus years.
On the plus side, the animation is superb, I won't contest that.
Sure, it's not a patch on 48 hours, but it does stand as a perfect example of ne plus ultra 90s sequelitis as tougher, simpler movies are retooled into flash bang gee whizz action paintings with money flushed into entourages and re-doing the same things they did almost a decade earlier on the cheap, only this time they all actually get paid (rather than the studio running off with the money and leaving everyone to wonder why a major success still isn't in profit).
Eddie Murphy is AMAZING as always, and is just plain hilarious,however both of them seemed to be going through the motions at times, still they gave it there all, and they were both great, plus Eddie gets to show off his comedic talent more!
They try anyhow and crash land a bit later, at a rather extreme "flying circus" just as some of them actually were at the time, with flyer's who lived passed their expected time and definitely are ready to die for the glory...  Before they landed, did the spot a HUGE air ship in a cloud and that valuable information, plus the fact that they happen to shoot down a very impressive Gotha Bomber (forgot that part) just before they saw the girls...
SM4 spends a lot of time with The Village, Saw and War of the Worlds - plus a couple of films I only vaguely recognized... blending the plots cleverly but without adding much to the comedic value in the blending technique.
Worse is when, at the end, a bit of voice-over repeats what a character stated less than a minute before hand, showing indeed one of those pesky and annoying horror movie motifs where apparently the director or producer or maybe the studio or something decided that the audience wasn't intelligent enough to get the point (plus, it leads the way to a possible sequel, which is predictable).
Made in 1943 it clearly has a 'propaganda' element to it, ordinary British (plus one American) merchant seamen facing terrible adversity and just getting on with the job.
My family and I have watched this show for 20 plus years for the sheer enjoyment and entertainment value.
And "Pretty in Pink" has all the pathos, plus Ducky.
It is not a "plus".
"A Clockwork Orange" starts out with Alex and his gang of "droogs" sitting in the Kerova milk bar drinking the milk plus... Then the camera starts slowly to move back and we see naked female statues and drink machines which purl out the milk through their breasts...  McDowell is splendid as the star-child Alex...
On the plus side, Tommy Lee Jones gives a tremendous performance, and for the first time I realized just how good of an actress Charlize Theron truly is.
We haven't seen Tommy Lee Jones on the big screen here for a while, so his presence is a major plus point, catching the thespian in action.
The cinematography is also absolutely beautiful, nice and simple static shots plus some pretty locations, such as the beach.
It's set in Hong Kong, and that's often a plus when it comes to fighting movies.
This is an above average Norris film, with a decent plot, and some good fight scenes.Chuck gives a pretty good performance here, and all the fight scenes were great, plus, the finale was awesome!.
The setting was cool, and i really liked the aggressiveness Chuck had in this one plus, the 2 main villains were great!.
The character development is actually quite decent, and i liked most of the characters, plus Chuck was at his best here!.
Such easy to understand and digest TV shows around at the same time like MURDER SHE WROTE and MATLOCK were designed to appeal to similar tastes, but with BURKE'S LAW you had to have a more fine tuned appreciation of wit, well timed sarcasm and style plus a tongue in cheek sense of humor to fully appreciate the gifts and sheer force of personality and presence that Gene Barry brought to the screen in his role and to enjoy the campy proceedings at hand.
The European horror style is a major plus factor in my opinion, and should please fans of movies from the sixties and seventies.
All The characters are wonderful, and the story was pretty cool, plus Patrick Swayze is simply amazing in this!.
Liam Neeson and Patrick Swazye shared an excellent bond as brothers and had fantastic chemistry together, and i thought Adam Baldwin, was wonderful as the main villain, plus the finale was quite exciting!.
Most of the critics panned this, and i can't see why, it's got plenty of action, suspense, and fantastic performances, plus i thought Swayze's acting was fantastic!.
The fight between Neeson and Swayze at the bar was very realistic and tense, and this features Ben Stiller in a very different and early role!, plus The ending was very surprising in my opinion!.
Sure it may not be exactly original, but i really enjoyed as you care for the main characters,and root for them, plus it has quite a few powerful and shocking moments as well!.
Well that is what they did plus help in finding and killing the people responsible for killing Truman's brother.
How lame is that, plus is Drake suppose to be one of the seven monks, because they never said.
"The House of Usher" is called "the modern re-telling of Edgar Allen Poe's story from a female perspective".Yeah right,and I'm an alien invader from Pluto.First of all,the film fails as a thriller as it's extremely boring and lacks tension.Like so many earlier adaptations of Poe's work,this latest interpretation bears little resemblance to the source material.The cast is pretty terrible,albeit it's nice to see Polish beauty Izabella Miko in the main role.On the plus side the cinematography is great and the last 15 minutes are actually quite interesting to say the least.It's a shame that the rest of the film is so painfully dull.If you want a proper Poe's adaptations rent or buy a couple of Roger Corman's flicks.3 out of 10.
Now it just takes some elements from 'The Isle,' adds some painfully obvious and overdone symbolism plus some magical realism at the end that makes me think that Kim Ki-Duk is having a laugh at my expense.
The proof of this is that, despite it's brief length being a plus for modern readers turned off by 800 - 900 page novels, more people know Dickens for "Copperfield" or "Pickwick" or "Oliver Twist" than are aware of "Hard Times".
And this is the big plus of this movie: The twists all work.
On the plus sides, Seagal does his own "fight" scenes, but they're just sad now.
The only other plus is the beautiful scenery.
I guess when you have 40 plus film credits under your belt and have worked under Peter Weir, Russell Burton, Chris Noonan and John Duigan among others you tend to pick up a thing or two!
The women of John Shaft are the educated and beautiful Aleme, (Vonetta McGee) plus the alluring and one track minded Jazar, (Yugoslavian actress Neda Arneric).
Hey, there are lot of other reviews of bad and cheesy movies (plus a lot of good movies) on my website, Cinema de Merde, which you can find through the URL in my email address.
Christopher Lee does his usual great work and Nastassja Kinski brings just the right note of naive innocence to her role (plus you've got to love a movie that has full frontal Kinski nudity!!!!)
The stellar supporting cast qualifies as another substantial plus: Denholm Elliott as a wormy, wayward weakling member of the evil cult, Honor Blackman as Verney's spunky agent Anna Fountain, and Anthony Valentine as Anna's suave boyfriend David.
Adventurous, beautiful scenery, good acting, good characters, based on true story, unusual spiritual elements, emotional and action plus a good eco message leaving you wishing the whole world would watch it.
The movie and its story is kept fairly simple and because of that the movie also feels very straight-forward, which definitely is a plus for these type of movies.
There is a feeling of dread throughout the film that is well maintained, and that's a big plus.
On the TV movie's plus side: Those actors who can actually act -- mainly the older ones -- do a fine job.
Bringing in the sons of those three musketeers, then their fathers plus D'Artagnan himself, gives a nice glow to the story.
One problem can be the action plus horror content of the movie.
The plus is perhaps some outstanding effects work by Koichi Kawakita, for the time; some mesmerizing cloud chamber work, and nice miniature ships,planet scapes and matte and optical work.
Also making Sharpe's life a misery is the inexperienced and arrogant Lord Keily himself, who's attitude towards Sharpe and his own men, plus his open affair with a sensual female guerrilla fighter by the name of Juanita, pushes Sharpe to the brink of his patience especially as this affair is embarrassing, and emotionally crippling the beautiful and busty Lady Keily who is also in camp.
On the plus side though, asides from how it was filmed and the good plot and script, we are also treated to a first-rate cast.
The production values are pretty good, the English dubbing is tolerable and the acting (particularly the two male leads) is competent, if not excellent, throughout, plus there are even a couple of black comic suspense scenes worthy of Hitchcock, particularly one with some neighborhood bullies playing keep-away with Marcos' bag.
About my only beef is the occasional clumsy camera & editing work that makes this film a wee bit of a challenge (the camera seems to be everywhere it's not supposed to be more than a few times,plus the framing seems to be way off,giving the film a rather clumsy,home movie look, such as 'Ziggy Stardust & The Spiders From Mars',which was marred by bad camera & editing work).
So as a matter of fact, the legend about Ferrari plus racing driver, the engine noise and the gear change sounds are all fake - and pretty much "trucage", indeed.
As an added plus the disc I got also showed the original commercials and opening promo.
Mac says he needs 'a big job' & Gladys tells him about a plan she has to steal half a million dollars in takings from the 80,000 plus seater Colleseum football stadium during the match between the Los Angeles Rams & the Green Bay Packers, the match has no advance ticket sales so every seat has to be paid for in cash on the day at the gate.
Here we have the splendid Pamela Franklin (The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie) and Mark Lester(Oliver in Carol Reed's Oliver) plus a sterling performance by Dirk Bogarde.
Music is a plus if you like Christmas carols jazzed up a little.
I saw Jan in "Buster and Billy" and he kicked the crap iota two dudes and than smashed their skulls in with a cue ball, plus he killed Charles Bronson in "The Mechanic" (with a chase scene that must have inspired the DeNiro flick "Ronin"), so Jan Michael was not to be trifled with at that time, no way.
It is also very mature and very graphic at times, plus twisted as heck.
i wanted to watch it for the big cast in it plus the directors.
The end-titles gave me a pleasant surprise,because the editor and assistant-director of Woodstock is the greatest director in my view: Martin Scorsese.This gives the directory an extra plus if it ever needed any.
The film is not gated correctly and 1/3rd of the image is cut off, plus there is no soundtrack.
The title cards are in Chinese and English, and many have decorative backgrounds, always a plus for me when I watch silent films.
Bearing all this in mind, plus the fact that "Mulberry Street" actually shows the courage and ambition to be a different and largely atmosphere-driven new horror film, I'd say it at least deserves the respect and appreciation of avid horror fanatics and amateur filmmakers all over the world.
Apparently 2 plus 2 does sometimes equal 5.
It's divided into two parts - Fiction, with its heavy sexual, presumably-racist and ironic elements, a searing affair that many people seem to have found offensive without getting the underlying satire, and then there's Non-Fiction; amazing how much spot-on societal jabs T. S. squeezes into this one, and plus it has another great, multi-layered performance from Paul Giamatti, always a major selling point of any film, for me.
All accusations one might level against Solondz (namely: bad taste, plus every "ism" in the book) get made by the fellow students, who detest the story.
A plus was seeing Joan Chen in a small role as Mrs. Yee.
Although these scenes were somewhat important to the plot, somehow manages to pad out the film beyond it's two & a half hour,plus time block.
The director, who is a very good director, as he showed in his last film "La gente de la Universal", decide to show of his 12 plus years of producing TV commercials in detriment of any sort of narrative criteria.
The interviews are also revealing 'we grew up with them, they belong to us' etc, plus the hilarious 'you don't get much for free these days' makes you realise just how human this band actually was.
They don't explain anything, if I hadn't watched the Anthology Doc I wouldn't even have a clue why the hell they're in this big film studio, plus, I don't think John Lennon says more then three words in the whole film (Paul never seem to shut up though).
I seem to recall that James Burroughs directed the premiere episode of "Bram and Alice", the only one I saw; Mr. Burroughs' guidance plus the excellent cast made it memorable.
There are clues a plenty; both were based on well-loved reminiscences masquerading as short stories - by Sally Benson and Booth Tarkington respectively; both featured charming (but with a touch of the 'cutes') American families; both were set in the Mid-West, Missouri and Indiana respectively; both featured Leon Ames as Banker patriarch; in both stories the girl of the family falls for the Boy Next Door (who, this time around has relocated to the Boy Across The Street); both families boasted an outspoken maid in the respective shapes of Marjorie Main and Mary Wickes plus a youngest member (Margaret O'Brien, Billy Gray) whose tall stories result in misunderstandings that lead to physical assault.
She was a PERFECT choice: her innocent face matched her character's shallowness and stupidity very well, plus a very sexy woman.
Now SOME films with these qualities work (such as MY GIRL Friday or BRINGING UP BABY), but this one does not because the script is poor plus Miss DeHavilland is cast in one of her worst roles ever.
Gable tries to save what can be saved, but Powell is so hopelessly uncharismatic and uninteresting - plus his role is an even more thankless one than that of the others - so he doesn't do the movie any good, which is nothing new.
That was the only plus in this movie.
Only plus was the Valhalla-gang that made me think a little on the tracks of Guy Ritchie.
The set is also a big plus.
The script does not lose anything in the 70 plus years since its release.
plus it will leave you in stitches from laughing so hard.
In regard to substance abuse, Ray pretty much limits himself to a refrigerator full of beer, plus dinner wine and the occasional bottle of whiskey (contributing to the delinquency of a minor through promoting under-aged drinking with his 11th-grader surrogate son Dave Tibbel, played by Trevor Morgan), while The Ram seems to keep his life in shambles through over-medicating himself with every drug known to mankind.
There were one or two scenes that dragged bit - the first guy that was killed in the forest plus why didn't he say anything?
That theme itself is another plus for LEM.
And all decorated it, in addition and to top it all, with a strange and distant language in a depressing attempt to even degrade plus the Spanish as tribute to the master who pays.
This movie is like any sketch extracted from Lente loco or any other TV show made by latin people in the spanish spoken networks in the USA -if you've ever had the misfortune of tuning in any, then you'll know what I mean-, but, an hour and plus long.
During her Cincinnati concert in fall of 2004, I was blown away by the juiciness of her guitarin', vibin', and singing plus the band was superb to boot.
Frost's blunt, no-nonsense direction, the eerie, ethereal score set to a pounding pseudo-disco beat (said score also boasts a haunting recurrent whistled theme), the flat, unpolished cinematography which adroitly captures the plain, plodding rhythms of mundane everyday life, the authentically lurid L.A. locations, several jarring visualizations of Carns' savage power trip fantasies, the mean, hard-hitting dialogue, the frequently quite startling all-out nasty rough sex tableaux, and the unusually strong and credible acting from a mostly no-name cast (the sole familiar faces are skinflick starlets Rene Bond and Uschi Digard as massage parlor girls, plus longtime Frost collaborator Wes Bishop as a detective and legendary exploitation producer Bob Cresse as the massage parlor owner) are all uniformly tops.
deaf actors in the movie world nowadays....   Also, it's a bigger plus when you consider the directional approach chosen for this film -- it's an appreciative success.
On the plus side, Jessica Lange gets it right because she's as camp as a row of pink tents playing the MIL from Hell with a weird fixation on her cute-but-dim offspring.
and that's what janggeum is.. it's just a plus that she's really pretty and has a good heart etc.
