James Cagney was a villain of Hollywood by shark eyes and voice to send for audience the core of badness and evil characters as his profile in cinema.The producer choose previously Ava Gardener to be the hero of this film in-front Cagney but Cagney refused this choose because he said that Gardner not familiar with his role and he cheesed Day in it because of her fantastic abilities between singing and acting and she succeeded in it with Cagney.
Her apathy is something unimaginable in Day previously, a weary cynicism expertly underplayed.
Back comes the previously fat and unattractive Goldie but instead, she is thin and looks even younger than she looked decades ago!
I am not sure if I saw him in anything else, previously, but this movie left me wanting to see him in everything he has/had ever done.
Mitchum appreciates Young and strikes up a friendship with her, which piques Holden's curiosity over this woman he's previously overlooked.
While the violence depicted in the film is no doubt accurate, what the film does not reveal is that the Iroquois likely became decidedly more hostile when the French began to assist old enemies, such as the Algonquin, in traveling into hunting grounds that had previously been Iroquois territory.
Relationships are always more complicated than the participants understand and, as is the case here, a traumatic event can unleash emotions and thoughts previously unexplored.

Interesting to see his daughter Allison at such a young age, as previously the only thing i ever saw her in was "Midnight in the Garden of Good an Evil", which he put together around a set of Johnny Mercer songs.
Anyway, I wonder if it was previously rated x in the very late 70's because the thing came out in 81.
Scarface (in the 80's) was previously rated x go to mpaa.org and see for yourself.
Watch some of the Indians' body movements, and the way the camera lingers over some of their dead bodies - characters previously introduced sympathetically.
The Awful Truth began life as a stage play in the early 20s, and was then adapted to film twice previously in 1925 & 1929, but here for the 1937 version, director Leo McCarey {academy award winner Best Director} improves the story big time with sharp witty dialogue and an appreciative knack for letting his actors improvise at free will in the name of comedy.
For example, when the "kopps" accidentally blow up the previously mentioned snack bar, Benny's first reaction is "Oh sh*t!
But having only seen David Wenham previously as Faramir in The Lord of the Rings, in drag as Audrey in Moulin Rouge and as the dubious Carl in Van Helsing ( a movie of quite excruciating badness), it was rather disconcerting to hear his real accent.
Secret Service agent Thomas Barnes(Dennis Quaid),previously wounded taking a bullet for the president, back on duty quickly takes a look at a tourist's(Forest Whitaker)camcorder thinking the shooter can be identified.
he risks his life for a little girl who he previously had bumped into and keeps her out of harms way to find her mother after an explosion, these events magnify the events going on in his own life(battle with his wife) and make them actually seem much smaller when he thinks about it...good addition to the movie the whole subplot with the one guys brother being kidnapped has nothing to do with the movie.
The acting is uniformly excellent, especially that of Dennis Quaid, who I had previously considered a mostly comic actor, but is very convincing here as a Secret Service agent.
Somehow I had previously missed the generation gap truism: "If you're not liberal when you're under 30, you have no heart.
A new family move into "the house" where a girl had previously gone mad.
Sheen even recalls previously reading about the Senator's loss, missing at sea, in 1941.
There's a small bit of derisive laughter as the crew (during the LONG period in which they are coming to accept that they have traveled back in time) compare a photo that was apparently taken an hour ago by one of their planes to a photo that was taken 40 years previously by another plane.
When they arrive, they meet the older Zippo (Steve Le Marquand), and they have the sensation of DÃ©jÃ  vu with weird events, feeling that they had previously been in that place.
The Lost Princess is Mr. Pace's first feature length film (he previously directed the short film The Tale of El Gusano)and he has given viewers a work that will keep them on the edges of their seats.
They had previously lived on the island of Roan Inish, but are now living on the mainland.
As someone said previously, if you're feeling down, watch it, I guarantee you won't be for long!
While watching this movie, pay attention to all the scenes that relate to things previously said, watch the circle close itself.
Character designs are fabulous and original, though their animated versions remind me Belleville Rendez-Vous (The Triplets of Belleville in the US), released three years previously.
Perhaps Thayer David was the best Nero but he did only one  installment before his untimely death (Perhaps a result of the  previously mentioned physical requirements for the part.).
The crash site was what I really wanted to see portrayed, as this hasn't been recreated previously on film (well, that's even mildly believable) and (if also based on fact) proved to be, the SMOKING GUN.
Sabrina was the only Angel that was previously married.
However, he is soon relying on his companion to rescue him, after he is captured by a former partner John (Jack Palance) - who he had previously betrayed some years ago to save his own skin.
Inspector Maigret is celebrated French pulp writer Georges Simenon's most famous literary creation and had previously been portrayed on the screen by Pierre Renoir in one of his brother Jean's most elusive films, NIGHT AT THE CROSSROADS (1932), and also by the great Charles Laughton in Burgess Meredith's intriguing directorial outing, THE MAN IN THE EIFFEL TOWER (1950) - neither of which I've watched alas - and would go on to be impersonated by a variety of formidable character actors among them Rupert Davies, Gino Cervi and Michael Gambon for TV!
Nathan originally seems eccentric but vivacious and likable, but as the film progresses he begins to show signs of disturbance, insulting Stingo whom he has previously treated as a friend, and unreasonably suspecting Sophie of being unfaithful to him.
Although there was some conflict about whom should have rightfully received credit for this song "back in the day" (I will not reveal too much),-the fact that the writer was Jewish and the singer African American helps us to understand the sensitivity of the lyrics themselves as the story unfolds a rich -if previously unspoken-tapestry of the American Soul- revealed to us via one of the greatest of all American contributions-jazz music!!!
It has been previously been noted, quite accurately, that Doug Aldrich is given the lion's share of solos in this lineup.
Lethargic comedy, previously filmed in 1929 with Norma Shearer, does have one plot twist, though many viewers may tire and tune out by the time it is revealed.
When I first set out to try and use film to help me with learning French, it was a completely uncharted territory except for one title I had heard of previously: La Femme Nikita.
It is no mistake that the virgin's sexual release in orgasm by cunnilingus is accompanied by a montage of scenes that she'd/we'd previously witnessed.
Even those films other than those previously mentioned 2 Reelers starring Messers Howard, Fine & Howard; we saw some really outstanding film.
Allegedly, he spent the last two decades of his life haunting libraries -- the same archives he'd previously scoured for materials -- pathetically re-reading old newspaper accounts of his past glories.
It's old ground of course for all of them, Preminger and Tierney had teamed up in "Laura" and, with Hecht were to do so again in the soon-come "Where the Sidewalk Ends" while Hecht had previously turned psychoanalysis to thrilling effect in Hitchcock's "Spellbound".
Using many of his established 'Brass Eye' characters, such as, Ted Maul and others, Morris shows just how much the media over blow every little thing about a subject that they themselves created and built up, and the result is as funny, if not funnier, than anything Morris has done previously.
*** Rich amateur chess player murdered six months previously, at the time to the utter bafflement of the police - Charlie has less than two days to research the case and solve it.
And now, in 2006, I find the webpage, and it contains more EMMANUELLE movies than I previously thought.
The film ends with a beautiful but ambiguous shot of Claire alone, walking towards the ferris wheel that she and Laurent rode together previously in the film.
Of course Adam & Evil is far from perfect, it's very unoriginal & the basic idea has been done to death & if the motive for the killer was revenge why did they kill the woman at the diner, the Sheriff & Maureen none of who had nothing to do with what happened previously?
They possess more secret herbs that make Sandra Bullock want to make nice-nice for hours with the reporter (whom she had previously detested).
Yes, if you thought that you had previously viewed timber-like performances, these two will leave you convinced that they studied drama in the Amazon forest under the tuition of an ageing group of trees.
Recap: A military outpost from earth are attacked without warning by a mysterious and previously unknown enemy.
Having previously been a con man, he has along with the amnesia experienced a total personality change.
Having only been previously exposed to Albert Pyun's 90s-era direct-to-video low-budget action garbage, I picked up "Radioactive Dream" expecting a futuristic crapfest like "Nemesis" or "Omega Doom".
In the true spirit of Full Moon Entertainment who previously did the Puppet Master series come Blooddolls!
Directed by Tibor Takacs I was pleasantly surprised by just how good I, Madman was, I'd never previously heard of it but I think I've uncovered a bit of a hidden gem.
This got lambasted by liberal film critics when it came out, of course, just as Dirty Harry had three years previously, but what's interesting about it today is how low-key the attacks on liberal values are, and in fact the film really doesn't go after anything except on-the-street violence.
Where Rebecca is mature and all, she's waiting for Enid to move into an apartment with her and get a job but Enid is far too busy with her nerdy record collecting friend Seymour who she previously stood up for as a joke.
As we saw previously in the film, an old senile man waits at the bus stop for a bus that doesn't come by anymore.

A truly indie film, with the kind of quirky, un-Hollywood story that typified everything I had previously grown to love about self produced films.
Like I said previously, Explorers is a film that holds up extremely well even as an adult, it's creative exciting and gives the kids a personality beyond what is often seen in the media.
One has to have lived in a Socialist country (as I did) to fully understand the situation of the Georgian people (or any other country previously ruled by a Socialist regime.)
They are both delightful in this stylish slapstick farce that had previously been filmed as *The Front Page* (and later, again as *The Front Page* in 1974, and as *Switching Channels*).
However, as I have previously stated, the film is not merely a period piece because the themes involved are timeless.
The most striking moment comes when the most focused-upon couple, who've previously experienced sexual problems, talk to each other after a bout of now satisfying sex and tell each other that they are now "real" - two less "real" people you'll have trouble finding in the history of the cinema.
Like I mentioned previously, the logic behind what certain characters did were absent and contributed to the incoherence of the plot.
Spencer Williams, however, is on the good side this time as Blake's ranch-hand boss and previously female lead Artie Young is just a picture here until the last 10 min.
You'll only enjoy it if your previously warned of how bad it is and you are ready for it.
Ratliff previously made a documentary about fundamentalist Christians, and the grandma's attempt to "save" Joshua becomes a realistically creepy element.
Rather I would like to claim that it gives just an impression of the life Turkish religious orders, society and the mind of a devout religious man who previously led a uncritical life without real challenges and without deep thoughts about practical life and religion.
Aside from my reevaluation of this previously disturbing aspect of the storyline, I found the portrayal of the political intrigues at the Vatican and among the prominent Italian families to be far more interesting subsequent to having traveled to some of the locales depicted.
I looked up the different screen adaptations of it, and found that Colin Firth had starred in one (I previously enjoyed him in "Bridget Jones's Diary" - which is, in fact, a semi-remake of Austen's tale - and "Love Actually").
The creatures, as hinted at previously, lack even the sophistication of, in reference to the B-movie classics of the 1950s, lizards with prosthetic armaments attached to their bodies.
Claire does open the profession for women, but it costs Billy Crudup his job and he's reduced to playing in bawdier unlicensed sort of entertainment, the kind Claire had been doing previously.
As previously referred to, the acting is exceptional, especially the two leads (Danes and Crudup) who shine.
That master player of light, witty material, Grant, is of course sublime, and I was surprised by Irene Dunne - who I had never previously seen in a lead film role.
And, last but not least, Palillo's Matt, despite what he had previously seen when alone in Lucus' ghost town, decides to convince his pals to return there.
I rated it 7, partly because there were some concepts I had not seen in movies previously.
He shows the ability to tell a story confidently and has no problems in going back and forward in time while he is unfolding the love story of the 2 main characters.He also has an technical ability not forgetting any detail showed previously in the film.
This doesn't always guarantee a great movie, mind you, as Franco and Lee previously collaborated to make a couple of sequels in the Fu Manchu series, and they were dreadfully boring films.
Astonishingly, this scratchy print, a remarkable historical document, is the only one in existence, and this is its first theatrical screening (it has been seen at various film festivals previously).
In the end the workers reignite some of the oil wells they previously extinguished.
As rumors of nomination begin to surround the rest of the cast, rivalry and obsession dominate the set, inflating the egos of the previously unemployed actors.
While for the first 90 minutes it's a film that equates boredom with realism, walking with paranoia and monosyllabic scripting with profundity, for the last couple of reels we get a half-hearted car chase, an impressive car crash (that leads to a moment of utter absurdity as a third viewing of the scene suddenly reveals a previously invisible survivor running across a motorway in plain sight), silly disguises, unarmed combat with a lesbian CIA hitwoman and the obligatory symbolic falling off a building dream scene as it ticks off the genre staples to throw in enough action to put together a decent trailer (certainly a parachute jump and the opening CGi cosmic zoom from the dark side of the Moon to close-up on a ferry with an unfortunately ridiculous sense of scale seem designed more for marketing than narrative purposes).
As mentioned previously, select movements and dances from Tchaikovsky's immortal score can be heard, but the majority of the music mostly consists of Tchaikovsky-inspired compositions as well as some rather trippy 70's techno-rock synthesizers.
Ring O Birthday is a great prequel to the Ring series although the director is not Nakata it is a good drawback to the previously made movies.
Having seen his first feature Hukkle previously, it is clear that PÃ¡lfi pays great attention to detail, and perhaps places the greatest importance on sound design.
Though I had enjoyed the Harold Lloyd features that I'd seen previously, somehow I expected 'Girl Shy (1924)' to be a rather tame slapstick comedy.
The film was the first to be produced under Lloyd's newly-founded production company, The Harold Lloyd Corporation, but both Fred C. Newmeyer and Sam Taylor {who had previously collaborated to direct the legendary 'Safety Last!
BY the time the Marxian Laugh Express had arrived at THE BIG STORE, the team had done a total of 10 movies: 5 at Paramount, 4 at MGM and their solo shot with a previously written play with ROOM SERVICE (RKO Radio Pictures, 1938).
The story circles around a lifelike doll that previously happened to be the girlfriend of a paranoid doll-maker, who killed her after she threatened to leave him.
There was decent acting, a good story, and as previously mentioned, although a bit far fetched, it made for good watching.
In creating such an invigorating visual world, as previously mentioned, Spielberg's vision is very similar to A.I.
This film is not about product placement as previously suggested, it is simply a entertaining and yet realistic glimpse of what our future may look like, as advertising becomes more advanced and intrusive.
I picked it up previously viewed and popped it in and... blah.
The vivid animation and fluid movement in the original two years previously seems to be a world away from The Return of Jafar's clumsy and simple production.
She experiences an existential dilemma much like her famous Italian films and tries to regain a sense of self through the antics I previously mentioned and more.
That master player of light, witty material, Grant, is of course sublime, and I was surprised by Irene Dunne - who I had never previously seen in a lead film role.
The script is, as I previously said, insanely dramatic (and sometimes the lines aren't delivered well - bad acting) and sometimes it got very funny as it just seemed really pathetic.
The first film as I said previously in the review was much less of a horror film as it was an amazing thriller/mystery.
The director has explored this topic previously in films such as The Unfaithful Wife and Wedding in Blood (among others), but Pleasure Party stands out because it's an overall much darker tale than what went before, and may well be a contender for Chabrol's all time darkest film.
The girlfriend of Takayama tries to solve the mystery of his death by finding his ex-wife and son, and bringing herself deeper into Sadako's life than anyone previously had.
Unlike in "The Bees", ZacarÃ­as really attempts this time to create an interesting horror piece, and while he unashamedly lifts some ideas from Oliver Stone's "The Hand" (released previously that same year), it could be said that he succeeds in making a somewhat original tale of horror.
Marin, age 33, previously had helmed only one movie on his own, a low budget item entitled THE DEATH KISS (1932).
A superb Adrien Brody steals the show as the emotionally unstable soon to be father Pete, demonstrating both previously unseen comedic abilities, and genuinely affecting emotional clout.
I also want to say I didn't know that much about Elizabeth Harnois previously.
I bought this movie, Leo, three years ago in the "previously viewed" section of a ubiquitous movie rental company.
When he can't persuade a woman with whom he had an affair a year previously to come with him on his trip, he takes in her place an American woman (played by Hawn) who happens to be staying with the first woman.
The plot suddenly became far too serious compared to the outrageous antics that were on show previously.
With such a strong cast and production crew, the show attained a peak of perfection unseen in British comedy for years previously - and some would say, not since.
As noted previously, this is definitely "inspired" by 'Last House On The Left" but the tone is totally different.
I know there are those who champion The Idiot and No Regrets for Our Youth, and even the one film I had previously seen from the set, I Live in Fear, is quite good (though it's hard to argue with it being a lesser film is such an outstanding oeuvre).
This is recommended to fans of animation firstly, also to lovers of track and field events (they're all there) and to any fans of the previously mentioned artists (Crystal, Shearer, Gouldman).
I'd previously enjoyed watching CHIPS, T J Hooker and COPS.
Fitzgerald called this version "the director's cut" since his Canadian distributor previously showed a much different version which cut several scenes, and jumbled the stories together.
Loving the attention and surprised at her disappearing inhibitions, she had an epiphany - the woman who previously felt she had no talents, realized that she did have one undeniable skill - she could "f*** great".
Corr, previously seen in The Commitments and Evita, the Madonna vehicle in which she was criminally allowed only one line of what should have been her character's own song, has her sights set on an acting career and the evidence on display here leads one to suspect she'll be most successful.
While we have previously seen Audrey Tautou playing a Turkish chambermaid in Stephen Frear's Dirty Pretty Things, we now see another critically acclaimed French actress playing the role of Bosnian Muslim immigrant.
Four gay men go out in West Hollywood on Halloween night to have a good time, unaware that the previously mentioned psycho slasher has his eye on them.
Willis O'Brien (who had produced many short animated subjects previously) was the primary resource behind Lost World: without his expertise and participation, the movie would likely never have been completed, or even considered.
I found this movie mesmerizing, both due to the lead performance and the depiction of a time and place previously unfamiliar to me.
The story, as I previously mentioned, is limited to a short period before the raise of Madame SatÃ£ to the scenario of Rio de Janeiro and is very realistic, inclusive showing the homosexual activity of JoÃ£o Francisco.
Helene too bears scars from the past, apparently dating back to a relationship ten years previously which ended badly, the trauma forestalling any further emotional entanglements.
An absolute gem for all of us action movies junkies - the kinda flick that makes up for the twenty or so dog piles you've gone through previously.
But no, the producers go and get a director who never made a good film previously to this stint on the resurrected Get Carter (and think of a living dead sort-of resurrection), Stephen T. Kay.
I've not previously been very interested in DeMille's career beyond his importance to Hollywood and film history, but this movie made it clear that he is an expert craftsman and artist.
They worked previously on five films: Red Sorghum, Ju Dou, Raise the Red Lantern, The Story of Qui Ju and To Live.
Another bold frontier for the series (previously explored, but less interestingly, in Squire of Gothos) was crossed as Tomorrow is Yesterday established the show's sense of humor by - characteristically - poking fun at its own historical context.
These concepts, which previously appeared in "The Million Eyes of Sumuru," sound terrific, but, despite some intriguing set design & visuals, it follows the same campy atmosphere of, for example, the very dated "Some Girls Do," which came out around the same time and which also featured a female army.
The direction was often dizzying: The previously mentioned shot (and there were more than a few others) that seemed to go on forever; the shots looking down on the distant lobby far below, in all its deco glory.
The first point that called my attention was the constellation of the stars sharing lead roles: none of the previously mentioned character has less importance in the story.
Even so, about half of this early section Â involving a group of archaeologists who climb a previously irreproachable mountain after stumbling upon relics belonging to a legendary 'lost' civilization Â is, amusingly, comprised of stock footage (some of it, apparently, from the celebrated German Silent 'mountain picture' THE WHITE HELL OF PITZ PALU [1929])!
I came across this version on DVD not having been previously aware of its existence; before this I favoured the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke version made ten years later as definitive.
She also interviewed a scientist, previously employed by the vinyl industry, who agreed with the contention that, yes, PVC is a potential toxin.
In honor of today being Election Day and having previously seen both Betty Boop for President and Olive Oyl for President, I just went to the Misce-Looney-ous site to watch Daffy Duck for President which it linked from YouTube.
Originally storyboarded by Chuck Jones and turned into a book before his untimely death, this latter-day Warner Bros. cartoon was another entertaining lesson on American customs which Jones had previously done with Porky Pig on Old Glory back in 1939.
Anyway, he brought his shades into school and they were all super-glued b/c he had previously broken them.
As stated previously, Jason Isaacs was this movie's ONLY saving grace, and unfortunately even with him in it, I cannot really recommend this movie.
The history is based on real deeds, it's adapted from an autobiographical best-selling book about a French burglar named Henri Charriere and Dalton Trumbo(previously prohibited for the Black List and he's cast as the Commandant) and Lorenzo Semple Jr are the screenwriters .
Referring to it as a blog isn't originally my idea, though, as roberttroll previously reviewed this film and his observation seemed right on the mark.
Another biologist, previously working on a secret government project, is being protected by a detective who is forced to battle the transparent assassin while the government tries to track him down.
Now that his children are older, he can return to his former hobbies previously restrained by raising his two children.
The ending disappoints in that it introduces an outside element to this previously enclosed world, and the ending can't resolve the movie's basic dilemma: how can it be both the story of a civilization's decline and also the story of a man's personal triumph.
As I've previously said the acting in the movie really caught me off guard.
Even without the publicity or the previously cut scenes (now restored in many versions) Eastman is convincing and works well.
This is the film where Tucci, previously stuck playing sleazyball creeps, reinvented his career.
Ryan Phillippe, who was previously best known to this viewer as the boy-toy of "Gosford Park," acquits himself admirably in the role of "Doc" Bradley, although the acting honors arguably go to Adam Beach as Ira Hayes, the American Indian who wrestles with guilt and alcoholism after his unwilling rise from obscurity to national hero.
"Pushover" was the introductory film for legendary Hollywood actress Kim Novak, who had previously only been on screen for a few seconds between two separate movies.
I can't remember any of their names, and some would disappear for long lengths of time and then die quickly (after having about 5 minutes screen time total previously).
and subtle plot devices which were previously overlooked.
Whilst '100 Girls' does have a far better know cast, I find that it was more enjoyable to see a movie where you didn't associate the female cast with movies they'd previously done.
Before dying, the last thing he did was look at this picture of his wife, whom we are previously informed is the love of his life.
Thankfully the Essanay shorts began, most notably from "The Tramp" on, to develop Chaplin's character as a more sympathetic and socially relevant persona; the seeds of which can be seen here, with a more likable take than Chaplin had previously indulged in.
Lourie (who had previously directed Beast From 20,000 Fathoms) attempted to repeat that success with Behemoth, this time not only directing, but screenwriting as well.
His brother Llyr appears with him here, the lesser-experienced brother that had previously only appeared in Ymadawiad Arthur and has made no further films to date.
Writer, Producer and Star John Fallon (aka the one and only Arrow In The Head of the eponymous highly respected horror movie site) had previously stated that his intention (along with co-writer and Director Christian Viel) was to, ahem, deaden his disappointment at the 2004 remake of The Punisher, which for all its' good intentions and impressive visuals still pulled its punches where it counted, and create his own vision.
Based on the James Ellroy novel "Blood on the Moon", James Woods is LAPD detective Lloyd Hopkins who discovers the terribly mutilated corpse of a young woman and immediately starts comparing the scene with previously unsolved murders.
Tightly written and directed by James B. Harris (who previously worked with Woods on the outstanding prison movie "Fast-Walking"), with crisp cinematography by Steve Dubin, a harsh, gritty tone, unflinchingly raw and profane dialogue, a jazzy, shivery score by Michel Colombier, a tense and exciting climactic showdown between Hopkins and the killer, some seriously ugly violence (the murder sites are truly nasty), and a shockingly brutal and nihilistic ending, this bang-up little sleeper makes for an extremely gripping and suspenseful viewing experience.
This film actually approaches a sort of implied interactivity, a new perspective for the viewer in a time based medium to the proverbial backbone of the narrative that I've not previously seen, at moments both inside the story and as well a voyeur to the story.
Now, about the ending which I previously found so cynical.
The plot rarely matched up with anything else that had previously happened in the show, and that's what made it great.
The acting is OK, the camera work is OK, the continuity leaves a lot to be desired as previously mentioned, the story is painfully predicable (spoiler alert, watch the opening menu long enough and you know he races)...
I'm sure there will be enough interest generated by Zac Efron's celebrity to get the film seen, but any serious rider, as others have previously posted, will find the premise and execution weak.
The inspiration for this film comes from the fertile imagination of Ben Hecht best known previously for co-authoring another newspaper classic, The Front Page.
This was truly a groundbreaking film, not only for its director, David Cronenberg, who had previously only done "underground" films, but it paved the way for the future of the horror genre in Canada.
Piper used brilliant clay-mation effects in the two previously stated films but here, I'm certain it has a lot to do with Shock-o-Rama Cinema, none of the fun and creative effects are prevalent.
Jacques Audiard, who previously gave us the very interesting Read My Lips (2001) and the cute and clever Venus Beauty Institute (1999), manages to create here a story about a character who is both a petty gangster and a pianist.
She is played brilliantly with subtlety and finesse by French-Vietnamese actress Linh Dan Pham, whom I previously saw in Indochine (1992) playing the adopted child of Catherine Deneuve's character.
As I have said previously French films can either be very good or like this one where the director seems more concerned with an esoteric format to produce what is in the end nothing.The film starts with potential but degenerates into a series of angst that the main character is attempting to resolve.This leads to a very disjointed movie where nothing of consequence happens and the viewer is left to employ some form of rational to begin to understand the story line.
The director/co-writer, Jacques Audiard, has taken a film previously made by James Toback called Fingers, starring Harvey Keitel in the role now occupied by Romain Duris, and made it his own.
Its very hard to send anyone out to see this unhappy little film (The previously mentioned Barefoot Gen spawned sequels, this has not) but at the same time you owe it to yourself to experience, however distantly what sort of monster we unleash upon the world every time we go to war.
Third is the bartender Connor Foster, previously seen in that role in the episode 'Homebodies'.
Story previously filmed in 1934 with Irene Dunne and John Boles.
As it was, the primary plot elements were so unoriginal and timeworn that Â even though previously unfamiliar with either this Dickens original book or other filmed adaptations of it Â I found no suspense whatsoever to one of the two main plot lines to the story.
The fatal script shortcomings of "Our Mutual Friend" appeared to me even more striking by contrast against another recent BBC release Â "Under The Greenwood Tree" (2005) Â which I had just viewed for the first time a short while previously.
Like I previously stated, 'Inland Empire' probably won't make any sense to you.
The director, Masaaki Yuasa, has previously done critically acclaimed animation work on other series, and helped create the equally mind-blowing, and somewhat disturbing short animated movie "Cat Soup".
In order to try to attract more people, his youngest son convinces him to open the runs up to snowboarders and teach snowboarding classes--and snowboarders had been previously banned from the hills.
I thought previously I had seen the worst comedy of all time when I endured Going Overboard.
Philip K. Dick's stories adapted to film have previously been great successes, like "Blade Runner" and "Total Recall".
Nick Cherenko (Lundgren) previously of the Russian special forces, has his family brutally killed by Russian Mobsters.
He travels to Russia and meets with Burton (Ben Cross) who will supply him with weapon's and assembles a team of mercs to help Nick get back Julia, while at the same time finishing what he did 7 years previously, killing Sasha.
So I just thought I would share this info with you as I had previously tried for years to get hold of this fantastic little known miniseries without success.Remembered watching it when it originally aired on BBC in 88/89 and since then it has always stuck in the back of my mind as aone of those "Must own" series.
It does explain a great deal about the behaviour and posturing of Western "intellectuals" who endorse freedom and the revolutionary pursuit of the liberation of oppressed and minorities yet who consistently support those movements and institutions that most obstruct such trends: previously the Soviet Union, today reactionary Islam.
This film and its music still stands the test of time as implied by the recent success of Diana Ross' CD, "Blue" (which was previously unreleased material originally recorded for Motown as a follow-up to this soundtrack) on the jazz and adult contemporary Billboard charts.
As I had read previously, Ms. Ross didn't seek to imitate Billie Holiday's style, and instead created a distinct and appropriate - yet similar - jazz style of her own just for the movie (check out "Good Morning Heartache"), and I, being a fan, didn't mind the song interludes.
Gino, as an ex con, is forced by French law to take residence anywhere but in a city and so he settles with his young wife in the country, where fate turns against him, as first his wife is killed, then he is hounded by his former crime gang to return to his former lifestyle and also one of the arresting officers from his case years previously, the now chief inspector Goitreau is in charge of the area and has a grudge against him and becomes even more suspicious when he finds out Gino's new girlfriend Lucie is working in the local bank With the help of his now good friend Cazeuenve and his new girlfriend Lucie (Mimsy Farmer) he tries to battle his demons and fight against the troublesome cop.
There's a decent amount of gore, including the previously mentioned fish-hook death, and a particularly decent leg-blowtorching-to-flesh-removal that is pretty choice.
I think most of the reviews previously entered on IMDb were placed by he cast crew or Anna Biller herself.
Once again, we see that the Rankin/Bass team were second to none in their constant efforts to share with their audiences adventures unlike anything they had previously experienced.
Martin Schmidt has done two films previously to this "Sidste Time" which is excellent and "MÃ¸rkeleg" which is crap, but not as much crap as "Kat".
Much of their work previously ignored, hopefully this film will elevate them to greater things and Oscars are surely looming.
It seems like she cannot eat or drink anything without it having blood previously injected into it.
As someone has previously noted, its almost like its been written by an aspiring teenage filmmaker.
Save both your time and money and see the two previously mentioned.
John Schlesinger has previously impressed audiences with movies like "Midnight Cowboy", "Marathon Man" and "The Falcon and the Snowman".
Unless you are specifically interested in seeing the the reasons previously mentioned, don't bother with this mess.
I had previously considered Astrozombies the worst movie I had ever seen, but it was bad-funny.
Dan then has a psychiatrist conduct hypnotic regression sessions on Laura, as she had been previously talking to him about the possibility of having had past lives.
As previously mentioned by my fellow critics, the hand-crank technique is used incorrectly and lends the film a music video tone.
The group lives in another haunted house in Amityville, where a priests confessional was places 12 years previously (at a time around the "real" horror).
Have previously enjoyed Wesley Snipes in several action flicks and I had expected a lot more, even from a score of 5.8 IMDb, the movie fails to entertain and even though the story is thin and unoriginal, the acting is most unfortunately thinner and goes to mimic a "worst case scenario" of playing "strong" feelings accompanied by some bad acting... Don't waist your time this movie Ã­snt entertaining, if you wanna cry it might suffice though, even though your tears will be wept due to seeing Wesley Snipes in the tragic action film wannabe comedy...
The writing is the worst part of it, in fact, though the writers did accomplish several feats I had previously assumed were mutually exclusive: they made the plot over-the-top yet unimaginative, the dialogue simple-minded yet smug, and the punchlines clichÃ©d yet unfamiliar (clichÃ©s are clichÃ©s because at some point there were funny, but the ones in My Boys lacked any vestige of humor).
I think it's sad that a previously entertaining show like South Park (yes, I did like the show) has to resort to wasting two episodes having the characters engage in a battle claiming that another cartoon show isn't funny.
Belle Mitchell, who previously had appeared in House of Frankenstein and The Beast With Five Fingers, also stars as the landlady of the boarding house where the title character stays.
There's not much story to it at all, except that a lowly gangster gets gunned down when his mentor, a yakuza previously in jail for 7 years, gets out and gets killed too.
...........sadly this film is not it.While I admit to watching this film several times,I really think that like most sequels to stand alone movies it suffers from lack of a good plot device,when the main character of the first movie is conveniently disposed of in flash back and quite easily at that and a new hero is introduced as a previously unmentioned brother you know that you are in trouble.
It was sickening how much they dis-empowered what was previously a truly amazing character.
I had never seen a Nanni Moretti movie previously and I was pretty curious since he is the kind of "respected author" among the European critics.
But even though director Tom Laughlin (of "Billy Jack" and "Master Gunfigher" fame) had previously managed to make some involving (if contrived) movies, here he couldn't pace a dramatic scene to save his life, and he definitely didn't have the know-how or the talent to make these uncharismatic actors carry the movie.
- was thrown together by Hungarian director Peter Sasdy, previously responsible for such superior offerings as "Taste the Blood of Dracula" (1969), "Countess Dracula" (1970) and "Hands of the Ripper" (1971).
She previously used her breasts in "Deadly Weapons," actually smothering people to death; here, it's more standard, like garroting someone with a cord, though there's one scene involving ice cubes which is different, if still dull.
The story is about a fellow who ends up in the wrong place, directed by someone (fatty Arbuckle) who was in the wrong place because he previously was in the wrong place.
Ultimately, it turns out Olive is pregnant, due to the fact that the television was broken four months previously.
And, yes, we are also served a number of leads that lead absolutely nowhere, as if the script was thought-out by the previously unseen cast while shooting the scenes.
Fisher Stevens, who is so obviously supposed to be Spielberg that it hurts to watch him, just is not in the league with the type of guests starts Columbo was known for previously.
Directed and written by the husband-wife team of Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini (who previously partnered on the smart and quirky "American Splendor" about underground comic book writer Harvey Pekar), this movie would seem ripe for a sharp satire about the privileged class on the Upper East Side.
There's almost no development, no suspense and no engagement value of any kind, except during the last twenty minutes, when they throw in the testicular transplant plot development which I haven't previously mentioned.
Things I hate about sequels include discovering previously unknown (and unheard of) brothers of the main villain killed in the previous film.
Incidentally, Craven knew when he had a good thing going and, so, reproduced here two death methods from the original Â Berryman himself, in fact, expires yet again at the hands of Beast (though he's met with the fate that had previously befallen his brother Mercury), while The Reaper's come-uppance is an even more elaborate and protracted stunt than Jupiter's demise in the 1977 film and which would have been more appropriate for a Road Runner cartoon!
I don't rate this film any higher than i previously did, but did find a few scenes enjoyable and might i add; funny.
As said previously, the effects were pretty decent for a low budget flick, but i simply cannot forgive a bad script and bad acting; even if the genre allows it.
Then he continues to act like a jerk while attempting to cover up whatever misdeeds he previously took part in.
Some of the stories were published previously, and Bradbury included them in an overall book.
I had personally only seen this format previously used by Chris Marker.
Alas, either the budget didn't run to it or someone thought it would be best left to the imagination but in a film so previously full of gore it was odd.
As I stated previously, this is how NOT to make a film, and just about anyone can these days.
Writer/director Oscar Williams, who previously penned the lowdown funky blaxploitation winners "Black Belt Jones" and "Truck Turner," really fumbles the ball with this disappointingly mild and plodding PG-rated clunker: the sluggish pace, meandering narrative, and especially lots of extremely dumb and forced attempts at painfully unfunny and witless humor doom this baby to outright mediocrity.
I had previously enjoyed BILLY JACK for what it was, an interesting little action picture with a leftist political conscience.
Granted, the occasional action scene and gory moment tends to put this above the previously mentioned films, and Reggie Bannister shows up at one point (though his role is essentially an extended cameo) However, the whole thing isn't that different from other Direct to DVD zombie flicks that can be found at movie rentals.
In places the acting was not up to mark that some of these actors have previously made.
The writers had previously done work strictly for television, I'm guessing Public Access.
Having previously played in Children of the Night, Witchboard II and Ticks (aka Infested, a Clint Howard guilty pleasure), she has all the right ingredients to be a B-Movie Scream Queen.
The theme of Holmes' dreams depicting exactly the events to come stands in stark contrast to his previously stated belief in rationality, facts and logical deduction.
The only scenes worth watching are the ones mentioned previously by RedDevil, whom I happened to view the film with.
I'm still certain that somewhere, behind the propaganda, there's an interesting story - how did hatred of Catholocism spread so rapidly when only a handful of years previously, everyone in England was Catholic?
The captain, Bosch, is played by Christopher Curry, a here-and-gone Martin Mull lookalike whose casual handling of his wife's disappearance would come off as absurd if we hadn't previously gotten a load of what she looks like.
Pre-World-War-Two Hollywood got a lot of mileage out of Hungarian plays, in this case one by Ferenc Molnar which had been filmed previously and would be filmed again.
Tere a a number of "stolen scenes"-taken from other movies(previously sited) It kind of reminded me of some of the "westerns from the 50s/60s".
Both central characters are blighted by past misfortunes (Lopez is at odds with her family over an incident which occurred ten years previously) and both are wary of romantic involvement, which leads to the inevitable complications: Lopez' hard-bitten cop is unwilling to lower her defences, while Caviezel is the angelic loner whose refusal to confront the past renders his life meaningless.
I bought this film in a small shop not knowing anything about previously about it.
All of the edge that was there previously has gone, and the ludicrousness of the situations fail to engage the viewer.
About the only funny thing left about the show, which had previously thrived upon irreverence, was how staid and formulaic it had become.
HELLWORLD continues - and probably concludes - the series   The film starts with something Barker couldn't have envisaged 20 years previously - people spending their lives in front of a computer .
Robin Askwith, previously a bit-part actor in Carry On Girls is introduced to us a what passes for an English stud in the days of Slade and three day weeks.
When Noah Bennet proved a more interesting character than previously hoped for, his role became bigger.
The BBC have previously had good luck with the tale - both their Peter Cushing and Tom Baker versions, studio-bound though they were, were more involving in their cosy Sunday teatime way.
As previously commented on, I'm sure it will be a hit in the States, but for anyone in the know, it will be a cringeful experience.
There were glaring continuity errors including (in a different sense)the fact that the previously annoyingly gabby punk kid didn't say a word during all the time he was being held loosely captive by the baddie.
While Porter purists will retch over this film (which was probably what his reaction was after seeing it, especially the added songs), it does offer up a period glimpse of Hollywood choreography from the mid-50s, along with the previously mentioned duet.
And what about his dragging a shark onto his motor boat after having previously pursued it on foot?!
Tanner goes to the house of Mrs. Hallson (Yvonne de Carlo) who has seen him several times previously in the film.
I bought 13 seconds from my local BlockBuster straight outta the old previously viewed section.
As noted previously, the cast plays its part in that over-the-top way common in cult or camp.
Some years later, his body & those of his comrades are discovered in wreckage previously buried in a sandstorm.
The film is a dumbed-down version of the book, suitable for audiences who previously fawned over Twilight.
We are not just to tolerate differences but to celebrate them, even the deviant and previously anti-social ones.
Broccoli did you really think that invisible car previously was unrealistic?).
The price was less than US$ 4,00 for an used DVD (called "previously seen"), which is very cheap for Brazilian usual prices.
As mentioned previously, the ending is suitably poignant, though the tears it almost brought to my eyes are due primarily to my love of and familiarity with the character.
The direction (by someone who'd previously been into 'Sesame Street' videos) isn't terrible, but it seemed he didn't know which way he wanted to go with it, as it blends hand-held, steadicam, and realistic video.
I really didn't want to write a review and certainly it's hard to get in ten lines, but the low reviews given previously may have been from those who did-not understand the movie.
Nevertheless, I should remark that I previously have read Guillou's books with great enthusiasm.
I bought this on DVD at Christmas without having seen it previously.
If I hadn't previously read some reviews here on this film, I wouldn't have had a clue what was going on, as it was, the film was somewhat confusing.
Kettering performs an autopsy & discovers that the Mayor was being controlled by an alien parasite previously unknown to man, Kettering puts two & two together & comes up with the startling theory that these parasites have come from the cone.
The most striking moment comes when the most focused-upon couple, who've previously experienced sexual problems, talk to each other after a bout of now satisfying sex and tell each other that they are now "real" - two less "real" people you'll have trouble finding in the history of the cinema.
The previous Pink Panther movie entry "Trail of the Pink Panther" already wasn't what you could call something successful but this movie, that was shot at the same time as this previously mentioned movie, is even worse comedy-wise, story-wise and whatever more wise.
As previously stated, I'm an eternal optimist when it comes to movies; I fervently believe that they HAVE to get better.
He is then caught by the bumbling cop and the inept reporter wearing a dress (yes, absolutely no reason is given WHY he was wearing a dress, since he had not been seen any time previously in the movie AND it was pretty obvious he was a man in a dress.)
I've previously commented that I find Figgis to be one of the most interesting directors around.
Instead, The Climax is a sad tale of an elderly doctor who has a thing about a singer he strangled ten years previously.
the style of this film is very out dated as previously mentioned they even decided it was a good idea to include a token wise cracking black guy in it all, along with the non stop techno music accompanied fight scenes, if at point you do feel drawn into what happening in front of you it so still dispelled by the drivel that holds it together.
As previously mentioned by my fellow writers, this movie introduced and brought back some of the things the original movie built on...like epilepsy...PH levels...the baby and the old man...the lower level being incomplete and sealing them off.
I had previously seen Tom Waits version of Woyzeck in the theater which I love, read the novel, which is equally good.
Like I previously stated, the idea behind the film is good and since this is one of Spadaccini's first efforts, I give him credit.
Ryan Gosling as the main character Danny Balint in The Believer, I believe, blows all the previously mentioned movies out of the water.
In fact the entire script is appalling, people continually deliver lines of dialogue that have no relation to anything previously said.
A nine-headed expedition is send (at hyper speed) to the unexplored regions of space to find out what happened to a previously vanished spaceship and its crew.
I was previously unaware that in the early 1990's Devry University (or was it ITT Tech?)
The script by Obrow & John Penney is an adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel 'The Jewel of the Seven Stars' which had been previously adapted to film as the Hammer horror film Blood from the Mummy's Tomb (1971) & the big budget The Awakening (1980) both of which are much, much better than Legend of the Mummy which takes itself far too seriously, everything is played with a straight face & it doesn't work.
This movie, while referencing and showing clips to other movies, generally takes most of its inspiration from 8 1/2 and, honestly, I feel if I hadn't had watched 8 1/2 previously I wouldn't have been able to care about this documentary.
Receiving accolades from various award giving bodies in Manila and handpicked to represent the Philippines in this year's Oscar, we expected this film to follow the ranks of some of the best Filipino movie classics that were previously shown abroad.
Even though they're often forced to say stupid things (Out of nowhere Jackson has an overly expositional insult about Jones's alcoholism, a problem that hadn't been mentioned previously and was never relevant afterwards), these actors are always reliable.
Actually, I had seen Racette act previously in two notable films Â Dario Argento's FOUR FLIES ON GREY VELVET (1971) and Joseph Losey's MR. KLEIN (1976) Â but I can't really say if her efforts were any better there.
In fact, the "Ancient Warriors" is a 7 second scene of six Sardinian young men wearing garb with spears in hand, they step out from the wall from which they were previously superimposed, rocks falls killing Richard Lynch's character, then then back step into the cave wall again & disappear... Don't believe me?
It is a sad thing to see previously successful and talented performers end up like this.
Is this some sort of comment on his whole sexual life, or is he granting life in place of the one he took previously?
I previously reviewed Jet Pilot, another John Wayne film done for RKO in the mid-1950s.
Woefully unfunny screenplay by Ken Barker, Tim Rasmussen, Vince Di Meglio and Wayne Lloyd and underwhelming direction by Ken Kwapis (who has collaborated with Krasinski and his THE OFFICE cronies Â many submitted to this mess to boot Â previously, with such higher hilarious results).
Having previously enjoyed Constantinos Giannaris's 'From The Edge Of The City', flawed though it was, I imagined this film might represent a coming to fruition of this director's potential.
The skyscraper-glitz penthouse suite the Petries were living in---in place of their previously normal suburban home--was pointless, and actually called so much attention to itself that it undermined the show.
By the way, this film was based on a play and was previously filmed in 1926 and 1930 as well as later with Red Skelton in 1946.
I bought this movie from my local video store for $3 out of the previously viewed bin.
My God...that man brings suck to a previously unheard of level that actually elevates Sci-Fi channel original movie D-listers...  How's this for a succinct clincher: Street Fighter: the Legend of Chun-Li actually gives Manos: the Hands of Fate some healthy competition for worst film ever.
Also having sold of the family silver and home some time previously there is very little in the kitty to pay for the treatment he needs.
Reena/Evie is looking for someone to help her overthrow Jarek the Sorcerer (John Lazar) who previously overthrew her.
Frank Perry, a previously classy director, clearly had no control over Dunaway.
The woman had previously killed about 50 bajillion armed gangsters single handedly, and now she has a small length of rope around her wrists (her legs are fine), she can't fight off an overweight, middle aged, unarmed business man?
The fact that the US has terrible ratios of health care and education to its financial status was demonstrated through the Sicko documentary and reached a whole lot of people who probably weren't previously aware that the 1st world nations outside of the USA have for the large majority much better civic systems in place.
I thought Clancy's books sometimes stretched the believablity of Ryan's capabilities to the breaking point, yet this goes way beyond anything Clancy has previously done.
This device was previously used for almost an entire film by Robert Montgomery (Elizabeth's dad) when he played Philip Marlowe in "Lady in the Lake."
I had previously watched it and I was a little kinder to it.
Naturally all previously released versions pale in comparison, but that still doesn't mean they aren't interesting to watch.
To this day I vividly remember seeing the movie ...as well as my incessant, inconsolable sobbing at the (SPOILER) previously mentioned rock crushing scene.
Two years previously in 1981, Porky's established a profitable template for teen films that many producers are still exploiting today.
What you don't see is why these previously risky and unprofitable sectors of the market have suddenly become profitable.
You get the impression that suddenly these previously high risk areas have become profitable because the creditors have expanded into these markets and forced them to be profitable, with new strategies.
The reality is that the credit card companies previously didn't expand into these untapped markets precisely because they were way to risky and would result in more losses from credit that is never repaid than profits from late fees interest.
The movie does a quick 180 halfway through, turning into a tragedy as the remote automatically skips years at a time based on what he previously skipped.
It is, as one viewer previously wrote, like something so real it's not even entertaining.
Writer / director / songwriter / co-star Bruce Kimmel (who had previously worked with co-star Cindy Williams in 1976's "The First Nudie Musical") gives it just a little bit of curiosity value with a few musical numbers (his songs actually ARE kind of catchy), but the film is ultimately lacking in real wit and basically has no energy.
The level of plagiarism this film reaches was previously unknown to me.
i bought this as a previously viewed DVD from a national video rental chain and only paid $5.
They do acknowledge the Hitchcock thing, but it's merely a not-so-clever ploy to try and disguise the fact that he didn't even come up with a story, but used some previously reheated leftovers from 30 years ago.
It is sad to see the previously great Vincent Price attach himself to the front and back end of this amateurish production of silly & sad non-spooky shorts.
As somebody previously noted, even the most innocent characters end up doing very wrong things (the bus driver).
There's also soft core sex scenes between Eastman and Gemser and between Cersosimo and Funari as well as the previously mentioned hard-core sex scene.
My biggest gripe over "Haunted Forest", aside from the previously mentioned and the lack of gore, would definitely be the ungodly horrible acting.
This new crop of directors following Moore are all about manufacturing images for themselves to no particular end since the topic has already been handled in full by Fahrenhype 911 previously.
The directing was, again, variable, as I said previously, the jump shocks were very well done, but the director seemed a little too fond of the shaky cam effect at other points.
Some hokum about the pairing teaming up again to complete a previously unfinished mission......hmmm....the arcade machine analogy again.
As previously mentioned, the interview cast do a lot less than pick up the slack.
If films like Cappuccino (an earlier quality film from this same writer/director) and Blue Hill Ave. can't make it to theaters and the previously mentioned vapid works are able to, why should intelligent Black folks pay $8.
Eisenstein in particular is good for this approach because one thing that ties music and imagery together well is rhythmic editing, something he is famous for in the first place and also something that he had previously successfully used to create sound-like impressions in completely silent films (like, for instance, quick cutting between a machine gun and its firer to represent the sound of the machine gun unloading).
Aside from the 'The Battleship Potemkin (1925),' a prerequisite for any budding film buff, I'd previously only seen his debut effort 'Glumov's Diary (1923),' a brief and plot-less short that is rather difficult to come by.
), while maintaining the essence of the tale (abetted by the narration of Sir Michael Redgrave) Â is to have Alastair Sim and Michael Hordern reprise their roles of Ebenezer Scrooge and Jacob Marley respectively from the definitive screen adaptation of 20 years previously!!
It's really exciting to see the previously unseeable.
It's NOT a love story like the previously mentioned, great examples of this sorta-kinda movie.
Famous story previously filmed in 1949 with Margaret O'Brien in the lead; here, young Kate Maberly isn't so much miscast as she is misplaced; inappropriately dropped into the tale, she's a too-modern tyke representing neither time nor place, and her youthful exuberance is rather exasperating.
There were at least a few peculiar facts about Muslim society that I had previously learned over the past several years, which added to my appreciation of the story in the area of historical accuracy.
As I have previously wrote, parody movies are always of the type 'love or hate' it.
Meanwhile, according to a newer law (40 years newer than the one previously discussed), Paige has to read the constitution in Danish in front of the Parliament.
Mexico City looks amazing in this film - I feel as though I have really *seen* the city in a way I never have previously.
Anapola Mushkadiz, who is a quiet little phenomenon, has never previously acted and showed little ambition to do so again, attributed her performance entirely to Reygadas.
Set in early 17th-century Flanders, which had previously been under Spanish rule, the story opens with shots of a busy village preparing for the yearly carnival, when the news break that the Spanish Duke Olivares and his troops plan to stay in town.
My interest in seeing the film stemmed from my curiosity about Will Shortz, unfortunately the movie just rehashed most of his CV that has been previously published, with nothing new added.
James Gandolfini plays the nasty neighbor of Eddie and Maureen, a sort of a pre-Soprano signification of the creepiness and villain potential he is capable of, which he previously displayed in "True Romance".
As previously mentioned, Julie, although not entirely 'normal', is the most normal character in the film; the rest of it is populated by lunatics.
The cast as previously mentioned is very well done fortunately for Mr. Irvin.
There is no better perverse pleasure than watching a married couple smiling and connecting after years of dysfunction as they hack apart a corpse together... especially following everything that's happened previously, which includes but is not limited to necrophilia, coprophilia, copious milk spraying, and random violence.
He previously took the indie world by storm with his award winning debut, "Brick".
The main actor has gotten even fatter then previously, and now takes about 2/3 of my widescreen TV.
For a director's first feature, I take my hat off to Mark Lee and also to the writer/producer who for reasons previously stated in another post did an amazing job getting this movie to our screens.
This was one of the first times Lubitsch had made a movie with little or no music on the soundtrack; previously, in his musicals and his sublime "Trouble In Paradise," he had used background music to cover up potential dead spots and carry the film along.
But here Jacquet has a screen writing credit, and not knowing anything about the movie prior to the screening, I expected something a little different than what had previously been seen in 'March'.
By then, everyone is aware of his attempts with Marie- Louise, and all his well-worn (and previously successful lines) are repeated with laughter by his friends, by the women he has seduced and in some cases even by those he didn't.
Smith uses these characters to reference his favorite movies (the previously mentioned Star Wars, as well as Jaws and Indiana Jones) and talk about any subject in the filthiest way imaginable.
On arrival the station's new commander, Benjamin Sisko, isn't too keen on his new assignment which is first since he lost his ship and his wife in a battle with the Borg three years previously.
I hadn't heard of it previously, so for all I knew, it could've been another straight to video nightmare, with unknown actors and a terrible script...  Man was I wrong!

Les Carlson, previously seen in "Videodrome" as that movie's villain, has a small role, and Cronenberg himself also appears briefly as a gynecologist.
I picked it up previously viewed and popped it in and... blah.

She's previously been sexually harassed in every job she's had -- as we're shown in a lurid scene.
The sex definitely is hardcore and director Lee Frost (who previously directed odd porno-noir The Pick-Up and dismal Nazisploitation trash Love Camp 7) definitely leaves nothing to the imagination as we get to watch the lead character have his way with various female members of the cast.
An absolutely awful movie I watched only because of Gwyneth Paltrow who I had previously admired greatly.
