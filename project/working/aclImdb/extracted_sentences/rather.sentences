Charles Vidor's direction, though rather static, is fantastic and showcases his stars well.
The film is a musical bio based on the rather sorted life and times of torch singer, Ruth Etting (Day).
Considered a departure from the 'usual' musical fair of its day, in that the emphasis here almost seems to be more concentrated on the drama rather than the music, 'Love Me Or Leave Me' is dynamic box office entertainment.
It felt rather light to me, just as Hollywood often does, put a bit of morals in it and mix it with a lot of useless action, basic character building, ambiguous events and there you have it.
OK, I see, Benito Pocino and Pepe Viyuela are reasonable M & F lookalikes (specially Pocino, whose heartwarmingly fun performance is the only good thing in the film), but I'd rather see Affleck and Damon play M & F than endure the debacle that's Fesser's film.
An earlier film I saw him in is called The Premonition, where he portrayed a rather creepy carny; also a fascinating film.
It has much to recommend it, chiefly: believable and detailed interaction among members of a rather large and unpleasant family, mostly given to self absorption but with moments of genuine compassion and caring that surface unexpectedly.
Each scene gets better and better and the story only gets more confusing but in a way that works towards its advantage rather than the opposite.
The whole movie, in fact, is rather slow.
It is rare that a film makes you feel that you are actually witnessing history (rather than the "Hollywood Version"), but "Black Robe" accomplishes that and more.
The Native Americans we encounter in this film are not portrayed in some idealized, pre-historic fashion, but rather as complex, violence-prone tribes as was actually the case.
The rights and wrongs, the pros and cons, of the cultural collision of Europeans with the autochthonous peoples are still too contentious, so I would rather not get into them.
This movie strives and succeeds in its portrayal of Indians and whites as human beings, rather than as villains or saints.
", but rather "I did this this way because... and I am pleased/disappointed with the results, so I will do it again/try something else next time".
The plots are interesting, well-written(as really everything in this) well-thought out, and rather surprising.
The last part of the Blackadder series, this is almost my favourite, due to the brilliant performances of all the actors (especially Stephen Fry, Tim McInnerny and Hugh Laurie), the hilarious jokes and the plots of each episode (even the last one - which is rather dire).
This has a rather grim World War I theme, but luckily there are brilliant jokes and plots to brighten up each episode.
General Hogmanay is also rather stupid and keeps making sure they are on the right track and doing what he wants.
The acting isn't always top-class but this is more because of the simple dialog, rather than its the actors their fault.
If you have grown up watching TV comedy US style only then you may find the conclusion of the series rather disturbing.  
Yes, there is tragedy, but the gift of a film that opens a window on deep experience is that you are uplifted rather than let down.
Take my word you must watch this won't be disappointed at all for people who like atmospheric horror rather than the gory kinds!
Such hits like "Dawn of Dead" and "I am Legend" are great movies, but their fear comes from intensity rather than dread.
That aside, the flick's appeal seems rather obvious.
A smashingly engaging film that is in the vein of Robert Wise's The Haunting & Alejandro AmenÃ¡bar's The Others, so if you like real well told ghost stories that unhinge rather than shock you, get in the queue because El Orfanato is a real pleasure.
While Carlos would rather believe that there is a logical answer to unlocking this mystery, Laura explores more otherworldly options.
Sound and music work very well too, and the film succeeds in working many small elements together (such as a playground hiding game and some very clever revelations towards the end), so all in all, the film is an accomplished piece of cinema and well worth seeing, although don't expect too much real terror as most of the chills in this film are poetic rather than gruesome.
The score, too, is notable in its schizophrenia: lively pop and electronic sounds (as in the rather silly orgy at the end, in which some of the bawdy nuns were actually played by prostitutes hired expressly for this one scene!)
You feel that Marie gets on rather badly with her husband (Sergi Lopez).
Although the story is rather far fetched the film has an excellent cast and is very well acted, so most of its viewers probably enjoy it.
The films ending is rather prolonged and is also somewhat weak, this is particularly noticeable because of the strong meat which preceded it, but Zalman King does deserve credit for ensuring that it was not made glaringly obvious long in advance.
It provides viewers with much more 'meat' than any of King's other recent films (except perhaps for his own performance in St Francis - another noteworthy film, but a serious study of the drug culture rather than an erotic work.)
As such, however, he does include everything one has come to expect from a babes-behind-bars epic; problem is its all crammed into the first 40 minutes, the remainder being dedicated to a rather laborious trek across the desert and the decidedly predictable and anti-climatic round of score settling with The Man.
And last but definitely not least, Clark Gable plays a tough but very very sexy chauffeur who menaces Stanwyck in a rather seductive way.
His big office has very elegant Art Deco trappings and is in stark contrast to the rather cramped conditions in the ethically operated hospital shown in this movie.
Aside from a rather dark view of humanity, noir films rely on suspense, plot twists and relationships.
Knocked for being a rather wooden performer, Lamas is well cast as the stiff, almost emotionless lead, making a strength out of what would in other circumstances be a weakness and Brenda Strong is effectively evil and always hot.
The rather subtle, dry humor mixed with slapstick comedy was very well done.
Marie's grief seems to be marked as atypical by her willingness to face these outside factors, which comes across as almost stubborn rather than genuinely self-deluding.
I also really disliked the directing -- every trick in the book is employed, or rather overemployed, such as ominous music, sudden noises, and excessive foreshadowing.
Though, even then it would have probably gotten dull sooner rather than later due to its one-joke premise.
I am also rather desensitized to horror films.
Frank Zappa may have been revolutionary to some but his music is mostly aimless for me, rather like this film.
For a start sex on the mainstream screen is all about foreplay, tease and aftermath rather than the act.
I thought the film was rather blunt, but the message effective.
peter pan with ADD and a foul temper) rather than the obviously hard working and gifted musicians that make up the "star group" of the school.
That is a pity because they could have had for once a documentary about kids finding their way rather than losing themselves but the filmmaker went rather with the caricatural: -the genius overachiever (the good) -there's the tortured teenager (the bad) -the 9 year old twins who would not know what a beat (or singing in tune) is if it came up and hit them in the head (the comic relief) -the school director who spends his time screaming and berating these kids like it's boot camp time in full metal jacket (bare in mind these kids are between the ages of 9 and 17)- (the ugly) - Even after their triumph at the Zappa fest you don't see him once high five a kid or give him or her a compliment.
Mind you that might be on purpose: You get the feeling that the filmmaker had a rather set agenda and wanted the characters to be seen in a manichaean fashion.
A rather dull but interesting commentary by John McTiernan, as well as interesting text commentary.
), Ah-nuld was perfect for the role as someone fighting on the side of good rather than the evil monster-type role.
It's really a great moment--a simple, unexaggerated statement of ethics--as tough as Dutch and his team look, they derive real pride from the fact that they are in the business (primarily) of saving lives rather than ending them.
And Dutch gets ticked off and he and his team try to escape the jungle, but they're then being pursued by an alien who "hunts" rather than kills.
'I'd rather watch fabric conditioner commercials back-to-back than another episode of "Hex".'
A thriller dwelling more on the sensual and personal aspects leading to downfalls rather than, as in Buffy, merely showing the heroine entering and leaving the bedroom then skipping to the resulting disaster and fight scenes.
This does not take away from the show but rather allows for the watcher to get to know the characters and to develop their own relationships with them.
They grow and change and even the Annointed One has various depths to her character rather than being the typical self righteous do-gooder, whining teen who just wants to be normal or rebellious adolescent who either gets out of control or does what she wants because she can.
One is totally immersed in the middle class consciousness of this typical Long Island suburb to the point that you actually feel you are watching this happen on a sidewalk in the town, rather than in a theater or on TV.
Pitty Buscemi could just let the movies speak for itself rather than using his past successes and cameo roles to push it.
With this film, Buscemi proves that he is more than just a talented actor, but rather a true artist in every sense of the word, with his chosen medium being film.
Steve Buscemi wrote and directed this movie and I shall be rather intrested in any subsequent work he does in either field.
The movie shows that war in the former Yugoslavia was not black and white, i.e., the conflict was not one of good versus evil but rather that all sides - including Croats and Muslims - shared in the atrocities committed.
The film lacks in fully understanding the ethnic peoples of the region, however it still is groundbreaking in its non-simplistic 'gray' portrayal of the war rather than other films that depict the combatants as 'good' or 'evil.'
I wish there had been something like this when I was younger rather than my 70 year old music teacher who had no idea what was going on in the music I was listening to at the time other than the certainty that "that's not music that's just loud banging and screaming!"
Although an interesting concept, it was rather poorly executed, from several standpoints.
The style is achieved well, and this uses slow-motion rather well.
The dark prince side is rather cool and can slice and dice opponents very effectively.
So my comment will probably be linked to the two films rather than only to this particularly strange journey, adrift in a Parisian's tramp mind.
Maybe it helps to restrict the budget and what you have here is an interesting example of something between indie and full blown Hollywood feature that relies on performances, script and directive skill rather than throwing cash at a slim idea to make yet another bland effects fest.
when he sees Duwayne staring at himself.Why?Belial laughs wickedly after Duwayne explains about wanting to be normal.Again, I ask why?Sure, they had a nosy reporter trying to expose them,but not much else.Gore and violence seems like it was just thrown in, to keep the audience awake.But even the violent scenes are poorly executed.The one liners thrown in by Duwayne after a violent act,made me groan in pain.I wanted to throw rotten eggs at him.At least Freddy Kruger knows how to throw in funny oneliners.Then there is the scene that made me cringe(BRRR).If there's something I never want to see in a movie,its this.I never want to see ugly people naked or have sex,and I never want to see ugly monsters naked or have sex.It had belial and Eve having sex,ARRGHH!Eww, that was something I can live without.I'd rather have my toes cut off!And that painful excuse for violin music sounded like it was played by a dog.Woof!The musical score is Laurie Anderson bad.When Duwayne tries to get it on with Susan,we find out,(SURPRISE)she's a marsupial.And she has a disfigured sock puppet pop in and out of her pouch.The biggest pisser of all, is the fact this was a ripoff of "Nightbreed",a much a better movie that came out a few years earlier.The freaks in that movie were better made,plus the story and plotting were well written.Watch "Nightbreed" instead of this dreck.0 stars for this junk.
It leads on directly from the original movie and yes it does look like a studio made film rather than the location shot original but that doesn't matter, what matters is the plot is not as simple as the original which really just told how they came into being and then they went around killing a few doctors.
Good fun if you go into it looking for the accidental humor rather than the intended fright.
SEMI-SPOILERS: This is a fun little movie about Belial and Dwayne (who didn't really die in the first one, rather ended up in the hospital) finding their way to a house of freaks, where they fit in.
So that rather should be a radio play.
But IÂ´d rather prefer the original version, itÂ´s purer than English one.
Like so many movies, "One From the Heart" runs best on a movie screen, rather than a TV.
The Coppola film for those of us who would rather watch Antonioni.
I've noticed that great sci-fi movies are almost always originally written for the screen, rather than adapted from books.
Memories to which he is deeply attached...  LoÃ¯c's demeanor is rather elusive and it's hard to decipher his mainspring.
The whole cast is excellent, and the sensual , open tone of the movie, mixing the fairly straight-laced couple, their young child, middle class friends and family, and the worldly young man and depicting them, ultimately, as not really all that different, is almost comforting...until that ending, which came rather fast and furious after a more slow moving development, shattering the mood.
The group discussing the effects of drugs on the people also includes Marins, which makes this rather odd.
It is rather amusing to see the "drug addicts" which look like middle-aged folks here, and some scenes which may have been meant to be somewhat frightening are actually more amusing than anything, at least these days.
With some promotion, this movie could have been rather more successful than it was, albeit it came on the heels of what might have appeared to be similar epidemic-type stories.
The eventual kayos that occurs is rather structured in its episodic layouts that come and go, but it's done in a wry style than intentional clumsiness even throwing some slapstick moments aside.
The aliens are suitably creepy as my wife will agree, as she still refuses to watch it again, and it manages without the gore of many similar movies, although it is rather violent.
Jennifer Esposito,(Jennifer Baker),"Crash",'04, was rather cute and very attractive and gave a good supporting role.
Simply put, this movie was so infantile it really was rather annoying.
I'm sure many will appreciate that, but it rather detracts from the suspenseful show-down between Derek and Mitch quite a bit.
The biggest problem is that we, the audience that is, are always fully aware of who the Werewolf is so there's no mystery or intrigue element & watching Charlie, Derek & Sam trying to figure it out is rather tedious & one might say unnecessary as we already know.
It just renders the plot point rather pointless in my opinion.
For the most part, the sex is implied rather than revealed, but the characters discuss sex in a graphic way.
I know it's an action film but it would help if there was a vague plot, rather than just one long drawn-out joke about muddling twins.
While rather disturbing, the scene is quite good and adds to the story.
Richard Tyson as the bad guy step dad/werewolf is actually rather good as is Kimberley Brown as Sam.
By no means a cheap waste of time and in places rather good.The idea of a wise cracking werewolf was new but the biggest draw back of the film for me was the werewolf make up.It totally sucked.The whole face was like a stiff mask with only the mouth moving.Bit like trying to be scared of a fancy dress costume.Why do that????
This rather unknown and underrated 80's exploitation movie opens rather slow and ordinary, with redundant speeches about manhood and the art of deer-hunting, but the exciting and genuinely suspenseful hunting sequences during the last half hour widely make up for this.
With Hunter's Blood, the emphasis is on action rather than characterization or drama.
What follows is a tense, action packed slice of survivalist cinema that delivers plenty of nice 'n' nasty scenes of violence (including a great shotgun blast to the face), which is only weakened slightly by opting to have David's pretty wife Melanie (Kim Delaney) turn up to join in the 'fun' (a rather unbelievable, unnecessary and unwelcome plot turn, in my opinion).
"Prey" tells a rather different and original story as far as shooters go.
All this is presented to the player rather quickly.
However, the enemies you fight in "Prey" are rather easy.
It is one of the smoothest games we've seen in recent years, compelling players along not by hardened challenge but rather sheer pleasure and a desire to see what's in store next.
The story is complex, it's fairly engaging & gripping but at the same time it's rather dull & drawn out, I liked it for sure but I don't think I'd be in any hurry to watch it again.
It's rather graphic violence.
The plot basis is on psychokinetic powers and at times it's rather absurd and incoherent.
I'm glad he made it into the rather weak "IT crowd" in series 2, he truly made that series worth watching.
Unfortunately, this kind of humour didn't seem to resonate too well with a mass audience, so another series is rather unlikely.
", (rather, is outside getting his ass beat down by the head redneck until he somehow manages to pull out of it and kick said redneck's ass.
So, with a line up like this, I thought this would be a simple, and rather disappointing, film to view.
All in all, it should have been longer, more detailed and could have used many more comments from the show's cast members rather than centering on "Mr. & Mrs. Sheffield".
Like the 1991 Jean-Claude Van Damme thriller "Double Impact," "Twin Dragons" casts Jackie Chan as heroic twins rather than as dramatic adversaries.
Even if Daniel Day couldn't make it, I think I would have rather spent more time with the original cast than wasting time with Danny Bonaducci (which is not to say he's not a good guy, he just doesn't belong in a Nanny reunion...in fact they could have brought on some of the repeating characters from the show, like Roger Clinton or Fran's psychiatrist).
Apart from a rather crude edit where a car accident occurs in the second half of the picture, the scenes are melded together seamlessly and flow together exceptionally well.
although i appreciated a lot about it including great performances by silverstone (ah, those brits ...) and charlotte brittain (who as linda has the most hilarious and poignant mini-soliloquy from the point of view of a "fat girl" i have ever heard) and most of its realism including a great ending, i thought there were several elements which were rather contrived, including a "coming out to the entire school" scene which veered dangerously towards cheesiness.
for one, i felt gorton as dixon, the deeply closeted love interest, was rather old for the part and that the movie didn't spend enough time developing their relationship on screen.
This film touching the rather trivial (it's the year 2004) theme of coming out, achieves through a fine tune of its elements: plot, dialogs, characters, messages, events storied etc.
It serves a rather specific goal and end which lacks from the rather simple realistic story-telling of "Edge of Seventeen".
My only criticism is that the music is rather standard fare.
The rather complex ending had its' good and bad points - the coming-out speech could've been sharper (this would've perhaps heightened the emotional tension of the scene), but I found the ending to be otherwise quite satisfactory - Steven, as a self-aware young gay man, possesses a strength and self-assurance that places him far ahead of John, whose cowardly retreats into violence betray a confusion that will only create problems in other people's lives until he gains the strength to work things out for himself.
The plot is terrible in the worst way, all the characters are cardboard cut-outs, and I would rather watch a High school student film than this piece of garbage.
Things were dirty and disorganized, just like in real life rather than being carefully and symmetrically placed.
But as filmmakers like Godard, Ozu and Kitano, for instance, realised, that very grammar can be a violation of the integrity of the image, forcing us to concentrate of the structure in which the image is only a unit, rather than the image itself.
Little niggles like that do not take away anything from the enjoyment of this rather charming movie though.
A pretty good film, I really loved the cast rather than the scrispt, so I think that it's worth watching, especially when Lindsay Lohan stars in it.
Sadly the actress herself has become rather unappealing as an adult, both appearance and personality wise (just another shallow Hollywood party girl...) but here's a look at how sweet she was before things went wrong.
Her reasons and motivations to redeem Neel are rather elusive even if she says (I don't remember the accurate cue): "I think human soul is unpredictable and can be able to become conscientious and intelligent.
(A Kelsey Grammar film)   Something is out there was released in Australia on a rather pathetic VHS tape.
Asoka took on similar romantic proportions, in that at its core it has a love story to tell, rather than one focused on waging war throughout the lands, although this was touched upon in the latter half of the film, stemming from a death of his heart, and the embracing of a rage against the known world.
It is a portrayal of Asoka as a normal human being rather than a great king who stands out from normal people.
Yes, it is VERY violent, but the violence is quite stylized and often uses the power of suggestion rather than actual representation.
Well, these two things are explained rather quickly for us before details are revealed that start to make the whole thing more intriguing, complex and a little bit different from the gamut of British crime movies that we've seen since the turn of the century.
Finally, I'd just like to add my general thoughts on the essence of the film and how it rises above it's individual scenes of bleakness and pain to become something rather .
"But at the end of the day, pic has a so-what feel -- fine technique in the service of something rather unsavory," writes 'Variety's' usually perceptive Derek Elley.
Baadshah is a wonderful mix of comedy and drama, and is good for lighthearted fun, although the plot becomes rather fast-paced nearing the end of the movie and some may find it hard to keep up (although I first saw this movie when I was about 10 and I had to read the subtitles, and I followed it fine, so.......) The songs are pretty good, one of my favorites being "Woh Ladki Jo Sab Se", the scene in which Raj- "Baadshah" (Shah Rukh Khan) first starts his job to con Seema (Twinkle Khanna).
The P-40s are attractive airplanes, with clean lines, although they appear to be Model Es rather than the Cs the AVG used.
Some time the twists go a bit too far and get rather tedious on repeat watchings, but this is the screwball genre - it's not supposed to be realistic.
The second was that it really did have a very distinctly Dungeons and Dragons feel to it, rather than just any fantasy film.
The film was a rather bitter and unhappy affair, and I found myself often really brought down by its miserable tone throughout.
If there had been more of a heroic, pleasant fantasy tone rather than a by-the-numbers destroy-em-all gauntlet tone, it would've been much more satisfying.
As it was, it gave the impression of enduring the film, rather than enjoying it.
No depth to them, feeling more like a high-school play at times which is also indicative of poor directing and a scripts with no real interest in telling a story, but rather to "produce".
He seems rather pleasant, except for the fact that he is involved in criminal activity.
In between the cheaply made creature roaming around doing his thing, we're 'treated' to such mindless padding as a woman waking up & showering with a sad lack of nudity, a mindless sub-plot ( or what passes for a semblance of a plot in all honesty) about ex-cons that goes nowhere fast, hippies being hippies (complete with an absolutely horrid song), and a rather strange nightmare that has jack all to do with anything.
Johnny Yune stars in this rather unhumorous yet abundantly silly comedy spoof of Martial Arts films.
First of all as a Hungarian patriot, I honor the makers of this movie (for honoring this event with a movie), and I recommend to see this for all of those, who would like to know a little more of how we suffered during the Soviet regime, but how we took up arms for our freedom, and showed the world that communism is not a historical alternative, rather than a bloody tyranny based upon a thousands of lies.
I also seem to recall that Amundsen as portrayed by Connery came across as a rather self-righteous and arrogant person.
Instead, forth-billed (after Claudia Cardinale and Hardy Kruger) Peter Finch takes the lead as General Nobile, whose ill-fated 1928 airship expedition to the North Pole, intended to boost Fascist Italy's international prestige, instead ended ingloriously with the survivors stranded on melting ice packs for weeks while inertia, lack of initiative and the poor chain of command resulted in buck-passing, recriminations and destroyed reputations rather than rescue attempts.
Although unusual may be an understatement: in a move more akin to theatre of the 60s rather than epic cinema, it begins with the ageing Nobile, tormented by another sleepless night, summoning up the ghosts of those involved in the disaster and the rescue to put his command on trial.
But it's the survival story that works best, with director Mickail K. Kalatozov often eschewing the spectacle (airship and plane crashes, icebreakers and vast landscapes of ice) with a preference for medium shots that keep the film surprisingly intimate (unusually for such an expensive picture, it is also shot in the more confined 1.78:1 ratio rather than Scope).
These are not ghosts but rather figments of Nobile's imagination and they behave according to his perception of how they would behave.
The ending is rather unbelievable.
Clint Eastwood is as ever, although he seems rather restrained.
"Tightrope"is a strange rather disturbing movie,but,if you can take it, a rewarding one.
This movie was made prior to the glamorization of "serial killers" in which the focus is on the weird, whacked-out antics of the deranged killer rather on normal people.
But hold on, what made the difference was the rough, raw and biting dialogue and the appealing characters were fleshed out rather nicely.
While, the killer uses that to his advantage, rather than actually delving into the killer's psyche, which I actually wanted to learn more about.
It doesn't reach any great heights, but hey, I kept on watching and I was rather entertained.
It rather explores the silence and the solitude.
These moments are rather spooky.
I've often pondered which sense would I rather lose: sight or hearing.
But, if you're willing to look past those things that irk cinema fans, and if you picked up this little cult piece you probably are, either being an animation fan or just a free spirit, it's a rather satisfying film.
The movie's plot is rather thin: Jackson is a cop whose partner was just killed by a gun-smuggling ring.
My suggestion is that you watch the "Cheesing" episode of SOUTH PARK and see their dead-on parody of HEAVY METAL instead--it's actually funny and worth seeing--unlike this rather stupid film.
Granted that many anime films seem to find a way to show quite a bit of naked people and violence, at least they do so with an engaging and intersting plot that contains the viewers interest rather than being something that looks like it was written by some blocked eighth grader looking to show naked women and lots of blood.
Too bad it would've been nice to have a closely knit band of friends (a la Star Wars) traveling to different dimensions on TV for several years, rather than a tired band of knit pickers.
Eddie Deezen is always a good comic relief in most movies he's in and I do remember Linda Kerridge was nice eye candy during her 15 minutes of fame, but I would rather have my fingernails pulled out than have to sit thru viewing Surf II again.
All in all; it is, in typical Christie fashion, a satire on the lives of the upper class that is buoyant with snippets of humour and romance as well as the inevitable murder (or rather four and a suicide).
The film is well-paced, with all the plot turns and clues coming with perfect timing, not too fast to be confusing, but not too slow to strain the rather flimsy fabric of the story.
Indeed the whole film seems rather tongue in cheek, with the all star cast having fun with their roles.
I really like the film but at the same time find it rather disturbing.
Before John Candy was really famous, he starred in this rather silly Canadian movie about a series of kidnappings.
Anyway, THIS movie, while rather lengthy, is upbeat, action-packed, and pretty funny, as the swaggering De Niro and the very dry Grodin display perfect odd-couple chemistry.
I rather liked it when Curtis meets Travolta at the end and they drive off.
I should also note that the movie starts out rather comedic, but the tone rapidly changes to drama.
While this film may seem academically sound and well-researched, it does not once mention what I thought was rather widely regarded as the most practicable alternative to petroleum fuel, the conversion of coal into synthetic fuels using the Fischer-Tropsch process.
Yet, there is no mention of a significant technology which is already in place, using a resource in rather great abundance, and whose refinement and improvement is light years from the hopelessness suggested by one of their experts, who likens the challenges we face in surviving the depletion of oil reserves to that of colonizing Pluto in ten years...
Peak Oil doesn't mean 'running out of oil', but rather 'running out of cheap and plentiful oil'.
I guess I'd rather believe I have an empty tank and conserve than think I have a full tank and burn - even if the truth is the other way around.
It seems that our total economy will revert to an agricultural base rather than industrial and technological.
The thin thread that "A Crude Awakening" seems to hang its optimism on is the assumption that if enough people become fully aware of this totally unavoidable event sooner, rather than later, then human ingenuity, combined with a level of human cooperation the world has never before seen, might possibly attenuate the consequences for at least some of those who awaken.
The effect is to inform (in a very entertaining way) rather than frighten.
By waking up and taking action - by making sure those in charge take action, we can slow the process and ensure that developing countries need to divert into renewable energy rather than old energy (oil) to achieve their aspirations.
If you thought it was serious, multiply that a hundred-fold and start examining it on your mother's life - or rather that of your children.
That is the first and last piece of rhetoric - the rest is cold examination of evidence; which is perhaps one of the reasons it then has to work so hard to make its rather dry subject interesting .
Would you rather not know?
I just found it loud and irritating, and it didn't make sense to me why the other characters were trying to talk over this cacophony rather than either asking for some quiet or just going over to Leeson's apartment (which was only across the hall!)
Overall this movie was fun and entertaining, although I personally think that the movie's success was rather exaggerated, because the story itself isn't all that great.
It makes this a rather fun movie to watch, though I wouldn't call it Leo McCarey's finest movie but that says something more about his qualities than that of this actual movie.
Tho sure enough love never quite runs as expected, and can indeed be a truly complex thing, especially when the other parties involved are human, a cheeky cat, and a rather smart and astute canine!.
No, this is not a spoiler and has nothing to do with the storyline, but rather an evaluation of their performances.
And Dunne, singing a Tosti song, watches him lovingly as he stumbles and executes pratfalls, ending her son with a laugh rather than the words of her song!
The film gets rather violent--especially the fight scene between Peppard and Pickens-which begins with Pickens using a whip.
One of the dancers in a scene is rather bulky.
This French movie adaptation is set in present day Bretagne, but other than that remains - rather surprisingly - true to the book, more so than, for example, the Diana Rigg version of Evil Under The Sun.
It's doubtful if Chiara will ever achieve the iconic status of her parents but she gets acting jobs because casting directors and producers know she can deliver rather than because of her genes.
But having only seen David Wenham previously as Faramir in The Lord of the Rings, in drag as Audrey in Moulin Rouge and as the dubious Carl in Van Helsing ( a movie of quite excruciating badness), it was rather disconcerting to hear his real accent.
This movie shows that love really conquers all in life.People may try to feel that they are only sexually attracted to one another but they later on realize that this attraction is much more emotional rather than physical.Also,it also make us realize that people may find someone not only who can make them happy in bed but also in real life.
In the end, there is no real story and surprisingly mediocre performances from actors who usually perform rather well.
The fact that the film conveniently decides to start over right before a plot twist is revealed just tells me that it didn't have much of a plot to begin with, along with the fact that a rather large twist regarding the president is revealed IN EVERY SINGLE TRAILER FOR THE FILM.
These people aren't seeing different things and coming up with different conclusions, they are only giving us the full picture rather than incomplete snippets.
And probably as those same people say Hollywood is "out of ideas" they get angry when it tries something "different" and would rather go spend their money on Spider-man 8.
The humor, or rather attempts at humor fall very, very flat.
It is so flat and unsophisticated that it is rather hard to believe that this film was released a year after "The Exorcist".
And some rather charming silent movie-style subtitle boards on the screen fill in any required exposition.
A shy, intense and mysterious young man who loves photography ( The actor is Hiroshi Tamaki also known as Chiaki sempai from Nodame's fame ^^) The second character is a shy, rather mysterious girl, who lacks self confidence but is cute and amazingly pure of heart.
If this is education, then I'd rather be an idiot!
Despite the title, the film's plot doesn't involve Sinbad in a boxing match with Mr.T., but rather a quest to turn a baboon back into a Prince.
The special effects don't hold up that well in the light of today's multi million CGI effects but I'd rather watch the magical work of Harryhausen rather than a soulless computer graphic.
The attractive cast performs listlessly and the villain is campy rather than truly menacing, although former "Doctor Who" Patrick Troughton is delightful as a befuddled wizard.
This movie is rather understated, right down to being in black & white and having a single acoustic guitar do the background music.
His one-on-one combat with an android provided some kinetic zip, but his action-character felt rather odd in the mix.
It is the male aged 10-15 I think must be the top raters of this rather sad attempt at cinema.
After being disappointed by Species 3, I felt absolutely wreck with Species IV...I mean I am a big fan of 1st species, and the alien-creature in species IV was like a puppet rather than being realistic.
The reason why I don't like this movie is because it's way oversexed, the plot was rather pointless, it was weak, decadent, and played out period.
I'm generously presuming this is maybe meant to be a warning on the part of Englund to alien chick to quit it already rather than the writers for this thing being the dumbest people ever (It brings to mind Danny De Vito's attempt to write a two character murder mystery in Don't Throw Momma From the Train).
Being a complete sourpuss when it comes to most comedic film offerings from the last three decades (though I attribute a lot of that to inanity rather than taking full credit for being a wet blanket), I find that when there is a film that makes me laugh so hard that I am concerned about the possibility of a stroke, I have no choice but to rave about it.
It's really interesting to see him in an earlier incarnation on screen rather than onstage.
In this sense, the film merely illuminates the weakness of the human condition, given all of its vulnerabilities, rather than stereotype a given group of people as morally depraved.
The violent clashes are filmed only fleetingly, rather than in voyeuristic close-up detail, but the tragic consequences are felt with sickening force on both sides of the family.
Try again some other time methinks, rather differently perhaps for a fresher approach.
Self-taught rather than "book-learned," Frank Hopkins is free of cultural prejudices and willing to meet the Arabs on their own terms.
In this case I would not be to surprised to find the former rather than the latter.
I usually do not go for westerns, but this one looked rather good on the trailers so I gave it a try.
Though you know a Mustang has to be a rather fast and strong horse because they named a rather good car after it.
It is refreshing to see people carry themselves well and with honor, rather than being the "wild Americans" foreign countries have come to expect us to be!
This is not a fast-paced film; rather, think of it as story unfolding before your eyes, so sit back and enjoy the ride.
In many ways THE RED BERET is much more enjoyable than most of the British war movies at the time probably down to the fact that it`s made in glorious technicolor rather than monochrome and I`ll probably be accused of being a heretic by saying that it`s more enjoyable than the depressing BAND OF BROTHERS a mini series that has a lot in common with THE RED BERET   * Watch the scene where Major Snow walks into the office and throws his hat onto a hat stand .
Akim Tamiroff as Welles' gypsy friend is rather good, but Nancy Guild in the dual role of Marie Antoinette and Lorenza, the woman who Cagliostro first rescues, then manipulates, is not outstanding.
The way I took the last lines -- my $.02 -- was merely how I took much of what Andre was saying: not the precise import or meaning of what he said (boy, does he talk fast) but rather the overall tone of dread and the fear of death he evinced.
How both Andre and Wally tend to ignore the restaurant staff as people illustrates the point Andre makes that we tend to react to people by the roles they play rather than as individuals.
There is no explosions, swearing, sex, CGI and none of the garbage that has attracted brainless movie goers for generations, but rather an intimate story of two friends catching up and talking about lost time.
Carradine seems right at home in this smut and Whirry is rather comfortable and uninhibited in front of the camera performing..for quite a jubilant audience, I presume(..unless you are bothered and/or disturbed by the naked body of a gorgeous woman).
Many of the sex scenes are cut rather short, not getting too explicit.
This rather dark film noir with its uneasy comics (Roscoe Ates, Nana Bryant, and Billy House who even repeats his checkers trick from The Stranger) and desperate heroine (Mary Beth Hughes), is further strengthened by the forceful performance of Charles Russell who manages to make his rather ambivalent drifter somewhat sympathetic.
Jule also seems to have a rather selfish approach to being an 'Edukator', as she purely wants to cancel a debt so that maybe she could start a lucrative career herself.
Or rather, can't live, because of low wages and debt.
The paradox, a rather pat one, is that the guy they kidnap, Hardenberg (Burghart Klaussner), was a Sixties and Seventies revolutionary himself, who only slowly slid into the capitalist life.
Or rather, only a little fake and a little contrived.
A very interesting, psychologically well developed film, that starts from the rather simple (the whole of the establishment are 'a wunch of bankers', as the British say) and then becomes more complex.
The development of the Hardenberg character was also very interesting: at first, he is a very rich top manager, also a rather pathetic figure, but then, as he gets in touch with his own idealistic past, he shows much strength and wisdom.
I think I'd rather be with a retarded father than parents who were never home and didn't give a sh^#t.
This film could so easily have been nauseating, but the superb acting made up for the rather predictable character played by Michelle Pfeiffer, while the child was perfectly cast.
In fact, I thought the only performance that was better than Penn's came not from Michelle Pfeiffer (who disappointed me a bit, actually) but rather from little Dakota Fanning as Sam's daughter Lucy.
I would like to see more Independent action-based films like "The Incorporated", rather than those we see every year at the festivals striving to be the next Neil LaBute or Woody Allen.
It's not limited, like a Generator, rather, you can customize a lot.
In the style of Edgar G. Ulmer's Detour, Inner Sanctum is a cheap little film noir, and one that gains all of it's successes from its plot rather any technical elements.
It seems almost incredible that this film was made in 1936, when the almost invariable tendency in Hollywood was to portray negroes as (perhaps) lovable, but mostly inept, submissive, rather primitive creatures, good for a laugh and musical entertainment but for not much else.
But it gradually becomes clear that the outlaw's love for the widow is passionately sincere (which may surprise some viewers in light of Halla's rather matronly appearance).
The plot on this one is a little weak in that the murder is an accident and Columbo has to result to trickery to trip up the murder solution rather than using his usual proved police methods of homicide investigation.
Actually, after watching this one for many years I have come to rather enjoy it.
Jessy would rather act like a baby at times.
Then some more elements are added : his friendship with another boy who is the rather of the macho type but who does not seem afraid of a masculine friendship.
Though my favourite has to be the shot that takes us up from the basement (albeit rather poorly cut as you go through the basement door) swerving up the stairs and into Jesse's little sisters room.
This would be a brilliant ending, rather than the confession being the truth.
I saw a couple references to additional information in the book form, but as for the movie what I got was not that Tideman/Owens CAUSED the event but rather that once the chain of events was initiated he was obligated to made sure that Laskey got on the ship at exactly the right time.
So other recommendations should rather be sci-fi movies of the same kind, and not just war movies.
Altogether a far more interesting premise than the rather pointless one the film finally opts for.
Mifune actually becomes a rather relaxed family drama, and a rather satisfying one, too.
Most of the comments made on this movie are rather critical, and admittedly not all aspects of the film are equally satisfactory.
What makes "Mifune" stand out from standard Hollywood movies are the painfully real characters, who make it feel like a real-life romance between two people rather than a hypothetical story about hypothetical characters none of us is ever going to meet.
When Liva escapes prostitution with a job as Kresten's housekeeper, the her part in the movie switches from drama to comedy, in the form of funny situations and events that feel natural, rather than contrived gag situations.
Arguably the best of the films adhering to the Dogma 95 Manifesto, and the first to be shot on film rather than video, MIFUNE'S LAST SONG is a genuinely enjoyable film.
A massive crew of hundreds disturbs the acting, disturbs the vibe, becomes the movie, rather then the film being the focus.
Somehow these larger and larger films just become money vampires for people to fill their bank accounts, rather then go to make something beautiful, as this.
You can understand that the actors felt comfortable and the whole thing came very naturally for them, rather then forced.
I can believe that a simple story is capable of being entertainment and moving, rather then great big complicated stories that consume the characters, and miss the mark.
Cheerleader horror movies ought to have at least a few cute cheerleaders who manage to have a wardrobe malfunction every few scenes, as this movie goes on you are rather glad they generally keep their clothes on cos they aren't exactly pretty....
The plot is a bit hard to follow some of the time, glaringly easy in other places, generally rather disjointed, which considering the mad doctor disectionist theme might have been a situationalist pun in something cleverer.
It is better than Easy Rider because it is not encumbered by all the hippie platitudes that really didn't age well and because Easy Rider is constantly telling you what it is about while Two Lane Blacktop shows you rather than telling you.
It shows me things rather than telling me and that can truly be said of so few films.
In that respect the story is about the brief relationship of four individuals, rather than the individuals themselves  There are several incidents during the journey and we can see from these that some of the individuals learn and others do not.
The mood and images transmit the inner essence of the characters rather than what they willingly reveal of themselves.
Hitchcock commented on how true horror is created not by showing the audience fearful images, but rather by us induced to forming such images in our own minds.
Everyone is biding their time waiting for life to turn out rather than creating the possibility.
What the film is is a rather tepid film made in English with Richard Grieco as the hit-man and Maggie Q as the target.
Its nothing we haven't seen before and its told rather blandly.
It's not a sappy movie that's cliched, but rather one that deals with the emotions of letting go of the past and those left behind.
Apparently Flynn later in life wanted to be considered a talented actor rather than simply a ladies' man or "matinee idol".
Lindfors plays more for eye candy rather than give a good performance.
Interestingly for a Matt Helm movie, however, Linka is a rare woman in Matt's orbit who is the recipient, rather than initiator, of the first display of interest.
The women are subjected to various tests, which are conducted by a callous scientist and his assistants who talk like robots and look like they belong rather to a street rave.
I'd rather watch reruns of Mork and Mindy.
The worst part about "The Last Winter", however, is the resolution or rather the lack thereof.
I saw this at the Toronto International Film Festival and enjoyed from beginning to end, rather unexpectedly with really good results.
It is an extraordinary piece that is told by its form, rather than text.
Perhaps the story needs a somewhat more ironic and cynical touch, then, rather than endorsing Sapt's agenda without question?
What's more, in the book Antoinette is implied to be one of the 'poules de luxe' or 'grandes horizontales' typical of the era, and is a number of years Michael's senior: which makes her efforts to hang on to him rather more urgent and desperate.
The film makes the big sword-fight a duel between Rupert and *Rudolf Rassendyll*, rather than between Rupert and *Michael* - which is understandable in box-office terms, but sadly means we lose *another* terrifically dramatic scene: Antoinette, in her bloodstained nightdress, going after Rupert with a pistol.
I like Coleman and Carroll in their leading roles as well as C A. Smith and Niven as the co conspirators   Raymond Massey looks like he is uncomfortable with his lines and would rather be doing Hamlet Nevertheless this is the best version and it still has legs and looks more Gothic than the MGM Vehicle which is saturated in colors and may cause headaches after the first reel  C Pope
I would rather blame it on script which was raw and weak despite all the credits of the writer.
But for those of you who want to watch a movie about something, that will actually deal with it, rather than pander to the lowest common denominator, you might want to give this movie a shot.
Their selections of paint, fabric, and accessories are rather outdated and kitschy, and they faux finish to the point of excess, dangerously giving viewers the impression that drawing design inspiration from the dining room of a Mimi's Cafe or Olive Garden is a good thing.
I see the film not as a documentary on the holocaust, nor a piece of anti-Nazi propaganda, but rather the journey of a young lady thru time into a fantasy world where she is "taught" the importance of her heritage.
I don't want to spoil any of the story, so rather than recount any more of the plot, I'll just tell you that all the performances are wonderful.
This is a lovely drama featuring a child rather than a kid's movie, but it works on either level.
It's rather cathartic, I have to admit.
Well the company has made a rather drastic change for it's next project in Santa Santita.
In terms of the storyline, I was rather interested to see how events would play out given that this theme on faith healing and religion is a largely unexplored here in the country.
Having read no reviews of the film before seeing it, I expected a pure Horror film, but it turned out to be an incomparably bizarre and experimental Horror-parody, with a delightfully macabre and grotesque humor rather than scares.
The experience eventually ends, rather solemnly I must say, although after at least 20 minutes of non-stop psychotropic hallucinogenia, it acts as a welcome buffer zone as you gravitate back into reality.
So rather than ask for my dollar back, I just got up and walked into the movie they were screening next door.
As this was made for television the Major keeps her clothes on far more than in the film, she does however wear a rather revealing costume in the first series.
She also takes getting shot up rather lightly.
There is too much attention given to computer generated virtual reality sfx rather than the action in real life.
Doomwatch - the gritty and often rather lacklustre series covering moral, social and environmental issues was the only programme that came close to Timeslip at this time, but Timeslip was overall much more successful.
Simon, portrayed by the excellent child actor Spencer Banks is the brainy one, interested in science and maths, with an instinct for discovery he single-handedly figures out all the crucial plot points for the audience to absorb, whilst (rather unfortunately) the naive and whining Liz, played by the admirable Cheryl Burfield, whines a little longer.
"Sexual Roulette" makes the film sounds rather intriguing, but the version I bought was under the alternate title "weekend in Vegas" which is I feel rather dull in comparison, but for a pound I wasn't going to complain.
It is my favourite of the three Topper films as it mixes comedy with horror rather well for its time.
- Saif doesn't have all that much to do differently-given a rather conventional role and a more conventional approach to handling it.
At this point perhaps he could not decide if he can still continue to be an artist or rather make money out of this?
Despite being a rather short film, with only about 120 minutes of running time, the film seems dragging.
Through Eklavya, Vidhu Vinod Chopra tries to debunk the belief that Dharma is all about following the path of righteousness as defined by tradition; rather, he endorses the view that righteousness is not an absolute concept but has to be rooted in reason - Dharmah Matibhyah Utgritah.
The beauty of Eklavya does not lie in its theme, rather it's the director's vision and actors' sincerity that make it stand out.
Please seek alternate work rather than continue to disappoint those investing their time seeking entertainment!"
The plot starts off rather simple as we are told that a group of guys are going on a trip to Vegas and bought the "Ultimate Vegas Bachelor Party Package".
The ending was also well explained, rather than it being a simple, unexplained twist, it actually had a nice story behind it and it made you smile.
But it is a great film and the music is spooky but awesome and the setting is rather Silence of the Lambs like, remember Jodie in the garage well it Virginia in the wall of a ghetto building.
It's a morality play, a story about how we deal, or rather don't deal, with race relations, and a really beautifully twisted love story as well, as all of Barker's works are.
There is no ghost of Daniel Robetei, but rather an entity that is formed by rumor, faith, fear, and the story itself.
Also the ending is rather anticlimactic and overdrawn.
The only real major gripe I had was the pacing could get rather sluggish, but director Boris Segal's accessible direction delivered the goods when it came to the action set-pieces, filming the exteriors with its available scope and generating some surprises.
Segal's film is also visually striking, especially the wide empty streets of L.A. but unfortunately the feature has some incredibly campy moments at rather tense sequences.
The Omega Man replaces the rather puerile vampire theme with that of a reactionary cult of anti-science.
The epidemic that supposedly turns people into blood-sucking Buffy-beasts in the original story is replaced by a rather more believable illness of which symptoms are aversion to light and insanity.
Kudos for the fact that the sympathetic characters in the movie (played by Quaid and McDowell) were actually suggesting that marriage problems need to be fought through and marriage held on to rather than thrown away, but still, frankly, I thought this thing would never end, and the ending, when it finally did arrive, was entirely forgettable.
I always thought of Andie MacDowell as a rather flat but obviously lucky presence on the screen.
I mainly saw this to watch Toni Collette and I can honestly say I was rather dissappointed with this movie as a whole.
Later his stuffiness actually stands out in rather good contrast to the anti-Victorian backlash that follows the First World War.
This is of course unavoidable, partly because the cast are all ten years older but also because the first Sharpe film skipped over the Indian books and had Sharpe obtaining his field commission in Spain rather than in India.
Once they are returned, the power of all will be negated, or rather reconciled.
This is another example of why you give people enough time to complete the story rather than force it into an allotted time slot.
The majority of the audience were NOT horse-crazy adolescent girls, but rather adult couples, who spontaneously broke into applause at Sonya's triumph in the Breeder's Cup Classic, and who lingered at the end credits, clearly hoping for even more.
However, the real tone of the story is rather sad and moving: The hard life of the musicians, trying to make a living, the mother- and wife-less home of the band leader, who lost both in childbirth.
I know that most Americans are too dumb to read subtitles (or rather Hollywood think they are) but it renders authenticity in wast amounts to a movie.
And Coy himself would rather win fare and square, than having the competition eliminated by extreme matters.
Red Sun could have been - perhaps should have been - a good movie, but what it emerges as is, unfortunately, rather a waste of a good idea.
Full Moon though would rather make a movie featuring characters from different movies coming together.
Show me something rather then explain it with one line of dialog.
Anyway felt more like an hour long TV episode rather then a movie.
The pace is rather slow, but never boring and the character drawing of Harry Voss is truly fascinating.
I'm not familiar with the works of Charles Bukowski, on which this film is based, but still, it's rather interesting, if strange.
I don't mean that one of his songs keys in during the action, but rather he bursts onto the movie set singing and strumming his guitar with nearly unparalleled intensity.
He himself seems to feel that something is right, rather then have it all worked out in his mind logically.
I felt rather clearly spoken to, both in image and dialog.
(I rather like that.)
This film is a Neo-Realistic Italian film, in that most of the actors were apparently not professionals and the subject matter was rather mundane (this is not meant to be an insult--just a comment about the style of film).
This is their latest attempt to appeal to real Christianity by portraying their field missionaries as here to help, rather than bent on world conversion.
Serving a mission for the Church is a rather common experience - what would make this man's mission interesting?
The Tongan people are not put off by this film, but rather are very much in support of it.
It's pretty obvious what the contents of Paragraph 175 of the German Criminal Code contained, judging by the number of innocent lives it consumed, it would be more appropriate if you'd watch the movie and learn rather than have me explain it to you in a website review.
As is often the case, the negative views turn out to be more a reflection of personality rather than of serious critical scholarship.
In real life someone stealing top of the range motor vehicles would not hesitate in getting rid of any witness rather than falling in love with her, which appears to be the ludicrous premise of the film.
Maybe it was just the fact that I watched this movie on television with commercial breaks while doing homework, and therefore wasn't exactly giving it my full attention and deep scrutiny, but I rather liked it.
It is by no means an important movie, but rather one that you can watch on a rainy afternoon or enjoy again if you haven't seen it for awhile.
Films like Night Shift and Grand Theft Auto were rather more zanier than anything he does nowadays.
There are not many live-action films about mermaids, which makes Splash rather unique.
Here he stars alongside a very attractive Daryl Hannah in a nice little romantic comedy that at one point gets rather risquÃ© for a PG rated movie during a certain emerging at the Statue of Liberty scene.
Overall though I thought it was rather good.
But you see for Peter Weir the story is told not with characters, plot and dialogue, rather it is in the total flow of the movie.
The rural location and inhabitants of the town are simply alienating in their welcoming vibe and also with an eerie score that gives out a groovy twang that works up the mood rather effectively.
The subject matter is more than tricky, and it's handled with a truly impressive balance of seriousness and humor; the humor does not come at the expense of the story but rather is intrinsic to Francis' and Blake's lives, as they are seen dealing with their reality of being conjoined from birth.
Mark and Michael Polish DO deliver halfway decent performances - though I'd rather have seen Michael in the lead.
I later read an interview about the movie and the creators' account of some of the imagery and the design of the movie, but such explicit detailing has taken away some of the charm I had felt for what I had believed were natural/innocent things, rather than improve my opinion of the movie.
He thus accomplishes the rather difficult task of creating a film that people will laugh at AND laugh with.
CAUTION -- MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS --  I put this film roughly in the same category as "Pleasantville" and "The Truman Show", in that they require you to suspend disbelief to show how, ultimately, it is better to really live and love then die, rather than live a "perfect" and protected life.
Using a clean fun environment was a beautiful sight to,rather than seeing gutters littered with derelicts,and yet in this movie no such thing exists.
When I first saw it a few years back I admit that I didn't like it much, it seemed rather stupid to think that a robot could 'become' human, but on viewing it again years later, I can safely say that I missed the whole point of this film.
In the end (indeed, 10 minutes into the film) not only do we not care at all what happens to her, but we rather wish Walken would just lose his cool, lock her and del Toro in a closet someplace, and dance away into the sunset to a Fatboy Slim song.
The movie lacks a good plot, and is rather boring after a while.
Maybe because these were the only episodes that were focused on a single Angel, Kelly and Jill, respectively, rather than the others which were group efforts...) Kate was excellent and extremely compelling as Sabrina Duncan, Farrah was quite good (sometmes mesmerizing) as the fun-loving, athletic, charming flirt Jill Munroe (I have always thought her comedienne skills could have been tapped into more) and Jaclyn was beyond lovely and sweet as Kelly Garrett, the perfect third banana.
The hard-boiled story sticks to something rather stable and less than flashy, but can be thoughtful in its wide arrange of antics and tactics.
The thing that struck me was that whether a film is well known is due to a product of marketing rather than quality, as I had never heard of this film.
Instead of being titillating or innovative, the film was just dreadfully dull, uninvolving and so melodramatic and campy that I would almost rather eat a live rat than see this film again!
In this rather frank film before The Code, Menjou hasn't been getting any kanoodling from wife Dorothy Peterson who was injured in an automobile accident.
This film fails in nearly all aspects, and it seems only appropriate to be called soft porn movies rather than a real movie.
Personally, I found this rather cute and quaint.
And the scene in which the Letarsky character comforts Schlutt's character after the rape is rather touching.
The only other prison film with a "gay:" subtext that I have enjoyed was "Kiss of the Spider Woman" That said, this little German film, "Locked Up", was a rather tender and provocative gay love story.
Though the film deals with the Holocaust, it doesn't graphically show Nazi horrors, but rather refers to them abstractly, making it more effective.
One criticism that is sometimes made of Streep is that she is too intellectual an actress, self-consciously thinking her way into a part rather than trying to live it emotionally, but in this case at least this seems to be the right approach.
It's revealed very late in the movie, at a time where we already root for Sophie, despite being a rather naive and weak character, but we care so much for her it's like it happened to ourselves.
But I think he's a dollop of awesome; a soupÃ§on of superb; and the thick, calorie-laden icing on what might otherwise be a rather slender cinematic cake.
I'm one of those people who try very hard to see the good in everything, even movies, and this film "Cruel World" deserves far more credit than it seems to get, as it is actually rather good.
Laura Ramsey plays the "final girl" Jenny, and though she is nice, as per usual in many horror movies (horror is one of several genres that are merged in this film), she is rather bland.
They handled the Reality-TV show aspect quite well actually, and even though it was rather straight-forward, it was still good.
A rather unexciting public official, Yamashita, receives anonymous letters about his wife's adultery.
Chow Yun-Fat gets a chance to prove his great acting abilities, without so much use of a gun(he also uses a gun, but rather rarely).
God of Gamblers has intense drama and a rather nice soundtrack(if a little bizarre at times).
The action wasn't much emphasized as in rather friendship, but when the action does kick in, it brings you to the same level as John Woo's bullet exchange, and heck, even Dragon (the bodyguard) knows some kick ass moves when he fights.
The authentic location work helps cement a realistic edge, while the pacing is rather measured and rather low-scale in its escalating confrontations and violence (which is tamely staged, but gut wrenching since you're thrown right into the acts).
As it is, it is simply using pieces that were probably rather expensive to make a poor man's "2001: A Space Odyssey."
They shifted the setting from Sweden to Austria, which eliminated the aspect of a sun-lit evening ("perpetual sunset is rather an unsettling thing").
Yes, it sounds like a rather plain story, but director Jonathan Demme knows how to make it interesting.
"My Son John" is a movie which is almost comically awful, with Robert Walker swearing on the Bible that he's not a Communist; Dean Jagger singing "If you don't like your Uncle Sammy;" the Communists tapping the FBI's phones rather than vice versa; Robert Walker dying from a blast of a Commie machine gun after a geographically impossible chase through downtown Washington; the taped posthumous speech to a collection of frozen-faced graduates with warnings of "stimulants" leading to "narcotics;" and finally, Dean Jagger more or less telling Helen Hayes that their late son got what he deserved.
It all looks really, really strange and inevitably that becomes a nasty impediment to the story line itself, which is actually rather good.
They went for beauty and surrealism rather than photo-realism, and it's glorious.
He makes some rather amateurish mistakes, but it's good to see even the old pros took time to master their craft.
The film would have benefited from a German perspective during the battle rather than just the experiences of the prisoners on Graf Spee, and of course did ignore Langsdorf's suicide a few days after the scuttling.
Most of them feature a two male competition for one woman, cynical insight into the minds of its characters and a rather strongly ironic sense of humor, taking apart the characters' follies and vices equally.
But plot isn't the point of most of Hong's films, rather, they focus in on the characters and it's quite amusing watching these two artists try to be friends while at the same time trying to one up each other and get with the figurative or actual girl.
While it's always refreshing and welcome to see films depart from the pyrotechnics of the Hollywood school of film-making, some films' subtlety and quietness are rather oppressive (Tsai Ming-Liang immediately comes to mind).
I'd rather watch cartoons for goodness sakes.
It's appropriate that this project consists of an international array of filmmakers, as the LumiÃ¨re brothers were responsible for introducing motion pictures and cinÃ©ma to much of the world via their (or rather their assistants) traveling the world.
The film is weakest in these early scenes, with slow pacing, average writing and rather poor acting from the children marring the production.
Jean Harlow shares top billing with Cagney, yet her role is rather small and does not really justify her name being above the title.
His brothers seems rather funny today, as the actor playing him went WAY over the top to make him seem stuffy and angelic.
WARNING SPOILERS: This review is from the point of view of one who would rather we live in a world without Mafias, organized crime, and gangs.
In fact, I rather liked Nails.
Tom then meets Jean Harlow and she seems to fall for him, although his interest in her is rather more glandular than anything else.
***SPOILERS IN CLEARCOAT***  This is a forgettable 'cursed treasure guarded by ancient monster' film that breaks no new ground and shows its lack of budget rather obviously.
The monster itself was rather disappointing; the CG effects weren't very good, so it was hard to tell just what shape it had.
The result is a rather flimsy plot line with several sideplots that are never really realized but Ulmer, as a director, does not invest on plots.
I don't think there is any kind of constructive criticism I could offer to a movie who's star actor is Tim Thomerson (not that I don't like him, I'm fond of his rather over-looked talents.)
Despite the sordid subject matter the film refrains from sleaze, it is in fact fairly restrained stuff, with its most discomforting moments involving tape recordings rather than anything visual.
I live in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, so hunting for a three-decade old and rather obscure giallo wasn't necessarily a walk in the park) to fetch a copy of "What have they done to your daughters" and what a put down it was!
A good many of the leads go nowhere and the killings, which are central to the plot, or so seem to be, are really never explained; we have no idea why a mysterious biker goes zooming around Rome, with a meat ax, butchering lust-crazy teenagers, private detectives and, even, a district attorney (played by a rather dazed Giovanna Ralli - her 70s hairdo stood out way, way more than her deadpan acting).
The film ends on a rather low key, leaving you to wonder if there wasn't anything a tad more interesting to do with your 90 minutes instead of watching this incredibly confusing piece of italiana.
It all seems like a warm-up for JOHNNY GUITAR in lush settings rather than a saloon.
Otherwise, Nikita is rather a 'sweet action movie' by my standards of today.
However, one day she comes across Tye Graham (played by Michael Wilding, who pronounces "Graham" as "Grimm"--rather appropriate) when he is hired to replace her burned-out rehearsal pianist.
If my memory serves me, Gig Young is most famous for committing suicide rather than any movies he made, but that's beside the point.
Crawford, in blackface, descends the staircase (still silently counting her simplistic dance steps and "posing" rather than dancing).
Perhaps it's the rather nihilistic denouement that rendered this movie unpopular.
My problems with this include the fact I find it rather preposterous that Colossus would cease with its surveillance of Forbin while he's in bed with the mistress, given that Colossus is watching him in the bathroom and such.
Also, it seems rather likely that all the missiles could have been capped and evacuated, forcing Colossus' weapons to be unable to be launched.
That they'd have to be disarmed in the way shown is rather foolish.
I suspect this would be more obvious if the movie was available in Widescreen rather than the Fullscreen version we've all gotten used to over the years.
A word about Frees' contribution to the film: In "War Games," for example, the computer has a curious sort of empathetic communication style ("Wouldn't you rather play a nice game of chess?")
What I'd rather do is call attention to the visuals -- the cinematography, lighting, costuming, and especially the set design.
It jumps here to there without real cohesion and becomes rather thin in detail, but there are some surprising revelations along the way.
The dialogue on the other hand was rather fine, if too much of it.
Borris Karloff comes across rather menacing and quite callous in appearance.
The soaring score takes hold and sometimes it got rather distracting for me.
I think even though the budget was low and the overall quality of the film was rather primitive by today's standards, the "feel" of the movie is what made such an impact on me and everyone else who has watched it!
The film moves along at a great pace, it's never boring, it's as plausible as any film can be featuring flesh eating zombies, it's really nice to see a pretty intelligent horror film with good adult character's rather than annoying teens & a well thought out script.
Surprisingly, he doesn't allow gore to overpower the action, preferring to concentrate on characterisation and atmosphere instead (in fact, what little bloodletting there is tends to be rather restrained and those seeking excessive amounts of entrail eating would be better off looking elsewhere).
The make-up is also rather nifty, with the ghouls sporting not-too-OTT dead complexions and hideous milky eyes, and several of the corpses featuring some nice individual touches (there's a drug-addict corpse with a needle in its arm, and one with a knife in his chest).
This version of Night of the Living Dead might not have been absolutely necessary, but considering that so many remakes end up being rather disappointing, fans of zombie films should be grateful that this one ended up in the hands of someone so knowledgeable and reverent of the genre.
In fact, you can almost state that the last half hour of Savini's film is a tiny third sequel, rather than a docile remake.
One time, when the rather ingenuous romantic lead, David Manners (UH!
While this remake rather wisely sticks to the basics of the original film, it does differ at some points.
The search for the killer, led by Major (later Lt. Col.) Grau (Omar Sharif), gets lost for a time and Valkyrie is inserted rather late in the film.
Although the transformation of a "General-lieutnant der Wehrmacht" to "ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer" is rather unusual and strange, the unit commanded by the character played brilliantly by O'Toole was already Waffen-SS in 1942 in the movie (but commanded by a Wehrmacht general at that time).
But as he himself says, he's concerned with the small scale rather than the large.
Grau, never flappable, replies, "I use a rather strong cologne."
(Of course, it's best not to look too closely at the rather prominent lump on the side of Von Stauffenburg -- where actor Gerald Buhr's arm was hidden under his tunic!)
All three plots intersect, sort of, but I can't help wishing that someone had made up their mind just what sort of movie they wanted to make and stuck with it, rather than trying to make three at once.
I agree with the above general sentiment that the story strays a bit too much at times, especially with the rather useless bombing of Hitler as a detour.
Don't expect a movie with ghouls and monsters, it rather is more fun to watch then it is scary and the Lugosi/Karloff combination is what makes this movie a real classic.
lol But the rest of the scene turns out to be rather bloody... Well, it's a good twist however...  *Global Spoiler Alert*  But the ending... Oh no, how could it be?
So, I don't understand, why was Perepelkin ("Kazanova" from "Menty") made the main villain (Anvar), rather than d'Hevrais (and yes, it's d'Hevrais, not D'Evre, as it's written in the "Cast" section here), who was the villain in the book... As for me, I think, that this simplification was totally unnecessary... For an Akunin fan, like me, it's a disappointment...  Also, the ending action sequence with Fandorin fighting Anvar was a bit lame... Varya killed Anvar, not the great Fandorin... And _he_ was so weak - he didn't even manage to wound the spy seriously... That's a major disappointment for me...  *Global Spoiler Alert ends here*  *Spoiler Alert ends here*  Now, I will explain the major pros and cons: Pros: The casting is fairly good...
I have to say I liked the ending, especially that they stayed true to Akunin's ending to the relationship between Fandorin and Varvara - rather than coming over all Hollywood and having them riding off into the sunset.
As a Background, this is the first time, we have seen Mani Rathnam write and direct a movie, that involves the conflict of terrorism and more of a global movie (concerning India) rather than Tamil Nadu.
While not quite as accomplished as the later movies, he develops a very simple story of a young married couple, the subsequent kidnapping of the husband and the wife's attempts to persuade the authorities to help free him into a well-rounded movie that works on almost all levels that it encompasses:  The love relationship between the two main characters is credible and well-handled; the struggle of the individual citizen vs. government authorities and individual desires vs. the larger scale of politics is dealt with intensely (the scene where the Colonel tells Roja that "everyone is happy" is simply chilling), and even the interplay of the kidnapped and the terrorists works out really well, even if it seems sometimes that Rishi Kumar was lucky ending up with these rather than more ruthless people.
The only problem that I have with this movie are a small handful of scenes in which Indian patriotism is showcased in what I felt was a rather blunt manner (but then, coming from a different country, I may lack some essential cultural background to understand it).
I saw the film when it was first released, and although I was rather young at the time, the story stayed with me for decades.
A very memorable film, rather obscure, and highly recommended.
The plot takes its main basis from the practise of hypnosis, and it does feel a little odd that a completely serious film is taking its central plot idea from a rather strange idea.
This was before I began thinking about it and determined that noir is more a type of film making rather than film content.
I'm not a fan of movies that are dubbed, i'd rather watch them in the language they were shot in and read captions.
And does he bring the rather impotent detective and the daughter of the murdered man together, and give the detective a promotion for doing nothing?
A lot more fun to look at rather than to think about.
The film takes place mostly in a gas station in the middle of the desert, and what starts out as a rather impromptu tale of romance turns into something more sinister when a gangster on the loose decides to hide out in the station, taking all of its occupant's hostage.
By not so much combining the two but rather looking both ways in perceiving an impression of the world, Robert E. Sherwood and those who adapted his play, stages a confrontation between the two outlooks, holding them up side by side and relating their shocking compatibility.
The actors work well together, with Tobin and Harvey rather amusing as the bickering rich couple (he refers to her as "my dear idiot wife").
Mantee has no qualms about the proposal, but has no personal quarrel with Allan and seems rather to almost enjoy his company.
The film had a chance to be a thriller with substance, rather it showcased its theme repeatedly giving the thrilling moments less sting so tonally the film bordered on drama.
My only little and rather practical piece of criticism as to the script is: how come that the yuppie-couple didn't have or use a cell-phone?!?
Over the years, comedians have tried to guy the show, but come away looking rather foolish because they made the mistake of sending up what they think the show is.
Yes is the answer but I shouldqualify this by saying The Christmas Invasion is wonderful in someplaces and rather mediocre in other places   Without doubt RTD knows what makes the show work - imagery .
This film thus centers on the myth, rather than stick to the facts.
In a recent biography of Earhart, none of her warts which would show her humanity rather than the public image which we already know.
It is true that Fred did indeed have a drinking problem for which he was fired but evidence shows that much of this was due to the immense strain he was under rather than a wilful character defect.It could be said that he was the worlds first commercial aerial navigator.
until recently I found out that he is reputed to have done just that in the Clipper planes which he navigated on their pioneering flights across the Pacific.Only it was thrillers rather than holiday brochures!
The writing seemed uneven and flat, and where the first series made you care about the characters, the second leaves you feeling rather unsympathetic.
It is quite dark and doesn't rely on the big on-screen moments, but rather the toned-down mild, very dry but witty humour (With the notable exception of one absolutely hilarious scene involving bungee-jumping).
It is a rather slow movie compared to your typical Hollywood movie, but then again the story and characters are also stronger.
Incidentally, I'd particularly recommend the longer version rather than the 108-minute version, as that fills in some of the plot gaps that other reviewers seem to be querying.
John Cassavetes, however, decided to concentrate on the characters rather than the action so you see lots of interactions between Vitelli, his girls and the gangsters and lots of shots of Vitelli thinking.
If they really wanted the Chinese bookie dead, why would they not enlist a professional rather than a high profile club owner who had no idea what he was doing, and why send him on a job they thought he couldn't complete, and with so much security in his way.
He owns a rather ratty strip club/cabaret joint on the Sunset Strip that fronts production values and performers of the qualities mentioned earlier, does middling business, and spends nearly every dime he makes "living the high life" or the "the image" of what someone in his profession should espouse.
as long as you pay attention the whole way through,the whole set-up pans out rather well and i thought the effort put into Both the idea and the execution of it was admirable.
The whole film lumbers and creaks and when finally it gets to its first surprise ending, believe me it is not a surprise, it's pretence and over use of slow motion is irritating rather than dramatic.
Also, it is rather formulaic particularly in the middle of the film ... the whole misunderstanding part is so cliched.
Its true that not many of the characters are very likable but actually the Argyle family were a rather tortured bunch in the novel too becoming more so after the revelation that it was not Jacko after all who killed the mother figure.
He demonstrates the proper way to use synthesizers, to transform the music, rather than make up for lack of an orchestra (or talent).
Serra's soundtracks were the first that I bought for instrumental music, rather than for pop songs used in the film.
Like Charlie Brown, I hate goodbyes and I'd rather more hellos.
A rather long movie, but it manages to sustain the viewer's attention throughout.
These are so hot, in fact, I'd rather watch EMMANUELLE movies than most X-rated films.
For all its technical brilliance, not to mention its finely-crafted script, this film is rather stolen by the mesmerizing performance of Joe Powers (aka Richard Towers - known to us all, of course, as Gaylord St. James).
For someone as notoriously misogynistic as Milligan, its rather odd to see such a likable female character.
There was good acting but only in scenes meant to show off good acting rather than to move the plot in any understandable direction (watch the interminable "mother of the prime minister" scenes).
This almost seemed more like an unused idea for the first film rather than a seperate plot line of it's own.
Kunal Kohli is an extremely sensitive director and while there may have been slip ups in pace here and there (it was an emotional rather than an action packed movie after all) on the whole the movie shows a director of competence and someone who has a very bright future.
Then, Corbin Bernsen gets on the radio, looking rather dapper in the command set that he never leaves (like Basil Rathbone in an old Roger Corman movie), and puts out a desperate inquiry: "How long will it take to repair?"
Sadly, this movie would be better if they just cut and pasted all the clips from each movie together, rather than reshooting them.
The acting was rather wooden which contributes to the overall poor production.
The starring couple (Vanessa Angel looking rather pouty with her botox-laden lips) starving for oxygen at the end while sitting in a diving prep room full of tanks (and them in wet suits).
The voice was rather hoarse, a bit affectedly posh, honking, loud and rather braying it was not unique for its time, it was the voice of the older actress or gregarious hostess and with her almost clown-like make-up (I recall her face looking white with make-up)combined to be her instantly recognisable trade-mark.
As part of this was a gallant and rather courtly attitude to "ladies".
I'm not sure that Fanny was a "victim of her demons" rather than product of her time - a twilight period for class, family money, Empire, privileged travel and cheap subservient staff.
Whether you admire Madame Fanny or not, and preposterous and obnoxious as she seems, I rather do, she was a pioneering female, very much of her time, and the world is a more interesting place because she was in it.
Typical of Jones's serviceable but rather dull Disney pastiches that characterised his early work, 'The Night Watchman' is an unbearably gooey little offering with a constant lack of energy that is sorely required to bolster the wafer thin plot.
The ending is all rather predictable, though fun to watch for the most part.
Nikita does not have the feel of an action film, but rather, feels like a fatalistic drama riddled with almost continuous tragedy and heartbreak, and spiced with just a tad of hope.
The film also benefits from the reality lent by the dilapidated and run down buildings in the various towns shown in the movie, rather than the cheesy 'gunsmoke" type sets that are normally seen in films of this genre and time.
That is to say, numbers focused on DANCING, rather than someone's flashy Western outfit, locations, batman angles, etc.
I find them rather sad in a way.
The happy end is indeed rather corny, but hey, the movie has a message, it is entertaining and funny.
Poetry should not be scrutinized for its lack of realism but rather taken in from a distance, its inner message interpreted at a more intellectual level, with candor and an open heart.
But I did decide rather than just complain through the whole movie, I would just try to sit and see maybe if the film could have been worth the watch at least, well, I was wrong.
It portrays the life of New Yorkers in a rather satirical, but realistic way.
The film is interesting and flows well, and then suddenly from nowhere comes Aman (Shahrukh), a happy-go-lucky guy who seems to have no problems in life, but he does want to solve the problems in Naina's family when he meets the rather complicated girl, whom he falls in love with the first moment he sees her.
Kal Ho Naa Ho might be resented by some for its rather high-pitched EQ but overall it's great to watch once .
Maybe I am being a bit of a Naina Catherine Kapoor....So, I'll end on this note rather...  Seen in the broader context of Indian Cinema, this film is a proper landmark....It's a perfect blend of the East and the West.
After rather unsuccessful attempts at copying American Pie-style comedy in Indian films, SOMEBODY finally showed us what it takes to make a success of this kind: A modern comedy (hilarious jokes) with modern direction (cool style of story-telling, I thought) in a true Indian setting.
Well, it is always a bit difficult in Western countries to get to see Bollywood movies with English subtitles, and though I have made a bit of an effort to spot them in the last few years I wouldn't call myself a Bollywood expert - and of course I've grown up with Western rather than Indian aesthetic standards ingrained.
And why exactly does Aman prefer to love vicariously rather than going for the girl himself?
It's also perhaps significant that it is Rohit rather than Naina who stays with Aman to the last.
was a pure joy and it makes me happy to see how Indian cinema is finally beginning to be perceived as a legitimate part of international film culture even by Western audiences, rather than just an exotic oddity - something that Chinese and Japanese movies, for instance, have already achieved to a much greater degree!
There are, of course, concessions to the modern world, unlike Laura Jesson, who was a full-time housewife and mother Claire has a job and for that matter her passion is kindled by a vet as opposed to a doctor, albeit one who treats lions rather than hamsters.
It starts off rather typical, a mousy but beautiful blonde woman, Claire, who sports glasses (to show her extreme mousiness) and is often filmed wearing a tightly wrapped wool coat and painful-looking high heels, works as an insurance agent who examines people filing claims.
Please note that is in no way whatsoever any disrespect to the utilised foreign crews, quite the contrary - they are entirely as competent as any other, rather my problem is that the recent trend to shoot genre flicks in said countries has invariably produced some of the most truly mundane and inane action and horror fodder there is going!
She treats her daughter Rebecka like she's a 5 year old superstar rather than a 34 year old mildly successful actress.
After just a short time however, the personality disorders portrayed must inevitably lead to a rather more uncomfortable experience.
I'd much rather shell out $40 for an over-priced boxed set of, well, pretty much *anything*, than give HBO $10 a month (or $80 a DVD set!)
The characters of Christopher, Paulie, and Bobby reflect the loyal - but self-serving underlings present in every enterprise, who are trusted out of necessity rather than merit.
I give credit to director Martin Campbell for respecting the dignity of refugees and using generated images as appropriate, rather than exploiting people unnecessarily .
If you're the kind of person who can EXPERIENCE a film, rather than just kick back and watch it, than you'll be brushing flies out of your eyes, and jumping at every sudden burst of gunfire.
I'm so glad someone's helping," and then deep down, you'll be ashamed to realize that you think that just because you elected to see a movie about Relief Workers rather than The Texas Chainsaw Massacres, you deserve some sort of gold star.
I hope the film, rather than being perceived as good or bad, will inspire others all the same.
Like "The Crow" before it, "Dark City" is heavy on set-design, bleak atmosphere and memorable visuals, but thankfully, the script (co-written by David S. Goyer) is smart enough not to hinge on special effects and set design, and rather, toys with your expectations while delivering something stream-lined and efficient, instead of being overly long and bloated like it very well could have been.
The only thing Mr. Proyas does not prepare us for is his rather over the top finale (perhaps a little overkill there), and his all too neat denouement.
A great film that causes you to think about its implications rather than spoon-feeding you plot.
For all of those who have been misguided and praised The Matrix as the greatest scifi movie(though i rather call it junk), you have been lied too.
The strangers' insistence on doing everything as a group also brings up another interesting point about the human race is that our ability to be individuals is what makes humans thrive rather than conformity and similarity.
I'd rather sit through a slow movie that is good than a slow movie that is okay.
Sure, he wouldn't have the money that he's having at his disposal now, but remember: DAS BOOT had a rather infinitesimal budget and nevertheless managed to thrill, enlighten and entertain millions of viewers.
Oldman plays it like he means it, killing mercilessly while still appearing cold and calculated rather than insane.
The story doesn't flow like normal, rather it drips on you like leaking faucet.
Also, rather unexpectedly, they stumble upon another man here--a crazy Dr. Hunter who seems far less a man of science and more a really, really horny guy who is constantly trying to kidnap the lady.
As for the dinosaurs, they may not be up to the standards of "Jurassic Park" or "Walking With Dinosaurs", but, again, considering what the budget must have been, they are rather good (except for a slow-moving Tyrannosaurus).
It seems that the father is stalking - or haunting, rather - his son.
That sounded rather lame, but it's a better plot than what's here.
There's a little bit of nudity, but it's rather a quick topless scene from the Allison Warnyca as the Sheriff's wife.
One criticism I have of the later movies is that I would like to have seen Herbie stay with his original owner Jim Douglas, and follow his adventures with that family rather than see him owned by lots of different people - partly because Jim, Tennessee and Carol are great owners for Herbie, but also because how does the poor little car feel being passed from owner to owner?!
In the film, we learn rather quickly that race car driver Jim Douglas(Dean Jones) has hit rock bottom after being a prominent race car driver(what caused his demise?
So the reason for not releasing this movie to the theaters must be the "overall crappiness" of the movie, rather than the nude scene with co-star Craig Sheffer.
I bought this dvd for $4 and because it's a movie Sandra would rather forget.
The suspense here comes more from wondering how Hitchcock is going to sustain interest in a film shot entirely within the confines of a small boat rather than through any dramatic tension.
To my mind, the issue was dealt with rather expertly in the story.
Hitchcock accepted a rather difficult task in taking on this assignment.
(I found Bendix in WAKE ISLAND, for which he was nominated, rather forgettable).
Harold Shand (Bob Hoskins) tells nostalgic and emotional stories about his National Service (which had been abolished for almost two decades when this film was made) and how he began his career as a street urchin An hour earlier, he had been proclaiming his glorious vision of 1980s Britain while Â in a rather unsubtle piece of direction Â framed by Tower Bridge.
Keeping this question unanswered for so long rather than giving hints occasionally requires a predictably huge scene of exposition, which is totally subverted when it turns out that Shand hasn't actually done anything at all.
In the event yes, because rather than going into hiding (like Michael Corleone in the first Godfather) Shand's feathers get ruffled even more and, the irony apparently lost on him, he kills two IRA agents for real and is tracked down and captured within minutes.
But the final drive away,with Brosnan holding Hoskins at gunpoint is now justly famous,holding on Harold's face seemingly endlessly but ingeniously,with all number of expressions telling us so much.This aspect of Hoskins' performance may be it's most impressive,despite being wordless.There has been a problem in some of Bob Hoskins' film roles since;undeniably a very fine actor,Hoskins however has sometimes fallen into the speech patterns and mannerisms of the role that made him a star into some other parts he has played,much to his detriment,though this has mostly been the exception rather than the rule.
We're shown a rather perplexing, confusing but well shot sequence involving several people and a couple of deaths over what seems to be a case of money.
After the dramatic introduction, everything is toned down slightly as Harold Shand (Hoskins), the man of the film, is introduced to a rather catchy theme tune.
With so many faces being introduced and so much pleasurable interaction, the events that follow fuelled by great hate for Harold are rather shocking as they are surprising and that's what really kicks this film off on a good path.
The film is chock full of character with names like "Marc's Trick," "Hot Shirtless Guy" and "Hot Clothed Guy" - I'd rather receive a hot glue enema than sit through this a second time, but this film does raise so many questions: Why do people see movies like this when there are so many quality films out right now?
The direction by Philip J. Bartel is, well, sloppy and the actors appear to recite their lines of dialogue rather than deliver them in a believable manner that suits the characters.
Here is the definition of "farce":   1. a light, humorous play in which the plot depends upon a skillfully exploited situation rather than upon the development of character.
I wouldn't have guessed the latter two had any talent based on Eating Out, but it seems that was all Q. Allan Brocka's doing rather than the fault of the actresses.
It proceeds despite itself to formulate it's plot out of significant character's arcs and roles, rather than playing to simply Crowe's predicament.
He had so many comedies that I enjoyed that it is rather surprising.
They did it here quite well, granted a lot of the time the person had their back to Steve, I still rather thought it was well done.
Though the funniest part was the scene involving the dog poop which I will admit was rather childish compared to the rest of the comedy in this film, but it still got me laughing the hardest.
Crowe nails the performance by not hamming-up the character, but rather by understating his personality.
I've read the articles and this show had so much competition including a few times it was canceled because of Superbowls and other such stupid reasons (I'd rather watch this show than the superbowl any day)  IT's sad too because the show had character depth and was good... really good...well thought out , great plot great writing.
The writing, the acting - even the photography (which looks like it was location shooting rather than set-shooting) - are all fantastic.
This Charley Chase short has a rather silly plot but because the film was written so well and Chase did a great job pulling it off, the whole things works very well indeed.
Comments: The story, or rather there are not much of a story or a plot as there is life.
A contemporary issue like gay bashing is a subject matter that some would rather not face and will undoubtedly have a bias against this film prior to viewing it, due to the subject matter.
)goofy and rather poorly executed because the costume isn't the least bit scary..more likely, seeing it will give you the giggles.
No gratuitous sex or violence, although rather large portions of both.
From the bits and pieces I had seen before, I thought the series is rather shallow and very light hearted but I was surprised.
There are some good, rather deep story lines dealing with the hassle of the daily, modern life as problems at your job, problems with your family and so on.
Agent Flores and Miguel's wife, Marlene, were also both very appealing, as strong, independent female characters who have their own complexities and motivations, rather than being overshadowed by the male characters.
while they followed rather simple people using simple tools (harpoons and fish hooks mostly) this film introduces industry as man's tool in conquering nature.
Some have commented on the weak story, but I rather enjoyed it - it could be billed as "Huckleberry Finn meets Standard Oil."
That's true, but especially when the magnetic field gets messed up, our apocalypse will come, or rather will rain down on us without holding back the tears of destruction.
The effects were nice, the emotions in the movie were rather violent for my taste, and I blamed it on Japanese cinema, but it was the magnetic field's fault (or was it?
It does not indulge in the process of reversing the trauma, it rather centers it's plot on surviving the drama.
Yes, the two leads are rather dull and the complete breakdown of society in about 48 hours, while explained by a few throwaway lines of dialog is a little hard to swallow.
The film contains some graphic sexual content, but it adds to the horror rather than plays a purely exploitive role.
Sadly to say, David didn't make many outlandish films like this, rather he used elements like this as an additive.
There's actual film shot of Lynch's wife Peggy going rather bonkers while in a bed.
Over the course of her journey, Natty meets up with a knowledgeable young man by name of Harry (John Cusak), a group of rag-tag misfits with a rather mafia-esque 'you take care of us, we take care of you' motto, and a loyal 'Wolf' (which may or may not be a Husky, since everyone but Natty refers to it as a dog, and it is played by the dog of 'White Fang' fame) that seems to have a sixth-sense when it comes to danger.
spoilers -- only parts i disliked even though they were realistically portrayed were the orphanage even though im sure thats the way it was back then for orphans.treated meanly but they at least could have listened to her when she said she wasnt an orphan.and also for the father to just leave his kid behind with the landlady who obviously is a rather loose woman .he didnt have time to watch the kid when he was around as she was always playing hooky or sneaking into movie theatres ,,although during the depression , you did what you did to survive but still he should have considered her welfare more than just to leave her like that, he didnt even say goodbye to her at the beginning of the movie when he left.
NATTY GANN is a rather unknown Disney release from 1985 that takes places in the '30's.
One thing she witnesses is a dogfight where one of the dog's is a rather wild wolf.
The violence admittedly is excessive, that I am used to, but there are one or two parts that are rather unbelievable.
Beautiful, oh, those green eyes, and feisty, like Scarlett, Paulette gives her best, including singing a rather salty sea chant at a social elite gathering of all of Savannah's fine ladies.
If this show is picked up, or should I say when this show is picked up, it will be an instant success because audiences love superheros and this show brings Aquaman to the level of any other great superhero rather than just being the loser one that talks to fish.
You've got potential complicated relationships -- a young cutie guy who hits on all the bikini babes he can, finds out he's a lost prince, becomes an unselfish do-gooder when he'd rather party while still wanting to solve the disappearance of his mother.
Also featured, among others, are Mario Carotenuto (as Milian's elderly sidekick and conscience) and Ray Lovelock (as one of Moschin's lackeys, though he exits the proceedings rather quickly in one of the film's best scenes).
You'd rather avoid this easily forgettable ASSASSINIO AL CIMITERO ETRUSCO and prefer TUTTI I COLORI DEL BUIO or LA CODA DELLO SCORPIONE, his best works to me.
), but as for me, I'd rather spend eight straight hours reading the nutritional labeling on every cereal produced by General Mills than spend time each week watching this overgrown bully browbeat and physically intimidate his unfortunate charges over and over again in a truly desperate attempt for yuks.
William Powell and Myrna Loy hit a real career high point in this film with a rather original plot gimmick.
From 1492, when Columbus sailed the wide ocean and found what he thought was India, up to the death of Teresa de JesÃºs 90 years later, Spain went through rather traumatic experiences.
Strangely, it seems to have been made by well-meaning amateurs (that includes the talented veteran actors who performed in a stilted manner and seemed rather lost).
The general idea of having a woman and her little girl visiting all those interesting places like Istanbul, and constituting a rather more intellectual travelogue than is usual in TV documentaries, was a sound one.
I'd rather be hogtied in a room with the roadcrew from Queen and a jar of KY jelly mixed with sand before ever being exposed to something this wicked and satanic again.
The camera is static throughout and since the film is driven by ideas rather than story line or character development, the journey at times can be a bit tiresome.
Yes, this treatment of the different class systems seems rather trite at first, but the complexities of the characters are mapped through until the sombre end, which is a refreshing change from the feel-good nonsense made by Disney et al.
Byrne's character is a seductive vixen who has a guy who loves her but she would rather chase after another, meanwhile her younger sister (Garai's character) is in love with the very same man whom her sister repels.
The movie captures some of the book's charm: the castle, the countryside, Cassandra's emotions, but I felt it was unnecessary to make up a particular scene between Cassandra and her father (I think this was done to accommodate Nighy's acting style) and I was really disappointed by the ending, where Cassandra seemingly lets go of her love, writing it off as a general experience, rather than declaring her love, as she does in the book, and her hope that the man she loves will return.
But her ongoing contemplation of her madcap family is born of concern rather than self-obsession.
Her burdens are increased rather than lessened with the arrival of a pair of rich Americans, and the romance that ensues.
The plot errs towards the romantic rather than the comic (OK, fair enough, that's what it sets out to do) but I found the end result a little disappointing.
Wuornos employed " Dr Legal " at her original trial , a man , or rather spaced out hippy , with no legal experience and no office who attended court after smoking as many as seven joints .
The director also receives sole writing credit, which rather explains the filmâs relentless self-indulgence â padding a wafer-thin plot with lame attempts at characterization and dreary passages of local color!
There is as many nonsense in it as in all Ed Wood and Spinal Tap movies altogether - a retarded mad scientist, the ridiculously looking killer toys, looking like some old 80's-style he-man puppets on acid and some more bizarre stuff like a strange dominatrix whipping and torturing her masochist slave all the time, a b-movie zombie monster with a carnival mask, a mad clown and gnome and a girlie rock band being captured in a cave and playing sonic-blasting gothic metal rock over and over again...  All in all it's rather a freak show like from a fifties' b-movie with a non-plot, some hardcore sex and splatter violence and ridiculous dialogues.
If that isn't strange enough seems the guy who wrote the book was a bit crazy and he even went so far as to say the book was not a work of fiction, but rather a true story.
This one is rather good, but the ending is a bit strange as something from his other book comes true too.
Its good fun while it lasts but it does rather streak by and afterwards I did have a number of questions about various plot and character points.
Overall I didn't think I would but I actually rather liked I, Madman, don't like that title though.
Genuinely interesting and rather imaginative terror film that could possibly satisfy both the audiences that desire creative writing and those who crave blood (even if the blood in this movie doesn't exactly look real).
What it does do clearly is to present a level-headed argument in favor of inclusive spirituality, rather than having one's beliefs lead to hatred and violence against others.
Although it sounds like a mean concept, Frisky Puppy is so warm a character that it is immediately apparent that to him this is just a game rather than a vendetta.
Or rather, that IS the end of it.
What is important to remember is that Wyler and Warners were not doing a send-up of the yet to be released GWTW, but rather using Owen Davis' 'old and often produced play.'
And really, the goal for the drive-in audience wasn't really to be entertained by what was on the screen, but rather, to have what was shown on the screen assist patrons in getting into the pants of other patrons.
Some of the dialogue, what can be heard, is rather amusing.
Some interrogation sequences are stretched too long and we witness the uncomfortable cast languishing with rather dire material.
I did find the foul character of Johnson rather amusing in how he describes everyone he comes in contact with..never a kind word for anyone, he's quite the misanthrope.
The truly horrible climax at the end punctuates a rather ineptly made film..attempting to leave open the killer's identity, it only has you scratching your head.
A plausible climax determining who between two obvious suspects might in fact be the real killer would've at least provided a satisfying conclusion to a rather poorly conceived horror film.
But these are men who hold to their illusions with a death-grip; one guy still wants to have long rock star hair though he's basically bald on top, which is a metaphor for how these guys avoid facing the truth; that they are not great filmmakers waiting to be discovered, but rather mere obsessives with eroded imaginations.
The weird, often by choice, relative at the family reunion who'd rather show you their tattoos or pet snake than photos of babies or a cute puppy.
Henry Fonda plays a rather priggish young banker who finally runs out of patience with his wayward fiancÃ©e.
Although there are numerous references to classic kung-fu movies, they don't come across as a tongue-in-cheek homage, but rather a pathetic attempt to legitimise the meaningless content.
If his own personality intrudes in the fabric of the film by what he shows and how he orders it, he complements rather than obscures Crumb's genius.
I was in the city and I happened to stumble across this rather "hidden" DVD.
We have endured decades of degeneration of our own traditional values by our home-grown liberals, while they infected our lives with welfare excess, crime toleration, agenda-based education, personal merit based on skin color rather than character, the eradication of our religion, and the trashing of our Founding Fathers.
I somehow think the average slave in Louisiana in 1853 would have looked to their own safety in such epidemics and been rather neutral about the number of Caucasian - Americans who were carried off by the disease.
Tyrone Power is also in it, although he is pretty much wasted in a rather small role.
Tyrone Power was merely OK as a love interest for Marie which seemed rather gratuitous.
Not being sufficiently versed in the actual history I suspect the relation between Marie and Powers' Count Axel was blown up or perhaps even invented for drawing power, and indeed I find the film's weakest parts the rather purple moments between the two which do seem to encroach into the realm of melodrama.
It is, for the most part, a bleak, rather disturbing film, but, for those along for the ride, it's also somewhat cathartic in that it allows the viewer to vicariously get back at those who break the law and have no regard for others' feelings, property or wellbeing.
Probably the most extreme part is at the very end, when the rather sympathetic police detective (Vincent Gardenia) who's been in charge of hunting down "the vigilante" lets Kersey go - but given the vision of the city this film gives us, this isn't really unexpected.
This is not a "gun nut" blowing people away with a .44 magnum or a .308, rather it is a guy who knows so little about firearms that he uses a pathetically underpowered gun to defend himself.
This movie rediscovers the beauty of LOVE, long after the success of DDLJ, when creativity started dwindling with more and more movies trying to replicate it rather than coming up with something altogether different or FRESH.
The social ideology running through the film is provocative as well Â and somewhat disturbing Â as Paul (a rather wholesome looking yuppie) ends up being 'persecuted' by a series of casually weird performance artists, leather freaks, bikers, hippies, punks, gay people and psychologically unstable women Â this self-contained enclave of bohemia en extremis is clearly a world that the wholesome-looking Paul is incapable of comprehending, and definitely doesn't belong in.
Sure, Goodfellas has some black comedic moments, but on whole, it stands as a "drama" rather than a comedy.
A rather abysmal, plodding Blaxplotation reworking of the Frankenstein myth - sort of - best describes this 70s offering.
Probably trying to latch on to the success of Blacula(a rather good film), Blackenstein tells the story of a limbless Vietnam vet named Eddie returning only to be the guinea pig of a Nobel Peace prize winning doctor.
It would have been especially easy for Ms. Tomlin to go over the top with her depiction of the rather flighty Margo, but she manages to balance her character's peculiarities and make it look effortless.
The plot of this modern-day paean to the age of Raymond Chandler is perhaps too convoluted to follow in-depth, but that's rather easy to overlook considering it is the least important part of the picture.
I would rather watch the bible channel than this crap that's just terrifying.
The dubbing is rather good for everyone except the guy who is trying to kill Godzilla.
Something much better could have been done rather then them just "getting away" in a very improbable event.
A different but equally sad truth is stated when Elizabeth accuses Erik of being, perhaps, the one who killed John and he concurs because he did kill John rather than returning a lesser, perhaps unmanned, husband.
It's just fortunate that it turned out to be a clever, imaginative action/adventure rather than the dull-minded, big-budget exploitations we've had to endure in remakes & sequels in recent years.
The rather unsubtle innuendos of their exchange ,that indicate a very willing woman, about screwing, etc., are extremely funny.
However, he is ably supported by fellow criminals Donald Sutherland (with a rather thick & unforgiving Cockney accent) and a rather angelic performance from Leley-Anne Down as Connery's love interest.
In essence, not all that different from his James Bond character, although in this film he is given enough invention & ad-lib to make the character more rounded than the rather one-dimensional Bond.
Sutherland, offers the comic-relief, the working-class foil to Connery's respected gent, and he plays it very well, apart from the rather hammy English accent.
The other club members know him as a retired industrialist who seems rather well fixed and comfortable.
Olivia makes a tremendous leap in her acting abilities following a rather "wooden" (pun intended) performance as a mannequin in yet another Christmas television movie, "A Mom for Christmas."
Crime Wave is really well paced hard boiled Noir and at a paltry 73 minutes it passes all too quickly, it also has the distinction of being a rather important influence on Kubrick's The Killing which has a similar look and also most of the same cast.
Unfortunately ÂCandyman: Day of the Dead' is a rather ghastly entry in the series and I'm sure will not fare well amongst fans of the original.
Bronson went on to become the #1 box office star in the World (although not #1 in the USA), herein playing a street punk rather than crime fighter.
It all just worked so much better when Jed was a well-off liberal, rather than a man who seems tantamount to being a vagrant, when Claire was a poetry enthusiast, when the audience was actually left in doubt, like Claire, about the state of Joe's mental health.
Because half the scenes are cut from the book and the character of Joe isn't well played, you end up feeling sorry for Jed rather than thinking of him as abnormal.
Surrounding Craig's scientifically-minded character are similarly well-read arty north Londoners all either completely oblivious to Joe's distress or the cause of it, preferring a rather British 'take no notice' view of Jed's stalking, which I found entirely believable.
Daniel Craig,Rhys Ifans & Samantha Morton star in this rather strange drama.
Oh yes, and there's love too, which generally takes place between the bullets rather than between the sheets.
In McEwan's measured prose it kind of sneaks up on you quietly rather than being telegraphed as it is here.
All in all, it's a small film that used sets rather than location.
They never forgave the betrayal by Douglass, and soon they managed to make the woman's suffrage movement lily white (and rather racist towards the former male slaves who now - theoretically - could vote).
There's a scene where Rebecca, frustrated by Enid's inability to make up her mind, blurts out rather cruelly "good luck living with your father for the rest of your life".
Enid plays a rather cruel joke on Seymour by responding to a personal ad he put in the paper.
The comedy in Ghost World is not the gut-busting type, but rather the quiet situational type that's amusing.
In fact there are many teenagers out there who are rather intelligent, mature and wise beyond their years yet still like their basic humour associated with other peoples demise, which in this film, is done amazingly well and it is quite relatable when we see Enid and Rebecca laughing at the "satanists" in the diner.
What Ghost World also holds is mountains and mountains of culture all dating way back to the 1960's Bollywood films and the 1970's underground music which is so satisfying to see now as so many people my age don't comprehend or care for, they prefer trash that MTV spits in our faces and know we'll love it and buy but the thing is, because the majority is rather culturally inept and likes anything dating from 2001 to modern times, leaves the other types left out, where do they go?
I rather enjoyed it but realize it's not for every taste.
Also, one might ask for a slightly tighter ending, as the film finishes without much resolution--except for one rather simple but touching scene between Enid and Seymour.
I would have thought he would have realised that aristocratic girls back then did not 'pass out' but rather fainted.
Once you get by the endless Holmes clichÃ©s and crutches, the weak plot and the fact that this Holmes is rather distasteful, it's a passable film.
I was rather fascinated by Watson's ears... but a wonderful bit of acting as literature's most put-upon-best-mate-and-colleague.
It's in fact rather creepy, and the sets are beautiful.
Some of the discussions between the characters regarding the murders tend toward being a little graphic, but it is most interesting listening to the rather repressed Holmes discussing the details of sexually motivated crimes!
No gasp of astonishment when Holmes revealed himself from a costume that by the way, seemed rather anachronistic of the late Victorian and early Edwardian era, just a look of slight betrayal and lack of amusement.
Perhaps the casual viewer might find this interesting, but as Holmsian I found it rather exasperating.
rather than the sleepy, Johnny-one-note performance of Everett.
However, it doesn't quite measure up to the potent subject with its theatrical presentation, clipped dialogue, time wasting filler, staginess, poor character depth, confusing language and dialect issues, and a rather contrived monologue at the end.
I watched the 'Grey Zone' some months before I left, and yes to echo some I found the acting somewhat overdone in places and the first bit of the movie rather confusing.
How absurd can that be -- to save the life of someone who will sooner rather than later be murdered by the Nazis anyway?!
I rather expected a dull, perhaps gritty story of a dysfunctional family with likely a bit of outside racism thrown in for good measure.
Any gags occur naturally within this context rather than being contrived and the film is better for this.
Adapting the historical incident, Keaton made himself the engineer of the stolen train (Johnnie Gray), rather than one of the raiders.
As he saw immediately, The General is one long chase, or rather two chases, structured like the flight of a boomerang.
Despite the rather sordid unhappy atmosphere of the film.
The script and direction of are simply too bland for the story, but more importantly we simply do not care about the character, and most of them are rather unsympathetic.
A rare 50s epic shot in Hollywood rather than Cinecitta, it falls somewhere between De Mille Â the apprentice child priestess in her miniature chariot drawn by a goat could be straight out of the opening of the silent King of Kings Â and MGM at its most opulent.
I found it rather interesting that more than once, I felt like I was invading these character's lives.
It's nice to see it taking on a different form this time rather than just playing in the background.
I found Explorers to be a rather interesting film.All sci-fi's I have seen have many things in common,They all go to space,see aliens... but I can't think of any that do -other than Explorers,(fill me in if I'm wrong)explain HOW a spaceship is made?
Wolfgang MÃ¼ller (River Phoenix) is the intelligent creator of complex things, Ben Crandall (Ethan Hawke) is the dreamer but his intelligence is not to be underestimated and Darren Woods (Jason Presson) is a normal, but a bit lonely, kid who happened to stumble into Ben's life and sees the opportunity to 'escape' from or rather to forget his problems at home for a while.
They then take their device for a rather humorous test drive, but near the end of their first run something seems to take control of their ship...they avoid disaster and then another dream shows them how to make a device that seems to provide air.
The movie goes at a rather good pace and is very funny.
It's rather tragic.
On top of that, foreign official in Georgia Pier Lewis, who constantly makes fun of the company's methods (as cutting power for a few minutes in an airport for not paying its bills, when a plane was about to land) and the Georgian people's reactions, is a rather pathetic character, making one wonder if he's ever heard the word humanism.
But Tarzan and Jane have become rather attached to their little tyke, and aren't about to give him up, especially when they discover that two of the visitors only want Boy for his vast inheritance.
Granted, a happy and stable marriage does not make much juicy filler for a movie, but we really don't get much of a feel for who this woman was, but rather who she was for Paul McCartney.
Most of the real-life characters portrayed here resemble their counterparts, but the thrust of the movie is on the story rather than slavishly recreating the look of any particular time period.
However, the reason the tag lines and previews are misleading, is because the movie is more focused on the horse ranch, rather than on her personal situation.
As for Julia Roberts, I prefer her in this kind of film rather than heavy drama, because I don't care for her very external acting.
Odd to term a 1995 film as an 'older movie', but SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT was rather dismissed in its initial release as a bit of fluff: looking at the film now reveals a tight little message movie garnished with a fine writer (Callie Khouri - 'Thelma and Louise', 'Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood'), and first class director (Lasse HallstrÃ¶m - 'Casanova', 'An Unfinished Life', 'The Shipping News', 'Chocolat', 'The Cider House Rules', 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' etc), and a cast that has not only grown in importance from the time of this film but has also become acknowledged as the creme of the cinema.
The story is rather slight: Grace (Julia Roberts) is a Southern Belle horse trainer married to handsome but womanizing Eddie (Dennis Quaid) who discovers to her amazement that Eddie is dating other women.
For Carlitos (Adrian Alonso), despite the gifts that mom sends back home to him, he misses her much and prefers that she is back in Mexico rather than working in the US.
Natalie Wood's VERY early portrayal of a native-speaking Austrian girl is rather remarkable for her age, too.
This simplistic view of two "mental illnesses" gets dressed up with 1) obsessed chick arranging to meet (and sleep with, equally of course) wheelchair bound guy via the plot device of anonymously informing him of a human interest story (he is an NPR-radio-station-type reporter) 2) utterly stupid 'human interest story' (an urban legend style boffo about a bunch of people who "wannabe" paralyzed for no particular reason whatsoever) 3) "magic fred astaire shoes" (of course, again, the shoes are nothing more than a mental "crutch" the guy is subconsciously using to give himself a reason to walk... that enable wheelchair guy to walk...after falling down a lot, only very slowly, with crutches or a cane...sort of like you'd expect someone who has been working out to retard muscular atrophy but who hasn't stood or walked for years to behave when finally standing and walking... 3) a few couldabeengreat lines that came off as too silly to be taken half-seriously because of the trying-to-be-an-allegory but frankly rather silly plot.
His co-star, Rick Moranis, plays just about the same character as in "Honey, I shrunk the kids" and its sequels, so that is not really interesting to watch either but I would rather see a whole movie with that character again and the rather lame love story between him and Joan Cusack than spend it watching Martin squint and squirm his way through every stereotypical mannerism we associate with Wise's.
It was a rather important and memorable part of my young life:I was getting ready to move off to college(among other things)and was needing a little distraction.
When Woody asks the stunning gal if she wants to dance and she says get lost creep and his answer to Linda is she'd rather not has to crack up any one who ever saw this movie.
My own mother was a real beauty in the l940s, and seeing the fashions of that time really made me wish I was a woman during that era rather than a child.
It's set in San Francisco, not New York, and is directed by Herbert Ross rather than Allen himself.
Diane is very pretty in this movie, although I think now she looks rather cruel when she is serious, but man i liked her dresses so much I hardly noticed her acting (sorry, can't help it as a girl).
While he did not direct it, but rather, only wrote a screen adaptation of his own play, this overlooked slapstick film from 1972 is one of Woody Allen's finest treasures.
Aside from some significant progression in the two main characters, where Sam expresses some past conflict with their father, "Bugs" is a rather weak episode with not nearly enough focus on the revealed swarm seen at the end.
Sam and Dean, thanks to the writers who have depended on co-incidental rather than an intelligent mystery-solving story, get lucky throughout the story and use none of their daemon-hunting skills that the show is all about.
Sam is bitter because he wanted to play soccer rather than go bow-hunting.
There are some lapses in credibility beginning with Elizabeth's inability to recognize John and ending with her rather sudden resignation that John is right in his perspective on the past.
Caper movies are among my favorites (maybe, it's because I work in a bank) but this is a very mild addition to that exciting thriller subgenre Â chiefly because of an unconvincing plot also involving child kidnapping, a counter robbery from a church to mislead the Israeli police, the gang donning a series of silly disguises and, ultimately, a burglary which remains unfulfilled (again, a fashionable twist in the cynical 1970s but rather ludicrous in this context!
I was rather surprised, it being one of the few Fred Astaire musicals I had never seen and recently reading some adverse comment to the effect that it was for the completist only!
He gets through partners rather quickly too, since they die, become super-powered ghost partners and then get re-incarnated.
Bender: one of the most popular TV characters of all time - an amazing feat since Futurama was mostly a cult favorite rather than mainstream.
Also of note is the colour of skin, pink rather than Simpsons yellow.
Stories tended to be organic in nature and the humor developed from the characters, rather than just the situations (A very Simpson-esquire idea).
The series itself does however contain some sexual humor that is structured rather uniquely to simply pass over young children's heads.
It's rather tragic that this brilliant piece of comedy is not that well known, as it should be.
The whole tension rides on which of these two ladies Gable chooses - or, rather, which one the audience wants him to choose.
As is obvious in the complex responses to both the book and the film by Errol Morris and Philip Gourevitch, STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE places in our faces some facts we would rather shield than discuss.
The rather boring script is written by John C. Champion, who takes the X raid on the German pocket battleship Tirpitz and turns it into what should be a rousing tale of heroism and courage.
They waste their time with interrogations about a surviving submarine, rather than doing something practical Â such as sending one of dozens of E-Boats out to search for the sneaky enemy vessel!
Interestingly enough, there is one blond bombshell Â but she only gets once scene and then is forgotten rather abruptly.
The defense and ultimate loss of the obsolete island fortress of Corregidor, here immortalized (less rather than more) in the film of the same name was, with the fall of the archipelago, a far more serious geo-strategic blow to America than Pearl Harbor.
Since nobody bothers to tell the audience, the kid remains a caricature rather than a character, and the final conflict between the astronaut and him remains something of a contrivance rather than a believable series of events.
This is perhaps one of the dirtiest looking movies of its day, which rather adds to the already oppresive atmosphere.
Following this rather well done sequence, they are quickly brought down and then one of them is just as quickly devoured by starving, irradiated homeless teenagers... and it just gets campier from there.
Or something...end up being in space while nuclear war happens on earth, only to crash-land on earth sometime later...not MUCH later, but society seems to have changed rather quickly and gotten that dirty Mad Max Punk Rocker type look to it.
To be honest, the first half of the movie is totally missable and rather confusing.
Most of the blame for the failure of the film must be laid at his door as it was he, rather than Hitchcock, who had the final say on these matters.
It's not without it's humorous jabs at both the upper and lower class and although it's rather over the top, Charles Laughton's performance is almost enough to carry the film alone.
A rather odd time and plot (and it shows) for the usually contemporary setting Hitchcock it deals with 18th century pirates that manufacture ship wrecks along the coast of Cornwall.
Unfortunately a lot of the story elements are very predictable -- Laughton's behavior from the very beginning is far from the "gentleman" who O'Hara seems to take him for rather naively even though she's seen him toss a bag of coins to his compatriots after losing a bet on her beauty.
Certainly an exceptional British film from the period, giving us a rather unusual story filmed with great skill and played by a group of talented actors.
Examples include the zither music, the dispassionate and unsympathetic characters, the lack of concern demonstrated by the protagonist concerning his danger (denying the viewer real suspense), the absence of "preaching" about the horrors of post-War Europe, the refusal to show the film's climax, and shots that make you want to look at the architecture rather than the people.
SPOILER  I would like my 50th user comment to celebrate a rather special film, so what better than a thanksgiving for "The Third Man".
"The Third Man" is a masterpiece because it states, or rather understates, some most perceptive things about the human condition.
It is impossible to understand human chemistry, why Anna should be attracted to the amoral and ruthless Harry rather than kindly Holly who wants so much to give.
And, finally, the bozos in this column who disliked the music because it had an "Hawaiian sound" must have thought they were listening to Arthur Godfrey on the ukelele rather than Anton Karas' zither.
Contrary to what many critics have claimed, the actual story is rather complicated.
I do not take this as a director trying to give the audience what he wants them to see, but rather a director in touch with his feelings and ideas.
For those of you who have not seen the Hitchcock classic "Dial M For Murder" on which "A Perfect Murder" is based, let's just say they are two equally suspenseful films that are in many ways similar but in many more rather different.
I was definitely glad I rented it, rather than paid full price at the theatre.
The mood of the movie is also set by rather dramatic music, which clearly emphases that these issues are important and have to be taken seriously.
They became immersed in 'pop culture' (as another reviewer here notes) rather than having any historical or dramatic interest; 'Apocalypse Now', 'Platoon', 'Full Metal Jacket', etc., despite their respective claims to be hard-hitting, uncompromising, gritty dramas, etc.
It is, rather, a compelling exploration of the hubris and naivete that shaped the American war effort.
It makes the sequence feel rather limited in terms of its mood, acting and overall storytelling.
The plot has something to do with the adult children of a family finding out that their mother hasn't really been dead, rather she was changed into a vampire and had been kept locked up by their father in a secret crypt.
She actually looks like portraits of women of the era rather than a conventionally movie star.
If you would rather think and watch a more plot driven film try American Beaty, Fight Club, The Usuall Suspects, The Aviator and many more.
Some of the explosions are huge, the fights are varied & well staged & most of the action is done the good old fashioned way on set in camera with real stunt men & real explosions rather than awful CGI computer effects which have become commonplace.
If you want to see a little of the real Japan then watch this movie rather than "Lost in Translation" (which would have been better if it was filmed in New York so the director knew what she was talking about).
Germans and Japanese have a lot in common so that makes the misunderstandings real rather than the usual "foreigners in Japan trying to make the Japanese seem like savage aliens".
THe main part is about the hunter dude who decides that he would rather hunt strippers than deer.
Don't be put off by the nudity as the worst thing about 'Naked Fear' is its rather lurid title.
It's not exactly a movie that brings out a whole lot of belly laughs; rather it's the accumulation of just solid chuckles, guffaws, and the occasional fall-on-the-floor moment that hit the best with characterization, behavior, mannerisms, manners.
Though slightly better than its predecessor (CROW: CITY OF ANGELS), this one follows Crow numero dos by ripping off the scenario of the superior original film rather than acting as a sequel.
While watching the film, I took note of a few things, these were: The acting was very poor and would have been better if performed by monkeys, the lighting was so dark that you could barely see anything correctly, the audio track was so quite that you could barely understand the actors, and it lost all meaning of the story rather quickly.
For the third Crow outing, I was left feeling rather skeptical of watching this considering the disaster with City of Angels?
The only drawback is that it was a rather complex mystery with a lot of misdirection, and having to watch it in a cliffhanger serial format was extremely frustrating.
It is all beautiful to look at but some of the moments are rather far fetched and not explained well enough or deepened out good enough, which makes the movie not always a believable one to watch.
There are some artistic and original sequences that I rather liked, although that also is what makes "Birth" a movie that not just for everyone.
Instead, he makes a different choice but ruins it still with an uncalled for action (disgusting action rather) that was drop dead uproarious to me.
The acting really sunk this film to a one star status rather than two stars.
I can tell the filmmaker was inspired more by the gangster films he loves out there rather than his own life.
Ordinary Cambodians are still grieving rather than blaming.
I would have preferred it if Lucas has continued in this direction rather than become overly enamored with special effects in his subsequent films.
Unlike the typical example from the short-lived but oddly prolific Nazisploitation subgenre, THE RED NIGHTS OF THE GESTAPO does not deal with the dehumanizing activities in Nazi concentration camps but rather with all the salacious perversions that a group of renegade anti-Nazi Germans get down to when they are holed up in a castle one night under the supposed pretext of plotting Hitler's downfall.
But, for most of the film's running time, the Gestapo's intentions seem not to find out how the latter plan to overthrow the Nazi regime but rather to prove that even these would-be saviours of the Fatherland have their sordid weaknesses: aided by a handful of truly loose women, the meeting degenerates into one sleaze marathon which ends with the unceremonious gunning down of all concerned by SS troops.
With a script that delves rather too deeply into the political history of the Nazis circa 1941, Fabio De Agostini's movie proves to be more concerned with factual accuracy than in delivering sleaze.
And with the entire movie set in a castle, rather than a concentration camp (like so many other films of its ilk), we don't even get any unnecessarily painful experimentation performed on prisoners.
We've all become paranoid little f***'s who waste our time on shallow small talk and brainless entertainment rather than having real conversations on real topics and devouring real culture.
You will find many points that leave a rather ambivalent impression concerning realism - the ending has to be called "fantasy like".
The rather negative way in which the TV executives appear might even be called too optimistic - while in the movie they seem just to be immoral and very well knowing what they do, reality might look somewhat worse: Most of the people in charge are probably acting in accordance to their very own moral principles.
This view is plausible not because of the concept of reincarnation, rather for his inability to remember that he was dishonest to his wife and betrayed her.
I don't know about the time of the film's release, but these days the sexperts chat is unintentionally hilarious, as the foursome are humourless, po-faced and rather brusque in their talk (as well as being an extremely plain verging on ugly bunch).
Here the film falls even further into risibility, as although these couples are meant to represent (or actually be) real people, they are so one-dimensional, robotic and mono-subject orientated that they seem like no one anyone has even met in this world, rather being dead ringers for the inhabitants of some future Brave New World-type dystopia.
I was starting to think you weren't some story-driven, twist-crazed, formulaic egotist and were rather a guy who has trapped himself in his own image.
The film is not just a story of faith but also of growing up and realising the world is not a simple place with absolutes, rather things may not always be what they seem.
I suppose there's potential in a comic examination of last minute wedding jitters; but this turkey spends more time fobbing us off with unbelievable scenarios, rather than dirty its hands by tackling something as mature as 'psychology'.
The only named character without dialogue and who is told what to do by her fine bossy aristocratic English mistress but who seems as if she would rather have nothing to do with the whole affair.
Having finally sat down to watch this film early this morning I was rather surprised by this little UK propaganda film.
There's also the staging of the battle sequences that, like many films of this era, seems rather dated today with all its hollering and men falling over.
Seen with the benefit of hindsight, the story is rather far-fetched, since there really was no serious threat of a German invasion after 1940, but of course those making the movie (and those watching it) didn't have the benefit of hindsight, and so it has to be seen for what it is: a well done bit of movie-making encouraging the English to fight back in case it did happen.
Although it clearly was propaganda to an extent, the movie didn't have what I would consider to be a typical "propaganda" feel to it, which I appreciated, and which makes it interesting rather than dated even today.
Despite its rather tortuous title this is a great piece of British WWII propaganda with a simple message: The Nazis are a bunch of child-murdering blackguards, and we Brits will see through their dastardly plans and overcome them using our doughty pluck and the intelligence of our womenfolk and children.
It had lots of blood, lots of kills and was rather tense.
The rest of the story is the basic Chainsaw premise of the two couples stranded in the middle of nowhere, this time a wreck the cause of the problem, a rather gruesome wreck.
This sequel, or rather prequel is also a lot better than the only sequel I ever saw to the original The Next Generation as that one wasn't very gory at all and itself was sort of a remake of the original.
I for one am glad that movies like TCM the beginning come out now and again to the same Criticisms that should be praised rather than scored, but then again i am of a generation that applauds the blood, and Gratuitous violence and dreary depression or horror, instead of going eeewww thats gross!
That is just my general overview if you are the type of person who wishes to see a huge hulking serial killer demolish people, rather than some little bug eyed kid, or old man with a fisherman's hook then by all means see TCM the beginning, otherwise stay home and complain about the lack of all elements that have ruined most horror films over the past decade.
the odd character didn't seem to have much of a purpose other than to die horribly and scared teenage girls still have that tendency to walk towards the screams of pain rather than leg it, but the grimness and violence of it all was pretty much relentless.
Although the remake in 2003 was excellent and had a tighter, more involving plot than this film, it breaks a barrier because rather than directly approaching the style of the remake and trying to live up to its success, this equally grisly thriller ignores all of the gloss, cinematography, pacing and story that it was inspired from.
Besides one scene in a Shoe store i think his performance is rather average.
Thankfully, the filmmakers made a thoughtful selection and didn't pick one of them to fill this rather demanding role.
You should be happy that we have talented directors and actors to portray this terrible way of life rather than experiencing it our selves forever.
What was even worse was the rather unscary make-up involved with the creatures from the other side.
Unlike "A Tale of Two Sisters", which also has a rather hard-to-follow plot line, "Pulse" clears up very little at the end and left me feeling frustrated, confused and uninterested in the characters' endeavors.
Kairo, or Pulse as it's known amongst English speaking audiences, is set in Tokyo & starts as Sunny Plant Sales employee Michi Kudo (Kumiko Aso) decides to visit her friend Taguchi (Kenji Mizuhashi) to enquire about a computer disk he's been working on, when she gets to his place he gives her the disk but then rather inconsiderately commits suicide in front of her.
Not a bad little Japanese horror flick, this, but while it is creepy and disturbing I must say that I felt rather lost trying to keep up with or figure out what was going on.
Still though, it has a certain creepiness and gloom about it, a sense of dread, that comes across rather well.
I'm a jaded horror-movie fan, hence approximately once in a blue moon do I get to watch a film from this genre that has me glued to the screen rather than bored or sneering/almost laughing at the gore when I'm not supposed to.
But perhaps that was the key here, the essential ingredient - or rather the lack of it: the fact that there is no gore.
Just like in the Japanese "Ringu", the eeriness comes out of what is insinuated rather than catchup-stained limbs flying through rooms as if they had wings.
Frankly, most of this seemed rather silly and lost me.
I've seen both RINGU as well as THE RING, JU-ON and THE GRUDGE and was rather ambivalent despite their popularity.
A Game For Vultures is rather confused and heavy-handed.
James Fargo directs rather lethargically, making the plot unbearably hard-to-follow on the one hand while over-simplifying the racial themes on the other.
Quite possibly the worst film I've ever seen, especially considering it's not even a FILM, but rather a shot on digital video, no budget, poorly acted, poorly directed, and poorly scripted amateur fest from beginning to end.
The former one is rather decent, still "normal" and "appropriate" male who searches the ideal woman.
It is rather a harmful and confusing movie which does not have much to offer, something even Fellini buffs criticize.
But tunnel is darkness and art is not there to lead us to darkness but rather out of it, to the spiritual horizons of light and beauty.
The film is rather a straight forward re-creation of some battles fought hard and won (or lost) in the foundation of modern Cuba and late 60's Bolivia.
For me, there's only 3 good things in Che Part1: i) Benicio DelToro's casting, and his marvelous PRIMARY makeup job--but not his bizarre, integrally terrible graying wriggler in Pt2--Benicio's leanness and beard are astonishingly close to some rather unflattering photos of Che; ii) Seeing Che soberly and meaningfully address the UN in 1964 as Cuba's post-revolutionary Minister of Economics; and iii) the scope of the battle of Santa Clara (near the end of Pt1).
So in terms of historical accuracy Che falters and ultimately that leads to the dearth and want of something a little more cerebral and provocative rather than an exercise in cinematic and narrative technique, however laudable that is.
It is obvious from their conversation that the story wants to remind us of how charismatic Fidel Castro is, of how he can influence a doctor into believing that waging a revolutionary war would make a more drastic change rather than simply healing a man in some clinic in the middle of nowhere.
And rather a good one.
A director who was capable of describing such a multiplicity of viewpoints (in his earlier film, Traffic) or bringing a real character to life on screen with emotional force (as in Erin Brockovich) was giving me something rather bland and unquestioning (Oliver Stone's insipid Comandante was already coming to mind).
However there is no emotional core or compassionate deliverance to make this anything more than interesting, and is a friendly inspection of Che's mindset rather than anything inspiring.
Much of the score in Che is over-dramatic and frictional to the narrative, it tries to up the tempo but it comes across as rather willful and disjointed.
Sometimes you almost feel like you're watching a documentary that's trying to teach rather than entertain and this can start to wear, especially when you're reading subtitles.
Of course, when I use the word documentary, I don't mean it literally, but rather, as a means to say that the approach its director takes it similar to those used by directors of documentaries.
Yes, there are scenes that drag on and on, and generally some of these seem superfluous and dubious to the overall arc of the production, but for the most part, the script and direction remains coherent in its willingness to merely document rather than emote.
So what we get in Part 1, the conventional "Rise" of the character in the story, is the tale of how to do a revolution right- or rather, how to take over a government by military force, and it's Che as a man who pretty quickly becomes a natural leader, a stern taskmaster and also someone who "loves" as a revolutionary must, Che says.
His presence, utterly submerged in his character, gives the impression of a patient, caring Guevara, steely, rather than fiery and almost never ill-tempered.
The only problem with the film I had was that it seems to have a little too much of a feel of a war film rather than a biopic.
The film is not all that well known today, and that is probably because it is rather derivative of other and better known westerns; most obvious is the climatic shootout sequence towards the end which directly 'borrows' from Sergio Leone's masterpiece The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.
He is also reunited with his Django lead man, Franco Nero (here speaking for himself rather than being dubbed, which is very welcome), as well as having prominent Italian actor Tony Musante and Hollywood veteran Jack Palance on board for his most high-class line up yet.
One of the reasons Corbucci really stands out as a spaghetti western director is that he has his own very distinct style, rather than simply copying the master Sergio Leone.
This is most evident in the numerous scenes where the taciturn Nero gets the brash Musante out of trouble or, conversely, 'sells' him to the authorities...and even more in the rather splendid showdown between the three characters, undoubtedly the film's highlight - given another dimension by being set in a bullring with Palance sporting a wig (he's nicknamed Curly!)
It's another buddy western with a Nordic (blond) and a Mexican guy where the first is cool and intelligent and the other hot tempered and rather low witted.
This is a humble TV movie that intends to be more of a study of a brotherly bond rather than a study in Luekemia.
Actually, it exudes a rather classy atmosphere (with cinematography by the renowned Roger Fellous) peculiar to French horror cinema Â similar, in fact, to other Mondo Macabro releases such as MILL OF THE STONE WOMEN (1960), THE DIABOLICAL DR. Z (1965), GIRL SLAVES OF MORGANA LE FAY (1971) and SEVEN WOMEN FOR Satan (1974).
It's rather odd, however, that no revenge was visited upon the spited socialite who perpetrated Duperey's accident.
As a comedy, a good chunk of that nastiness earns a good deal of laughs, especially when it involves the innocence of kids rather than the awfulness of the adults.
The film itself is very much like the prints in that Harrison does play a rather useless rich jerk, though the ending was quite different.
Despite all his breeding and money, he manages to squander away all his family's good will by always managing to screw up his rather easy life by drinking, lying, womanizing and using practically everyone around him.
I've been a single mother for 14 years now, and my son is generally viewed as quirky and shy rather than disabled: only time will tell how well he will do in the world.
Alley makes the most of a rather unpleasant role and gave us a memorable television experience, light years away from her role as Rebecca Howe on CHEERS.
Realistic rather than sentimental, an unpleasant topic successfully presented with first-rate editing, acting and direction.
Payne is rather cool, as the lead.
KCC may be seen as a lesson of noir, as a core film, and as a rehabilitation of the genre into the class of the adventurous thrillers (rather than the cheaply philosophical fatalism).
KANSAS Â has some of the ingredients of the noir (it is a rather pleasant surprise not to have a standard femme fatal); yet on the other hand, it seems a bit too selfÂaware, selfÂconscientious as a cool noirÂin a way that better movies (like DOA and SUDDENLY) are not.
It's coolness is a bit too obvious and rather overstated.
Tracking down Foster and company is no picnic for Joe, but he manages to clear himself in the end rather neatly.
Slightly marred by a rather sappy conclusion, "Kansas City Confidential" overall still rates highly as the authentic gnarly noir article.
He interviews Tommy Iommi, guitarist for Black Sabbath, rather than the more obvious choice in frontman Ozzy Osbourne (whom I believe would not have been as interesting an interviewee).
For metal die-hards, yes there will be bands that are not covered here (the melodic death metal scene, for example, is only noted, doom metal is not here), but the documentary serves as an overview rather than an encyclopedia in moving pictures.
It has an excellent global rather than US or British focus and covers everything from the roots of metal to all it's various past and present incarnations with almost all of the information coming from either band members themselves, fans or interested third parties from various academic backgrounds.
I wasn't expecting a definitive work on one of my favorite kinds of music but rather what had been touted as a love-letter to heavy metal artists and fans.
This was not a corny VH1 type of special but rather a heartfelt tip of the hat to a culture that is still going on with teenagers and with us slightly older folks.
In doing so Dunn categorizes Metal into different subgenres (a process that will always lead to a lot of discussion among fans as proved by the IMDb boards), he tries to find the origins of Metal and divides his survey rather cleverly in chapters like "Religion And Satanism", "Gender And Sexuality" or "Death And Violence".
For an anthropologist, Dunn is far too concerned about the different styles of back and death metal, rather than reviewing metal as a phenomenon and culture around the world.
A certain number of people are killed during the course of the film, which gives a rather black tone to it, and to be fair, this contrasts alarmingly with the gorgeous exotic sets.
It is not all about computers and technology or whatever you would contribute to the description of the movie, but rather it's a pretty good thriller.
Sneakers is done with a lot of flash and style, but in the end it's all rather silly.
I found the stories fresh, realistic, and full of literary references that fleshed out the scripts rather than purloined as borrowed lines uttered by the actors.
The most notable ones were the loss of the wonderful doctor (played by Barry Morse) and the introduction of a shape-shifting alien (Maya) who seemed rather inappropriate to the style of the show.
The sets and costumes and even the special effects were actually rather good but not more impressive than UFO four or five years earlier.
The stories to me are positively weird, a lot of them being fairly esoteric and ending in a rather anti-climactic way.
It had potential, but it just seemed to have the need to sell in many markets so that it could pay its bills, rather than just to tell great stories.
The screenplay is much more interested in introducing a lot of characters to you rather than fleshing any of them out.
As a TV pilot, it showed that it might have eventually become rather interesting.
Written and directed by people who should've known better, "Doctors' Wives" was considered pretty heavy stuff in its day (the first time it ran on network TV, there was a "parental discretion" warning preceding the movie), but its 'raciness' is now rather quaint.
Their differences prove effective as the generator of the comedic effect, although -in my opinion- this movie is also a solid drama rather than a simple comedy.
However, I found myself rather enjoying this film for many reasons.
The story is not meant as history, but rather an examination of social disparities.
Director/Co-writer Joe CastroÂOne of the effects artists at SOTA effects, a company who's work in the past has usually been less-than-stellarÂwould have been much better off handling the gore rather than writing/directing, because he shows no sense of pacing.
Actually this all happens rather fast and I was hoping for a little more character development but heck, the director was in a hurry to get to the gore and that's what the people who went to see this movie were waiting for.
See this movie only to see how well a thriller can be done, and how important it is not to go the cheap way and go for a big shock, that destroys characters rather than makes your jaw drop in awe.
With most viewers being either misled by the similarities to Agatha Christie's "Ten Little Indians", or just pompously broadcasting their knowledge that this movie was inspired by such, they seem to have missed the point that this was not a "murder mystery" per se, but rather, a finely-crafted journey through the mind of a multiple personality during the course of purging his violent personas.
Tyrone Power was at a stage in his career when he wanted more serious roles rather than stay forever fixed in the minds of movie-goers as a swashbuckling star.
Each actor contributed in their minor roles, - nice to see Stephen Boyd in an earlier role - Lloyd Nolan seen rather briefly, and Mai Zetterling as the nurse who was supportive throughout.
I don't know why 'Dennis' only receives a 4.7 rating on IMDb because it is a rather enjoyable film with plenty of cute/funny moments that leave you chuckling so surely deserves a few points more.
Dennis is wide-eyed and innocent and the slap-stick scenarios are 'accidental' rather than contrived as in "Home Alone."
I don't want my money back, so much as I would rather pay more money to ensure no one involved in this project ever worked in film again.
If the movie hearkens back to simpler, more clear-cut times, it is at least nice to see heroes who genuinely like each other and who can get the job done while having some fun doing it, rather than today's friendless, dour-faced loners with chips on their shoulders who spend every waking minute searching for "the truth."
Then comes the standard cops do not believe a thing scene that usually appear in movies of this sort and then a rather interesting dream sequence.
They happen to have a rather lame weakness that is really quite easy for anyone to use.
I thought that was rather lame, but I guess you gotta kill them somehow.
Shame, because her acting was rather good - as was most of the cast, to be fair.
"Neon Maniacs" is a fun and pretty fast-paced flick that I dug quite a bit.It has plenty of violence including decapitations,an axe to the face,a guy cut in half etc.The film ends rather abruptly and it leaves the door open for a sequel,which will never happen I suppose.All in all "Neon Maniacs" is an underrated little flick that surely needs more recognition.One of the best horror movies of the 80's-a must-see for true horror buffs!
After all, any non-zombified fan has to admit that the cartoons have rather poor animation when compared to the Looney Toons and MGM cartoons of the era.
This is a rather poor compilation of supposedly award winning and nominated films.
Poor because several of the films are very lame and are NOT award nominated, the prints are rather bad and parts of some of the cartoons are missing!
Carrey is as funny as ever, this time playing a stupid rather than a sort of psycho wiseguy.
Ultimately, Vitus possesses a quality that most American music films lack which make it a film worth owning, rather than simply renting or borrowing.
There does seem to be a good bit of propaganda for the Russian Army (the way all the commanding officers are big softies and frequently bend the rules), and this does seem rather disingenuous.
Bad things start happening in Joshua's household from day one (the film takes us, rather harrowingly, through 70-plus).
This could be rather fun for a young viewer, though some American critics have found this charming story "simplistic" or "sappy."
They stay rather caught in conservative dogmas, which where made to control man and are far away from a healthy human experience.
There may have been reasons for this depiction but one should rather try not to confuse it with the an authentic account; this account one should rather get in contact with real orders.
I will not go into the story of this movie but rather just ask, who doesn't like a good 'ol HP Lovecraft story?
With the exception of Andrei Tarkovsky, Soviet cinema remains rather unknown this side of the Atlantic.
His house is rather drab, but she seems okay with it.
Grigori Chukhrai's Soviet film Ballad of a Soldier begins with a downbeat and downcast voice-over informing us of a situation in which a young boy's mother will never have the chance to have recited to her the rather epic story her fateful son has to tell.
She gazes, ruefully, down a broad road leading off into the distance as she stands on the brink of where her town and general dwelling area meets wilderness; a longing look on her face and an uneasy establishment of power over a rather forlorn figure established within us.
If anything, Chukhrai's film victimises the 'little guy', or the poorer and more grounded characters such as Alyosha and those he encounters - it pities them and presents their situation as less than desirable; whereas stately figures such as soldiers and others of various degrees of authority are hard-nosed, seemingly uncompromising and find it rather difficult to understand the true nature of human emotion.
The rather ham-fisted editing further adds to confusion, with sequences ending to suddenly, settings changing without proper establishment, and events being referred to which the audience never saw take place (though, this may be since I saw an incomplete version).
Mr. Brando's rather short stint in the film was punctuated by terse, cynical and penetrating dialog, playing the enterprising villain who continually cuts to the chase with large doses of street-wise metaphors.
Come to think of it I think I would have rather seen a movie based on the internal battles of the studio/writer and the director then this mess.
Director Chukhrai shows little of the overpoweringly visual virtuosity of Kalatozov's film (except for the superb sequence near the beginning which earns the main character his heroic status) preferring to capture the reality of the scene rather than its emotional core.
The film begins well, and moves slowly - some might feel too slowly for a film without truly effective revelations - towards a rather low-key showdown between the two adversaries.
Not a terrible movie, just a rather flat, uneventful and predictable one.
Particularly Starbuck (Dirk Benedict), who tries so hard to be Han Solo, but only comes off as petulant, sexist, and rather pathetic.
The age difference shows in that she is still a child and wants to play rather than behave like an adult.
He finds a raft to get home rather than wait as his leave is almost up.
However, despite a notable cast (Keith Carradine, Susan Sarandon, Barbara Steele and Gerrit Graham), the film only really comes to life - after a rather wandering first half - when the Lolita-esquire elements of the Brooke Shields character take center stage.
The most controversial part of all of this comes down to this really- underage sex, or rather a form of twisted, really non-consensual sex that ends up just skimming the line of bad taste.
Actually, now that I think about it, I think I like the fact that the film allows me to be disturbed on my own rather than hitting me over the head and telling me how I should feel (as Hollywood always does).
With that in mind, the atmosphere of impending tragedy colours the entire film despite the film's rather charming presentation.
Patrick Dewaere was a wonderful comic actor (see him in Les Valseuses), while Ariel Besse was rather, er, young.
Yes, I am aware of the fact the rather vulgar and tasteless subject line entirely misfits the overall tone of this film, but when else am I going to have the chance to use this clichÃ©d saying in a review?
Extremely well by a rather difficult role.
The cast of characters is rather extended.
Little Noises offers moments that leave the viewer saddened rather than laughing.
The kid's pretty talented, how about we give him a freaking CHARACTER to play rather than an amalgam of heart-warming looks.
The would-be female lead seems to have used all her resources, all the accrued influence available at the autumn of her career- not to entertain but rather to keep her "credit" from the leading titles, ...BH only admitting to having perpetrated "Eva" at the final moments of film.
I started out disliking this, but ended up rather enjoying it.
The story is told in the form of a rather obnoxious reporter interviewing Henry, the senator's son.
However, in rather typical Avery style, the characters step out of the tale and demand that this dull story be updated.
The movie is rather long, but it is worth watching it all-- take it bit by bit!
Jane is, although maybe not for our standards pretty, a very classic beauty, and very much in character.The Bingley sisters are wonderfully arrogant, and Bingley is such a nice guy - not the insipid undecided, but rather too much trusting those he holds dear.
He perfectly blends all these different traits and is utterly convincing in portraying the outward stiffness as a simple facade for the strong emotions and character underneath, rather than simply being stiff and wooden.
I had to try it on many people before I lost my nerve, with some rather hilarious results.
But the ending does sneak up on one rather fast and the pieces of the puzzle are too simple, but this is a 20's film parody, after all.
Almost everyone around him is seen as crabby and foul-mouthed, whereas Johnny is perpetually cheerful, resorting to colorful 1920s slang instead of cussing the air blue, and using his keen wits rather than his fists to get out of a dangerous situation.
The plot you can see unfold rather quick.
For a long time, I wanted a stronger proponent from the left, but after considering all of them, the left's best attack is attacking the person rather than the thought, and there is no one capable of entering the realm of ideas from the left, and presenting a cogent argument of fact.
Reading the comments here is rather funny.
The cgi attacks are rather laughable, with only one or two that are even remotely effective.
But no, they're feeling rather happy.
Personally, I'd ignore all the reviews about bad acting, bad CGI, low budget, eastern European cast, plot holes the size of Bulgaria, continuity errors etc - those are part and parcel of this genre, and should be celebrated rather than snottily mocked by those who - against all evidence and knowledge of the genre - apparently expected a high-quality movie.
Charles Durning is effective in this film and far from hating the ending, I thought it was not "Upbeat" but rather merely stopped the movie from being a total downer.
It's not uber realistic like "Half-Life 2" but rather just looks like something out of a really bad dream.
), a wide range of animations and rather articulated faces and the like(I do not personally find the introductory movie as compelling as the other two, perhaps that is only me... it might be the pop song, if I will grant that it's sufficiently sad in tone).
The interface remains unchanged as it should be, and once you are used to the directional keys(shouldn't take long), the way you move in this is rather intuitive, and you can get into this almost immediately.
I would rather of had three root canals than be forced to watch this pathetic excuse for a film again.
When he is forced to face the inconsistencies and unexpected circumstances which life throws his way, manifested rather dully by a three-horned dog and a reptilian-looking homo sapien, he demonstrates an incapacity to tackle turmoil and confusion.
The dynamics of this dysfunctional household are presented in a rather shallow, inept manner.
It is the result of collaboration between two rather bright European b movies masters.
This is not a Hollywood high octane movie, rather a wonderful story composed of characters you can relate.
It all starts with Mrs. Baker stars as a rather free-spirited race car pilot who crash-parks her car on the circuit and ends up slightly wounded in a hospital.
I believe this is a rather excellent movie, when looked at from the right angle.
I think the gameplay is awful, the graphics isn't good either, it looks to much of an animation rather than a realistic game.
He is a wealthy man but would rather spend his time lounging in the sun eating bananas and coconuts than doing business.
No, it is no masterpiece (let's face it Reb Brown is the star of this one), but it is bad enough to be rather entertaining in its own strange little way.
It's too bad this film was not intended as a comedy, but rather as a science fiction/ fantasy epic.
"Dumplings" seeks to make the audience feel vaguely sick and recoil rather than scream or skip a heartbeat.
More intellectual and artistic as the characters are made to look good rather than deviant.
I don't want to give details on the plots of any of them because I think that viewers need to experience them for themselves with no preconceptions going in, but what I can say is that "Dumplings" has the most plot and is probably the one with the highest "squeam" factor, "Cut" covers a rather familiar premise but with lots of fun moments (you'll see) and "Box" is more of an artistic endeavour with not much of a plot, but for some reason I was enthralled and couldn't look away; it's the one I liked the most.
I would rather hold my grandmas hand while she's on the toilet than watch even a second of this movie again.
A lesser actor would have taken this kind of success to the bank by now, while possibly allowing the character to slip into caricature rather than being concerned with keeping it real and convincing.
But Dunne seems to be a rather liberal lady, having no qualms about Grant's hesitation in telling his new wife the truth, nor with him going so far as to bringing her home and carrying her over the threshold!
It's for this reason that the two are able to rise above the silly material to create a rather sophisticated sex comedy, one that forgives natural indiscretions on the part of each party, and it's for this reason I give the film an 8/10.
Just as "On the whole, I'd rather be in Philadelphia" should be on W.C. Fields' stone (unfortunately, it isn't), Cary's quote would make a fitting epitaph to a career that spanned more than three decades.
The only complaint is that the laughs stop in the last quarter of the movie, which is rather uninteresting as the focus shifts from comedy to romance.
She was magnificently feline, as Pauline Kael says; dispensing slinky, fluttering phrases and quips, and making it clear what a laugh the character is having; she seems rather to be getting off on the entangled situation.
All - or rather much - has to be homogenised; pop star product looks are apparently required, and conveyor-belted into mainstream films.
The actor playing the world-weary, rather Robb Wilton-esquire magistrate ought to have been involved more than he was; an enjoyable turn, that would have been effectively woven deeper into the narrative.
Things did perhaps get rather sentimental with the involvement of the couple's children, although this is hardly the worst such offender in Hollywood history.
While the plot itself may be typical and no great shakes, the selling point of this comedy are the funny A&C routines that are peppered throughout the movie... We get to see Abbott prove to a gangster that he is not actually here but rather "Someplace Else"; funnyman Leon Errol drives Costello bonkers by discussing horses and how "Mudders eat their Fodder"; Bud makes Lou continually "Dress and Undress".
'Footsteps' as a whole is a real lesson for any film maker in how to tell a story visually rather than relying on dialogue to convey emotion and carry the narrative.
The music is okay, but for that I rather go to the concert than watching this piece of untalented crap movie.
The film also contains a rather clever plot misdirection about mid way through, a subplot about cops and one of the victim's father that makes you think the plot is going to evolve one way, but then completely changes direction you.
It's rather straightforward, even though the script does throw around many scientific exchanges but counterpointing that is many trashy dialogues.
The work's creators used the medium of film to its full potential rather than being content to use the camera to record visuals that could just as easily be seen on a stage.
And I think the fact that this rather brave for the time show (and actress) was able to influence the 5 year old white child of an Alabama bigot to spend a lifetime in the same line of service to others says a hell of a lot about its "epochal" effects on the minds and people of that time.
Even today, I think I'd rather be "Julia" than "Jackie".
Although MONPTI is rather sad in its content and sometimes even melancholic, it is filled with wonderful humor that will appeal to various viewers.
While Dallesandro's work here is rather flat, Di Leo keeps Dallesandro's dialog to a minimum.
The script by Erik Anjou plays the concept far more like a standard teen slasher (as if we didn't already have enough) rather than trying to develop the demonic phone-line to hell idea as in the first, instead they take the 976-EVIL premise & simply use it to give some supernatural powers to a homicidal maniac who wants to kill lots of dumb & annoying teenagers, yawn.
The script too, is fleshed out rather well, by upping the suspense and surprises but also questioning that of morality and the backlash of this touchy subject.
The lighting seems to come from nowhere and what we're looking at appears to be a rather stark movie set instead of an atmospheric Edinburgh street.
The performances are all rather good.
Solid, well-crafted but rather patchy cinematic treatment of the saga of notorious 19th Century "Resurrectionists" Burke and Hare and their unorthodox employer Dr. Robert Knox; in the vein of Hammer horror (featuring two of their most notable participants in Cushing and Gilling) though the lack of color makes it seem a half-hearted attempt (even if, with an eye on the low-budget, it was probably a conscious choice by the film-makers as the intentions were clearly of a serious undertaking)!
screen); the "Continental Version" fares even worse, showing more damage and having rather scratched audio to boot!
The cinematographic style of the film is often compared to earlier Horror classics of the 1940s rather than to those of the late 50s and early 60s, and one can see why.
Burke and Hare, realising that they're onto a lucrative line of business, begin to murder victims rather than simply digging up the bodies of the already-dead so that they can keep the doctor stocked with corpses.
From what I've read in factual biographies and works of reference (yes, I find this stuff so intriguing that I study it on the side), the screenplay is rather accurate and faithful when it comes to the basic re-telling of the murder cases.
".But she has good reason for butchering six people: they all commited a crime that no one understands, like dumping her daughter, eating poultry (because Beverly loves birds),smart-alacing about her dentist husband, refusing to rewind a rental tape, critisizing about her family skills, and witnessing one of the other five crimes.You may think she's insane, but really, she's just expressing things we'd rather hide inside of us.Like, say you work in a store and someone wants to return something but they don't have the recipt.It can't be returned without the recipt, so you tell them "No can do".Then they start cursing you out like you're worthless.Wouldn't you get the urge to shove a bullet in their brain?Well then, you now know how Beverly Sutphin feels when someone decides to be a wise guy.This movie is perfect for anyone who loves to laugh.Plus, the DVD contains the theatrical trailer, a behind-the-scenes featurette, several TV spots, four interview clips, and extra behind the scenes footage.I give this one a 10/10!
I gave it a 7 rather than something higher because the action around her is okay but delivered more as a set-up for her various exercises in family values, and the plot itself doesn't seem driven by anything other than her proclivities for a particular problem solving approach.
This is one of the few Waters films that I rent from time to time rather than own, but it's still lots of fun.
When I went to watch ÂCrimson Rivers", another movie based on one of Grange's novels, I was really amazed by the atmosphere, but rather disappointed by the ending of the plot which I found to be rather overdone.
The film looses tension as it unravels and somewhere on the middle it gets boring as the investigative characters catch up with what is rather obvious to the viewers.
Reno is great as a dangerous, rather brutal and grizzled rogue cop gotten out of "retirement" by an obsessed young cop to solve a series of grisly murders.
Similar is every other character; while Rachael Leigh Cook does a rather good job with her Lucy Stanton (a character unfortunately and implausibly called 'Luce' and pronounced 'loose' by her father), she has very little to do but be a victim of her father's obnoxiousness and some sort of bizarre Satanic cult that is only given a raison d'etre in the last twenty minutes.
Maximilian Schell's rather good acting is wasted in his predictable yet nonsensical role.
He did not overact in any way, but the way he delivered his lines felt forced, felt like I was watching the performance rather than watching life unfold.
This is a rather sad story, but true to life.
Edward plays the role beautifully, he makes the call or rather has someone else make the call to preserve the status quo but it does anything but that.
I tell ya, there's no obscure 80's movie I'd rather see for the first time flipping through Showtime at 4am than O.C.
The son of the jailed partner, played in rather stiff fashion by HOWARD DUFF, is unforgiving when he realizes Robinson shared the guilt with his father and yet let his father take the blame for the incident.
Horton is rather colorless in what is meant to be a sympathetic role and spent her remaining years in TV roles.
Encouraging them to think outside the box rather than be restricted by school-approved guidelines, he not only provides them with a full appreciation and love of poetry, but also a fresh mindset that focuses on seizing the day and acting on impulse.
Unfortunately, several plot points introduced prior to the suicide are simply dropped after it, leaving the viewer wondering what happened to the budding romance of one of the students and a town girl, as well as a few other things that just get left rather than addressed.
The setting of the prep school works rather well in this film, making it almost a world unto itself.
Most impressive is the scene where Todd watches Keating pack to leave the school, rather than pay attention to class.
One student commits suicide rather than fight for his beliefs.
Frankly, compared to modern classrooms which are bastions of free expression, I found the Weldon students' respectful treatment of their teachers rather refreshing.
This stories is what the movie mostly is about, but in the end the teens find them selves right in the middle of a rather unfriendly storm which seems to come from nowhere.
and Stiggs, and they're not even necessarily that likable, but neither are the Schwabbs, the family they torment, and anyway Altman doesn't really ask us to root for anyone but rather just enjoy the silliness.
This hard-boiled crime melodrama is about contract killing and it traces, rather naively I thought, the genesis of the whole enterprise and is said to be based on fact.
Unfortunately it was brought to compare with last year CT-HT, I would prefer this movie rather than CT-HT,  I'm not a movie snob but if you have seen the a hundred of HK martial art movie you will realize that that CT-HT is SOOOOÂ DARN ORDINARY with the clichÃ©-ending scene, Chorography that actually no better than a HK B grade martial art movie, how slow is the story lineÂ And if you compare in term of budget wise.
It may be because I had no idea that Thailand made western films in the 1960s, let alone seen any of them, that this film proved rather effective.
This is a rather fascinating experiment in transplanting a genre that's rather American into a country that has none of that sort of history in its culture (as far as I know), and it does work rather well, but does come off a bit odd, to say the least.
A fun film, a weird film, and possible influences seem to be Guy Maddin & John Waters, so if you're up for a strange western with surreal sets and Thai actors, well, give it a shot, it's pretty strange but also rather astounding.
There has always been something rather absurd about the cult of the Hollywood western.
That can go to the final stand off, which has some panache about it and ends rather nasty.
In the rather colourful countryside of the rather colourful modern Thailand, a gang of horse-riding, machine-gun toting, Thai cowboys led the by the colourfully villainous Fai (Sombat Metanee).
There are frequent musical interludes, but not in the Bollywood style, rather songs which explain the emotional state of certain characters, the high point being the main love song - ridiculously over-sentimental - and the cowboy-esque Bonanza-style riding song, a country and western inspired, cheery melody about loneliness.
It is a very violent film, but the kind of violence that is truly comic-book, overly-red blood (think cheap hammer horror), taken to a level of exaggeration which rather than making you gag, just makes you wince and laugh.
By all means see it, but it's rather dated.
And that's not the least of it, as the unexpected plot twists mount while Schaffner starts to look like the least corrupt person in the film compared to the strokes Noel Willman's patiently greedy Mexican police chief and Bernard Lee's determined but less than ethical Scotland Yard man are willing to pull to either get his money or lure him across the bridge...  Ken Annakin's film may be shot on location in Spain, but it has a resolutely British studio look to both its photography and its interior work (as well as its rather over-emphatic James Bernard score) - you can take the British out of Britain but not the Britishness out of their films, it seems.
However, both versions were rather explicit.
The amounts of graphic violence and Â especially Â gratuitous sleaze are admirably kept rather low, and this in favor of character development and tension building.
Teddy Roosevelt and his rather diverse band of recruits believed that they were going to Cuba to save the Cuban people from an evil and exploitive Spanish colonial government.
Tom Berengar's Teddy Roosevelt and Gary Busey's 'Fighting Joe' Wheeler are splendid evocations of two rather well-known men, replete with little details that bring them to life.
After almost two hours of rather incoherent snippets of stories I was waiting for the surprise ending, connecting all the pieces, leaving me with a message: "Don't date", or "Don't like rain?
Jaws 3-D is a trashy second sequel to Jaws that's more likely to turn viewers' stomachs over rather than keep them on the edge of their seat.
The shark is bigger but no match for the two that took residence at Amity, it looks fake, roars and swims (or rather crawls) at a snails-pace and misses out on most of its potential-victims due to its clumsiness.
I can't believe this guy had the chutzpah to think he should have been selected to play 007 rather than Pierce Brosnan.
To tell you the truth I'd rather watch an Asylum tie in than one of the glossy pieces of crap thats been out lately.
Along the way they encounter giant spiders, man-eating vines, Pterodactyls, a rather odd (and entertaining) tribe of natives, and even King Kong.
Everyone plays it rather low key, you won't find your usual clichÃ©s nor your usual over-the-top imbeciles, but instead some folks that you can actually sort of care about and like.
Pretty much run of the mill western displaying many of the same plot lines that have been rather beaten to death in the Western genre.
The Frank Fenton screenplay based on a story by Philip Rock and actor Michael Pate is rather formulaic stuff right up to its cavalry ex machine ending.
Perhaps the only downside to The Circus- or rather the DVD, is that it does not offer the original film from 1928, replete with a silent film organ score- say by the great silent organist Rosa Rio?
The plot of the movie may be a little flimsy and it could be described as a series of sketches rather than a feature film.But that shouldn't detract from the many merits that this film has.There are so many scenes of creative brilliance;the hall of mirrors,pretending to be an automaton,the chase in the circus ring,the fabulous tight rope segment.These all go to show what a great movie legend Chaplin was and he should be regarded in the very highest esteem.
The film, as a whole, is rather drab & slow, Chaplin playing the Tramp as a circus act, (not discounting his own tightrope work), but the closing scene, as the circus moves on and he's left alone, with only a picture of his love, and his Tramp walk into the sunset, makes it an emotionally powerful piece to watch, giving us glimpse of Chaplin's inner self, not to be found anywhere else, but hidden beneath his character.
I found the ending rather pleasing, logical but somewhat unexpected.
Some of the direction and camera work mostly during the first half was rather impressive and the performances of Hopkins, who unlike may I never really find to amazing, was very very good.
The twist was also revealed in a rather convenient manner but the actual twist at the end was clever.
I found the Willy Beachum character and the actor playing him rather boring.
I thought Grindhouse was a hoot but not worth another attendance, being a concatenation of two lousy movies in an amusing fashion, but I'd rather sit through three hours of that movie a second time than watch this one for the first.
It won't throw you for a complete loop but rather ties up some loose ends that had me scratching my head up until then.
I'd rather prefer more scenes between Willy and Crawford but even the way it was, the movie kept my attention all the way through and despite the rather weak ending, I found "Fracture" quite good.
I think it's a glimpse of what might have been, rather than a look at a tired, faded star.
In that respect, the movie is rather sad, because McQueen never made another movie.
Directed in a rather plain, yet still effective manner by TV show veteran Buzz Kulik, this movie has a certain rough look and gritty atmosphere to it that's gripping and believable.
The music is a bit cheesy and the story is rather episodic, but still a fun night at the movies.
It is nothing grand, and for the most part there really is no plot, but it is still a rather good movie.
He goes after super big rednecks, small time crooks, crazy guys who blow things up, and one rather dangerous individual.
This anime has the fault of having a rather... shocking first scene, and this would discourage sensitive people from watching it.
Also, some of the most violent scenes are rather surreal: think characters being tortured to eerily beautiful Gregorian chants.
If you are too immature to watch the characters for their personalities rather than their bodies or are of weak constitution pass on this series.
It's rather, well, cheesy!
A Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell, on the other hand, has me rather confused about its makers intentions: sometimes it follows the standard Troma route, offering extremely dumb characters, bad special effects, and gratuitous sex and violence; occasionally, however, it seemed to me that director Brett Piper wanted his film to be more than just tacky trash, throwing in snippets of poetry (Lewis Carroll's Jabberwocky), an intriguing sci-fi slant (there is the suggestion that the planet may not be Earth, and that the humans are the descendants of space travellers), and more poignant moments (such as the agonising cry from the scarred warrior who yearns for company).
So rather than try to explain what this film is... how about a little about what it isn't.
It adds a level of mental discomfort, but then that's likely a big part of the point- seeing the oil burned by order of a government that's been on the news we watch every night is one thing (or rather was), but it's another to suddenly take it in another light, where in the realm of science-fiction it asks the viewer to raise questions via abstractions one might forget when taking it as complete truth.
They are rather offering man - who is void of adequate images - a set of images with which he may begin to understand.
The Kuwaiti landscape is presented in sweeping, wide angle shots making it look like the surface of an alien planet rather than the Middle East.
Coming out at the same time as Ken Russell's rather more amusing Valentino, The World's Greatest Lover suffers from Gene Wilder's sporadic tendency to mistake the grotesque for the side-splitting.
The similarities between it and the first movie aren't really too hard to miss, but I found myself liking them rather than feeling like I was seeing the same film all over again.
I would happily watch High School Muscial (which, I am shamed to admit, made me laugh a little) every day for a week rather than sit through this trash again.
I was wrong, after about 40 mins of watching I would have rather ripped off my own ears and set them on fire than watch for another minute.
This film is rather short, and I suspect that some of it is missing, but the story has continuity.
It is a rather entertaining pre-code with a bitter courtroom battle at the end of the film.
Bickford gives a tired, rather over the top performance and it's no surprise he wasn't used very often as a leading man.
What I found rather uncomfortable here is how a man (who is absolutely terrified) can be shown to be locked in a jeep while gas seeps through one of the heater vents and slowly either kills or knocks him out.
What could be so frightening and irrational that a scientist would choose to freeze to death rather than confront it?
A perfect film from a rather unknown director, see it!!!
She argues (get this) that she'd rather face life in prison than live without Ted.
I happen to be a rather big fan of his and am trying to be patient about when I will be able to see the movie.
I'm glad I finally found a place to rent a copy rather than buying one, and it's obvious that the rental houses agree with my assessment, as I had to check on Netflix, two Blockbusters, and one Hollywood video before I could find a lone copy at a third Blockbuster.
The humor some people pointed out distracted from the film rather than added to it, it was needless for a film of this nature, Gangs Of New York is meant to be about rivalry, revenge and drama, and although there were a couple of places where the dark humor really worked there were too many instances where the humor felt like tacted-on Hollywood cheese.
I would much rather watch Pearl Harbor than Gangs of New York.
The movie is barely watchable, and if the weather outside is fine, I'd suggest you rather take a walk in a park.
Thus, though you might entertain a flicker of interest in the Hamletesque question of whether the son will avenge the father, you wind up so bored w/DiCaprio that you don't freakin' care anymore by the time he gets around to doing the deed (which is rather done for him before he even bothers to show up).
but if you'd rather not think too much then hey, why not watch Stairway to Heaven.
Although this film is rather long (2 hrs 47 mins), I was so provoked by it that the time flew by.
from more popular films and tempering them with style, the whole movie still seems rather dull and derivative.
Eduardo Noriega whom has always being a good looking actor rather than a worthy actor shows why is so popular amongs his fans, but you better stick to Thesis or Open your eyes
Some of the scenes get boring and can run rather long.
Personally, I'd rather see a documentary on Dr. Kellogg and his quackery; this fictionalization was filled with too many pee-pee/poo-poo jokes for it to work for me.
The characters are poorly developed: we get to "know" them through their "thoughts" and the narrator's speech rather than through their actions and expressions, which doesn't help much to make the viewer sympathize with them.
It's the Ikarie crew's social or dutiful pairings, even to the point of bringing each other flowers, or taking showers together, which lay at the heart of the film, rather than any encounter of a new civilisation and the socialist message entailed.
I was rather disappointed with this film, after the high voter rating.
I will fault the distributor, though, for marketing this title as a horror film; rather, it is a psychological thriller that relies more on the slow building of suspense than on blood or gore.
had still been a rather impersonal affair.
However, the real treat from these guys are not what they were doing in the link up's but rather what they did way back when, and fortunately in That's Entertainment Part II there are more classic clips than you can shake a stick at.
"For Your Consideration" seems to be Guest's attempt to move back toward more-demanding film directing, as it leaves the documentary style behind in favor of more typical visual film fare, has more narrative structure than his previous films ("A Mighty Wind" and "Best in Show"), and even seems more comedically designed in that the scenes are built to a single joke rather than the rapid-fire succession of them in his mockumentaries.
I would rather watch a Steven Segal movie than watch this steaming pile again.
For this viewer this mocumentary about a very bad film company churning out a very bad film with a rather pitiful cast of actors falling victim to Internet rumors that an Oscar is in the air works as a funny idea and social comment for about the first half four and then sadly falls apart painfully as it proceeds to its wholly predictable end.
If, as Guest insists, this film is not intended as a satire of Hollywood but is rather the tragicomic tale of what happens to someone when they are told that they deserve an award, we should be spending less time on all the Hollywood in-jokes and parodies, and more time with the characters themselves.
His underhanded approach to life is not smug or justified, but rather self-assuredly devoid of any overeagerness or vanity.
As he reached the status of French cinema's Â»mandarinÂ«, and by proving to be the undisputed commercial ruler of non-American cinema, Luc Besson retired form directing and began writing and producing a whole serial assembly of rather simple French programmers which were set to compete with mid-budget Hollywood efforts.
a movie that is not focusing on a special mission or on action but rather on people, what implies their job, on their daily life...even if they are spies.
It's nothing of the sort, rather a tepid satire on the banality of television news but without the biting humour and insight that Chris Morris and Armando Iannucci provided for "The Day Today" and "Brass Eye".
", rather than real setting/background with fictional scenario ("There is no way Bill can win a Superbowl!
As far as the film goes, it was a rather funny script and despite being a silly plot, it worked rather well.
Since there was so much comment on the "fake gorillas," I think it is worth pointing out that these were not in fact intended to be gorillas but rather the fictional race of "great apes" that raised Tarzan in the Burroughs novels.
As mentioned previously, select movements and dances from Tchaikovsky's immortal score can be heard, but the majority of the music mostly consists of Tchaikovsky-inspired compositions as well as some rather trippy 70's techno-rock synthesizers.
The film's supposed key rape sequence is rather tame and doesn't really feature a lot of sexual violence towards the victim, and it happens relatively quickly.
The villains arrive rather late and aren't even given much time on screen, their threat unable to really nourish in our minds.
Do yourself a favor a leaf through and old Reader's Digest rather than waste your time on this crap.
His buddy then, in turn, is more interested in slapping the s--t out of Baumann rather than copulating with her.
It's made out of rather thin branches, so that it is possible to see right through the walls.
There are also windows, and at least two large holes in the roof, so that when they say they wish they could lock the door, it sounds rather funny!
There is also a rather nice scene where the police officer patiently tries to take Cartman seriously, as Cartman reports the loss of the photograph of himself in a compromising situation and expects the police to help.
He spends the whole night trying to stop Kyle, but when he comes to no avail, he decides he'd rather expose himself.
The campers continually commit suicide as they decide they'd rather go to hell now then be persecuted.
Cartman Sucks may not contain a strong social commentary, but it basically is what I wanted: an episode more focused on an entertaining plot, rather then entirely on an issue.
My one complaint about "Plate quemada" is the rather shoddy subtitles.
I always assumed that Kate and Allie were more like sisters rather than best friends.
However, what sets it aside from many other monster films is a terrific cast, most all rather inexperienced actors, but they portray their characters well, and certainly as characters that you can actually care for.
Harmon Walsh is an absolute hottie, but he's also a terrific actor making his debut here as Johnny, the hero who finds himself with a big problem (aside from the Ice Queen) when he gets drunk and sleeps with another girl, Elaine, leaving his girlfriend, Tori, rather upset.
Noele Reno plays Tori, rather tame compared to the other vibrant characters, but she gives a good performance.
The supporting cast is strong, but like the leads they seem to be pulling in different directions throughout the film, and when all is said and done this rather lengthy film feels quite a bit longer than it actually is.
Caan works hard in the role of Eddie Sparks, managing to make a pretty despicable character rather likable for the majority of the story.
"Curse of the Queerwolf" was rather dreadful, but it just doesn't hold a candle to the eternal awfulness of PViB.
It is somethings that every person should think about, and re-prioritize some things in life that should be first, rather than money, etc... Just a great movie, was very moved by it...
I caught a blurb about the film including mini synopsis to wit: Grandfather dies and leaves challenges, rather than $$$$$ to his errant playboy grandson.
It managed to take a 'Brewsters Millions' theme and turn it into something far more emotional, a drama rather that a comedy.
This is a heart warming story that I would rather watch any day than some of the big budget, special effects laden blockbusters that leave you devoid of any real emotion at the end of the film.
The theme of the dead sister's original undoubtedly, though I'd rather have let Shu live and kick butt (wow those beautiful, deadly legs!
In his spare time, which is rather often, he daydreams and masturbates, visualizing shooting stars into space and using his penis like a blowtorch.
However, the poor schluck doesn't get very far with his sexual shenanigan because a rather bored but grim-looking rooster sees what looks like a worm-like animal to him, and pecks it very hard.
The film is flawed (the middle section in particular lags pretty badly), but I'd rather watch an interesting if imperfect film any day than successful tripe.
So, this really is a rather uneventful film, and the only thing you can say about it is that it's not particularly badly made and features OK acting.
It starts with a man who calls himself Tommy the Clown, who entertains at children's parties much like most other types of clowns, except that he specializes in an amazing dance performance rather than magic tricks and balloon animals, and before long other dancing clown groups are popping up all over the place, mostly staffed by kids and teenagers who otherwise would more than likely get involved in a life of crime.
The game, although rather short, is still butt loads of fun to play.
Though I had enjoyed the Harold Lloyd features that I'd seen previously, somehow I expected 'Girl Shy (1924)' to be a rather tame slapstick comedy.
I own the R3 DVD of this movie, and my overwhelming feeling is that the storyline is rather weak, however it's not all bad.
Having dispatched of each opponent Ivan removes their (rather crappy) Ninja headbands which he then sends to Gordon as proof of his kill (although I've seen exactly the same crappy Ninja Headbands for sale for about Â£2.00 in martial arts shops so he might as well have bought a few from there and saved himself some hassle)  Finally Gordon is forced to accept the challenge to stop the bloodshed (although as per usual with these films despite ninja being sliced/stabbed etc there is not one drop of the red stuff in sight!!!)
The final chase sequence is rather annoying.
The storyline is rather predictable, so also is the drama.
The final chase sequence is rather annoying.
The news and circumstances that they must endure but the writers do a splendid job in bringing the unlikely pair of grandparents who probably would prefer traveling the world rather than raising their own grandchildren.
Their cleaner Liz is also on hand to help out but gets rather distracted by Tom, a builder, hired to add another bedroom to the house.
The last scene, rather fittingly is of Maggie pulling an envelope from Philips coat pocket (thinking it is yet another school letter she is never destined to read) and opening it to find it is in fact a Mothers Day card.
The first cut scene explains why Quatre goes to retrieve the Gundams, and has a rather funny line courtesy of Duo.
I'd rather cut off my big toes and run from Maine to Mexico non-stop while simultaneously sticking blood-sucking leaches all over my crotch.
As such, Bride Wars is not only resoundingly poor on just about every possible front, but unenthusiastically so, making the film not only cringe-worthy to watch, but also rather boring.
well, i personally found the ending rather unsatisfying... it 'shocked' me out of my "suspension of disbelief"... i didn't see how things could be so 'resolved' after 10 years of courtship, to dump it all out in a few minutes.
With little romance to back up the meagre plot, dull, dry characterisation coupled with non-existent chemistry between either the friends and their partners, or even themselves, the vast majority of Bride Wars turns ugly, rather quickly; the movie pushes that this cat fight between Hudson and Hathaway is meant to be fun and airy with plenty of laughs, but it's too transparent and formulated to even move beyond dry caricature.
If anything, the movie exists more as a mildly poignant example of companionship in the form of friends rather than romance.
Yet had Winick went with this theme for the majority of his film, rather than save it for after all the silly, perfunctory cat fight scenes that in turn just about destroy all human shades within his characters, Bride Wars could have been a much more flowing, and relevant feature.
Back in the 1970s, some young directors really believed it was possible to make movies for television, rather than "TV movies" (one-episode 90 minute TV shows or the longer, even less cinematic soap opera 'miniseries').
The football sequences here are rather straightforward, and more of the same we saw in the first movie, save for some spectacular, probably CG-ed movies like the volleys, overhead kicks and diving headers.
All in all I thought it had tremendous potential had it just stuck to a footballers troubles in his footballing world, rather than try to get stuck in a long boring drama.
Goal 2 is unlikely to add to that total, it being an update of last year's Goal in which Kuno Becker's Santiago Munez is awarded the chance of a lifetime Âalbeit one that involves him abandoning his life in Los Angeles in order to pursue a career at Newcastle United rather than follow his father into the lawn maintenance business.
The acting, the soundtrack (the first featured a rather stunning selection of Oasis tracks for some reason), the concept.
People get shot for no reason (and I'm talking NO REASON, here ... not even within the context of the four thugs who are the centerpieces of the film), the stereotypical drag queens were -well- kinda offensive (rather than funny), the pacing seemed sporadic, the dialogue -while peppered with realistic jargon and cutesy internally-referential life-comments that made you think these characters were real people- was superficial, and the "monster" of the movie was never given any real build-up before it started messing with people's minds.
They are unnecessary and rather... sickening.
The story takes in themes of love and selfishness, and the characters are actually rather well done.
DOC HOLLYWOOD is full of charming vignettes, from Stone vicariously reading the mail for an illiterate farm couple, to being paid for services rendered with a rather large pig, who ultimately becomes his 'pet'.
Perhaps the Television of today has doubts about their actual content and dialog, that vacuous imagery has been made a cornerstone, rather than window dressing.
I remember being a bit annoyed as certain episodes resembled after school specials, rather than the medical/ crime drama I became addicted too.
Occasionally the pace of the movie lulls and sometimes Canevari sees fit to get rather pretentious with his direction, but, on the whole, the film is a decent enough watch for those seeking some sleaze.
And although I imagine the makers never intended to provide any laughs, I defy anyone to not giggle at the moment when Lise is suspended above flesh-eating rats (actually rather disinterested gerbils) or the 'sex' scene between Lise and the doctor, which consists of several minutes of them rolling around together naked, but never actually seeming to bother with any serious boning!
Everything about this movie (the music, the script, the photography, the editing) serves the purpose of making sure I share Spielberg's viewpoint about the movie's rather contrived situation.
However, it's much more the former rather than latter.
In Order to give life to a rather pessimistic universe, from the American writer Philip K. Dick, Steven Spielberg had the courage to create the darkest movie of his career (so far at least), which touches important ethical dilemmas about the types of protection of the human being, beating the crime, respect for the individual freedom and the responsibilities of the citizens and the law.
It gives a sense that without colour in the world there is no emotion and people actions are now based on what a machine says rather that acting on human instinct.
The benefits of the system are so great that OF COURSE I'd rather not look too closely into the burden that must be borne by three - just three - individuals.
I would certainly rather watch this little gem than most of what is being shown in theaters these days.
If the detective had spent half as much time looking into the case, rather than trying to convince her that she imagined or dreamed it, he might have solved the case sooner.
Very deliberate, which makes the viewer have to use his imagination rather than have others tell her how to feel, think, etc.
The only problem I have with the movie is that it's rather long.
(It's also somewhat surprising how tall that actor is, he really towers over Crawford) Detached and calm Â but underneath insecure and aimless -, he tries to reason with the woman he'd rather not like to meet again and who is becoming a living nightmare for him.
The mood of this film is rather well set by the very much underrated director Curtis Bernhardt.
Finally, it must be said that this film is rather instructive and insightful in its depiction of the horrors of schizophrenia.
Her character should have been actually introduced (even in one brief scene) rather than merely heard or talked about in flashback.
Just like in his previous "The Wolf Man", the story is charged with a dark pessimistic feeling of dread that gives the film a unique feeling (contrary to most Universal horrors, there's almost no comedy) that rather than making the film dull or boring it enhances its captivating charm.
Obviously done as a dramatic element for the film, the tactic doesn't make much sense, other than to provide a reason for Anthony to arrange his escape in a dramatic ride on horseback, with a rather effective looking leap over Devil's Gulch that the baddies won't risk attempting.
But Anthony's father was really William Drew, and on that note the film ends rather abruptly.
The performances are rather stilted with not much more than the characters going through their motions.
It's all pretty confusing rather than ambitious.
The efforts of police and government against him are portrayed as "factually" as possible (which makes aspects of their discussions rather unintelligible to Americans).
Of course, all these things will make the movie seem rather boring to many viewers here!
You would do better to burn the money in you wallet or purse rather than wasting it on this film.
Not because I wouldn't have enjoyed meeting some of the others, but because at one stage fellow house mate Verne Troyer might have asked me about the last film he did with his best friend, and I wouldn't be comfortable lying to him and denying that I thought The Love Guru was a cinematic mutant mistakenly allowed to live and breathe rather than be put to a merciful sleep in the development stage.
But his latest Guru Pitka went too far when he thought of writing it down; in comparison, his Beatnik poet Charlie from So I Married An Axe Murderer (1993) was a character of multi-layered nuance, and more importantly, one that people would much rather watch.
While I enjoy a good low-brow laughfest like the next guy, I still would rather have a somewhat decently constructed story, something this tale lacks completely.
I'd rather wear a chastity belt for 30 years like the Guru rather than sit through this pile of crud.
There are several morbid sequences including a scene of a cat being carted off to his death by a mousey executioner and a moment in which Sylvester attempts suicide rather than being sent out to face the vicious vermin alone.
Samuel L. Jackson is too typical, Milla Jovovich is WAY too typical, and Doug Huchison is rather disappointing.
In this film he is quite young and rather delicate looking, and while one can imagine that Lennie would admire him for his brains, he has no air of authority about him, no real life gravitas to ground him in reality.
Cowboy actor Bob Steele brings a nice touch of the Old West to the swaggering Curly, and I wish that he, rather, than Meredith, had been cast as George.
Aaron Copland's music is used intelligently, and its soaring near the end seems appropriate to the effect the film was trying to create, which was one of tragic humanity rather than tragic human beings.
The themes include a robbery plan that goes awry though here it is more of a con rather than robbery and it is executed without resorting to violence.
Second theme is domed love   which in this movie is rather short, more of this later.
The sweeping camera work that's dreamt up can capture some uncanny frames and lighting is kept rather under-lit to breath a really unsteady gloominess.
I really liked 'Audition', but I found the Ring movies to be rather boring, so I watched this few expectations.
Story wise, it isn't very original, but its still rather interesting.
I remember being rather excited about this show when the railers first appeared, even rushing out of the room whenever they came on as to not spoil the clips through over-saturation.
Little Britain Series 1 was great, Series 2 was also great, but the usual comedy formula that third series screw the whole thing up (as it did to "The Fast Show") works on Little Britain, and we were let down by a rather disappointing Series 3 last year.
Burgess Meredith was a fine George, and I rather doubt Sinise could have improved on it, sight unseen, but, that too is purely subjective.
If you have a rather strong constitution and like your humor very twisted and gross, then give this a watch.
The rather strange storyline concerns a bicycle delivery driver who crashes his bike and is assaulted by a mysterious young woman.
Not that it isn't without merit, but, rather, again, this is a different film with a very different feel.
This is a great film, but not for purposes of mindless entertainment, rather for purposes of knowing self.
This funny, out of character Adam Sandler vehicle was bumpy at best, with a rather insulting Buddhist monk scene and some unintentionally dumb sequences as well as some overly obvious cameos which made the movie campy though tolerably cute.
It also serves as a good contrast between conflicting ideas as Kilpatrick and Gutierrez strike up their rather volatile relationship.
The movie is rather slowly paced, but offers a very adult story for Western fans.
It packs a rather mean punch and while not particularly memorable, it's still pretty good entertainment.
The supporting performances are generally rather lacklustre, possibly because none of the characters beyond the two principal players carry much depth or interest.
Slim comes across as a rather mysterious character, and Bickford plays him with a compelling low-key dignity.
I did not find it uplifting in any way - and I am rather thankful for that.
It's rather a human study, the kind of migrant workers whom the Joads joined are shown in a small setting at a California ranch.
The film begins rather slowly (and overly-sentimental) but becomes an incredible story with great acting and characters, powerful philosophy and imagery.
Also, this time, even Jafar - rather tragically - joins in the singing and dancing and the originally great but now tortuously irritating Iago gets not one but two songs.
The animation was terrible compared to the first, it looked cheap tacky and rather rubbish.
I'd rather forget this one ever happened.
Third, the story is too boring: if the end is rather enjoyable, it took maybe 40 long minutes to get there!
"), the gentle Genie is rather funny and Jasmine is one of the most beautiful Disney woman!
So, I guess I should rather look for the first one, to find more Jasmine (and nostalgia of my friend) & a better story !!!!
And looking at it through the eyes of someone who's been acting for thirty-odd years rather than the eyes of a teenager really makes a difference.
The conventional use of flashbacks and slow motion become rather mundane.
The film ended with some rather interesting faux documentary interviews with the typical man on the street.
The action/shooting scenes are well-choreographed with a fine eye for the detail, but it's the main characters, their dialogues and developments around which the movie is develops rather than the action sequences.
The director doesn't try dazzle the audience with "eye-popping" angles or camera tricks, but rather shows the life of Jesus in a simple way.
...There is only one reason to watch this movie - or rather, fast forward through it - and that is to see a large Noah's Arc roll off the side of a cliff and smash into loads of little pieces.
In conclusion Ring O does add depth to the trilogy and deepens rather then clarifies the mystery and in the same way to the recently released Starwars prequels, infuses the film's near one dimensional monster with a sense of depth, which serves to draw pity from it's audience.
Mitchum is a rather amiable, self-confident, yet low-key lead who's easy to watch, although his fight scenes are indeed hard to swallow.
The odd and rather inappropriate disco-soundtrack is awesome and the cinematography is steady.
The film starts off with a rather hokey plot setting up a woman and her boyfriend against one another regarding a multi-million dollar company.
It was very forgettable -- and rather contrived.
But Dunne seems to be a rather liberal lady, having no qualms about Grant's hesitation in telling his new wife the truth, nor with him going so far as to bringing her home and carrying her over the threshold!
It's for this reason that the two are able to rise above the silly material to create a rather sophisticated sex comedy, one that forgives natural indiscretions on the part of each party, and it's for this reason I give the film an 8/10.
Just as "On the whole, I'd rather be in Philadelphia" should be on W.C. Fields' stone (unfortunately, it isn't), Cary's quote would make a fitting epitaph to a career that spanned more than three decades.
The only complaint is that the laughs stop in the last quarter of the movie, which is rather uninteresting as the focus shifts from comedy to romance.
She was magnificently feline, as Pauline Kael says; dispensing slinky, fluttering phrases and quips, and making it clear what a laugh the character is having; she seems rather to be getting off on the entangled situation.
All - or rather much - has to be homogenised; pop star product looks are apparently required, and conveyor-belted into mainstream films.
The actor playing the world-weary, rather Robb Wilton-esquire magistrate ought to have been involved more than he was; an enjoyable turn, that would have been effectively woven deeper into the narrative.
Things did perhaps get rather sentimental with the involvement of the couple's children, although this is hardly the worst such offender in Hollywood history.
I mean, wouldn't you rather see an armored hero plow a villain into the ground and blast him through some buildings than see some kid start literally exploding?
It helped you build a person to person relationship with the character, rather then seeing her as a 'mean' abused child it portrays her as just an abused child.
You sort of take pity on her through this movie, rather then thinking she's an evil spirit trying to raise hell.
The movie is clunky and stereotypical, rather demeaning of Asians and women.
His acting still appeared as if he were performing on stage rather than in front of a camera.
In conclusion I decided that I would rather bash dead babies against a brick wall than watch this movie!!!!!
This lack of likable side ruined the opportunity to contrast nice with mean leaving a one dimensional character rather than the intended schizoid persona.
In fact, it's rather admirable that one can have so much charisma as to be the center of attention all the time, but one side effect to this is that the people around such characters often don't get the attention that they deserve.
The story is all carefully crafted to rotate around the myth rather like a vast conglomeration of space debris and dust rotating around a giant, frozen planet.
Although the movie was directed by Busby Berkeley, it includes none of his celebrated dance extravaganzas, focusing instead on personality rather than pulchritude.
A rather benign 70 minute production where Kay Francis, the daughter of a famous actor, will not tour the country, but rather insists upon making the Broadway scene.
We end up rooting for him rather than just watching him.
I personally don't see what is so hard about paying attention to a film, but with the action genre, I think people prefer to be entertained in a mindless eye candy kind of way rather than a thought provoking-thriller kind of way (but that's just my bias).
A lot of potential in the story, but some rather poor director's work never made it come alive.
Why not pay to get better actors and a better story and rather cut the budget a little on the effects and the score?
But in this case I'd rather be in the car crash and be spared the movie.
And, most of the book's methods of contacting the spirit world are rather silly such as tapping on bowls at Midnight with chopsticks awaiting hungry spirits, or looking between your legs for a spirit.
I found the twist at the end regarding May and Teddy's fate rather amusing and it fits in with the overall mood of this film.
It seems that some time back, Tobin had stolen HER husband and now using a rather intricate plot, she diverts Tobin and Brent to her home--planning on keeping them there while secretly contacting Tobin's husband so he could come there and find his wife with another man.
The computer manipulated skies and open fields looks silly and aged, rather than extracted from a comics atmosphere; and I sure have seen good works on this subject -just take as an example The unbreakable, or Dobermann.
It's not full of four-letter words, sexual exploration, drug abuse, or any of the other clichÃ© problems of teen life, but rather deals with the more day-to-day high school drama of bullying and crushes in a way that's both more innocent, yet more disturbing because of its accuracy.
"Angus" is in fact a rather painful movie to watch sometimes, because the strongest subject matter it deals with is bullying.
The best element here is the fact that we now have character driven rather than situation driven horror.
I felt Ringu 2 to be much more mainstream than the original with the addition of an action type story line and perhaps a rather confusing science fiction element but it fit nicely and was not overwhelming I thought.
Already the subject of a comprehensive TV series ("Ringu: Kanzen-ban", 1995) and a theatrical spin-off (THE SPIRAL, directed by Nakata and released in Japan at the same time as the original RING), the series represents little more than a millennial update of old-fashioned Japanese kaidan, though its ghostly villain ('Sadako') is now a part of the cultural lexicon throughout SE Asia (rather like Freddy Krueger in western society).
The film does not feature shocks and thrills - rather it is a continual and intense grinding down of the audience as we witness the lead character self destruct, become a shadow of himself, and take down everyone around him.
It's a pity that the  character of Reiko is killed off by a runover accident rather than by  the curse itself.
It's rather like suggesting that they're making The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers as a sequel to The Fellowship of the Ring, solely to capitalize on the success of the first one and make more money.
For the first time, we get the sense of Sadako as a tragic figure, rather than a relentless spirit with the sole purpose of seeking revenge on everyone.
As I haven't viewed a single scene from the original second instalment (written and directed by JÃ´ji Iida), it's impossible for me to say if it was deserving enough of its incredibly poor critical and public reception to be completely erased from the continuity of the series (although some who saw it commented that they would rather have watched Sadako's cursed videotape instead).
His self-assurance, disarming directness, and engaging and almost defenseless smile belong now to a slave-holder, rather than a man who in his words, was "born to be joyful."
On the surreal side- you have an abrasive homeless jerk who becomes an angel, an engaged man who decides he'd rather hang with miniature party buddies instead of getting married, and a man who shaves off all his hair for a beautiful woman and then turns into a chair at the end.
Rather, we are offered a wryly comic look at human nature, best suited for those who have lived enough of life so as to be able to identify with the film's pathetically flawed characters, and look on them with affection rather than impatience or contempt.
It is a pessimistic outlook, to be sure, and rather depressing Â but, in the end, we are left with the message that love not only is possible, it is the only thing that gives life any meaning at all.
He`s best known for making DRILLER KILLER a movie far better than it`s given credit for and his only mainstream film is BODY SNATCHERS which is a rather unnecessary remake   THE FUNERAL hints that it wants to be mainstream because everyone loves movies about gangsters don`t they ?
This dusty, low key, low budget gangster film manages to hold the attention for the most part despite being very derivative and rather dull.
What follows is a rather dull boat trip through the bayou punctuated by silly dialog (featuring lots of "cat fighting", frequent use of words such as "dame", "broad" and "loot" as well as frequent whining by Connor's girlfriend) and stock footage that is rather randomly inserted.
Then, in the end, the women all turn on each other and by this point, rather inexplicably, the cop and Connors have fallen in love and the film ends with the surviving broads being arrested.
It seems like my own problem rather than the film's.
I first came to know the rather unique director from his infamous DRILLER KILLER...
I was quite surprised and then I came across this one rather cheap.
But this one was rather interesting.
Chris Penn plays his rather temperamental (surprise surprise, it being Chris Penn) brother, and Vincent Gallo plays young foolish brother Johnny.
They're doing movies which are rather like 3D PC games.
The scene where Martin's hanging off the back of the truck was rather cool.
It all might sound rather fantastic, and it is, in the best possible way!
after the airing of only the pilot), I think the show has the potential to capture the chick-flick audience- provided the plots of future episodes are original rather than predictable rewrites of other women-taking-charge shows.
Their characters all have interesting, new story lines, and the actresses pull it off rather well (especially Miranda Otto).
To be honest, rather than SATC and DH, I was reminded of a female version of "Big Shots".
The children forced into war are a rather surly, sometimes confrontational bunch forced to commit terrible crimes against their will, making this a potentially sadder and bleaker story.
It was not very interesting and although I actually watched the whole thing I was rather bored with it.
The vignettes about the Carlyle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania and Frank Hamilton Cushing's infiltration into the Zuni Indians of the Southwest as an anthropologist and ethnologist suggest just how complete our intent was in living above Native Americans rather than with them.
The main problem is that Hollywood had little experience with focusing on a group rather than on a single character, so Ford's attempt is indeed laudable.
His tired face becomes poignant, his tall, forceful presence paints him as a gentle giant, rather than as the salt-of-the-earth cowboy he is best known for.
It's all rather gentle and beautiful, very subtle.
Vikings were dumb and proud to freeze to death rather than plant trees, adapt and survive.
As the film draws to a close; there's less focus on characters and story and more on sex and the film culminates in one great big orgy scene with a rather shocking sting in its tail!
The difference in approach may strike some as superficial window dressing but makes for a fascinating growth in the character as De Renzy rather than continue the story chose to retell the tale for new times and sensibilities.
Rare for a first season episode, this focuses on Spock rather than Kirk, who remained on the Enterprise this time around.
In the wake of more recent drama series like Law and Order and The West Wing, Magnum's plots seem rather linear and predictable.
The writing for Hillerman along with his acting are some of the most memorable of Magnum, rather than the throw-away characters Rick and TC who seem more like caricatures than people.
Which holds to my theory that some of the best actors are in fact of the supporting variety rather than the "stars", who are there more for charisma and presence than character-acting ability.
I've since become rather obsessed with my "three 80's M's" -- Matlock, M*A*S*H and Magnum.
Later, having shamefully abandoned Vietnam for purely political reasons, our Presidents like Nixon and Ford and Carter seemed rather impotent, like the always wimpy Alan Alda (Hawkeye) in M.A.S.H., and the always intimidated and beat up James Garner in The Rockford Files.
This is a prequel which actually works and explains things rather than giving even more questions.
I am SO GLAD to FINALLY see a movie that shows Native Americans as we are in real life rather than the traditional depiction as scalp-seeking-savages, tells our stories, and shows how life on the reservation truly is today.
It's all rather tame and except for the Buddhist's murder there is nothing shocking.
She (from a single-Dad family) accepted Charlie with equal normalcy and seemed to fit into Thomas' family rather well.
Although there are elements of rather unsubtle box-office pandering (the photogenic young couple and a rather simplistic finale) it opens up new challenges in the way we think about people.
It has been suggested that autism, which has a strong genetic component, is a variation on normal rather than a defect, but its severely disabling nature means it has to be regarded as a malfunction.
With a title like 13 EROTIC GHOSTS I was under no illusion what sort of film I'd be watching - A rather threadbare plot revolves around a bunch of supernatural investigators finding out about ghostly happenings after a girls school is struck by lightening and burns down in a special effects sequence that wouldn't look out of place in the cheapest DOCTOR WHO production   As you can imagine this threadbare plot is just an excuse to show some lesbian love action and despite the sex scenes not being up to the erotic standard of ALLYSON IS WATCHING the sex scenes are fairly good for this type of genre though to be overly critical there's maybe not enough boy on girl action   13 EROTIC GHOSTS doesn't take itself too seriously and does contain this memorable exchange :   " You know she reminds me of my old Co in 'Nam .
It's hard to warm to any of the characters - they are a series of quirks rather than real people (eg Jason Schwartzman doesn't wear shoes, for some unfathomable reason).
The audience are always one step ahead of the authority figure so know fine well how the victim died ( Usually by a camera being thrown in their face or something resembling bees superimposed over the camera lens ) so in order for the plot to go somewhere the running time is taken up with the authority figure meeting a beautiful doctor/scientist/vet so we get a romantic subplot , then about 2/3rds of the way through the movie after the authority figure has consumated the relationship it's then he realises people have been getting killed by cameras being thrust in their face/ rather poor animation and then races to save the local population against superimposed bees   There you go , another by the numbers thriller with deadly bees .
Just So Much that's implied rather than stated.
Otto Heller's photographic style not only shines brightly into every nook and cranny, but the story always goes for the belly laugh rather than the jugular vein).
In DROLE, following Chesterton, say, rather than Conan Doyle, events start in relative order - characters are firmly set in their social positions.
But as the plot proceeds, as characters are revealed to be leading double lives, as the profusion of secondary characters complicates rather than explicates the story, as events become more preposterous and unlikely, the social divisions represented by clear-cut spaces are blurred, and the film  escalates into chaos represented by the mob, that great terror of the English, spilling into the narrative, destroying the respectable middle-class home, flouting and mocking the law, making its own judgements.
I think the gameplay is awful, the graphics isn't good either, it looks to much of an animation rather than a realistic game.
All of these relationships work in rather manipulative ways, except for seemingly the relationship between student and professor, which seems genuine.
I am a fan of the offbeat independent genre of filmmaking and I found this to be a rather interesting entry into it.
Granted the editing was rather sub-par I believe, it was needed to accomodate the screenplay.
An excellent example of when film-makers get tired of a project half way through, and rather than create a quality project, simply go through the motions.
The story was rather dull and pointless and also full of clichÃ©s - bad one's that is.
I guess they tried to make sort of a surreal feel to the movie with the amusement park vampires and the setting in the ending with the blood hoses and that "orgie", but it all came out rather cheesy and silly to me - not frightening as intended.
The DVD does have one other high point, a rather long but interesting "treatment" section that shows what Lussier and Soisson intended.
the action of the film is rather dull and boring, it does not come with something new and, what pis*ed me off the most, puts Romania in a bad light.
Blade 3 had an interesting and rather chilling version of Dracula, but the movie was kind of disappointingly stupidified into shlock.
Their flirtation is rather cute, almost like puppy love, especially when Uffizi cracks his rock-hard face to smile at her.
And that one person can by getting off his or her slacker behind remind us what is means to care for We, the People rather than just Me...  Definitely worth the free download...
The first 30 minutes are rather tame in the gore-department, but still amusing because of the hilariously inept acting and crazy character drawings.
Burt LancasterÂat that time 57 years oldÂin fact dominates the film by a mystic presence, rather than actually being on screen for any length of timeÂ  The bulk of the film constitutes a battle of wits and guns between Valdez and an extremely stubborn leader of a band of trigger-happy gun-slingersÂ   So when Frank Tanner (John Cypher) provokes a shoot-out which results in the death of an innocent man, Valdez asks $100 compensation from Tanner to provide financial support for his pregnant widowÂ Tanner not only refuses, but humiliates Valdez and orders his hired gunmen to beat him hardly, to tie him to a cross, and to drive him out of his placeÂ   Again Spain locations represented the American frontier for this revenge tale about an aging former cavalry man who dusts off his old uniform, straps on his old guns, takes plenty of ammunition, and erupt a one-man army against a greedy, rotten, evil rancher and his henchmen to enforce justice at any costÂ  As the pursuers forge deeper into the wilderness, the situation shifts around with hunters becoming the huntedÂ  Susan Clark (Gay) sides with Valdez without falling in love with him, while Barton Heyman (playing the chief henchman "El Segundo") provides his character with warmth and quality at a pivotal timeÂ
Much of the movie is of people being sort of cruel and insensitive - acting only on impulse and immediate feelings, rather than maturity.
Lenny's "laying out all his cards" for Kelly's Dad (as Lenny does his monologue, and Kelly's Dad responds with his hysterical descriptions of preferring a lit bomb in his mouth rather than having Lenny court his daughter, look at the combination bemused/concerned reactions of Kelly and her Mom--priceless scene).
Shot like a TV rom com, acted like it was shot before a live audience by inexperienced actors (ie they stick with entirely average performances rather than work them into something decent), lit for TV, scripted with a "try to please everyone" dumbed-down - syrup coated - hollow - interconnection of not really connected stories.
Adding to the appeal of the movie are many humorous situations and Mark's affair with Annie who has a rather domineering father.
However, I would much rather see a first time director tackle a project with the complexity and ambition of "Leo" than to have them make yet another pseudo wry, post modern, Tarantino imitation, or, worse, a boring, routine slasher film.
Lying, if done to protect rather than deceive, can be the most heartbreakingly romantic thing of all (I'm reminded of the devoted father in 'A Night to Remember (1958)' who, with admirable composure, assures his family that the Titanic will not sink, despite knowing that his own death is unavoidable).
Even Warren Hymer as the cop is rather good.
The chapters, or rather what are left of them, break off at inconvenient moments, sections are severely disjointed, transitions are non-existent, and so on.
I first learned of the film while studying Latin and therefore was aware of the fractured nature of the original work and was prepared for the same in the movie, and while some of the action is provocative a fair amount of screen time is just, well, rather dull--its hard to follow and has no translation to modern times or sentiments, still through all the meandering there are moments--moments that are visually stunning, inspire awe, and feel like nothing from this world.
Today, we'd rather see a good violent film than to watch, say a film of Ingmar Bergman -- which would perhaps give us more insight about life and about our condition as emotional beings -- and football is taking over our lives.
The ship wasn't built to look like a recognisable ship at all, but was rather like a symbol of one.
On one hand, its many flaws are rather upsetting.
We again have a group of women at the centre of the story, this time they are soccer players rather than prostitutes.
There are frames in this film that I could stare at for long, long minutes rather than the few seconds that they appear on screen.
And I'd rather have a film try too hard then try too little.
In a year when the films with the most impact (like "The Dark Knight") have been those that have tapped into the fears and mindset of the times we live in, it's rather fitting that a movie like "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" comes along at the end of the year.
Like Pitt, she is playing an idea rather than a real flesh and blood character.
Director David Fincher's latest garners an epic feel, not from its rather lengthy runtime, but from spectacular storytelling and intricate character development - or perhaps undevelopment.
When you age backwards, you get more chances rather than missing it.
Although Pitt was very solid in his performance I do not believe he deserved an Oscar nomination (rather Blanchett deserved one) for his role of playing Benjamin Button.
I felt that the great downfall to this movie was that Brad Pitt didn't give an amazing performance and did not take control of the movie rather Blanchett stole the show from him which made Button seem less important to me.
We need to appreciate what we have rather than wonder "what if...?
Although it's a pretty glum and straightforward thing to say that nothing lasts, the film does not depict itself through false optimism, but rather through hope.
We are told in rather soggy voice-over narration (spread throughout the film) that Daisy is "the most beautiful person I'd ever seen", but that's all we'll get.
Too bad that a film that means to affirm life turns out to be rather lifeless.
While I felt he did a good job with the part, he didn't have to do much...Benjamin, fittingly, is a rather quiet character (I'd be willing to bet he narrates more than he actually talks in the film).
There's a couple of plot twists, but it's a rather straightforward story, and as usual, Woo melds it with the action with his trademark style and perfection.
He has the attitude and the look that make his character credible, which helps anchor Woo's art in reality, albeit a rather violent one.
The true brilliance of Woo's films lies in the fact that he never sacrifices story for action, but instead blends the two together to create a whole that is artistically rendered (his action sequences are something akin to visual poetry) and substantial, rather than having an action film that-- like so many others of the genre-- is hollow inside.
The film doesn't display this as a horrific event, but rather as part of the scenery, cannon fodder; the film even gets pretty despicable amusement from this, particularly in one scene involving a baby (don't worry!
The models are alright if low-poly and the backgrounds are rather stunning.
The puzzles are mostly logic based, and while some require inventory items that can be a little non-logical to come by, it didn't takeaway from the experience, but rather enhanced it for the most part.
It could be said that the stage musical actually ends on rather a limp note plot-wise, but this problem has now been neatly licked.
Many people dislike this fight, feeling it's uncharacteristic for Buster to triumph through brute force, sheer slugging, rather than ingenuity or pluck.
This is one of those movies taking a rather gritty look at the world of Italian-Americans, before it became a clichÃ©.
All these scenes are linked by association rather than real coherence, even if the editing by Thelma Schoonmaker (who for some reason didn't work with Marty again until Raging Bull) does a good job in keeping the film together.
I think it's more of a psychological western in which Robert Mitchum works out his own salvation rather than get the help of a doctor like Ingrid Bergman who wouldn't have been available back then because Dr. Freud was just starting to develop his theories around the time this was made.
Where it differs from other laddism comedies, however, is the extent to which characters AND plot lines developed in sophistication and imagination, to the extent that the Kryten+ series are deservedly accorded the rare tag of sci-fi comedy, rather than outer space sitcom.
Yes, they're a welcome relief, but they are, however, rather incompetent scientists: they can't get their experiments right.
), and , believe it or not , a story that IS quite original : a space craft crashes on Earth ,and only one survives , well, two , but the other thing is nonhuman , very nasty and rather horrifying- H.R.Giger would be proud - and , yes , has a huge appetite for humans, but even that is brilliantly explained , as the human race in its quest for resources obliterates anything that lives on any planet,and not asking any questions , but simply sending the fleets of colonizers after the campaign 's been done !
DVD (rather poor quality) rental.
Simply because it probably didn't overdo it, like a uncertain pleader who would try to hard to convince it with fancy words and show, rather then solid statements.
I stumbled upon this move by accident, but being a sci-fi and fantasy nerd, I watched it, despite the fact that sci-fi movies nowadays tend to be rather poor.
Sterling Hayden plays the sheriff rather stiffly, but macho enough to get himself shot in the arm; James Gleason, always a genius, gets the TV repairman to connect the wires to the table on which the automatic rifle is placed which explodes and starts the gun off (I always love James Gleason); the scene goes so fast you have to zero in on all that happens in that moment.
It's all rather predictable and all ends well.
This one degenerates quickly to a love teeny story with some rather weak made for the film music.
There follows a string of crummy gags (broken up by a rather lovely aerial view sequence) before the main storyline kicks in, with Porky taking part in a race with a more powerful train.
Because I want to discuss some of the details of this short, this is a spoiler warning:   This is an interesting little short, though there's very little that's all that special, save for Frank Tashlin using some tricks usually reserved for live-action film rather than cartoons.
A bull has a strong supporting role in a couple of scenes and has a hand (or rather, a couple of horns) in the final outcome of the race.
It may have struck him as odd that the murder weapon was a rifle with a telescopic site aimed from a height (the window of a warehouse, rather than a private home), and that the killer was a wiry, thin, long faced loner with a military record.
However it's rather ingenious as to how it does fail.
Nice try on making a Robert Shaw worthy character, but I would rather watch Zombie Planet with my testicles attached to a car battery than watch this again...
If anything, Castellari's career has shown him to be a shrewd if erratic film-maker who was not only generally content to go with the flow rather than make his own thing so to speak but, on a number of occasions, he cannibalized elements which had been successful in previous films by shamelessly including them in his own (notably Woody Strode's bow-and-arrow expert from THE PROFESSIONALS [1966] being incorporated into Castellari's admittedly impressive KEOMA [1976]).
The story is structured exactly the same as "Jaws", with the first half revolving on the introduction of a tourist beach communion where local politicians rather risk peoples' lives than cancel the popular annual surf contest.
The story is rather dull and uninspired (except by JAWS of course), but Castellari remedies that with very energetic direction, an excellent musical score by Guido and Maurizio De Angelis, and a lot of his mouth-watering wide angle use of slow motion.
Lots of cult film actors (Including Vic Morrow, James Franciscus, and Giancarlo Prete) and a lot of goofy effects and stock footage, make this film completely silly and enjoyable rather than disturbing or shocking as most horror films set out to be.
It was once said that the whole of a movie should not be in so much whether you like or disliked a movie, but rather, did it leave a lasting impression upon you?
Perversions are par for the course and explored rather graphically.
The influence from Wes Craven's classic The Last House on the Left is clear and obvious throughout, but the film doesn't do anything new with it and overall is really rather boring.
The Last House on the Left inspired a number of rape and revenge films; the majority of which hailed from Italy and are rather good if you're into this sort of stuff.
With all due respect to the HK Movie Association who puts this movie as #9 on the 100 best Chinese films of the last 100 year, I believe this movie is rather dated.
It often seems like the actors are moving from pose to pose rather than acting.
Let me explain, the story is rather interesting with many plots.
The Chinese title "Hsia NÃ¼" means "gallant lady", according to the subtitles, but lead actress HsÃ¼ Feng is hard to warm up to, and usually seems off-putting rather than gallant.
They operated in rather different production settings, cultural milieu, sources of inspiration, etc.)
Once I saw King Hu's martial arts masterpiece A Touch of Zen I was rather surprised since it exceeded in almost every level.
In the beginning of the movie we follow the everyday life of a poor artist Ku, an unmarried man in his thirties, who is living in a rather small town with his mother.
it had an eye on the lowest common denominator, concentration on high production values rather than telling a story).
Moreover Hsia Nu is the kind of film one definitely would want to watch on the big screen of a cinema, something rather rare as far as martial arts films are concerned and generally rare for anything not an extremely expensive super-production.
The area Starcraft didn't won me completely over was in the actual gameplay, your army are limited by available resources and most individual units are rather fragile and can quickly be destroyed by enemy fire, I spend lots of time fixing and replacing my battered army rather than planning battles!
The game also has a magnificent story(and well-told(partially through rather marvelous voice-acting, and some through beautifully animated video sequences), complete with three perspectives, and well-written characters).
Further, in StarCraft, the campaigns are meant to be played in a specific order, because they are not concurrent, but rather entirely different chapters in this wonderful complex story.
This is a rather tedious slasher with a lot of the film showing this group trying to find an exit while bickering with each other.
The title seems throughout the film to be rather ironic, since most of the situations they encounter, such as being cheated at a snack bar, are far from wonderful.
Both movies are more about attitudes towards their respective theories rather than the merits of the theories themselves.
for not really getting organized, not engaging in politicking, not being charming when in the public eye, insulting the other side and acting as though the subject is not worthy of debate rather than respecting its dignity and engaging in reasonable debate, and for not really explaining to the public its position and exactly why it's a bad idea to "teach" ID in science class.
It is guilty of exactly what it criticizes the anti-ID camp for, specifically: (1) not really explaining exactly why it's ridiculous for ID to be taught in science class, and (2) arrogantly insulting the pro-ID side rather than respecting its dignity and engaging in reasonable debate.
As Jakob finds a friend of his doing something that will certainly get him killed by the Nazis (this particular friend decided to make a ham-handed attempt at escape rather than overtly kill himself), Jakob runs to him and tells him that he heard on the radio that the Russians were closing in and would liberate them any day.
who is not scary or evil at all but actually seems rather pleasant and almost painfully shy.
It meant that he was willing to put money on the line (mostly his family's) to make a film that he believed in rather than one he knew would break even or make a small profit.
There were some interesting shots but the discipline of film would have had them making sure the light readings were carefully evaluated rather than what happened: the typical low quality of digital, but with even muddier shots than normal for digital.
I caught this on IFC awhile ago, and I was rather hooked (the main reason at first was the title---The Cure is the best ^^).
There is not a lot of plot -- it could be summed up in two sentences, but devotion to those kinds of small incidents in our lives (which often turn out to have the largest impact) allows attention to nuance and subtlety, rather than the broad strokes that gloss over the texture and feeling in our lives.
I especially enjoyed that this movie treated me as an adult, it did not spoon feed me; rather, the movie left me thinking, so I could reach my own conclusions about the relationships between all four characters.
The movie's characters say more by what they DON'T say rather than what we do.
Like the best movies, the script is cut to a minimum so that we may drink in how the characters are reacting rather than what they are saying.
The prose -including the writings of Lorenzo, the main character- is rather corny.
But we are told to forget those loopholes, and rather penetrate one of the holes in everyman's fantasy island, and end up somewhere else, where women declare to us unrequitted love, remember the one-night stand they had with us as a glorious moment in their lives or choose us as their wild sex partner, in a world of limited pain and certain forgiveness.
The place one will remember for a long time: where the tidal flow made by full moons is also the flow of our soul, where we can see happiness as an island -or rather, a raft- in the midst of a sea of indiference, where we can find LucÃ­a's loving and admiring eyes and smile, and live in them forever.  
The focus was also on the soundtrack rather than dancing, so this is a much more thoughtful and full-bodied presentation of the score.
I would rather watch paint dry than sit through disgusting thing.
It's a movie to really think about and it goes from what it seems a twisted story full of rather weird elements to a (if you wanna see it in that way) sweet and simple love story.
But we care not a whit for them, and regret every moment they filch from L & H. Even the usually humorous Eric Blore, as the composer's manager, has to deliver lines that are rather forced & flat.
Most of the movies in the latter portion of Laurel and Hardy's careers were rather poor and stale.
Simply put, the duo are looking rather old and ragged and the jokes that worked well the first few times look a bit stale here.
If you want your comedy really laugh-out-loud funny rather than just amusing enough to spend a half hour with, this show is for you.
I'm actually rather angry that I had to stumble across this film by accident online, instead of seeing it on any of the numerous gay and short film channels or festivals.
YEs the story is FLAWED......... i hated the ending............ anyways.... Sakkena- SOnam Kapoor wasn't really impressive........... she tried..........but she convinced me that she was crazy... and thats the only reason why i liked the movie.... Ranbir kappor is GOOD, not great but surely he will get BETTER...soon.... as for RANI she is never BAD.... Sanjay leela Bhansali made a beautiful looking movie... not necessarily a great movie.... but if u watch it with it with Open minds then maybe u will LOVE it.... or lets say Be able too see something more meaningful in the rather Simple Ending????
This timeless, nameless place befit a film that is grounded in abstract and existential themes rather than plot as the women characters are caught up in an endless cycle of waiting Â Lollipop for her son, Sakina's grandmother for her tenants and her own son, and Sakina for her lover.
I can totally see why this movie might come across as totally lame; it has half- baked plot with a rather strange pace, underdeveloped characters, and a little substance overall.
O's repression and sense of honor make him the sympathetic rival, particularly when it becomes clear that he isn't restrained from engaging his enemy, but rather he doesn't know how to act on his own behalf.
In an rather tired and often exploiting genre, this film really stands apart as an example of the value of depth in characters, theme and story no matter how two dimensional the tracking story might be.
All of the spoofs on the old TV personalities like Howard Cosell, Keith Jackson, Pele, Jackie Stewart and Barbera Walters were rather funny.
Now she has the ability to kill at will rather than with a cursed videotape!
This one is rather funny too, and a rather straight forward kind of game.
So lots of comedy bits, the game progresses rather smoothly to be sure with very little thinking needing to be done to get by most of the puzzles.
Not even his mother, Cloris Leachman, shows much love but rather appears to be on the verge of either slipping into a coma, or becoming a cat, a fate not unlike her "wolfish" grandchild!
If you ever wonder why a feature is released straight to video, rather than to theaters first, look no further for a reason than this wretched mess.
Graphics wise the game is rather uneven.
Jambalaya island in Act II came as a rather big shock for long time fans and still one of my least favorite sections in the game.
Monkey Kombat in Act III, though fun may seem rather tedious to some gamers.
Additionally, I was rather disappointed at the blatant fan-service quality of sticking Murray into the game.
Errrrrm....Wait, I'ts on the tip of my tongue...errmmm....Gimme a minute, will ya...errrm....  Well, that rather says it all doesn't it?
Coming from the same people who gave us the bloody awful Octopus movies, I fully expected Spiders to be a complete stinker; I'm glad to report, however, that this cheapo big-bug movie is a lot more fun than I thought it would be (hey, I might even go so far as to say that it was actually rather good!).
Christina Raines plays a young woman who is diagnosed with cancer, and rather then choosing to live her life handicapped, she chooses to live the rest of her life to the fullest.
We've remarked that not only was the acting superb (and very *natural*, which was rather amazing when considering that many of the actors were relative "unknowns" at that time), but also the *action*; it's like we're literally right there with the officers.
I for one suspect thats probably the case with out humble director trying more to put one over on his audience rather than enlighten them.
The cast is made up of professional actors who seem to be very close to the subject matter in real life, and as is the case with other films of Giusseppe Andrews, the fact that the entire feature is filmed with a small digital camera rather than expensive equipment adds a whole extra dimension of grittiness to the already dread atmosphere.
It's like two contrasting halves glued together in hopes that they will complement rather than clash.
What ultimately saves the film and actually makes it rather special is the romance between Romano and Emma (Allene Roberts).
Humphrey Bogart stars in this rather uneven courtroom, flashback-dominated drama as a good-hearted defense attorney standing up for a young man (John Derek) accused of shooting a police officer dead while making an escape attempt.
Filmmakers like Otto Preminger and Sidney Lumet would later go on to prove that when it comes to courtroom dramas, it's better to relate to the killings through word of mouth rather than showing it either as a prologue or a flashback, for it just seems to get in the way and there is far more drama that can be generated by the actors relating to this event none of them have seen.
Sure, the special effects are rather inferior to today's modern technical improvements, but they didn't seem to bother me all that much because I found the cast so much fun to watch, and the premise was quite enjoyable.
His character George Miller is an introvert, unattractive and rather pathetic looking loner who lives in a sleazy hotel room and paints macabre stuff for a living.
Catto and Bridgeman did not draw their impressive list of collaborators from their personal address books; rather, they were forced to became "world champion cold callers."
If this is what a Big Night Out is like, I'd rather stay in.
I had always been more into comedy than music like most of my mates and this was not only a new show but a brand new style of comedy, much in the same way that Python paved the way for so many comedians, i reckon BNO or rather Mr Reeves and Mr Mortimer did the same in the nineties.
He tackles the rather lackluster script, bringing life to the whole film.
All of this happens in this movie but there is also a rather unnecessary subplot involving a custody battle.
All that happens in this movie is rather predictable.
Speedy Gonzales was essentially a one-note character (kind of like the Roadrunner) so the quality of a Speedy cartoon is largely dependent on the surrounding characters and situations they get themselves into rather than Speedy himself.
Well, it is funny at times, though this is not the point here, because it is supposed to be political rather than funny.
STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning   I'm rather glad I'm now a member of the internet based LoveFilm rather than still renting films from a video shop, because I'd hate to have to phone up and reserve this film.
In fact, the title of the movie refers not to the creature, but rather the android which is in the shape of a cat.
Unlike a lot of animes I have seen this one is more like an American cartoon in that it has a rather short run time which hinders the plot a bit, but all in all it is a fast pace sort of horror in space anime.
I'd rather watch a movie about lava lamps.
At lot of that is due to the subtlety of the sound - it does not overpower or try to manipulate - it merely stays mostly in the background and enhances the suspense rather than detract.
The ultimate villain-ghost that is finally revealed to have triggered the events is actually just a rather misguided and pathetic character so when they came over all demonic at the end it rang really hollow for me.
The events themselves which triggered the haunting were, once again, rather unimportant yet predictable and wholly unoriginal.
In her world a relationship is threatened not by sex with strangers but rather something as seemingly innocuous as holding hands with another person.
I remember this as a rather odd affair, very male, not particularly woman friendly.
A world where blokes are blokey and great, with lovable eccentricities, and women are for ogling - here merely disguised rather than mitigated by romantic pseudo poetic posturing.
This felt rather curious, especially when compared with An Evening With Gary Lineker, in which the characters, both male and female, were much better drawn.
The attention to detail in the football seemed much better in that other play too, here it seemed rather desultory - a sequence of blokes cheering when goals went in and looking glum when they didn't.
To sum up, really rather drippy, almost as wet as Morrissey's mustache as he sipped coffee by the Seine in a ludicrous, introspective setup that a teenager would have been embarrassed to have come up with.
Overall, i'd say watch this one if you loved Fever Pitch, Mike Bassett, or An Evening with Lineker, although this one should be appreciated for its strong acting performances by the female lead rather than the male.
I would rather have watched "Battlefield Earth" again.
I'm sure this is the movie where she is chauffeur-driven in a fantastic Rolls-Royce town car with "rattan"-work around the rear of the car, rather like Norma Desmond's in Sunset Boulevard.
In fact he does a very hilarious job in pouring cold water on a romance between her and a rather fatuous politician played by Lyle Talbot.
Preparing his rather mediocre play in a small-town, he acquaints Mrs. Pepperday, wealthiest lady in town.
The romance between Judith Allen & Joe Morrison is a rather dull affair, although the young man sings well.
The film resembles a sitcom in that the humour arises out of the situations in which the characters find themselves rather than from any particularly witty dialogue.
"The Adventures of Robin Hood" was made as popular entertainment, designed to amuse and thrill rather than make audiences think.
Because others have told the outline of the story, I won't redo that here, but rather focus on why I so completely enjoyed the film.
- especially since I haven't watched these films for what seems like ages - but I won't be doing so immediately, given that a second set is actually coming in March; that said, of the 10 films included, only 1 will be a first-time viewing for me - THE DAWN PATROL (1938) - but it would still be great to have these childhood favorites readily available on the new medium (rather than in the worn, and often colorized, prints I've had to make do with up till now)!
The show every once in a while tries to relate to the comics what with the occasional characters like Toyman and Prankster and whatnot, but fortunately it tries to stay fresh and original and give us stories to which we don't know what will happen rather than redo some comic stories.
I rather rate how much fun I had when I watched it.
They have become sparse enough in this area, that the professionals are almost there for the tourists and as historical re-creationists, rather than as a professionals performing a civic duty.
Underplaying rather than overplaying is a most subtle skill and Corr demonstrates this with aplomb.
As far as tango ambiance is concerned I would rather watch again movies at the National Geographic site (http://magma.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0312/feature2/index.html).
What is left out is not omission but rather is left to the viewer to ponder.
But as I began to accept the film for what it was rather than what I expected it to be, I started to appreciate the honesty and vulnerability he brought to the part (and the same can be said of his direction and writing).
His character is undeniably rather clichÃ©d, but he plays the part better than anyone else could.
It's fun to watch teams pushing themselves over the top with some rather weird quests and having an arguments over nothing.
it was rather moronic not to mention racist and extremely unrealistic .
I would rather coat myself with fresh blood and swim through the Amazon River lengthwise (it's infested with Red Bellied Piranha).
Supporting cast is basically window dressing so your reason for seeing this should not be to see them, but rather to see the maturing twins.
An easy to digest, easy to forget, silly and rather stupid little movie.
That was far better than this, (this was, to sum up: a rather weak effort to make it feel like a good film).
The story at first starts of rather simple but just like in real life things are more complicated than they at first seem.
It's almost as though the new blood directors are shouting "look at me" rather than "look at my story."
Sure, their acting still isn't on a par with what the Roach kids were capable of, but it's still rather a warm scene.
Buckwheat's decision to call the dog "Smallpox" is rather contrived, though, as is the rest of the gang's discovery.
As for the short itself, it was rather funny, especially the scenes where the other kids run from Buckwheat and Big Shot while a radio announcer's voice warns listeners of the "epidemic," and when the kids hog the phone booth in a drug store while other people wanting to use the phone line up behind them (they hang up a sign that says "Line is bizzy").
However, everything outside its general "people are people" running thread is a rather bland salad dressing.
Not because it was a gay slasher film, but because I was worried that the characters weren't going to be portrayed as real people, but rather caricatures of gay stereotypes.
Perhaps the animals would have looked fake in Technicolor, but they are quite impressive in black and white, especially the predatory allosauruses (although they are rather cute in close up when they fastidiously lick their digits after a particularly juicy chunk of flesh or snarl like Elvis Presley.)
There are, of course, countless film adaptations of the story, and, wasting no time, I quickly tracked down the very first of them Â an old and rather battered VHS tape of 'The Lost World (1925),' directed by Harry O. Hoyt and featuring probably the finest visuals effects of its time.
This addition also allows for a (rather predictable) love story, since it's completely unreasonable for young Malone to conclude the film as a single man.
There are changes to the novel Â not only is Bessie Love brought along on the expedition to search for her lost father (with none of the comic relief chauvinism from Challenger found in the 1960 version) but the pterodactyl that terrifies the streets of London has been changed to a lumbering Brontosaurus, which is certainly a change for the better Â but then Doyle's book is rather light on plot to begin with.
Even the collapse of Tower Bridge seems anticlimactic rather than a spectacle highlight.
Lionel Barrymore was rather -- and I apologize for the clichÃ© -- over the top, but he had some great lines and characterization.
Tom Conway is another under-rated actor, and his role was rather thankless, but he looked and sounded very good.
I'm 25 now, and find myself rather worried at some of the cartoons that are produced these days.
I plead that Linda gets work soon again because she is really one of the best actresses out there playing strong women rather than weak and superficial.
We never really find out much about the pianist, except that he is rather mild mannered.
Crawford is less likable than Loretta Young in LAUGH, CLOWN, LAUGH- in fact, I found her rather unattractive and forgettable when compared to Young's sweet charm.
So, Alonzo devises a rather sick solution to his problems.
The action is rather minimal, with only a good wrestling scene from the mid waist up that shows off the great Reeves physique.
He is perfectly cast as an honest cop, battling the system( reminiscent of khakee) except as he himself said, this movie is an implosion rather than an explosion.
While one may forgive Andy's naivetÃ© at thinking Kolkata is still the Baul music city of his dreams, his lecturing to people right & left about how to live comes off as annoyingly snobbish rather than an artist reaching out.
Some rather shockingly morbid gags highlight this very funny confrontation between Bugs and Yosemite Sam, who has dropped the "Yosemite" from his name in order to vary his roles beyond that of the Western outlaw.
Incestuous sub plots and maniacal old ladies don't upset anyone anymore nowadays, so "Lake Dead" is actually rather soft by today's standards.
Also, the film is rather misogynistic.
The movie actually gets rather artful at times.
Unfortunately, teamed with the amateurish script and embarrassing cast, it turned out to be a rather muddled mess.
Reggie then believes Michael and the two team up and the rest of the series plays out rather linearly.
In the supporting roles, Joanna Lumley is delightfully sarcastic as Flora's incongruously named aunt, Mary Smiling, who has a rather unusual hobby.
Jody's role in the film seems to be rather confusing.
Whacky good fun and I like the message that people should follow their own dream (even nutjob religious maniac Cousin Amos, brilliantly played by Sir Ian McKellan) rather than be a slave to a tyrant.
It can get rather dry, so dry that it's simply not funny(like the novel LUCKY JIM), but when it works, it's great to watch, and it works here.
Flora, excellently portrayed by Beckinsdale, is pretentious and rather smug but also well-meaning and likable.
Delroy Lindo has a typically rather small part (unfortunately) but manages to be breathtakingly captivating for every moment he's onscreen (also typical for him).
But the maturity of the young man, the son who has just seen his parents break up in a rather nasty fashion -- that's what's so outstanding.
Satan himself, or rather herself does a curious impersonation of Josephine Baker, who by the way is also be seen in the excerpts from the original Madam Satan, directed by Cecil B de Mille in his most extreme, odd mood (the action of 'Madam Satan,' the original 1930 musical, takes place inside a Zeppelin!).
This film has a warm fuzzy feel to it which stops me being particularly vitriolic about it, but I can't seriously recommend it to anyone either due to the rather slow pace and predictability of the whole affair.
The answers are hinted at rather than announced and the dialogue sparse without being empty.
In fact it is so long ago that my memory of it is probably more filled with nostalgia rather than reality.
Even though the opening wedding sequence nicely sets up a scene of normality for the events that follow, it's rather overlong and a more Hitchcockian terseness would certainly have helped.
For a while the only way you could tell it was a potential thriller was the very moody, rather chilling score.
This is rather a good thriller and perhaps similar in style to Hitchcock, only a bit nastier.
As with all great thrillers the fear comes through the gradual realisation of what is really happening, rather than the continuous portrayal of graphically violent acts.
Given, the scenes between the mother and son at the train station, you'd think it was just another day they were going to visit grandma rather than the necessity to flee from a gangster looking for his stash of cocaine.
rather than as Mr.Bond - get it?
The story is good, and rather dark.
The police captain, O'Grady, is a rather ruthless character.
Later, he lets Ayres's rivals bump him off, rather than prosecute him and risk an acquittal.
This is actually rather ironic considering that in real life, Ayres was strongly opposed to violence and when drafted in WWII, served as a medic because he was so morally opposed to taking lives!
But, when the gangs start fighting among themselves, he is reluctantly pulled back into the picture--leading to a rather dramatic conclusion.
"Immagini di un convento" is a nunsploitation film that really delivers - I would rather call it "Sexual Revolution in a Convent".
it seemed rather pretentious... and very predictable.
For instance, the opening twenty minutes or so, which are somewhat dark and violent, are followed by some broad, over-played comedy scenes (see the rather attractive, yet highly annoying, Mother).
In all, provided you can stomach the rather bad comedy scenes, Drunken Monkey is worth watching.
: Also, be on the lookout for a rather humorous supporting performance from Brittany Murphy as a bored, easily-excited teenager who is also brought along for the ride.
Due to the low budget - which adds to rather than detracts from the style of the film - there's no CGI and wire work is clearly minimal.
Also Brittany Murphy is a scream as Deliverance a rather wacky motel owner, who is extremely randy and has the hots for Malik.
This remake of the classic Brit thriller is far from being the worst movie ever made but it is rather substandard .
From Stephen T. Kay (of "The Shield" fame) comes a Get Carter 're-make', but viewers shouldn't treat this as a re-make of the film - rather a modern re-interpretation of the book "Jack's Return Home" (1970).
I invited anyone who enjoys a movie of old, when it was about entertainment rather than depraved education to make the attempt to find a copy, sit back and enjoy.
If you must buy bargain movies at Walmart, go for VHS rather than DVD.
It is almost a polar opposite of what was to become one of his favorite themes, the wrong man theme, in the sense that it is the populace (and the audience) rather than the police that are on the wrong track.
A mysterious, rather Gothic young man (the great Ivor Lovello) rents the room and his odd behavior almost immediately sends up red flags for the suspicious Mrs Bunting (Marie Ault).
The addition of music is rather overdone in my opinion but it does fill in the empty silence and does add a dramatic effect.
Monosyllabic actress June flounces prettily as their flirtatious daughter; Malcolm Keen, whose character is done rather dirty by the script, plays the suspicious cop who loves her.
After the success, or rather lack thereof, of "Curse of the Pink Panther", Blake Edwards realized he had to accept that Peter Sellers was no more and that he still needed to bring the name Clouseau back into the franchise, even if it meant giving Sellers' classic character an illegitimate son.
Altho Clouseau is such a fool, Sellers plays him with such great presence, so artfully and skillfully, and, yes, suavely, the audience is actually, paradoxically, laughing with rather than at the bumbling Clouseau.
This film is no exception, and it's too bad: it's rather tender and vibrant in its humor, colorful and gracefully paced in its framing and editing.
Too bad - the anger that folks seem to hold for directors as they work into their later years is rather frightening and rabid, it seems to me.
This film is fresh, funny, and, actually, rather youthful.
In the end a rather sad story.
from Terry and Mason's novella rather haphazardly, the film is still one to recommend.
Here she gets into yet more sexual situations, first being raped by a weird hunchback thief (Charles Aznavour) and later rather indecently frisked by a horny cop (Joey Forman).
It is, in the end, a movie that focuses on character rather than action.
Most of the plot and the World War II theme is rather unnecessary, especially as it was not included in the book.
The CGI was beautifully woven into the film so that it did not take away from it, but rather created the water horse to fit beautifully with the surrounding images.
But rather than tell a historically-based story of Richard's time in the Levant, the film tells a very fictionalized and watered-down account of the crusades to seemingly heighten the entertainment factor of its action/adventure/romance story.
By changing the story into almost a Robin Hood story (where Maid Marion is kidnapped by the Sheriff of Nottingham), DeMille creates a more average crowd-pleasing Hollywood story rather than an intelligent cinematic recreation of the Third Crusade.
Their love is mostly a spiritual love rather than sexual one (so appreciated by Medieval people).
DIFFERENT DeMILLE: It is noticeable that THE CRUSADES, though an epic, concentrates more on message rather than lavish sets and costumes.
Given the above, it's a pity that, like most DeMille pictures of this era, The Crusades is dramatically rather weak.
Directed by Ken Russell, this segment was slightly over the top and fun (in a rather stupid way), but didn't really go anywhere and had a non-ending.
Also since this tale can be seen apart from this film in other places, I'd recommend that rather than sitting through this whole film merely for this one part.
Although the Blood Sucking Boob segment was rather disturbing.
It's not poorly made, just seems rather unimportant until the final reveal.
I don't know why but I used to be a huge fan of Creepshow and Tales from the crypt although the later series were rather lame.
Combining animation with some rather shocking scenes of necrophilia and traditional Japanese horror imagery, the episode is both surprising and creepy.
In summation, the film is visually sumptuous, the performances are rather good (although a notable few are wooden) and the story line is clever.
This heart is not made of solid stone, rather a quite flexible rubber.
The colours are far too subdued, giving the film a rather lifeless look, and the demon of the digital age, Edge Enhancement, rears its ugly head again.
The result looks rather like a VHS transfer, but I'd swear in court that the film looked a lot better on my UK VHS copy (mainly because of the colours).
I love this not so much for the story line, although Sandler and Barrymore are adorable together in this but rather the hysterical return to life in the 80's.
This show is so absolutely horrendous that i would rather play ET for the Atari or watch Manos: Hands of Fate than watch this show.
Robot Chicken is not for everyone: some of the humor is rather mature, occasionally toeing the line between edgy and tasteless.
It was rather inspiring to me after I had watched it all the way through.
Not because it is well written or animation genius, but rather it is an exact parody of life.
This show is the epitome of what I avoid by watching adult swim original shows rather than more mainstream comedy; predictable pop culture laden crap.
I also am a fan of Mary McDonnell's work from Dances With Wolves, but her smugness her seemed rather 1 dimensional; albeit not a great role to begin with.
The strengths of SO PROUDLY WE HAIL (1943) are found more in its form rather than the content of its characters.
Here, marriage to a handsome man and financial success - long the expectations of many young Korean women - are not depicted as an absolute guarantee of security and/or happiness, and turning 30 without being defined is hardly the end of the world, particularly for Korean women who remain adaptable to the changes happening around them, rather than being pressured to fit a mold as their ancestors were.
Really neat B-movie cast includes Louise Fletcher as a rather odd scientist(Dr. Erhardt)who finds the being spellbinding, and seems to have been cut off from society a bit too long, and Miguel A. NÃºÃ±ez Jr. as computer specialist/electronics genius Wiley.
Lu Leonard has a funny role as the rather grumpy cook dealing with a rat problem Shivers won't correct due to his procrastination.
But Agniezcka is making a film, rather than a piece for a newspaper: journalism vs. art, capitalism vs. socialism.
Although the journalists in "Kane" said otherwise, they were never seeing "who he was" rather "what he was like" ie.
I kept waiting to see if Rick would turn out to be a total jerk, but it became clear that he was just a rather shallow, unemotional type guy ,who clearly was not interested in relationships and commitment.
(Deshmukh makes, rather, crafts a gun and frees himself without the carjackers noticing, Sanjay Dutt jumps off the cliff and grabs the two falling children.
Thomas' Jamaican accent(..his undercover role is a Jamaican with ties to a criminal organization in New York)is rather amusing, as is his work opposite Crockett's alligator.
This is not a witty movie but rather boring and slow- paced.
What...are they saying they would rather have seen another dim-witted, idiot summer movie filled with one-liners?
Ultimately, "X-Men" qualifies as the best superhero comic book movie ever produced, thanks to a stellar cast led by Shakespearean heavyweights Patrick "Star Trek: The Next Generation" Stewart and Sir Ian "Richard III" McKellen, "Matrix" style special effects which compliment rather than eclipse the plot, and a literate script that parries childish pratfalls.
There is also the issue that powers may be a curse rather then a blessing e.g.
Ian McKellen is brilliant as Magneto and succeeds in creating a human villain rather than the usual clichÃ© like villains we see in Hollywood productions.
The female characters are as powerful and important as the men, rather than being mere love interests.
The acting is consistently excellent, the sort of ensemble acting that keeps the focus on the message of the film rather than on individual attention to characters.
From here we get to see the T-600 and Kyle Reese, Marcus is rather cold towards him at first but he is pretty confused about what is going on.
Obviously, Skynet's new gadgets have been introduced and they're rather interesting, though gaudy in some respects.
I didn't find it refreshing but rather stiff and stale like old bread.
I find it rather ironic that someone would call this film brilliant.
Resembling more like Desperado rather than a Frank Miller graphic novel (marketing was gearing in that direction), Shoot em' Up is one of the most insane flicks in recent years.
I find this rather unfortunate because I had been anticipating Shoot 'Em Up for quite some time and had heard many good things about it.
Leaps in logic and rather mundane action drop this film to the bottom of the barrel in terms of summer blockbuster material.
The film is rather slow to start although this time is used well in building up the plot line and characters.
all i gotta say for this movie is that it blows, pointless story line,crappy cast, no laughs, waste of my time and the TV stations, the best part of this movie was the mud wrestling all though it lasted some 5 seconds i love meghan in this movie and i think she was the only bright spot but ya this movie blows i give it a third of a star(only cuz they mud wrestled) out of 5, plz don't watch this movie even if it is the only thing on TV i personally would go to sleep but eh its the best option considering this movie will put u to sleep wut a waste to the national lampoon series damn id rather watch van wilder again at least it had some laughs, o well this is wut the movie world has come to
I'd rather watch Kim Possible or Pokemon instead.
For one thing, the men seem to be treated rather decently by the guards - who seem to exist in surprisingly small numbers, actually - and the prisoners appear to have more freedom to walk around and interact with one another than we are used to seeing in American prisons (or, at least, in movies about American prisons).
As with each perspective, we are woven into each predicament and, possibly, led to believe that most are victims and victimised rather than perpetrators of crime.
I was actually rather surprised that this film was as enjoyable as it was.
It's so unfortunate that American film and theater productions place greater value on perfectly photogenic looks, rather than exceptional talent.
My only quibble concerns the decision to pattern Lewis Stadlen's Banjo after Jimmy Durante's version in the film, rather than Harpo Marx (upon whom the character was originally modelled), but that's a matter of personal taste.
For anyone who is an admirer of Richard Linklater's two wonderful films, 'Before Sunset' and 'Before Sunrise' - of which I include myself - then this rather excellent film will show you another side of Julie Delpy that was not really glimpsed in those films.
In 'Before Sunset/Sunrise' Ms Delpy's character was a rather sweet, innocent abroad type of character, whilst here her character may start off looking that way, and the voice over helps to build that initial impression, but it does not take long for us to realise that here is another side of her, one seemingly obsessed with sex, and finding the ideal partner.
Because interest is generated by what's being said, rather than what's being seen, the low grade visuals are not a problem at all.
To begin with, the plot is rather flimsy: boyfriend, American, and girlfriend, golden-haired Frenchwoman, are together for two years, start to get bored of their relationship, and thus decide to travel to Italy and visit the girl's parents in Paris.
Julie Delpy who was absolutely charming as Celene, the heroine of two Richard Linklater's movies (Before the Sunrise and Before Sunset), tried to make the similar film or rather follow-up about the couple that have been together for few years, experience some problem in their relationship, and try to work them out.
That's the basic premise, with Jack being brought around Paris by Marion, as well as to catch up (or rather providing the opportunity) with Marion's friends, which inevitably involves ex-boyfriends.
Whether one wants to call him touchy and easily offended will probably also depend on whether you think that, in the first place, he is being treated badly by all those slightly crazy Parisians or whether you would rather want to say that he is a bit stiff and inhibited.
All in all, it feels like a very personal look at French (or rather, Parisian bohemian) life, and very much worth a viewing.
Mysterious Skin doesn't hammer its message into the viewers head but rather makes him think about the fact that a small moment in the early years can change a life forever and nothing can be undone again.
Robbie Benson (Billy Joe) was not raped as others would like for you to believe, but rather explored his true feelings.
Written by Morey Amsterdam it plays more as a series of loosely connected sketches rather than as a film as a whole.
There is humor but the acting by the two leads is so broad and over the top that the film becomes annoying rather than amusing.
throwing a bunch of naked chicks in the flick only makes me think of some porn i'd rather be watching.
Meanwhile, MiddletonÂbilled here as CharlieÂplays an incompetent but honest sheriff rather than a dastardly villain.
Bradford (George Zucco, who played Professor Moriarty in "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes") is a rather suspicious character himself who specializes in smuggling felons across the border into Canada.
When this show first came out it was considered the Sex and the City for the black folk, and while the premises of the show is smiler (withe the four female friends looking for love career and everything else in between) it's rather different as well.
This definitely works better as exploitation rather than horror and it's one of the reasons why audiences loved these films from Hammer.
It rather ruined the 'return to his true love, to make up for all the wrong he'd done her' ending for me.
All this is set to lovely music and the scenes continually change--morphing from one scene into another rather seamlessly.
This is a must see for any Russian film lovers; or rather, anyone who enjoys something with spice.
The visual jokes are all rather amusing but I do feel sorry for Tom when he's victimized in such a way.
This was a fairly amusing short and it was great to see Tom getting some rather good hits in on Jerry, which it seems seldom happened.
Hollywood could do worse than release films with integrity by artists whose following grows yearly rather than the current dustbin classics of late.
Whilst mocking all those terrible tartan images which are so cringeworthy at the best of times it never takes it too far and it feels like it is an affectionate laugh at us and our 'culture' rather than an out and out pisstake.
In this greatly under-rated film, Mike Myers plays a man scared of commitment, until that is he meets Harriet and they fall in love, but does she have a rather macabre secret?
Upon hearing Of the Countess's death Frank Ventura (Cristea Avram) and his wife Laura (the rather attractive looking Anna Maria Rosati) also both travel to the bay to try and buy it so he can begin to a build long planned development that the Countess was so opposed to.
My one real complaint about this movie is the head-scratchingly odd ending, which really ties things up rather nicely, but leaves a rather questionable taste in your mouth.
The rather loose plot is centered on a lovely bay belonging to a Countess.
I was shocked to learn that this movie was not shot in a wooded area, as Bava has made it appear, but rather the woods were simulated by clever camera angles and random branches held in front of the camera.
Only a few things spoil the ride here, and admittedly they are rather major.
She's terrific chewing the scenery as Anastasia Gargoli, mother to some rather objectionable jerks who (along with their children) are trying to kill her for her inheritance.
many years ago on Cable TV â in fact, back when I wasnât yet a Euro-Cult devotee and, consequently, ended up being rather lukewarm on it.
Incidentally, Bavaâs film has also been seen as a black comedy in some quarters â but itâs rather difficult to concur, in view of all the typical giallo viciousness (reportedly, former Bava collaborator Christopher Lee walked out of a screening of the film because of its excessive violence!).
The film had a handful of alternate titles both on its homeground (3) and abroad (4); itâs rather a pity that the R1 and R2 DVD editions do not make use of the best titles: personally, I would have preferred TWITCH OF THE DEATH NERVE to A BAY OF BLOOD and ECOLOGIA DEL DELITTO to REAZIONE A CATENA!
Tim Lucasâ audio commentary on the new Anchor Bay disc imparts a lot of information despite having the occasional silent passage: most interesting was the filmâs genesis as Dino De Laurentiisâ initial foray into the giallo genre (he eventually backed out of the project) and as a collaboration between prolific genre screenwriter Dardano Sacchetti and Mario Bava (after the former had had a falling out with Dario Argento) - but Lucas informing us about the sad fate of some of the participants (heroin addiction, hardcore pornography, murder and incarceration, suicide) makes for a rather gloomy track.
This film gets right down to business pretty quickly; in short order two of the characters get knocked off although the first nine or so minutes, rather effectively, play out without dialog.
Garbo's performance is good but seems rather strained.
massacres inflicted by Armenians to hamshins, Kurds, turks and Tatars (azeris of today) why its always found out only Muslim graves in eastern Anatolia rather than so called genocided Armenians??
A shame this is so bad really, because I like bad horror movies and actually rather liked the basic premise: Back when the Spanish were being generally unpleasant to natives in America, they enslaved the local populace and got them to mine all the gold out of the mountains and basically ended up with a wet dream's worth of gold.
I would rather spend my money on quality videos.
This isn't the worst film ever but it's certainly a very bad, cheesy, poorly acted, amateurish title in the "Jason" series and the fact that it was indeed NOT the last "Friday the 13th" film is rather ironic in itself.
After Jason was killed in the last 8 entries, it seems rather stupid to try and explain that this would indeed be the last time, especially since they would go back on their word, also their Final Chapter was hardly the last.
So rather than be inventive, the writers just threw all of this at us and hoped we would lap it up like thirsty kittens at a milk dish.
Like "Part V," it probably would have worked better as a horror film independent of the Jason saga, rather than dragging Mr. Voorhees into a place he has no business being.
The director seemed to be going for shock value rather the exploring the various levels of why these characters are like this.
The pared-down visual style gives the movie an edge and intensity, as if you're watching real people in a documentary rather than a fiction film.
who actually prefer to see their cult favourites -- usually larger-than-life actresses -- in *bad* films, rather than good ones.
Following the commercial success of "11 days, 11 nights", this was marketed as a sequel, but it is rather more like a remake, and it is a slight improvement on the original.
This one doesn't hurt, but rather leaves you with a stale taste.
Loud music is no warranty for a climax and in this case it causes rather more of an anti-climax and irritation.
I thought even her voice sounded like Stone's once or twice (or rather, Stone's sounds like Malone!).
I call it a French flic rather than the usual "film", because it seems more American than French.
The performances are so subtle that they barely register, and the inevitability of the rom-com structure makes waiting through the minutiae of their developing relationship a challenge rather than a joy.
French people have a tendency for long and deep conversations about not too offensive and personal subjects as a way of courtesy and care for one's private life, so this is rather challenging stuff I guess.
though two french stars(reno binoche) are trying to make their character genuine, their presence don't make a good story, you even wonder what sergi Lopez cameo's appearance is doing in this story?jean reno as a international business man is not very convincing and Juliette binoche plays as in a loreal commercial endorsement, after 20 minutes the intrigue is gone, and everything is just not believable if you like the plot you'd rather watch Philippe Lioret very good "airport" movie "TombÃ©s du ciel" with jean rochefort
but overall the film was rather serious.
It's (as far as i know) a rather unique thing in Swedish history.
When they understand that and hire someone decent to write the script (instead of burning their money on fight-scenes filmed from three angles), then maybe this could be entertainment rather than just a bland and boring waste of money and time.
Despite the rather violent and dark plot with various scenes of torture the film is beautifully shot in a nice landscape with lakes and waterfalls in front of a blue sky.
Together, with a rather heavy set man called LaFarge, meaning Load, they set off and discover a race of albinos living under the mountain.
Now I rather enjoy finding all the scientific and historical inaccuracies in those old movies about giant insects, shrews the size of dogs, and an underground civilization that lives on mushrooms and speaks English.
It is one of the best portrayals of an alcoholic that I have seen, because March focuses on the pain, the resentment, that causes him to drink, rather than just the ugly aftermath that a binge leaves in it's path.
Gaynor also does rather funny impersonations of Garbo, Hepburn and West at a Hollywood party that reveal a knack for comedy.
Although The Mole People isn't the best of Universal's 50's sci fi movies, I rather like it.
Worst of all, Wellman's direction was far too discreet and distant, making the storyline seem rather childish.
so disregarding his own life and safety, he rather capture them and risk his life, then to let them go and wait countless years before another opportunity.
Christopher Walken is superb in the role of Whitley Streiber, a rather wacky and annoying New York writer, who encounters alien beings at his country house.
Lindsay Crouse, however, seems rather miscast in the role of the supportive yet frustrated wife, not that she doesn't give it some effort.
Looking at these creatures, one is more likely to think they are cute rather than creepy or surreal.
There are so many classic lines of dialogue between Walken and the aliens that the movie reaches a point where it seems almost like a bizarre, personal delusion--portrait of a madman rather than alien abductions.
Further unlike most low budget films these days it was actually shot on film rather than dv so it doesn't look like someone's home movie!
While I have only seen the rather underwhelming Once Upon a Time in the Midlands from director Shane Meadows, this isn't so much as a jolt back in the right direction as it is a full blown shove back onto the correct tracks.
The characters don't seem to be experiencing any romantic epiphanies, either, but rather the filmmaker seems to be exploring the kind of questions of how-do-you-fall-in-love-and-who-with that are so ... collegiate.
This is really a film for lovers of Paris rather than Rohmer's directorial style and is probably one of his most accessible film to date.
This movie works because its setup in a small town with backstreet gangsters who at times look ridiculous driving in their small car and hunting Richard is not the typical depiction of good/bad but rather different.
Seeing it again on DVD, some of the early scenes made me laugh because the acting is rather wooden, and the production values are very 1970s.
Both are also average-looking rather than gorgeous which makes the story more believable although Sorcha is beautiful in a classic way.
Faithful as the long conversation are rendered in the '73 version, they appeal to the intellect rather than the heart, they are interesting, but not captivating, and they lack the focus and also the intensity of the scenes between Rochester and Jane in the '83 version.
Despite the fact that this movie was filmed long ago, that the costumes were rather strangely chosen (at least for today's viewer), and that the supporting cast is not always at its best, this is by far the best Jane Eyre adaptation in my view: it manages the perfect note for the two main characters' development, for their chemistry, and for their reason of actions.
Filmed in rather nice black&white.
She sounds like a 40 year old rather than a child of 8 or 9 which she is supposed to be.
In fact I would say there is a little too much subtlety, to the point where the details that are supposed to be underplayed to maximise the mystery and suspense do not seem to be underplayed at all, but rather they appear to have simply been ommitted.
The difference is that in this case, the intermittent gaps are in the story rather than the action.
What this makes for is a thrilling and genuinely frightening conclusion to the film, but a rather dull experience for the rest of the time.
This is a rather enjoyable movie that is nothing too impressive but is a good watch nevertheless.
Despite its genre clichÃ©s, this is still a rather well made movie.
300 is a rather easy target, and the jokes they make are fairly predictable.
This movie also has Sherman Hemslely in a rather large role so once I saw that flash on the screen, I knew the film would be kind of generic.
Though the setting was on a small scale, (the state of California rather than the entire U.S.) it shows the chaos of what could happen and that is just in California.
While certainly nowhere near as graphic or violently upsetting as a film like Irreversible, it is easy to draw comparisons as this is a film which tackles notions of human nature and the horrible things people do to one another, all shot through with considerable style and skill (think Hal Ashby meets Michael Winterbottom) and performed by actors who never seem to be giving performances, but rather becoming those characters for 90 minutes.
The film's key-note shock scene, a bit where a woman gets impaled through her genitals, sounds more shocking than it really is, as the cut-away dummy used looks so fake as to induce chuckles rather than shrieks.
Patrick was an obscure (and rather boring) Australian thriller released in 1978 and I doubt even the makers of it would have planned a sequel; but for some reason Giallo a Venezia director Mario Landi saw fit to direct a (presumably) unofficial sequel to it anyway.
As anyone who has seen Giallo a Venezia will expect, much of it is of the misogynistic variety; with one death scene in particular, which sees one of the ladies have a poker rammed up her vagina (in a really rather bizarre scene that has to be seen to be believed!)
This film does not judge the characters it presents, but rather reveals people who are trying to do their best to "break the mould" with limited options for advancement.
It is nice to see Beldar be a father figure to his daughter rather than the "Let Your Kids Be Who They Are" mentality of these days.
Some say it was rather late, I would say, "Who Cares?"
It really brought back some rather shitty memories from my past.
It is nice to see Beldar be a father figure to his daughter rather than the "Let Your Kids Be Who They Are" mentality of these days.
I would much rather watch this than Lord of the Rings or Star Wars movies.
Looking laughable, rather than menacing, in a fetching camouflage jumpsuit and black motor-cycle helmet, our maniac somehow manages to stalk their prey unseen, before blasting them with a volley of nails.
Throw in some unconvincing and rather weak gore (let's face it, nails don't make a lot of mess: small puncture wounds with a trickle of blood), and what you have is an amateurish production that completely fails to capitalise on its sensational title.
He was not arrested by the Stasi at the end of the summer of 1956, but rather in November of that year.
He does, but rather than being comedic this movie is dramatic and touching.
However, when he was a martial arts coach (he preferred that word, rather than "teacher" or "master"), the top 3 karate tournament competitors were all his students.
While other documentaries often focused on his meteoric rise to stardom and the mysterious circumstances surrounding his untimely death, this documentary chooses rather to focus on his life, his teachings, his way of thought and his remarkable achievements - all of which made him a legend.
This is BY FAR the best Bruce Lee documentary I have ever seen for two reasons: they consentrate on more of his philosophical beliefs rather than his life story, and they show GAME OF DEATH!!!
Visually the sepia rounded-corner 19th century photograph look of it is a stylish stylistic directorial choice from Arbuckle, showing the talent he could display (and would again) rather than simply allowing the action to be the film.
I have seen some rather hideous films in my life, but frankly this one qualifies as one of the all time worst, particularly in light of the immense talent of writer & director Stephen Norrington, an otherwise fine cast, and some incredibly gifted technical people such as the editor and the cinematographer.
Even when accosted by two men who could easily overpower her, she uses her resourcefulness to outwit the two rather dim-witted thugs, holding them off for just long enough to accommodate the arrival of her rescuer and male suitor (Francis J. Grandon).
While some of the moments were rather strange and surreal, the impending desperation that falls on Anthony Edwards' character is quite interesting, considering he has no need for monetary wealth.
This entirely fails to pay off as the script for the lovers is risible (they won't be diamonds, they'll be soup) and Mare Winningham is not up to the task of proving to us that she genuinely loves this man in the closing moments, rather that she is scared out of her mind (who wouldn't be) and will say anything.
This movie is rather offbeat; the acting is not bad, but just unlike normal hollywood acting, even despite a few familiar faces.
It's not such a bad film; it's really rather tender and sweet.
Despite the rather silly casting of Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman as French criminals, they work surprisingly well together.
This is a terrific film to show your children, a behind the scenes that is informative rather than salacious or snarky.
Well, because I'm a rather evil person who will no doubt find great delight in watching this pack of moronic actors have little-to-no success in the future.
However, none of the cast proves quick-thinking enough to deliver jokes, but rather try to pass off odd and quirky behavior as humorous, and for the most part they fail at that, too.
The second, and most important, is that I would rather live my life as happy and wonderful and comfortable with myself as I am and die at 50 than live until 108 always fighting to be someone I'm not.
You'd probably get much more entertainment from that rather than this film.
I concede that the film uses rather ordinary plot devises of violent setting, young vs. old, etc., to contrast the characters' predicaments.
It is pretty clear to me after watching the movie that Ross had never intended on making a movie about Sherman, but rather was the inventor of the modern day self absorbed BLOG.
Now it isn't just that he came off as rather dull, but the women he was set up with also really didn't spark any interest as well.
In particular, Pat seemed rather flaky though pretty and Ross came off with a personality that was akin to balsa wood.
These are people I would rather not know let alone invite into my living room.
The ending for one is rather ham-fisted, and a scene between the oldest son and his school therapist seemed awfully pat to me.
I would rather eat my own feces and snot and down it with milk mixed with Kraft EZ Cheeze (I'm lactose intolerant btw) and Clorox and Drano than have to watch this stupid crap again.
As Marie & Janice investigate they uncover some dark secrets that townsfolk of Drago would rather keep hidden & are prepared to kill to do so...
As it stands, HM2 is predictable straight to DVD junk that offers very little to fans of the first film: what effects there are have a distinctly cheap look; Slater phones in the majority of his performance (he only actually appears in a brief flashback); the script and direction are bland; and the film ends rather abruptly with the highly trained Griffin being defeated all too easily by Turner.
Segal chose to go the comedy route, rather than drama, for which he is equally qualified (Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?).
There's a lot of crude humor and some stupid childish gags that embarrass rather than entertain (such as Farley's fight with the eagle).
Secrets of a Call Girl is a rather odd Italian crime film as instead of focusing on the usual areas - shootings, car chases, fist fights etc, we focus on the hard done to girlfriend of a mobster; Anna, played by Edwige Fenech.
It has to be said that this film is more than a little slow at times, especially compared to other similar genre films owing to the fact that the focus is more on Fenech's character rather than the mob activities.
Beginning with real passion and some swirling and effective film-making it is rather a shame that the last section has to rely upon the dubious interest of her and her child and her doctor lover.
The plot is ridiculous and the screenplay rather dull and nothing ever fits together to solve the riddle as you would like to in this movie.
It's rather infuriating how this movie contains truckloads of sequences in which fish and harmless smaller shark species are tortured and killed for no reason other than 'sport' and 'amusement'.
This actually gives the film a rather surreal feel as the language is constantly chopped and changed.
To call this movie a Jaws rip-off is rather misleading in some ways.
By trying to tie up hatred and bigotry into one neat little package (by compartmentalizing and homogenizing groups of people), the movie fails in a rather big way.
This film could have been better perhaps from an American director rather than from an "outsider" looking in.
Special mention has to go to the ever-dependable Gene Hackman who returns to form as the no-nonsense former sherrif who knows how the locals tick and isn't about to be fobbed off in the same way as the rather naive & clean-cut Defoe.
The realism that this film contains is both distressing and comical; a compound genre that I feel is rather difficult to accomplish.
Through the camera's scope, the viewer does not witness an organized, calculable story, rather an intelligently assembled collage of personal movies filmed by Andrea and Wayne to both document their quite casual domestic family life as well as their gruesome escapades that are performed in secrecy.
Their bickering tends to be rather boring, something you've heard a thousand times from listening to your dull neighbors.
It is very stylized in places but with finesse, nothing looks excessive or gratuitous but rather serves the story.
The picture concludes rather realistically, albeit tamely, I feel; how much more satisfying would it have been to see Claire really go up against the vicious tramp dog, Chloe?
Although the end might be a shock for many it was, in my opinion, an audacious turn on Ozon's behalf rather than a cop-out.
If there is a puzzle to be solved, I do not think repeated viewings would achieve this; rather, it feels like an open-ended mystery.
A mystery to savor rather than solve.
But there's a hitch, and that is that John's young, fast and loose daughter named Julie (Sagnier) frequents it rather often thus causing friction, disagreement and general strife.
It is likely that he rose to such prominence mostly because of his winning personality and good looks, rather than the movie plots, but in studying Western movie history, I learned that when he was given his chance to be the star of his own series, he set out to be good at his job.
I was rather bored in the beginning, but by golly this movie takes off and becomes downright exciting.
MGM put together these three stories of passengers on board a ship remembering three recent romances that all ended rather differently for the protagonists.
All three stories end rather differently so you can expect quite a roller-coaster for your emotions.
Although this movie has three rather uneven stories in separate segments, the overall package succeeds, is quite beautiful artistically and is highly entertaining.
This film isn't a classic, but it is about people rather than robots or a serial killer, and it doesn't insult the intelligence of people over 20 years old.
He thus accomplishes the rather difficult task of creating a film that people will laugh at AND laugh with.
I would rather watch this than have to suffer through another viewing of UNderworld.
Overall, a rather bad movie with a few redeeming qualities.
considering the source, the cinematography stands out as rather good.
We all want to give good reviews to desi films- but hey... let's be objective rather than just loyal!
I know of many friends who are studying engineering, medicine or business (the only `approvable' majors for Indian Parents) who would rather be majoring in liberal arts.
I am currently majoring in comp sci, but would rather be majoring in history or political science.
The characters of this movie are all one-dimensional stereotypes - the overly garrulous Sikh (played rather badly by someone of Bengali descent who could not enunciate the Punjabi accent), the ridiculous TA who speaks with his fly open, the uptight Indian girl who won't kiss the guy, and the crooked shopkeeper who overcharges the customers.
There is not much to say about it rather than it's got terrific story line, music and it's fully action packed.
To a newcomer, I would rather recommend FATTY AND MABEL ADRIFT, LOVE or THE GARAGE.
It's hard to believe that this rather passive Elvis is on the verge of making his celebrated '68 comeback.
Romantic comedy, screwball comedy, political intrigue, comedy of mannersÂit has so many angles that it leaves one rather unsatisfied.
Regrettably, Olivier's rendering of the Grand Duke seems rather wooden and dated by comparison.
Because when a powerful man in a 1957 movie has political opponents arrested without trial on charges of "un-Carpathian activity," that's a comment on the ongoing red scare in the US rather than on Imperial Germany.
In 1989, this probably seemed like so much nonsense rather than anything groundbreaking or postmodernist.
"It's a rather frustrating question since I'll never know the answer.
Later, we learn that this tribe is fleeing from a band of savage warriors led by Zero Wolf (Raoul Trujillo of "Highlander 3") who wear more tattoos than any outlaw biker gang and sport some rather painful looking body piercings.
However, Mel Gibson isn't witty but painfully earnest, and thus his violent formula is disturbing rather than entertaining.
And indeed he simply seems to float along the stream of life so that events occur TO him; rather than he be in control of his life.
One of these was quite significant in that it described a rather violent homosexual relationship that the hero had whilst in prison.
I'll start by saying that it's been a few years since I read the book but a review of the film I skimmed before watching it and my own surprisingly thorough recollection indicates that Visconti's film is a rather close adaptation.
At the beginning of the film Meursault goes to his mother's funeral and appears rather stoic.
I always thought of him as a talented window-dresser rather than a great or even a good filmmaker (Bertolucci has inherited his mantle).
'The Dying Gaul' calls up the lesser of the two, amounting in the end to cinematic wool-gathering, rather like this comment is becoming, so I won't continue much longer.
Besides some of the plot holes that I still can't figure out, I was rather captivated by The Dying Gaul.
Ironically, while Saarsgard may have the most interesting character on paper, he's actually rather flat compared to Clarkson and Scott.
The film starts out with a quote from Herman Melville's MOBY DICK, "Woe to him who seeks to please rather than appall," which by the end turns out to be a commentary on the inner workings of Hollywood and if the main character played brilliantly by Peter Sarsgaard wants to be a part of that.
The film's screenplay does contain a rather obvious plot hole.
Richard Gere and Ling Bai are a great combination, however, the film is rather long and drawn out and intends to become a bit boring.
at the climax rather than caring about what is happening.
Silly tricks start subplots, and dialouge rather than action end them.
It reminded me of Hal Hartley's films- most notably "Trust" - tho these characters, at least Emily, are not quite so dysfunctional and there seemed to be a slightly more positive vibe (or rather less bleak outlook) to this film than Hartley's.
You may be thrown a bit (as was I) when characters are doing things out of character, not realizing it's a flashback, but that only adds to the experience- I'd rather be confused for a few minutes than have some obvious corny announcement that a flashback is coming, like squiggly dream lines appearing on screen.
He's also enlisted some rather famous actors, and the movie's been shown in regular format, a 3-D projection with the old glasses bit, and I-Max.
While the set design for the interiors is really rather snazzy.
First, the film shows the US adopting a one-child policy, which is rather improbable given the fact that the US is a large country & is not packed to the brim like China, thereby making such a law pointless.
The acting is rather mixed.
It would seem that Poe has been reading too many of his namesake's books, leading to a rather deviant bent, a lust for married women and psychedelic dreams, plus (due to genetic enhancement) the inability to hold his drink.
This is a fun low budget Sci-Fi prison flick, that's rather exciting, with a solid story, and fun performances!.
This is a fun low budget Sci-Fi prison flick, that's rather exciting, with a solid story, and fun performances in my opinion, I highly recommend this one!.
At 16 Wong already knew to act with her eyes, rather than with her arms, like Johnston (the princess) does.
What makes this sad rather then just a novelty is that Robert Zemeckis used to be such a great director and one of the things he was best with was memorable characters.
It's of course all rather simple and formulaic but this is also what makes the genre so great.
The book was not based on Norse mythology, which the movie made references to Odin and Ragnarok and such, but rather based on beliefs of God.
Rafe and Katherine put themselves into a mystery that crosses the boundary of the living and the dead--rather, the undead.
My first impression of Rafe is that he's a jerk, but I discovered (rather quickly) that he is rather good-natured and good-intentioned, and that he truly wants to help Katherine out.
I admit, this movie has some of those aspects, but it rather focuses on a corny, stylish animation work.
The action and animation itself reminded me of a teen-rated video game rather than a masterwork.
However, there were a couple of scenes in the movie of which some of the up closes of the actor's face in certain scenes look real rather than animated, particularly in the scene of where Beowulf encounters Grendel's mother.
As with the story, rather than beginning with King Hrothgar murdering Grendel's father, it opens with the King having a party of drunkenness and very inappropriate nudity, particularly for an animation film.
I felt no pain for him, rather an urge to say, "Shut your gull!"
I can kind of associate with the story, I have a social problem called Asperger's Syndrome, it may cause problems in my social life and skills, but I do like the fact that in one of my schools, I became a student known by almost everyone in my final year (11), and the film story seems rather similar to mine in places, and it is a very good film.
His mom Rusty (Cher) has a drug problem and has a poor relationship with her own parents, and he spends his time hanging out mostly with a rather tough looking group of bikers, at least some of whom are also into drugs.
That same night, in Rome, Benigni's cabbie talks his holy passenger to death while making his confession, and, in Helsinki, a laid-off industrial worker and his colleagues (VÃ¤Ã¤nÃ¤nen, Kuosmanen and Salmela) meet a taxi driver (PellonpÃ¤Ã¤) with rather more to be depressed about.
The effect is rather like bolting through an exhibition of Edward Hopper paintings at high speed, half-glimpsed nighthawks on the periphery of vision.
This is one of Jarmusch's best films, because it shows how important to subtleties in riding in a cab can be rather uplifting.
His rather jazzy sounds give it a noir-ish feel to it.
I found the story of the Roberto Benigni episode rather stupid, but his talent in exaggerating (so he did this even seven years before 1999's Oscar ceremony!)
The concept of the movie thinks of night as a place rather than a time, because all of the stories begin at the same moment in time but in different time zones.
If you like other Warner Brothers' cartoons I'm sure you'll like this although if I wanted to watch a few Roadrunner shorts I'd mix them in with other character's cartoons or they might seem rather repetitive.
I missed the 3D incarnation as we were watching the DVD rather than the cinema release, but after a while you stop looking at the CGI and start enjoying it.
Much of the movie is badly lit... the screen is too dark, and although this could be construed as being spooky or mystifying, I think it's rather unnecessary.
Being a rather jaded horror/exploitation fan, rarely do I find anything that actually shocks me or scares me to the core (although there are some D'Amato films I refuse to ever watch!).
I was rather disappointed with his "masterpiece" Buio Omega, so I didn't have high hopes for this one, either.
What I think he did better than most schlock was that he used actual tricks of the scary movie trade, rather than just thinking of the most vomit worthy ideas imaginable (which are still present here).
When you get to the last half hour, then the movie flies into gear and knocks you out with a punch, but other than that, there are some notable events here and there, but it's mostly rather dull.
To those of us who have seen a bunch of these movies, though, the impact isn't as severe, but I find his unflinching ability to shock rather amusing.
There can be no more visceral an image of a child born into the world of No Future than this, yet those who see it as mere unnecessary nastiness on D'Amato's part might reflect that it has a partial real life analogy in the treatment meted out to Sharon Tate's unborn child in the Manson gang murders as well as a rather more classical forebear in the famous Goya painting of Cronos devouring his child (in D'Amato's film, the father looks on as his child is eaten by the cannibal, but if the mirror analogy holds, he is looking at an image of himself).
Personally, though not quite my top Italian horror outing, I thought this was really rather awesome stuff.
Not only that, but it's 3D (which I wasn't aware of) or rather the all new 3D (no more red/green glasses).
Popular is not your pre-teen comedy that belongs on Disney Channel, but rather is geared for older teen/young adult and older.
I'd much rather watch LOGAN'S RUN for the 50th time, or PIGS!
I even liked the bizarre touch of having two rather different looking women DELIBERATELY play the same woman interchangeably throughout the movie--some real weird but fun stuff here.
I also found it also rather sexy.
However, most of these early Chaplin films were experimental in terms of technique but rather bland in terms of plot.
In a sense, one could look at his 'swan song', That Obscure Object of Desire, as his ultimate feminist tome, or rather critique.
The audience is almost given the most fractured romantic tale in modern cinema, where you do (or at least I did, if not more on the first viewing then both times) feel for Matthieu who is not really as flawed a bourgeois character as in 'Discreet Charm', and is actually a rather nice and easy-going fellow.
Although meaningless liberties have been taken with this true story - what possible difference, for example, could it have made to acknowledge that Mitchell was married rather than imply bachelor status - it still grips in an understated way.
Don't look for for exacting factual screenplay here, rather enjoy Gary Cooper's sensitive acting.
I thought it weakened his argument and the film (unless I'm off base) to bring in all the material about jet aircraft--not that it might not have been true, and not that the prosecutor didn't make logical and effective use of these "fantasies"==but that it seemed sort of overweighted to make Billy appear a misunderstood prophet, rather than just a good experienced soldier and flyer.
So the Navy brass frequently sent the Shenandoah on public relations flights, rather than using it for military purposes or long distance flights.
A rather foolish cabinet member offered to watch the aerial bombing from the warship's deck, so certain was he that the vessel couldn't be destroyed from the air.
That said this is probably a renter rather than a keeper, but it should be on the must see list especially f you love old movies and movie history.
Like great writing, great film-making successfully journals the trials of everyday human conditions, rather than stringing together cinematic cliches.
"Praise" accomplishes this as we immediately believe there are no actors, only we the audience feeling rather voyueristic and nodding with every move Gordon & Cynthia make as if we would have done the same.
The terrorists in the background seem rather contemporary although this movie is from 1977.
There are many different areas in the SW universe, all rather nicely done.
I Want To Keep My Baby starred Mariel Hemingway as a girl who became pregnant by her boyfriend and decided to keep her baby, whom she named Elizabeth, after the youngest daughter on The Waltons, rather than give it up for adoption or raise it at home with her meddling mother.
The acting was very poor, leading one to believe that perhaps the creator's friends were used in production, rather than Ms. Simmon's third grade class, but the difference is negligible.
Not a great movie, but a lot of great directors had some rather questionable material come out of their first hours behind a camera.
It can be rather depressing, or if taken lightly, can be quite comical.
'Flags of Our Fathers' is a well-organised picture that flows rather nicely on the issues it wishes to address.
Although based on fact rather than fiction the characters all seemed to be stereotypical, or fulfilling roles so as to compare and contrast against one another.
Given this, I found the photography great (with the use of a rather dark and "dusty" light) and the first battle scene rivals "Private Ryan" (does it have anything to do with the fact that Steven Spielberg is one of the producers?).
Unfortunately, I found it rather difficult to follow the script with so many flashbacks and, to some extent, I found the movie development a bit chaotic.
The kids who are sent to a war, any war, all wars, are no heroes whatsoever and in any way but they are the flesh and dough of the cannons of the enemy, or rather the other side.
It made you roll your eyes in astonishment at the cheesiness of it, rather than feeling any emotion towards the character.
The plot is rather formulaic, as is much of the dialogue (I expected better from Besson), but the movie has a bit of the 'Nikita' flair (guys going crazy with fully automatic weapons in public places).
It's a surrealist film, which is only directly revealed not in the strange dream-sequences Charm employs, but rather in a very simple technical element: the use of two actresses for a single female lead.
I'm sure she wasn't like this back in the day... a boisterous, bossy and rather annoying woman, slowly becoming a reasonably acceptable character portraying someone who really was stuck in the middle.
Winston Churchill, robustly played here by David Calder, was a principal supporter of Edward just because he was a prince, but then Winston was a rather romantic old Tory.
However, instead of treating it with certain horror to it, the guy openly touches his wound and rather than show himself the blood, he holds it out for others to see, that too at full arms length.
Though he might be overlooked, Forrester Harvey's character is rather thought-provoking.
But, I'd rather hear Lainie sing a torch song.
It's such an intriguing chess-like game, and I'm always trying to guess what the players are going to do next... or rather, what I would do next were I in their place!
A new series has just started in the UK and I'd rather chew off my own testicles than sit and watch these vacuous people hamming it up for an audience of equal worth.
To be honest I would much rather be having my teeth pulled out at the dentist than watching this rubbish.
If this and other programmes of it's ilk are allowed to continue,then we can well and truly say that the great days of British TV will be gone forever,and that if you have no talent whatsoever,rather than vice versa,you'll become famous thanks to the brain free writings in UK tabloid newspapers and magazines,describing the numbingly unexciting events in these "reality TV shows",the most unwelcome media development in history.A disturbing trend that has to stop sooner rather than later.
There is nothing worse than this so called reality TV Show, quite frankly I would rather watch the Telletubies.
A very good movie, rather mild than over-hyped.
And yet, it's a pretty good bit of entertainment, recommended to those who appreciate the genre as a whole rather than merely a short list of classics.
Adapted from the short story, "Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been", by Joyce Carol Oates; this slow paced and moody film is for those who like introspective stories where you spend a lot of the viewing time in self-analysis rather than character identification.
On the day of the Russian TV release of "Master i Margarita" I watched a talk show with the director Vladimir Bortko who commented on this film saying it was a life necessity to create mini series rather than movie.
To me, it was rather painful to follow the love story of the two beloved through the series.
Apart from everything visible you can read more between the lines, specially if you are familiar with Russian history and the social relations in the past.Reality is not shown too clearly - but it is all on purpose because the author's and the director's idea was to show a grotesque,rather than a document.
Everything is straight-forward (alien stalks and blandly picks off team one by one), rather than the bizarre and unconventional nature of the original.
He enjoyed a rather large following while he was alive, and many still love him and his works.
Koroviev is dream come true in Abdulov's interpretation, whereas Azazello shows how demons can try to be nice and come out rather fatherly at that.
The photography was really rather beautiful.
The two leads are rather bland, and maybe it is just because he would be such a huge star, but Cagney definitely draws your eye whenever he's on screen.
One can quibble with less-than-optimal special effects, but I'd rather see second-rate CGI in service of a good story than the tens of millions of dollars wasted on overblown blockbuster drivel.
But the dialogue seems forced and coming straight from the screen-writers pen, rather than from a real life character.
I think the story was pretty awful and rather scary then funny... Chad Donella on the other hand does a great job.
BUT, I'd rather watch the Girls Gone Wild infomercial I've seen on Comedy Central 20 times at this time of night rather than this.
He plays a psychiatrist who kills the husband of Lesley Ann Warren's character rather than ruin his reputation.
One must also mention the quality of Hamilton's performance in all of this; his character's womanising ways are typically exhibited, but his presence in this episode warrants respect, especially considering his unflappability and self-assuredness; traits which are powerfully upheld until the closing scenes, when he tries to undermine Columbo's perceptions of proof and the validity of an eye-witness (who comes forward rather conveniently late in proceedings) in front of his colleagues.
On the whole, this is a subtly and well thought out anti-war film, no less effective because it concerns the fate of one man rather than thousands.Too bad that its humane message remains so generally unseen.
THE PURPLE PLAIN is a British war film which means it`s rather understated when compared to its American counterparts .
From there on we have a rather good, believable survival saga.
The film is also rather poorly plotted, with it all going well until we get to about the hour mark and then it takes a horrible downturn, almost into the realms of boring; this is a far cry from The Godfather films for Coppola.
Whenever two people are talking on the phone, for example, they are rather obviously standing right next to each other with a wall in between them.
The main complains are Begemot all of whose personifications failed miserably and Gaft's character who was completely out of context and rather weird.
Whether it was a poor budget to blame or inability to use decent special effects but Bortko created some grey depressing place in the middle of nowhere which looked rather bizarre.
hellfire and smack aren't bad actors and play their characters rather well.
The audience is suddenly asked to feel bad for these rather idiotic characters (I'm using that term loosely), but instead we really feel nothing, and that is what makes this movie so disgusting.
Well, Gondry has been 12 forever, and a big 2-part documentary placed on this great DVD realize gives a rather detail explanation of everything that influenced on Gonrdy's unusual directing style.
Some nasty stuff implied rather than seen but which would give Hostel 2 a run for its money make this non-family viewing, on the other hand those drawn to it for that reason would be disappointed by the lacklustre orgies.
Made in 13 50 minute episodes, unfortunately the only bad thing about the show is the rather cheap BBC production values.
It wasn't intended to be literal, but the poor guys kept getting killed off and the women lived to play in later episodes, so I guess the casting people decided to go with making the older women look as young as possible rather than the other way around.
I, Claudius is one the best BBC dramas ever, and sadly reflects a bygone age of programming of quality and substance, rather than bland reality TV.
An extremely peculiar, rather uninteresting film, a considerable step down from the first film (which wasn't terrific, but was at least exciting!)
Trinity offers no easy answers, and much of the film serves to continually question the characters and their motives, rather than to resolve any issues.
However, it is very much a film that begs to be examined more closely, rather than given up out of frustration.
He befriends a little boy (not in the Michael Jackson way, though the boy in question is, ironically, Macaulay Culkin's younger brother, Kieran) and consequently gets rather chummy with the boy's mother.
As if her being a still distraught widow weren't enough, she is also being harassed to a rather unreasonable degree by Ted Levine, who is hilarious and brilliant and the land developer's chief henchman.
Even so, the film is hardly the heady brew of erotica and visceral thrills that was the latter (though it contains similar lesbian undertones and the occasional outburst of shocking violence) but rather a deliberately-paced mood-piece Â in fact, it might best be described as REPULSION (1965) in the countryside (with all the inherent eeriness that such a remote setting entails)!
The film reminds me of Schlondorff's The Tin Drum with its rather disturbing, yet comical theme of children growing up entirely too quickly, although The Art of Crying is, in my opinion, far more beautifully poignant as it is told through Allan's eyes.
Of course I did rather enjoy the playful tone of the episode.
It's also not a real "slasher" film, because you do not see much slashing around, there are not many horrifying close-ups (besides some ripped out larynx that looked rather artificial) ... it's generally not very gory, it's not laugh-out-loud-funny, but all in all I highly enjoyed watching it.
But alas the execution of these ideas falls short.While the actors and actresses do a fine job portraying their characters, the story becomes rather predictable and a bit silly.
Glosserman and co-writer David J. Stieve have done a great job in finding an imaginative way to recharge the batteries of the slasher flick on a low-budget, using clichÃ©s in a manner that nobody has ever thought of, rather than simply giving in to the temptation to simply use them like every other 'FRIDAY THE 13TH'/NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET/HALLOWEEN knockoff.Gorehounds will find the relatively light blood-letting a little disappointing, but there's so much more to enjoy here than the raptures of evisceration and dismemberment.
Neither of those guys look like typical maniacs, so when Leslie does make his first appearance masked and all, it's rather amusing.
Second, if you are not a fan of Boop, you also might not be all that impressed--simply because she's a rather dull character compared to animated characters from the 40s and 50s (which had a lot more personality).
This is a rather poor compilation of supposedly award winning and nominated films.
Poor because several of the films are very lame and are NOT award nominated, the prints are rather bad and parts of some of the cartoons are missing!
The really great twist is that in order to stop the timer, rather than entering a code, the team must answer a series of trivia questions.
I think that it works that there are two guys stranded on the planet rather than one.
The only clever turn is Prince David rescuing--rather than slaying--the Goliath-like Gulliver.
Still, there is certainly nothing objectionable here, the music is rather interesting, and the story is pretty upbeat - on the whole, it succeeds at entertaining, and is short enough not to be dragged down by its flaws.
The music is typical of the period, rather sugary for today's tastes, and the "Gabby" character introduced in this movie isn't nearly as funny as they seemed to think at the time.
She then goes to her childhood home, a rather large mansion, and this is where most of the film takes place.
The script is rather trite, and the film is also rather oddly paced, as it starts off like any other silly zombie movie, only to mature into something much more interesting later on, which may annoy some viewers.
The acting is barely tolerable, the editing is rather rudimentary and on top of that, the pacing becomes a bore sometimes.
A solid ending to a rather weak movie featuring one of the most ridiculous opening-sequences ever in horror history (which I failed to mention earlier in this review).
The characters are all very representative, and rather well cast.
The direction is rather straight-forward, I felt, and followed a projected path.
I would much rather watch reruns of this show on the DVDs than most of the garbage that is on the tube now!
And this sad story of the mother's attempts to goad the son into bringing home a young man to meet the sister seems rather cruel.
I'd rather watch Flash right now.
I hope at least it manages a whole first season rather than just about 13 episodes or what not.
this seemed rather lame and pointless.
Both are saddled with characters that simply aren't believable at their age anymore even if they do now have a rather bland son to acknowledge the passing years.
She's a primary school play version of a reporter while somehow Mick Dundee seems to have suddenly become a complete simpleton with no memory of all the things he encountered in the first two films in the hope that the audience will find his newfound ignorance funny rather than simply bewildering - it's not even as if his character took a whack to the head in a contrived plot point, it's just plain lazy writing.
Given the typically British austerity of the film, an illfocused and bleak story, an almost complete absence of passion, and what are by film standards rather sublunary events with no payoff in the end, this flick was barely tolerable.
And that's an aspect he could easily have tried to play upon, approaching it from the perspective that this is a rather `odd' occupation compared to the average guy on the street.
He has a rather unsteady relationship with Hugh, his brother, as they like to insult each other.
"The director is apparently on crack" For viewers that are trying to understand the story of Antigone, this film only served to confuse them rather than clarify.
It's fun to watch teams pushing themselves over the top with some rather weird quests and having an arguments over nothing.
In the "Jackass" series they try to be as offensive as possible and they succeed rather well most of the time.
The persona was always unique, but I didn't find him sexy--rather exactly the visual object he mostly saw himself as, and continually sought to create.
The film had an even pace that kept building slowly to a rather fun but ridiculous ending, and some interesting scenes.
It is rather dated though, in slang and fashion, and it just didn't do it for me.
Although criticized heavily by some die-hard fans, Taken is a very enjoyable installment to a rather dull season.
Don't you think it's rather absurd?
The dopey premise isn't quite played to it's campy potential..in fact the direction is rather subdued(..as are the cast, even though there are some emotional fireworks as the bickering between family members gets sometimes heated) though the kills themselves are often quite laughable.
")despite the obvious signs of real danger is rather mind-boggling.
I'd MUCH rather watch this again than Eurotrip, which was just a blatant take on American's view of Europe.
We do not look with judgment on the film but rather on the times in which it was produced.
Eventually, Karnes begins to adopt a more diplomatic manner, ultimately suggesting rather than demanding that a torpedo be the ideal means of destroying the Behemoth.
It concerns 3 rather dimwitted criminals who come up with a plan to rob a bank by tunneling in through the basement of the luggage shop next door.
I also found it rather refreshing to see Robin Williams playing straight man to Lane, who along with Hank Azaria as their housekeeper, practically steal the film from everyone else in one of the most entertaining comedies of the 90's.
Had this film a slightly bigger budget and a more serious attitude (like Walter Hill's fantastic, "The Warriors"), this could have been considered one of the best of the pessimistic, mankind-is-doomed-in-the-future movies, rather than just a very good b-movie.
Kurt Russell is the out-for-self anti-hero, who's heroics come from self interest rather than a love for his fellow man.
are deliberately given a cheap and dirty look, rather than attempting to make things look good with no money.
In this version the dwarfs are not really dwarfs in the true sense of the word, (well maybe some of them are), but rather a group of men who have been emotionally upset by a woman one time too many, so when a bout of misogyny sets in, one of them sets up a group of men (limit 7) who wish to live in a world without women, and will go to any means to achieve this.
They have no friends, their hometown is a dump, and their family is a rather pathetic lot, even if they're presented in a positive light.
Not only is it set in Wales but it's also a film born of a passion for the art of film making rather than profit making.
This starts off an escalating feud which involves the decapitation of a poodle, and the surprisingly massive explosion of a caravan, culminating in some rather brutal justice inflicted on Bryn and his partner in crime, corrupt cop Terry Walsh (Dougray Scott).
I'm not going to go and spoil the entire thing, but what I will say is that things take a rather dark turn, with Julian and Jeremy showing a rather unexpected creative mind for murder, especially given that they appear to be just permanently wasted.
The scenes of Swansea's nightlife are perhaps too accurate (anyone who has been to Wind Street at its worst will know what I mean), and the accent and rather, erm, colourful way that the characters speak is spot on.
I found it rather entertaining, maybe it did not fully live up to the reviews but most of the history works.
- I guess it's because he was played by a Swede rather than a "real" Italian.
The version of the DVD I purchased was from Denmark itself (I speak a little of the language), and I was rather surprised and disappointed to find that there were no English subtitles (only those for the three Nordic nations) - I'm sure those outside of Scandinavia would find this a fantastic film, so I cannot understand why such an opportunity was missed.
Or rather, 101 Things Not To Do On The Golf Course.
I wish they were honest about the film's shortcomings rather than promoting it with reviews from raving cult members.
People with ADD/ADHD apparently make good executives, because they're impatient when other people start discussing things, and they'd rather make their own decisions, which they have sufficient confidence to feel are correct.
I still am glad I went and would rather watch a movie like Indigo that is about redemption than the exploitation that we are exposed to daily in the media and especially Hollywood movies.
They would think "they are definitely not me" rather than attempting to discover aspects of indigo children in themselves.
It certainly seems that the producers are trying to feed off of their first born in this genre, "What the Bleep Do We Know..., Like Bleep it promises existentialist views of rather unexplained events and experiences in our life with a spin that was thought provoking and entertaining.
I kept trying to find a station playing the magic bullet infomercial rather than deal with this..but curiosity got the better of me.
I get suspicious when movies push lessons about life, as if movie realities can substitute for, rather than amplify, actual experience.
Wilbur might seem selfish, but I think that Wilbur might be sick of being judged based on some silly sexuality archetype that he carries because of habit, rather than real desire for it.
It was a good choice to make this movie in English, rather than Danish, and the result is an excellent drama which will apply to most people even though they, like me, may not be much for that sort of movies.
I thought Wilbur's subtle words of wisdom were rather funny.
I rather enjoy her previous film "Italian for Beginners" (2000) in Danish, Italian and English.
She's also in director John Crowley's "Intermission" (2003, script by Mark O'Rowe) - taken on, among the stellar cast, the rather offbeat yet still demure role of Sally (the script itself is plucky and unyielding alright - then again, it's probably quite 'normal' in the setting described) - another amusingly enjoyable film from Ireland if you're so gamed.
The quiet conversations amongst the various characters, in which feelings are often hinted at and implied rather than explicitly stated, help to elevate the film above its sometimes contrived and maudlin plot.
Harbour, rather than try to go on fighting a almost certain death sentence from cancer, commits suicide in the hopes his brother will honor his promise to look after his wife and stepdaughter, giving Wilbur a reason to live.
Actually, I've also seen (in Australia) another reel of this film: not a projection of the movie's image onto a screen, but rather I've seen (and touched) a mouldering reel of nitrate footage from the movie itself, now deteriorated beyond hope of restoration.
Watching this restoration at the Barbican, it occurred to me that credit for the single biggest innovation in 'The Story of the Kelly Gang' belongs not to the photographer, director, editor or scenarist, but rather to that most unsung of film figures ... old Smokey, the projectionist.
There is no depth of acting or emotional ability, no sense of trauma or affliction rather sex addiction is viewed as being a "problem" that can be cured, with the emphasis on being a "survivor".
Despite some good ideas the script (by James B. Harris) lacks any real cohesion and is for the most part rather contrived, worse than that the dialogue is also pretty flat and uninteresting, with the characters all painted as rather one dimensional.
That's not to say that either the script or direction are outright bad, they aren't, it's just that neither has the impact, style or strength to carry off this type of film or story, and because of this it all just comes off as rather flat and unexciting.
He does receive some assistance, with both Charles Durning and Charles Haid giving good, solid performances despite their rather underwritten roles.
He is pushy and very confrontational and insists he gets his own way now rather than later, very much like Clint Eastwood's "Dirty" Harry Callahan character.
But real tragedy is never far away and even if the feminist character is a rather blunt caricature, her actions and her reasoning are an essential and convincing part of the story.
The first half of the film is really rather good and plausible; but then the twist hits and it really requires a suspension of disbelief from the viewer.
Certain elements of the film are rather nasty, and indeed the book was originally denied by many different publishers for being too graphic!
It all boils down to a rather hurried and coincidental ending; but I really do feel that this is a film where the style of it is much more important than the plot line.
A two is rather generous for this, and it only gets that much because of Davies and Warner.
The youth also are very interested in music but not of there culture, but rather music from the United States and Europe.
Moussa Sene Absa (director and writer) does not convey a clear pro or con stance on the changing culture of Senegal, but does provide a rather complete look at both sides of the issue.
I rather be playing it!
This film tries to use "funky" camera angles & special effects to hide a terrible plot & rather uninteresting characters.
My favorite bit of unreality involves the caretaker - when they arrive at the place, the caretaker gives Nami the keys, but the scene is played out as a video game sequence, with the caretaker icon's lines being printed on the screen, rather than spoken - thus making it impossible to determine anything, even gender, about this "person".
It is a well made movie, and the not-torture-porn parts are even enjoyable, but it could have been a lot better if it focused more on the psychological part of the torture rather than the cheap Hostel style crap it ends up with.
The acting is brilliant, each of the cast members did more than a great job, but it was rather the character story of the developing relationship between Meg and David that gave this film its actual strength, and the very last moment between these two characters is something that would even make a grown man cry, which takes place after the grueling last fifteen minutes.
Unfortunately, it's all too easy for mainstream critics to shoot down this kind of movie by terming it "exploitative" when actually it's the opposite: a tragedy that immerses the audience in the misery of the real rather than promoting escapism with comfortable, and clichÃ©d, lessons about violence and evil.
Much of the brutality in this film is implied violence rather than in your face blood and guts.
The film doesn't crusade for allowing bad language, but rather shows how silly it is to take language so seriously, particularly when Mothers Against Canada invokes a war with our neighbors to the north.
This cartoon presents several levels of ideas, including, as strange as it might seem to anyone turned off by the language, some rather profound philosophical notions.
First off; I can understand why people would dislike this movie; The characters are all portrayed in an extremely stereotypical way, the acting is considerably over the top most of the time, the story is rather cheesy and not very believable - I mean which gay couple would (or COULD) transform their eccentric home into a monastery-like environment in 24 hours to pretend to be a cultured family to impress the son's fiancÃ©e's parents?
Even though the characters are stereotypical, the script has obviously been written by someone who doesn't intend to contribute to the stereotypical view of the gay drag community, but who rather wanted to create characters that are lovable while at the same time shouting "don't take us seriously".
This isn't a movie portraying life in the gay society; and everyone who expects realistic (and hence probably rather unfunny) portrayal of such a theme is better off NOT watching a comedy featuring gays (don't most comedies thrive on making the stereotype seem funny?)
However they're brought to life so well by the actors playing them that it doesn't make you shake your head in frustration over yet ANOTHER movie portraying stereotypes, but rather makes you shake your head in laughter over the deadpan things they say and do, which are so obviously unreal at times that anyone who thinks this movie will promote a false picture of the gay community needs a reality check.
What is remarkable about this two-reeler is perhaps not so much the dialogue in itself but rather the circumstances from which the dialogue, and the situations, evolve; it is not meant to be taken seriously.
The only drawback I feel this movie has is the somewhat out of place voice acting of some of the main characters, it seems that the producers wanted the film to be attached to some big name actors rather then finding voice actors that would suit the specific characters,specifically I felt that Bill Nighy voice was out of place as the Professor and perhaps Nic Cage could have brought more energy to the role.
The film manages to canvass some rather complex ideas regarding robotics, which really raise the quality of the story to a higher level.
I might agree with those who think the portrayal of Toby's(Astroboy's) father was rather cold.
It's all rather confusing and irregular in it's general presentation, but it's also one of the best animated films I've seen in a long time.
The approach is rather comedic, but the film is hardly kids stuff.
Strutting around getting her new business together, rounding up clients and welcoming curious workers, in all-black leatherette motor-bike togs, she makes this otherwise rather ordinary little drama stand out.
For example, scenes in which family is involved, are beautiful characterisations of more or less typical working class households, or rather any British folks.
Acting, situations and people are so real that every character seems to be played by men and women in their lives, rather than by professional actors.
This might be partly due to the involvement of Ken Loach himself but also because it is a rather poignant essay of the one crucial aspect of globalisation Â the richer countries exploiting the availability of the cheap labour available from the poorer countries.
Why the hell this was cancelled, I have no idea but whatever that reason is, whether it had to do with the fact it didn't attract such a massive audience, or it was simply the fact that many people just didn't get it whatsoever, Freakazoid wasn't just one of Warner Bros. better cartoons that dared to be different- but rather it was different to the extent to which it didn't sacrifice the humour, creativity and originality.
I thought it was rather wonderfully done, despite the grisliness.
Fixations have never been a good idea in any direction, and if erotism is the crowning thorn in the exaltation of the most sublime that can be put on celluloid, as far as this Catalonian director is concerned, one might understand why I would rather give up the ghost.
He seems to pick on dubious literature of a sexual fantasy nature, by rather poor writers Â Almudena Grandes is the most notorious example Â and seek to convert them into films: the result is mostly vulgar with very poor taste.
Plus, compared to Chaplin films of 1916-1917, this one compares rather favorably and is much funnier than most of the earliest Little Tramp films from Chaplin.
Willie is an angry man who would rather complain about his situation rather than do anything about it, but deep down he means well.
The only problem with this film is the rather slow opening sequence.
If, as it is with old musicals, you can accept that this is a series of vignettes rather than a tightly bound story, you're home free and you'll know ecstasy.
The acting is rather hit or miss: Hampton barely registers as the insipid would-be hero, the ever-alluring Lynn Lowry contributes a memorably sexy turn as the enticing Nurse Forsythe, Barbara Steele projects her usual sense of class and commanding presence as poised lesbian Betts, Allan Kolman does well as the infected Nicholas Tudor, and pretty Susan Petrie likewise impresses as Tudor's sweet, distraught wife Janine.
The problem is, that Annabelle was rather well known (and liked, apparently) by many men within this complex and had frequent visits from them, and therefore she has shared this little parasite with them.
Dr. St. Luc as a rather interesting hairstyle, too, kind of an extreme wind-blown look, perhaps achieved by applying spray after coming in out of a gale.
Cronenberg is rather a master at incorporating the creepy and nasty into "everyday life" and this was just a taste of things to come.
In common with many other '70's horror films, the lack of money proved advantageous as film makers had to rely on their imaginations to create terror, rather than fall back on the safety net of special effects.
Although Shivers might not 'wow' today's audiences with dazzling special effects and technical brilliance, there are still plenty of unsettling scenes that make this movie worth a look, especially if you're a fan of the director's later work: an early death scene sees a man strangling a young woman, before cutting her open and pouring acid into her body cavity; Betts (Barbara Steele) gets a bath-time shock as one naughty, phallic parasite pops out of the plughole and nips up her cooch; Nicholas Tudor (Allan Kolman) wishes he hadn't been getting some on the sly when his stomach begins undulating in a rather uneasy fashion; and a brilliant, downbeat ending sees the horny islanders getting into their cars for a trip to the mainland.
Most of the attacks are rather quickly presented and it's clear during the flesh eating the look of latex, cheap and disappointing.
The wound on Jerry's arm is quite a grisly sight, and the rotted faces of the zombies are rather ghastly.
I would rather watch my limbs on fire than this movie.
i give the writers and the director a little credit just because this is a rather knew idea.
This movie starts out rather slowly in the progression of the action (Murakami's gun is stolen on a bus - revealed in a flashback to a superior), but picks up quickly once the Sato is assigned to help Murakami.
I found the film very entertaining, but was surprised that it turned out rather black and grim.
The plot is rather Chandleresque, requiring a firm hold on the personae and threads.
Very Russian, indeed, and viscerally impressive; extremely atmospheric, suggestive, rich in urban life touches, with a strong load of eroticism in quite a few scenes, naturalistic and brutal in some respects, harsh as tone and bleakÂin many ways, rather unlike Kurosawa's ulterior elegiac and lyrical success IKIRU.
The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film, something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel.
), but I rather call it a heroic humanism.
He was not one of those artists who necessarily got better and better, rather was he one who continued to take on different challenges, not always with the same degree of success, as "Dodesukaden" and "Dreams" were to prove.
SkarsgÃ¥rd is very good as the war photographer, and his final speech, though going very close to crossing over into being clichÃ©, manages to work perfectly and arouse actual emotions in the viewer, rather than just being sappy, manipulative drivel(which this sort of thing almost always is).
Had I grown up watching it as a kid, this would be the war movie to remember, instead the Swedish audience had to stick with rather cheap takes on world war II.
You don't get to see Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers style violence, instead the action sequences are very stylized and rather gritty.
The film works principally because rather than focusing on the war itself, it focuses on a group of people thrown into the war; and their personal experiences, which principally consist of blowing German heads off German shoulders.
Mutator is a rather disappointing entry in the mutant monster on the loose genre.
Admittedly, attention to innovative stark realism is paired with some rather predictable stock situations.
We're so used to his ultra-slick, amoral roles, that seeing him in this film is rather startling.
Whatever the case, his private life seemed rather glum and lacking vitality.
One can't get over the impression that these are well-meaning actors rather than real people.
It's rather insulting, really, to both the audience and to the real croppers who had to deal with such a precarious existence, year in and year out.
A rather pale love story added to the screen play simply detracts from the films power.
So bad they think World War II starts with Pearl Harbor, rather than Hitler invading Poland, or more accurately Japan invading China.
John Houseman is a fine actor, but rather cold and unreadable, so replacing him with Sir John Gielgud, with his warm and expressive grandfatherly face, was a smart move.
As to the critics of historical accuracy, the author was not presenting his work as a non-fiction textbook; but rather a novel set against the background of events leading up to and including World War II.
I felt good to watch this, but rather than the plot generating this fuzzy feeling, it's probably really just brought on by the memories of watching B-movies at 4AM after a good night out.
wasn't Czech) I assumed that her mother (Irina/Rula Lenska) must be Russian or Polish because these couple of words she uttered definitely weren't Czech, rather this Slavic universal mixture.
The only Czech sentence she says is "miluju te" which means i love you, which is commonly used in English, but rarely amnong parents and children, rather for lovers.
According to its manifesto, Dogme rules reject special effects, scripted and formulaic acting, and films all scenes in ambient light to make the actors rather than post- production additions drive the plot.
The biographical format works well enough but we are never really given the insight as to how he developed his stage act, rather it is explained through the drugs and circumstances...  All in all a good, fairly gritty film, which charts the life of one f comedy's great groundbreakers, and a killer performance by Dustin Hoffman.
touching at the raw chords, a story of a man who cannot (or rather does not want to) reveal his emotions.
Not much to say except i enjoyed it, rather than getting just plain bored.
It's quite possibly one of the most Enjoyable Films I have EVER seen....and it's little over 2 hour running time flew by,Now I was aware and so should all viewers be that C.S Lewis was a devout Christian,and therefore Christianity does feature rather heavily and at times Too Heavily, But most should be able to ignore the bible lesson and enjoy the spectacle.
The film is (loosely) based on the play, which rather faithfully followed the life of Lenny Bruce (more or less) and told his story using entirely his own words.
Some of them I memorized cold, and found that when people mentioned his name at parties or family gatherings, and someone invariably asked who he was, rather than explain his life or what he died of, all I had to do was recite one of his bits.
Due to this, the three eldest siblings are thrown quite off balance during the film, and not in the credible way of children, but rather for the goal-oriented purposes of trying to build up suspense and plot where there is none.
It's him, in the principal role of Hyppolite, who greatly carries this rather enjoyable movie to its end.
Ironically though, such a structure might have deprived of us of seeing more of Hoffman doing Lenny's bits 'live' on stage - and for me these were the highlights, which I wish had lasted longer, rather than flashing back to some past event after 30 seconds.
I rather enjoyed the leisurely pacing, although it gets more frantic (and goofier) in the last fifteen minutes.
i always thought of rutger hauer movies rather 'campy', but this one's so poor poor poor it's not even worth the tape it was recorded into, and it doesn't even make you laugh with it's poorness, it's just that poor.
And although the narrative is rather cold, it's also unique Â sometimes refreshingly so.
A rather uninspired but harmless enough movie that goes around the world and back again to establish its goofy premise.
Watching the opening minutes of the film worried me that this film would retreat into itself rather then expand in the so many aspects in which it actually did.
The movie is a tasty blend of slapstick humor, the perils of interpersonal relationships and a particularly brilliant bit of artifice involving a mantel and a doll-(keep an eye out for it towards the end of the movie-it happens rather quickly!)
The funniest part of this movie is the race, I could not stop laughing, it was stupid, but rather funny.
The happy ending achieved for all in this story-line is the result of the common sense shown by Loy and Grant; the 'screwball' aspect which is not a genre, but rather a way-of-handling social-mores comedy, is here made to serve a plot that involves several hard-working normative people in a situation that should never have happened but has in fact happened.
For example, at least two identify Shirey Temple's character as a college student rather than a high schooler.
It's not an easy role to play, given how the character as written is really rather annoying.
Frequently it's music,sometimes a quest for a rare item, rock climbing or even acting (that last one's a favourite for all the rather pretentious play-within-a-play options it throws up).
A very good, if (also characteristically) rather pessimistic film.
My first pick to watch was not Rawhide or The Gunfighter, the two black and white pictures in the collection, but rather the Technicolor, Garden of Evil.
Herrmann scored the film rather as a conventional adventure story and avoided the usual clichÃ©d style of writing associated with westerns except perhaps the theme for Hooker (Cooper) where the composer hints at a "cowboy" tune with its wonderful long loping Americana tinged melody.
Dunne is a pretty easy-going, sensible woman, but Grant shows a tendency to be rather flighty and impulsive.
In effect, whenever music plays in the film, and it is predominantly source music rather than underscoring, there is a magnified reaction on our parts.
Each recording recalls the various phases of their lives: their chance meeting, their rather unexpected marriage, early years spent in the far east.
It would be so much more powerful if he is ultimately beaten to incapacitation by his father, rather than being hit by a car.
The cast talked to each other rather than at each other.
I don't feel the acting plays too much of a central role in a movie like this, as it's based on actual people rather than fictional characters.
The history presented in The Right Stuff is rather accurate by Hollywood standards, and almost every minute is entertaining.
Films are almost never about measuring a man's inner desires, but rather his being able to win the fight at the end.
The animation is a gritty realism, rather different from the standard principles of animation in which exaggeration is almost necessary to translate emotion to the viewer.
And the prospect of watching it didn't sound too appealing to me at first, considering the rather subdued DVD case cover...(I know, I'm ashamed)   That said, this film is a masterpiece of story telling, the calibre of which my current favourite films pale in comparison.
Auntie, a cold, bitter, self-serving woman, has no patience with Seita or Setsuko, especially when they would rather chase after fireflies at moonlight, play by the beach, or lounge around the house instead of helping out.
I have seen this in other things which have not been banned, so I personally think it was rather silly to ban this.
But rather than handing us a linear path back to the recovered art, Dreyfus gives us a profound meditation on the things we value and the losses we inevitably endure.
However, rather inexplicably, she is swept away by a rogue.
Don't wait for a DVD release, but rather watch it on the big screen.
Feeling more like an old friend rather than a griping thriller this film is a good little mystery.
; Edward Arnold's belated entrance, in my opinion, brings the film to life after a rather slow first half.
This isn't just some theme slapped on top of an anime, rather a critical part of the show.
He's another cool cat who's the wise and "aged" one of the rather motley crew.
The way it's told, it seems to have an amazing knack for conveying some pretty deep ideas in a rather playful manner.
"All in all, "Going Highbrow" (1935) is a pretty good post production code comedy although its rather fragmented structure works against efforts to make it a unified story.
Sitting down for Macbeth the Comedy I was rather expecting a kind of Iris Murdochesque production, full of in-jokes about Shakespeare and Macbeth in particular.
Sitting down for Macbeth the Comedy I was rather expecting a kind of Iris Murdochesque production, full of in-jokes about Shakespeare and Macbeth in particular.
The British movie industry has tried unsuccessfully for nearly 30 years to mimic the style and content of infinitely superior American movies rather than staying to its true roots.
It is only for this reason that I give the movie a rating of 2 rather than 1.
I thought because it was released in the same year as two other very well regarded British horror movies , one featuring a squad of British soldiers as good guys fighting a bunch of werewolves and the other featuring a squad of British soldiers as bad guys battling against crypto zombies , that LONG TIME DEAD may have got lost in the market place but after finally seeing it I doubt if the merits of DOG SOLDIERS and 28 DAYS LATER had anything to do with its failure - The reason it bombed is that it's a rather poor horror movie  First of all can we please stop seeing movies where horny , drug taking teenagers get stalked and slashed .
After pressing play on the VHS, this rather confused and quite frankly stupid reason of thought was quickly diminished after the first ten minutes or so had passed by.
The fact that the ending was actually an ending, rather than a Hollywood sequel-tease was nice, however.
While sitting around at a club they begin to have a discussion on what the biggest buzz in life is, from this rather innocent sounding topic the subject of sÃ©ance's is brought up & for some reason they all decide to hold one.
Generally speaking Long Time Dead is rather slow & uneventful & the characters are so bland & similar with most of them looking & sounding exactly the same & the only one's I could really distinguish between are Lucy because she's black & Joe because of his hair!
Most people would probably find this frustrating and rather irritating, but its exactly the point.
However, I'm certain most of us would rather have our personal security in the hands of a bully than say the little glasses wearing kid who has asthma... but is it really that much better?
Much of this sequence is rather serious, dealing with a young man's lusting for an older woman, the rousings and thoughts of the old priests...and then it suddenly, finally, breaks up the tension with an S&M gag!
It wouldn't; there's a sense of pacing that makes the film seem rather serious, but (as it says on the back of the original video box) it owes as much to Monty Python as it does to the old-school 20's surrealism that got Bunuel up off his feet and into the cinema scene.
The guy seems like a real jerk rather than a leading man.
The whole thing was rather silly to me.
What is slightly harder to accept is Fred's overlooking Carole for so long (at least once she is out of the rather scary suit and spectacles she wears in the film's opening scene).
However this is not explored fully nor given elsewhere as an explanation for his foolishness (at just 80 minutes long, an additional 2-3 minutes to deepen this rather more satisfactory explanation for Fred's behaviour would not exactly have overdone things).
There was a crooked judge, rather like the judge in the film.
She is supposedly the niece of the crooked judge Stillman and comes across as a rather colorless debutante.
Bronco appears to be a rather colorless right hand man for Cherry, with a rather sinister look, who probably has had a very shady past.
John Wayne is a rather rakish ladies' man and played with much less bravado than typified his later roles.
They are both charming, which also is rather unique.
The game sequences seem a trifle interminable and MGM didn't help by giving the movie rather cheap production values.
Novarro's costars, although rather boisterous, are ultimately defeated by the script as well.
Charming & talented, it is a shame that today Novarro is remembered chiefly for the manner of his death rather than his contribution to American movies.
So Snipes, Seagal and Van Damme seem like they would rather allow their careers to tank than give up their martial arts skills, and i praise all of them for that.
after seeing her on naff British TV, it was rather a shock to see her brandishing a pistol rather than a pint of larger or an iron)
Anyway, for Miike, this is typically violent fare Â even more pointless than usual and all rather amateurishly assembled; besides, having the actors speak English results in unintentional laughter more than anything else (though Quentin Tarantino's absurd cameo is no less embarrassing: incidentally, I may well have been witness to the genesis of the picture back when these two mavericks 'butted heads' at the 2004 Venice Film Festival!).
Films like "Audition", "Dead or Alive", "Visitor Q" and "Gozu" left rather indelible impressions on me.
Here is where some already voice there objections, arguing that the native Japanese speakers should speak in their own language rather than sometimes struggling to deliver the lines in English.
It does make for sometimes rather herky jerky deliveries on the part of the actors, but when you consider that the whole film is paying loving homage to a great tradition of films by the likes of Leone and others, which usually featured overdubbing, often by other actors even, it seems almost fitting that the dialog delivery in "Sukiyaki" is what it is.
Some of the action sequences are rather memorable and somewhat comedic.
And much more than that: war of White and Red Roses, Gollum for a sheriff, chest, full of gold, old lady - gunfighter (who happened to be also animated eight-handed woman and Quentin Tarantino's lover), Tarantino himself, rather weather-beaten and riding steampunk-crafted wheelchair, raining bullets, Japanese mountains in the autumn, fight in the snow and so on.
I'd much rather have had Japanese dialog with English subtitles...or at least English subtitles anyway, which were not available to me.
I much rather prefer divertis, but the movie itself is indeed not bad all things considered.
Nudity and gore feature prominently (especially considering the time of release), yet it's all rather dull.
I've just seen Tower of Evil for the first time and found it rather scary in parts.
Tower of Evil is British made and is rather scary once on the island, where most of the scenes are shot in the dark.
Sulu: "I'd rather be on the Enterprise."
I'd rather rest my head between Uhura's massive pillows now than be fighting aliens on this damn planet."
I rather liked that they ended up together and living the bonnie and Clyde life style.
Nothing much can be revealed about the story & it actually is not a suspense flick, rather it is filled with thrilling moments.
It would seem that this portion of the film presents the harshness of an authoritarian regime as misdirected and even naÃ¯ve rather than inherently evil, although it is equally likely (and, indeed, probably more so) that it is a message to those very regimes (specifically that of Franco) of the reality of their form of government.
This is, by the way, one of the best portrayals of philosophy I have ever seen in a film : we often see Laura in her philosophy class, where a Derrida-lookalike prof discourses - rather eloquently - on freedom versus the law in Kant.
Unlike some of the terrible works by rather talentless directors such as Jeff Thomas, et al., Hartsell and Shirley's film isn't heavy-handed and full of religious agenda (see "13 Seconds" if you'd like to see what I'm talking about).
The acting and dialog delivery of many actors does not seem to come out naturally, but rather seems to be forced out.
There are actors in this category too who prefer playing safe, rather than acting...
If the director wanted to go there the best thing would have been to let the viewers make their own conclusion rather than spelling everything out.
He builds a sumptuous, even fastidious, set, decorates it with some rather good actors, and uses highly toned up coloring, no doubt as if to add insult to grievous occular harm, which, for 1870 New York, was indeed a gross insolence and incoherent injustice.
His camera is always moving, but the effect is stylish and subtle rather than intrusive.
It has been in rather heavy rotation on the movie channels for some reason of late, and I watched it again a few weeks ago.
The lines are dumb rather than funny and the cast--most notably Sammy Petrillo in his tooth-gritting Jerry Lewis imitation--is abrasive rather than funny.
Mitchell is a shorter knockoff of Martin and his job is to sing (rather poorly) and get the girl.
They make fun of a rather fat lady, which I thought was stupid, as well as, the entire picture.
And praise be that Zalman King has left the acting business for directing because I would rather watch his erotic flicks than sit through another painful Jerry performance.
"Blue Sunshine" is more fondly remembered for it's bald,thirty-something,ex-hippie murderers who are easily the most bizarre descendants of the living dead yet to reach the silver screen.This film is not easy to categorize:it's a horror film mixed with drug movie and also features paranoid urban legends and bizarre conspiracy theories.The title of this movie is taken from the name of a bad batch of 60s acid that seems to have some rather unfortunate long-term side effects.The film is badly lit and there are some dull spots,but "Blue Sunshine" is a must-see for experimental cinema enthusiasts.7 out of 10.
The movie ends rather quickly, and while some people complain about this, I prefer a clean break over a drawn-out exposition-filled "wrap-up."
Likewise I rather enjoyed Mark Goddard's performance as Edward Flemming, a former drug dealer now running for Congress.
Zalman King is the best as the film's rather unlikely hero.
It's rather a psychological, sophisticated mystery thriller that works in some decent surprises and jabs that are spine tingling good.
For a low-budget production is stands up remarkably well and it's rather sad it's gone by with little impact, because Lieberman shows impressive talent here.
These moments definitely added to the unsettling mood that's created and help build up those scenes with the bald psychopaths becoming rather freaky.
This has a rather ambiguous ending though, but other than that it's pretty damn funny and while my review may not necessarily reflect that, that's because it's more one of those movies you have to really see to appreciate.
I'd rather sit and watch a loogie dry than to watch that 80s show ever again.
When Farley Granger's devout but tubercular mother dies, it precipitates a rampage against everything that makes up the prison of his life: his ugly urban poverty; his penny-pinching employer who offers promises rather than a raise; the Church, which once refused burial to his father, a suicide, and is now refusing his mother the "big" funeral he thinks he owes her; the smarmy, sanctimonious undertaker.
", and I found it rather stereotyped and one-dimensional.
This film was rather unfunny, didn't have anything profound to say like the previous version, in matter of fact, it doesn't do much of anything well at all.
The twin billing of the late Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher is rather appealing and the two comic-gifted actors do fairly well.
Ashton Kutcher works well with what he is given, yet his character comes across as a trite, clumsy bumpkin to Mac's ferocious flare, and is merely the butt of every comedic catastrophe, rather than a multi-dimensional character who can hold a candle to thwarting his own preordained chagrin.
It's great to see all the old Doctors, for example (even if the first Doctor was dead and is played here by a lookalike and the fourth Doctor rather childishly didn't want to be in the show, so is featured via old, unused TV footage), but it's still a bit cheesy to have simply SO MUCH Doctor Who crammed into one show.
I also agree, the educational part was not about Charlie Banks, who seems very passive and self centered with many short rather flippant comments.
I would have thought Charlie would have attempted to undermine Mich earlier in the film, rather than passively sulking and accepting this man's total illegitimacy as a college student.
Mr. Durst shows he has the chops to pull off a rather remarkable film.
Therein lies a clear blueprint of the issues: Is it better to identify and treat society's offenders, rather than simply punish?
Comments here about plot holes and unresolved issues rather show that some viewers missed clues and did not catch onto what was going on.
The main characters development is as I mentioned certainly not catholic, rather they discover to abandon the vain failure of self-sacrifice and Samaritan ambitions, and that to do real good you have to accept your own desires.
It ranks more as a drama with sex today and should be considered like Basic Instinct or The Lover or even Last Tango, rather than like soft porn.
Still the supposedly intellectual approach to sexuality is fairly boring today, and rather pedantic.
I would rather spend an hour on a good Ina recipe than 45 minutes on a bad Rachael Ray recipe.
And much like Mr. Charles Chaplin, Pappy Ford renders his tale even more universal by designated titles, rather than names.
And with the whitewashing of Fonda's character came some rather heavy handed symbolism of Fonda as a Christlike figure.
Until then, it's up to Pedro Armendariz to hold the fort as the policeman who has replaced religion with a new faith, politics, although even his missionary faith in atheism is somewhat undermined here by Fonda's nameless priest being a sober believer rather than the drunken fallen angel of the novel.
Amongst all the adrenaline filled action, Anderson makes sure to toss in the occasional character development or when he's feeling really daring he'll toss in some pseudo-dramatic realization our hero comes across which helps remind the movie-goer that the movie has a plot rather than just a string of explosive action sequence.
Since the days gradually came on the Royal Family in Great Britain that they are to reign rather than rule, the struggle has always been to be popular and stay popular without being self indulgent.
They are the unifying symbol for their country rather than a written Constitution that we Yanks have, so they're behavior, good or bad, counts for so much more.
The stage play was so cinematic that a movie seemed inevitable, and the transitions between scenes were even enhanced through the use of a camera rather than stage.
While the movie relies servilely on (often complex)special effects for the realization of its vision, these techniques are not there just for the "wow" factor; rather they are all in the service of a unified directorial vision, full of resonant symbols and painterly motifs that seem always to reach toward each other as if in a dance.
However, given the rather surprise ending, this would be a necessary variation, given its circumstances.
Especially when I said that I hoped Lance would just get it over with and commit suicide already rather than torturing his family (who loved him and accepted his homosexuality) with his constant false alarms and solipsistic behavior.
I was rather pleasantly surprised to hear that all of the actors in the film are all locals of Afghanistan and do not have any experience in acting.
The director also did quite a laudable job of making a rather bleak atmosphere throughout the film.
I rather prefer to see the film as an unusual coming-of-age story.
The fact that she wishes that God had never created women, rather than wishing something a little more logical, like that God had never created the Taliban, serves to bring into sharp focus the extent to which the Taliban have perverted these women's minds.
The film then darkens drastically, becomes more political, and also somewhat fantastical, non linear, and rather mythic in tone.
You might expect a made-for-TV remake of a 1950's exploitation flick to be a camp spoof but instead it turns out to be a rather enjoyable, if simplistic, prison movie.
Running the group is Nick Smith, who you can call a snob, as well as sexist, obnoxious, and of late, rather weird.
Nick is also a good guy beneath his preppie bluster, a fellow who champions Tom and breaks down Tom's highminded resistance to joining their circle with snarky logic ("You'd rather stay at home and worry about the less fortunate, but has it ever occurred to you you ARE the less fortunate?")
Indeed, they seem to exist outside their own time, belonging rather to that group Cecil Beaton dubbed "the smart young things" from the 1920's, in his "The Glass of Fashion."
And like many "smart sets" they seem rather a closed corporation.
The film is compelling not because of a riveting story, special effects, or manufactured suspense, but because of sharply written characters whose personalities drive the story, rather than vice versa, extensive knowledge of its subject, and beautifully written dialogue.
It's pretty likable but also rather insignificant--worth seeing, but not a film you should rush to see.
For the world of this traveling theatrical troupe is not one of glamour and glitz with elaborate sets and costumes, but rather one of cramped dressing rooms and boxcars, lonely train depots, and rural barnyards.
Moreover, the basic plot blatantly emulates the second "A Nightmare on Elm Street" movie, the pace really kicks into gear and rarely lets up after the rather leisurely opening third, the 80's clothes and hairstyles are hilariously hideous (Michael's silly blue pajamas are especially sidesplitting!
The ending is rather cheesy.
It makes a great contrast with the coolly laconic and rather more serious 'Ipcress File'.
Though it starts out intriguingly, in the end this espionage film is rather much ado about nothing.
The main point of interest in this rarely seen movie now is the equally rarely heard Jerry Goldsmith score, which I rather like.
She starts out a rather naive young bride who is dumped off in Paris by her older husband while he toots off to India for a year.
Despite this, I still am not complaining because I liked the film so much plus Miss Oakley is a rather mythic figure already and little impact on history (though she did a lot for women's rights--at least indirectly).
For an American Indian in the 1930s, this portrayal was amazingly sensitive and showed him as a rather decent and clever guy.
Throughout the mini he has displayed a marked tendency to concentrate on what would look good rather than on what would work well dramatically.
But all in all, it's escapist and rather sad and examines the downfall of a paradise.  
As a film in it's own right, the direction was rather interesting.
I would rather watch a dog take a crap than watch this movie again.
Director-star Orson Welles also adapted Isak Dinesen's rather pointless book about an aged millionaire recluse living in China who tells his employee of an incredible story he heard while in the service regarding a rich, dying man, his terrible wife and a sailor-stud.
Facts (or rather, the usual exposition), of course, aren't usually the best parts of any story, as any filmmaker can tell you.
The symbolism seems literary, rather than cinematic.
When 'Mickey' explains 'We all have a Demon', best remember he is speaking as an American, not an Amsterdam 'hippy', Canadian, current German (they learned), rather as a member of a 'mass-societal-killer', political 'mob'---who simply reflects his heritage.
Mickey and Mallory believe that some people are worthy of killing, perhaps in the cruel theory of Social Darwinism (survival of the fittest) - Mickey says in his interview in prison, that other species commit murder, we as humans ravage other species and exploit the environment; the script is interesting, but it is questionable how much this film amounts to, in the sense of making us think about society and human behaviour, rather than the intensity of a 2 hour bloodbath that we have seen.
My point is, rather, that this is a film that dealt with such an important, realistic issue that it should never have been controversial in the first place.
), rather than the violence (which apparently seems to be causing a misguided sh!tstorm of controversy, too, and like the sex, I don't think that people are that impressionable), namely the kind that is seen in music videos and such.
', but rather the fact that the real enemy is in the corporations and media, the real power of a nation doesn't rely in the leader but the television.
They were magical people, these men and women and children, who American history still would demeaningly classify as slaves, rather than people who were enslaved, a seemingly minor distinction, but in that distinction rests acknowledging the wrong done, and the people, the people, not slaves, the people... it was done to.
The game creates a nice illusion of a big adventure before its rather over-the-top ending.
Well the entire game is a rather funny ordeal as our pirate must navigate many obstacles on his quest to become a pirate and rescue the governor's daughter from the pirate ghost LeChuck.
So for a fun and rather funny game this one was very good.
As it is, by using a modern filming style and adding in lots of jokes that no one would ever think women of that time period would use (though I'm sure they DID say some pretty crazy things when men were out of hearing range), the writers and director managed to make a forgotten part of history rather hip.
Many of the songs were rather lascivious, as were the gratuitous scenes of the homely Swank (she is a decent actress, but she is hardly attractive) masturbating in the bathtub, complete with too many shots of her over-collagened lips.
Poor photography, at least as seen on Showtime, and a rather coy use of close-ups are the only things that spoil this photographed stage presentation.
Johnson, who resembles a young Joan Jett, comes on like a little punk rocker-in-the-making, so its surprising (and rather disconcerting) when her moment in the spotlight finally arrives and she's transformed into a New Wave caricature (or, perhaps, a "Rocky Horror" patron).
Alvarado's Pam is the daughter of a well-known politician; she is depressed and withdrawn and we clearly see that these tests are her father's way of throwing money at the problem rather than really be involved with his daughter.
i'd rather see dennis rodman in drag throwing magic around than these girls.
The second cut scene is less brilliant and rather politically incorrect, but it's still a shame it was eliminated.
The movie actually has nothing to do with real witchcraft, and perpetuates the stereotype that witches are brides of Satan, rather than the nature-worshipers they actually are.
I mean, yeah, it does suggest one look into their own heart and act, rather than hate others and always fantasize (or even act) on that hate.
Writer/director Frank A. Cappello has a good grasp on his subject matter and probably intended the rather slow movement of the film to underline the 'ordinary' situations that in a flash become extraordinary.
Though the subject matter is rather terrifying, Cappello elects to present this tale as black humor.
The film explores the dichotomy of disability and enablement, suggesting that, ironically, enablement comes about through dependence rather than independence.
The ending that was used leaves that rather wide open.
There's also some rather humorous gay moments, particularly with an obviously gay hat seller who sells Power his own hat, and is then told by Power to throw the other one out.
The star, then, is supported by a most excellent cast: Angela Lansbury (a fine actress but a rather unlikely chanteuse), James Bell (a usurped town leader), Jean Parker (an ageing belle and the latter's wife), Wallace Ford (predictably in the role of the reliable town doctor), Ruth Donnelly (as Scott's gracious elderly housekeeper), Jeanette Nolan (as the wife of a revenge-seeking ex-con whom Scott has killed in self-defense), and an interesting trio of villains Â powerful boss Warner Anderson (who also fancies himself a ladies' man and, in fact, strikes up relationships with both Parker and Lansbury throughout), shifty but nervous gambler John Emery and smooth gunslinger Michael Pate (making for a worthy opponent to Scott).
Scott makes a good, twinkle-eyed loner hero and Angela Lansbury is quite attractive as his leggy showgirl love interest, (though she would begin playing mothers of grown children just a few years later) but their romance is rather obligatory and uninspired.
He's a rather crude arranger, while being a sublime painter at the same time.
Official reviews of this latest film from David Lynch descried it at best as "opaque", "hard to summarize" and "to be experienced rather than explained", to at worst "indulgent", "complete nonsense" and made without consideration for the audience.
Your average movie goer will hate it, but those who see movies more as art rather than entertainment will probably find some way of appreciating it.
I can't imagine any other director making this movie, (or any movie like it, not that there might be), and keeping you interested or making you care about the outcome or the fate of the characters, or rather the fate of one character, the actress playing the leading role in the film within the film and whose dream/nightmare most of the film seems to be.
With these rather ordinary strands of guilt, fear and failure, Lynch relocates to his absurdist, cineliterate dreamscapes - chaotic, multi-layered palimpsests of creaky genres and deeply personal insecurities, sexy red curtains and frazzled electrical currents.
Owing a rather tidy sum to the restaurant owner (played by wily Adolphe Menjou), he is blackmailed into passing himself off as Russian royalty to charm a Yankee heiress.
This review is not about HOW the film was done, but rather WHAT the film does.
The moments of suspense and terror are so well done - there are several scenes that will literally make you jump - that I found a Hitcockian brilliance of using subtlety, indirectness, and sound to convey emotion rather than expensive special effects.
It is a movie that plays off of ideas, color, mood, it presents intangible emotions that we feel and internalize rather than think about and solve.
Overall, rather bafflingly over-rated by IMDB reviewers and for die hard Tupac Shakur fans only.
It is, despite its occasional hilarity, a very gentle and loving movie; there's just no meanness in it, which is a very pleasant and rather unusual thing, especially in a comedy.
After a rather fatal turn of events he gets a second chance at life and love.
I'd suggest going out for a nice dinner date, rather than spending on this flick -- unless you know you have the appetite for it!
I'd rather have a migraine than watch the 'antics' of this amazingly unfunny guy---who is supposed to be there for comic relief!!
The landscape, the lyrically still, gently moving camera, the haunting, 'dehumanized' pop strains of Bowie, Lovich, Kraftwerk; these phenomena bring out our responses... Or rather the cumulative effect does.
Throughout the film it shows, in the late 1930s, Jewish citizens being taken away by the army or secret police (with rather stirring music).
The leads are awkward, the story itself is rather blase, and the only saving grace is Chung's stylish direction.
Daniel Wu's rather blase acting style fits his tortured character.
I would rather deal with a plot that has to do with deep spiritualism, the nature of human and human-like beings, creative magical system (the spell out your mantra system), and plenty of strange and diverse cast of characters with distinct and deep personalities of his or her own; rather than deal with the Teeny-Bopping angst of fitting in, endless cinema and very little gameplay.
At the end I just want to add that I'm really glad I have grown up in a happy home in a rather quiet neighborhood!
I've never really taken to actress Marlene Dietrich, and I find her distinct European accent and stunted line-delivery to be rather distracting; however, she does passably well as Charlotte Inwood, demonstrating an arrogant disposition that forms a strong contrast with the mild personality of Wyman's character.
Only 'Ordinary' Smith's rather hurt reaction to learning the truth about Eve means anything, but it feels like a betrayal of a much slighter nature - she's a well-intentioned deceiver.
Richard Todd has been much criticised for his stiff portrayal, and I think it's fair to say he's rather a plodding performer, even if he's never truly bad - although his psychosis under the stage is tremendously effective.
The false flashback is a neat gambit, but unfortunately it unbalances the beginning of the film - Eve is sidelined for too long - and forces the script into some rather ugly expositional dialogue.
So, not only was it enjoyable - I it was also rather educational.
I rather enjoyed it though.
The scene of Eve and the Inspector in the back of the taxi was rather nice, at least I thought so.
I can see why it might not appeal to some people, being character driven rather than having children being chased by rampant birds or someone being attacked by a serial killer in an old lady's wig.
I feel that the writers deserve a bigger budget to prove to us that they can create a truly cinematic experience rather than a small dimension TV drama.
The hero is from IRELAND, rather, and his story is about a viking victim getting back at the perpetrators.
Its rather horrifying how the most visually stunning scene in the anime is the rape scene.
Expectedly, Q would rather focus on an upcoming DJ contest but trash-talking Bishop has other plans.
It's beautiful to care about the shape of a picture, it's even great when we make it well and the greatest stuff it's when we've got a rather solid story... now it's not the case here, the shape is soooo bad, traveling used like amateur, pretty bad effects (see it to believe), overbids of camera movements, thanks to the director for the bad use of the provided means.
As the movie began, I was somewhat thrown off, as the editing is somewhat "jumpy" and the story is presented out of sequence, so it's rather like pieces of a puzzle coming together.
Despite the rather raucous and disjointed beginning, this film does have an interesting plot, as it turns out; one just has to be patient as it slowly and tantalizingly begins to unfold.
Uniformly good acting especially from the two leads, cameos from Queen Latifah and Samuel L. Jackson, tense atmosphere and a funny, slang-heavy script all act in its favour, but a lack of originality and a rather mediocre ending bring it down a notch or two.
Linda (Thandie Newton), his wife, leaves him early on, choosing to fend for herself rather than go down with Chris' sinking ship.
A spectacle as good as this is unfortunately rarely seen in the movie industry with concentration focused on cinematography and character rather than other "distracting" aspects of production.
There's an air of mystery surrounding them all, and McLachlan trusts his audience enough to let us solve it all for ourselves rather than hitting us over the head with each plot point.
For example, there's a rather well-turned sub-plot involving one of the girls and the creepy caretaker, which relies on the audience's assumptions - and society's suspicious nature - to provide the necessary tension and resolution.
New Zealanders might recognise some references to Cave Creek, but they'd be reading in to the storyline rather than being told it.
When a movie lacks plot, acting, and other appreciable qualities you have to take what you can get even if it is rather crass.
In my opinion, it is a great film that is far too compelling to be worthy for those and it should have been nominated for Academy Awards rather than Razzies.
I don't particularly like either of the Morgan Earp characters in either film, but Virgil Earp again is portrayed much better in Wyatt Earp than Tombstone's Sam Elliott, who basically does his usual and plays Sam Elliott rather than a character.
Combat Shock is hands down, the most depressing movie I have ever seen, yet laughing just kind of came natural, but I would imagine you would need a rather dark sense of humor to see any humor in this at all, but believe me, it is totally there, it's just that it's overshadowed by the morbid, nightmarish, grittiness of it all.
If you watch this film based on the cover or the Troma-logo,don't bother, chances are that you feel rather drained after viewing.
I went to see the film based on that promise of titillation, but rather than being turned on, my tender sensibilities were turned off by the amoral characters and plot line.
One would think that this film was a rather blatant fantasy by that unapologetic libertine, Roger Vadim.
Comedy, even black comedy, still needs a moral center, something we can laugh with rather than just laugh at.
However, rather then Schwarznegger, Dolph Lundgren hasn't lost that touch of a Cool Action Dud He gets better the older he gets.
The film involves a shepherd-cum-experienced mountain-climber (a rather glum Quinn) who's asked by the French resistance (in the figures of Marcel Bozzuffi and Michel Lonsdale) to take a prominent nuclear scientist (James Mason) and his family (including wife Patricia Neal and daughter Kay Lenz) across the Pyrenees to safety in neutral Spain; along the way, they're helped by a group of traveling gypsies (led by Christopher Lee), while McDowell is the maniacal SS officer in pursuit.
It is not that this attitude is wrong, rather that it robs the dramas of the qualities of breath and moral ambiguity that mark all truly powerful stories.
and then the obligatory "never I'd rather die!".
Odd, then, that the series' major weakness is that there's too much going on, too much action and not enough quiet spots, which makes for a rather relentless and one-note viewing experience when it's not broken up into its original chapters.
Or I'd rather you don't.
Similarly to my fellow citizen, I also find it rather peculiar, that out of six comments on this film, four (and from now on five) have been written by Hungarians.
OK, it's rather silly and unreal(?
Rather than going forward, this GTA game is a rather stripped down version and uses the same AI and engine from GTA3 and is re done in an San Andreas style.
He's gimmicky, just like Little Nicky, but rather than feeling strongly one way or another about him -- I just felt indifferent.
The underperforming box office results of both "Zohan" and "The Love Guru" may help them realize this sooner rather than later.
I always have hated Adam Sandler movies although I found this one and Deuce Bigalow rather amusing at times.
I found it to be a rather hilarious joke on the seriousness that everybody applies to the stereotyping.
The stereotyping is, actually, rather fair and towards the end even shows plenty of "good stereotyping" (as accurate as stereotyping ever is, which is to say, rarely).
But the dubbing is rather good, I must say.
I expected this film to be nothing more than your very average 80s horror flick but it was much more.Admittedly the acting was well below par but the shocks certainly weren't.Any film encorporating clowns in my opinion can't help but be sinister there was no exception here the clown was terrificly scary,and the little girl dressed in white just added to it.The film also boasted some rather gruesome deaths especially the guillotine!This movie certainly surpassed its expectations.Deserves to be seen.
This is OK for the kiddies, though it is rather violent.
All of the child actors, rather surprisingly, do very well too and Rose Byrne proves to be a good partner for Cage, alternately hindering developments with a refusal to believe events and helping out with the odd comment/input that clarifies things further for Cage.
Director Alex Proyas manages to deliver a rather decent sci-fi flick that has plenty of suspense and intelligence.
The geek factor of Knowing is rather high with lots of number configurations and what-if scenarios which is great for the sci-fi fans.
He does not escape from a prison in Alabama, but rather the state prison in Huntsville, Texas, (the author apparently got their "Huntsvilles" mixed up and assumed it was Alabama.)
This prison escape film plays more like a straight drama, with a rather perfunctory car chase saved for the last dozen minutes.
Soderbergh is wise to put the looking-for-work moment very early rather than after 38 minutes, because it is better to start out with that.
I would rather watch a movie about these four girls than most movies readily offered to me.
This movie easily could have devolved into some pseudo-Scorsese gang movie but instead chose to focus on family drama, which is portrayed rather compellingly.
On another note, apparently there exists this person called Jennifer Lopez, and apparently she has rather large buttocks, and apparently I need Date Movie to tell me this.
", an additional statement that rather aptly sums up this piece.
Would you rather go out with class, or go out with really low quality volume?
She was rather surprised that I disliked it so much since I usually like romantic comedies, but I would rather watch "Made of Honor" than to ever watch this one again.
Those frenzied opening sequences we could have easily dispensed with, but in the end an Armageddon-like debacle is averted just in time for a bona fide twist ending that, for a change, puts the various plot pieces together with grace rather than rushed clumsiness.
Billy is 22 and works at a bank (just a little bit of information) Any way Billy as well as his dog who seems to get on rather well with the creature who Billy calls Gizmo Randy tells Billy to remember the three rules.
The other super villains are the Lizard (which is fun as long as you don't keep dying, because then it gets rather boring) and Morbius/Shriek.
The patrons are rather disbelieving until one creature gets inside and proceeds to try and eat as many people as it can.
Joan Graham is the secretary for Stephen Witney, an honest and dedicated public defender, who succeeds in doing something he would almost rather not do: get Joan's sweetheart, Eddie Taylor, out of prison.
It seems, rather, that this is merely what he would like to believe, and hopes that by asserting it boldly, repeatedly and each time quickly passing on to something else, he will like an after-dinner illusionist convince us that something has happened that in reality has not!
Images are mainly matched to the narrative according to the associations that they evoke, rather than to illustrate facts.
But it all makes rather a lot of sense, and not to suspect that there are people who spend their lives trying to figure out the perfect system for a stable and obedient society is like saying the military are not working on invisibility techniques, or cloning, or ever more effective bombs.
A fairly good watch, Every seems rather realistic, The fact the movie looks as though seen through a crappy camera makes it seem life-like.
The concept of the film is rather terrifying.
I'm more interested in finding out whether there is any truth behind the film, rather than moaning about the poor effects.
I find it rather strange how many people can find flaws with this movie.
I never knew any of these actors when I saw the movie, so maybe I was at an advantage rather than always thinking "Thats the guy from Stargate!".
Never the less Arthur is a watchable, warm creation, one's tempted almost to say endearing, while his peculiar peccadilloes, sexual or otherwise, ultimately add to rather than detract from our sense of his humanity.
Parts of this film are not fictitious works, rather raw, honest cinema, but to those who haven't seen it, I won't give any of this away.
Some of the strange things that are happening in this movie most probably happened to everyone once in some degree in their lifetime, so in some weird way, everyone should be able to relate to the characters and events that are occurring, rather than just being shocked by them.
opts for a deadpan humor, coaxing us to laugh at these pathetic people not out of affection or understanding, but rather simply as a response to life as they see it.
It is weird, but take it for its beauty and its amazing animation, rather than a film to make a point.
Rating: 4/10 (and I'm being rather generous)
A letterboxed DVD, with rather eccentric English subtitles, has been released by Hong Kong's Winson Entertainment.
Besides that there's not much else to be saying, as lets remember that its only a rather short piece of the movie it so well satires, rearranged and twisted for the best kind of laugh.
The latter, a rather nasty blackmailer and creep, latched onto Cassidy secret.
It will be interesting to see how 'NCIS' continues to develop, especially with the recent introduction of a new main character, although I sincerely hope it avoids the pitfalls of 'JAG' by focusing on being about the NCIS rather than delving too much in the love lives of the characters.
Week after week the officers of NCIS deal with murders, kidnappings and other threats to the lives of Naval officers across the globe (well at least the U.S.) but rather than adhere to the dark, overly serious tone of the law&orders or CSI's this program offsets the (often heinous) crime of the week with the banter between the central characters.
her training is not investigation, but rather assassination and intelligence gathering.
I found Todd to be a rather flat, and annoying, character.
To me, that quality makes for the best Columbo opposition, because it places the emphasis is on the cat and mouse game, rather than just the simplistic good vs. bad.
It doesn't place blame, rather shows implications of well intentioned, ignorant motivations.
This plainly is an allegorical piece, each actor fulfils a function rather than a character but the story is none the worse for that; many art house movies do likewise.
Moreover, the basic plot blatantly emulates the second "A Nightmare on Elm Street" movie, the pace really kicks into gear and rarely lets up after the rather leisurely opening third, the 80's clothes and hairstyles are hilariously hideous (Michael's silly blue pajamas are especially sidesplitting!
The ending is rather cheesy.
The music is surprising good, the actors are VERY good (Macedo is superb, the best, Stefani is THE WITCH, the boys they make its work rather well, the role of AgustÃ­n Sierra, MartÃ­n, is very funny, with his constant psychological auto-diagnoses, the psychiatrist is terrific, Lorenzo (Esteban Prol) is really good... and ... and Florencia Bertotti is an angel living in the Earth.
The film shows how her feelings of indignancy are ignited and herself propelled--rather too quickly--into a spiral of Irish politics and intrigue.
Holmes' life on campus is rather cosy.
While offering us a rather slight story of a pair of teen lovers on the road who encounter a slightly older bisexual who becomes their nemesis, companion, lover and protector, THE DOOM GENERATION offers a great deal of visual style and wit, and some genuine moments of suspense.
Maybe he's looking for a third option, one that actually does children good, rather than oppressing them or leaving them to run wild in an irresponsible world.
I'd rather watch insanity like "Evil Dead 2" than the Spiderman movies any day.
In the middle of the movie,some totally new characters show up and it's pretty obvious they're only there to get killed by the demons.But then again,what other purposes can characters in a horror movie have anyway?This second movie in the "Evil Dead"-series is kinda different actually,it gets more surreal here,mainly because Ash has really lost it here in the first half,and the demons appear to be even more over-the-top and more evil.However,they both grab themselves together near the end for their final showdown.Ash is accompanied by a bunch of idiots but as they're idiots,they don't help much and get killed in some rather original ways.I'm not sure when this movie is situated,but I'm guessing this movie acts like the first one never existed.Not that it completely retells the story,it merely summarises it.And as I took this walk on gross-out lane,I found myself very entertained,somehow shocked but I don't have a clue by what exactly and I did laugh along with Ash and the deer head I must say.That scene really puts a spell on you.Almost as great as the first one
Plus, although the movie gave us some insights, the actual span of time covered in the film was rather limited.
I must admit that I rather enjoyed this Sherlock Holmes fantasy story.
The feeling that one gets is something that closes inward rather than something that opens outward.
The film began on a very slow and rather boring note though Amitabh Bachchan's powerful role as the narrator was worth appreciating.
Always enjoy Tom Selleck, (Will Cubanks) films and in this picture he plays a rather low key person who loves studying a dictionary and was a former ex-cowboy who has a good friend and sidekick, J D Reed, (Jerry Reed).
He rather seems like the dark reflection of Oskar Schindler to me.
Two suicide attempts and a character's ageing by 50 years are all conveyed through clever editing rather than expensive stunts, CGI or prosthetics.
Maybe it was a budgetary rather than aesthetic decision to do so, but bravo nonetheless.
The film also creates a rather fictitious legend around how the infamously harrowing hit song Gloomy Sunday conceived and left its mark not only on music history but also on demography.
It'll be interesting to see what the "Kath & Kim" devotees make of it (that's a popular current Australian TV series by the same director) - perhaps you require a special bent to see this film as being truly funny, rather than merely pleasant.  
Effects-laden mess also echoes the "Indiana Jones" series, but without strong or charismatic performers and screen writing, the picture deflates rather early.
I liked this movie because it was more psychological rather than chop and slash gore that most horror films use to scare people.
She also doesn't exactly resemble Holiday, who was rather plump early on, but she just so commands the screen...amazing how few films she has ultimately made, though the specter of Dorothy Dandridge looms large.
But I also have to admit that the movie its story, written by Chris Columbus, was rather simplistic.
Playing Miss Holliday in the film,Miss Diana Ross does not try to imitate her,nor does she resemble her in any way.She sings songs associated with her quite competently,and performs rather than acts,as top class singers(Frank Sinatra,Peggy Lee)tended to do.She is clearly a charismatic performer,and that shows on the screen.Unfortunately she does not share Miss Holliday's talent for turning dross into gold,for dross is what "Lady sings the blues" quite evidently is.
In spite of the rather dramatic and heavy sounding plot I've described, it also has some great comic moments.
great performances by Clark Gable-the doctor, and Myrna Loy, the 'high-maintenance socialite', who 'tosses' him because he stays to save a patient's life, rather than attend her party.
The only thing this film lacked was more ... more of the luminous Ann Harding, more of how she was slowly capturing the real man inside the phony, shallow playboy Fletcher, and more of how William Powell brought that character into reality from a stiff and rather formal screenplay, the kind of "very talkative" cinematic fiction so common in that era.
And, indeed, rather risque for its day since there is a supposition at one point that Ann Harding's character, Joan, in trying to trap William Powell into marriage, is giving pre-marital favors and is actually caught in the process.
it is not the classical English film either as the family is placed in an out of time and out of space atmosphere unlike the clear and cozy spaces of other English stories.i would rather say that the film is imprinted with Emma Thompson's personal touch which makes it a beautiful yet strange film in its own way.
The script writer, actress Emma Thompson, uses language in a manner designed to communicate rather than to just make a bunch of noise while pretending to say something while saying nothing.
There are seven rather naughty children who have creatively and gleefully drove away seventeen nannies who tried to tame them.
Usually I'm all for scripts that don't shout and scream, that rather rely on subtlety and restraint, but this one is so elliptical that its own best intentions are undermined.
They roll out of one town into another and rather than stay at a hotel they are taken in by a couple who are related to one of the skydivers.
He then stands up and leans in rather closely to Ms. Kerr.
Here the message seems to be political while in Hollywood it's often rather religious, but the technique is the same, and strangely, you can hardly miss the Devil and God working around a hapless Man even here.
Death sequence that follows (operated by the all-times star french guillotine) is tactful and strikingly hard, and (thankfully) rather short.
I wont go into the detail of her life and what we see of it, because you can see that in the movie and read about it in the plot summary... some of the shots in this movie were spectacular... especially in the first half, and the final sequence in the water.. but there were points where her ranting and raving became almost painful to endure.. contradictory, angry, and occasionally insightful, Estamira is a rather unique and confusing person and her story is heartbreaking, although it is difficult to empathize given her temperament.
Considering I was expecting this Lindsay Lohan vehicle to be a tame, teen-friendly Hollywood horror, I was actually rather pleasantly surprised by its absurdity (but then I love Argento films, which rarely make sense).
I can say that Lohan's performance seemed rather bland and stale throughout, as though in the back of her mind she knew the movie was trite and looked at it more as a paycheck than a serious mark on her resume.
Other than that, I'd rather stab my eyes out with a biro than be forced to sit through it again.
Of course, in a made for TV movie, you aren't looking for the professionalism of the genre, but rather at the entertainment value.
In Paris where the World Championship was held, she was second after school figures, but the difference in score between her and VrzanovÃ¡ was rather small, so she still had good chances to win.
"Art of the Devil 2" is a gore-soaked horror film which was directed by a team of seven filmmakers known as the Ronin Team.The direction is solid,the cast is pretty good,but the storyline is hardly dynamic.When the gore appears it is unrelenting and disgusting.Miss Panor is an great villain and truly remorseless killer.The gore is rather hard to stomach for example toenails are torn out,teeth are plucked,live geckos burst out of a boy's back,one hapless girl gouges her own eyes out and the skin on man's legs is burned by a blow-torch.Overall,I enjoyed "Art of the Devil 2" more than its predecessor.Give it a look.
Unlike the Sixth Sense with its slick execution, script and delivery, Art of the Devil 2 had a rather satisfactory ending, but with the final stroke of the pen in creating the finale, it presented itself with a major loophole that seemed to have glossed over what transpired earlier, which is a big no-no in trying to force audiences to accept the "new truth".
Anyway, the film is an interesting (and mainly successful) mishmash of genres: part offbeat Western (with a wagon train beset by Zulus rather than Indians!
This is a rather interesting (and amusing) tale of a spaceship that goes to a planet to investigate a call for help, only to find there's seemingly nothing wrong.
If only more people would actually spend more time trying to read about the origin and classical stories of the Legion rather than base the entire concept on the series.
Save the world (or rather, the galaxy).
This movie was far more impressive then it's contemporary rival the rather silly (though still enjoyed) Conan the Barbarian.
Shame on Ariel Vromen, who needs to go back to NYU, shouldn't have transferred to LA Film School, and needs to stick to dark comedy, rather than supposed dark films that lack intensity or research.
He wrote to Will Rogers, who was touring in the George M. Cohan/Lionel Barrymore role of the father and slated to do this movie version, stating that he had had to leave the theatre with his daughter rather than expose her to such smut!
Rogers prided himself on never doing "blue" material, and withdrew from the film in favor of that fatal trip to Alaska with Wiley Post; one suspects the unfortunate minister saw rather more than he liked of himself in Muriel's father, McComber, in the play, and that was the true source of his offense.
I don't think Norma went mad because Hollywood turned its back on her, rather Hollywood turned its back on her because she went mad.
Nancy Olsen gives a strong performance in a rather small part and Erich von Stroheim is chilling and disturbing as Max.
Jack's nearly MIA in all but a few episodes and the episodes went through changes, such as more attention was payed to the evildoers and their plight rather than the classic detective elements in the previous two seasons.
Always underplaying, going for the quiet impact rather than hot blooded emotions, he is a big reason for the show's success.
This pleases the movie industry no end - it would prefer to have us come back again and again for sugary confections rather than supply us with something nutritious into which we can sink our teeth.
And yes, there were certain brief moments when she looked (rather than sounded) like her mother, but she's all LIZA.
The thing looked as if strangely colored drool was coming out of its mouth rather than fire.
I'd rather have lunch with Sauron than sit through this again!!
In this movie, sexual intercourse is not of a climatic taste, but the seed of inevitable events whose consequences are rather bizarre.
I never believed that the daughter was ashamed of being black, rather, she was angry at the fact that black people did not have the same opportunities as whites.
DOUG: A chance meeting between two single moms leads to a lifelong friendship in Imitation of Life, a movie that was a rather late addition to the Odyssey, but one I'm very glad we looked at.
I found it to be historical rather than dated...although that last line is, inarguably, ridiculous.
After this, the film never reaches that high again, and some of the tales are rather hit and miss.
This sodomy sequence could have failed miserably, were it not for the complete conviction and commitment Wilder devotes to the role, having the good sense to play it straight rather than overly goofy, and in the process, capturing the viewer's sympathies and hearts with his earnest, idealistic eyes to an almost alarming degree.
The song is a confession of a wife to her husband about the rather mundane and unexciting state of their relationship.
The story was also a but clichÃ©d and there was one rather misplaced hot scene.
If you liked Predator... watch it again, rather than this tenth rate rip off.
I roared laughing out loud and that didn't stop until the final chapter that turned into a tragedy (there is always a thin line...) This is not so much a 'political' movie as some people may believe, rather it's a story focusing on the character and mentality of people from the Balkans.
They went for beauty and surrealism rather than photo-realism, and it's glorious.
It should have won Emmys rather than being nominated but it was a great cast and legacy to sitcom television.
Yet, "Tropical Malady" also brings a romantic tenor to the subject as it implies that the love between the two men has somehow moved into a more meaningful and primal stage, one bereft of the constricting and deadening rituals placed upon it by a civilized world (my suspicion is that is why the filmmakers chose to make this a love story between two men rather than one between a man and a woman, though, frankly, the Thai society we see doesn't seem to be particularly condemning or homophobic in its response to the lads).
The relationship has homoerotic undertones but they are suggested rather than openly acknowledged.
He places his hand on Tong's knee but the boy turns it into a mischievous game of squishing his hand with his other leg rather than acknowledging its sensual implications.
All that, rather than the intimidating silence he's known for.
So the movie is, unintentionally I suspect, rather hopeless.
In some ways, the concept behind the storyline was a rather interesting blend of several typical movie types in an interesting combination.
I have to admit I found it rather entertaining for all these reasons and more.
I would rather choose to watch 90 minutes of my computer going through 5400 blue screens of death than watch this appalling drivel again - ever.
None-the-less, the prestige, is not a description of an illusion's parts, but rather the remains left of the magician who has transported himself via the Tesla device which, apparently, does work.
Once I'd got my head round the idea that it was a series of vignettes, I went with it, but this made it disappointingly like a sketch show rather than a film.
Fairly impressive cast of Tattoo cannot cache rather implausible & heavy constructed story.
Martin Schmidt directs with the talent (or rather lack of it) of a 10 year old Fangoria fan.
It seems as though the screenwriter was trying too hard to make jokes rather than allowing them to flow organically from the situation.
I didn't laugh, rather I just waited for the plot to continue.
Truth is, the basic technical aspects are good, but they are drowned out by the bad acting, bad script, and bland feeling that makes it seem everyone had other things they'd rather be doing.
Tracy Scoggins gets good billing for a rather degrading cameo.
and rather bloodlessly at that!!!!!!
Most of the dialog gives background information of all the different characters which is rather pointless and shallow.
There's a scene in A Crack In The Floor where busty beauty Heidi (Daisy McCrackin) accidentally spills her drink down her frontÂa rather obvious excuse to have the lovely actress whip off her clothes and give us an eyeful of her charms.
But when a film racks up a kill count that reaches double figures (I counted ten, including several by pick-axe), but prefers to suggest the carnage rather than gross out the audience (probably 'cos it's cheaper that way), you can't help but feel disappointed and cheated.
Well at least he adds some spirit to this rather stage bound, dull movie.
However, in this rather listless installment, the menace of evil is very, very subdued and the film never delivered on its promise.
This "brilliant" villain sure wasn't very careful and got himself killed rather easily.
So, what looked like an exciting adventure film turned out to be a rather dull little film.
Finally, we also get a chance to see the fine actor Bramwell Fletcher in a rather substantial role as one of Fu Manchu's intended victims.
But I guess the selling point to this movie is more to do with the music of The Beatles rather than character interaction but the music featured here is of the band`s early stuff and I much prefer their later material  As a strange footnote last year Paul McCartney`s daughter Stella was married on the island of Bute where I live .
It's just too much sugar in this movie...diabetics rather stay away.
They too were well acted and brilliantly produced but were made to sell a political message rather than entertain.
At first, I thought it might be interesting, but after the rather hard-to-follow introduction, it just kept going down in my view.
Though one has to wonder how did such obviously low budget movies get their hands on some rather respectable actors and actresses.
Granted, Stone is a rather newcomer at this point, but Chamberline and James Earl Jones are not.
The biggest curiosity about the film is that most of the action in the trailer doesn't appear in the film at all despite looking rather less inept that what made the final cut, leaving the feeling of something that's been patched together in post over the weekend on an Ed Wood budget.
After waiting so long for this title to be released I have to say I was rather let down.
My expectations are rather low when we're talking about sequels.
Vulgar is what it claims to be, I give it a 1 out 10 and I think I'd rather gauge my own eyes out than see it again.  
Even the many reviews here liken the film more to the temperament of Tarantino rather than Kevin Smith - who has a gentle edge at the end of the day.
It started out rather interesting - this very plain looking young woman seems to live a lonely sort of life with her widowed father in a medium-sized town.
I found Drum to be rather wooden and two-dimensional as in fact I found many of the characters.
Actually this film is more of an identity crisis drama and murder mystery rather than a horror movie.
This is a comment rather than a review.
I found myself listening more to the "crescendos" of the music rather that what was being said.
He plays Anthony, the earnest and honest follower who would rather settle down and find love then get involved in illegal activities.
In this role he manages to convince us he only gets involved out of a sense of loyalty, rather than to actually gain anything for himself.
I felt like the conclusion was an afterthought rather than a planned event.
I could say that the movie looked more like the the takes rather than the actual movie.
I'd rather be made sit through one Mad Mel's recent films then ever watch this bloated, rotting corpse of a film ever again!
The reincarnated princess gets her father's lightsaber, I mean her predecessor's flute, but the dog puts in no reappearance as a dog or as a human (unless I missed something very subtle about either Hiroyuki Sanada's or Sonny Chiba's characters)... and he was, shall we say, rather important to the original princess.
An example being the sequence at the girls house after the first date to the bar, which was rather lame as far as the story and especially the acting goes.
What is notable about this film is that it is not only bad, but it is as bad in relation to the rather low quality first film as this fact would imply.
A film of this sort requires interesting, if often two-dimensional supporting characters, and while Lauren Cohen, the female lead, does a creditable job, the rest of the supporting acting is rather bad.
Kal Penn should have been working on a Harold and Kumar sequel rather than this infantile idiocy.
Thankfully, this movie was rather short, and relatively painless.
The rooms at the Manai are huge, and by hotel standards, rather top notch.
However, when all is said and done Petzold's "Yella" is a film full of irrelevant references pinned under the title of "artistic licence", it would be better suited to a total running time of 30 minutes, rather than forcing the viewer to endure 86 minutes worth of scenes depicting the supposed ideals of the capitalist West.
The 3 stars I give the mini-series comes from the generally good production values and the commitment to making a mini-series rather than trying to compress the whole series into 2 hours or so.
Robert Vaughn was trying desperately to act (doing rather well too).
Most were rather bad and a few just plain unwatchable.
Of course so much cricket sound was recorded probably because they used the camera mic rather than a boom.
Unfortunately I had to endure the full almost two hour cut of this crap rather than the shorter US DVD version which apparently makes no sense but would have thankfully lasted for twenty odd minutes less, I just have no luck at all.
Jack Black is an annoying character.This is an annoying indie movie for 14 year olds.Do I have to write eight more lines?Ana de la Reguera is dang fine to look at,as a Mexican nun who puts up with the rather forward and rude advances of Jack Black.This movie is a PG 13 version of an indie film.I really like a movie that has the courage to explore Mexican culture.This movie explores Mexican culture-deeply.
The multiple story lines in this one coalesce rather well, especially Negri replacing Jenny Hasselqvist as the sexual possession of a sheikh played by Paul Wegener (who, in addition to working for Lubitsch, took part in two important early German films: 'The Student of Prague' (1913) and 'The Golem' (1920)).
I wish thay would rather have put some CLICHÃ' Stuff.
At first, she seems like the perfect older mentor for robin, as she enjoys spending time with her after school and showing her how to bake and do other rather useful things.
I rather stick a knife in my stomach for entertainment, rather than touch this movie with a 10 foot poll.
The music is awful and so are the action scenes, if you want to see Rutger's action film i recommend seeing rather split second or arctic blue.
After (roughly) the 20 minute mark, the film has become so utterly, irredeemably rubbish that one is forced to consider whether it is intentional and intended as a form of challenging art rather than as a linear film.
And, largely because of that miserable excuse for a script, it winds up being not a good ANY kind of film: When the bloody hell are film makers going to realize the rather elementary truth (as in Kindergarten level) that if you don't have a good script, you don't have a film?
The performance by Fiona Kay is excellent, but she is the only fleshed-out character, and doesn't really behave as a normal person, more an adult's rather twisted vision of what a small girl might do and think.
Trauth was pretty darn good but for the life of me I couldn't understand why his character would rather be a freak skater instead of the high school football team's quarterback with the hottest cheerleader in school for his girlfriend!??!
The problem was the laboured dialogue delivery and the general impression that the actors were acting for the camera rather than being real characters with the camera as the invisible voyeur.
I'd rather be at the dentist, especially since my dentist, unlike Dr. Mabuse, is a nice guy.
Whether the last third of the film explains his reasons for being there or not, the film should've focused much more on what she needs, what she is experiencing and should've explained a lot more of her backstory of who she is as an Aussie geologist, rather than let them both be strangely stranded "tourists" who are seeking for some sort of direction from the plot!!!
The performances were stilted and without much heart, Collette looked like she was just sort of skimming through all of her scenes and dialogue as if she was rather not bothered about being in this film.
I was hoping to learn more about the outback and more about Australian geology and have more scenes with Toni's character's work (she was supposed to be a geologist), rather than this annoying yuppie chick, having major league hissy fits and non-stop winging.
It ended up rather redundant and slow, to me.
In the movie, apart from Aki, perhaps, there are nothing but cliched characters, who only fit a general description of a character rather than a true character.
Finding a hidden mural is an old and effective device, however, the director did nothing with the mural that was found under the wallpaper; it should have revealed a clue or added to the story, rather than merely remaining as background scenery in the room or an occasional talking point.
I'll give Stewart some credit--hence the rating of 2 rather than 1--because he assembles some compellingly gruesome footage of shark finning (and beheading and gutting) to drive home the point of finning's barbaric, wasteful nature.
They would rather ram another vessel and risk killing human beings, to save a few sharks.
There was no emotion, and so much drama over too little drama..if that makes sense The movie also seemed like it was over the span of a couple months, rather than three years.
In the book, they were in a train), on their way to their grandmother's house, or rather, mansion.
And how the movie ends, it may look dramatic in a rather happy-ending manner, but comparing to the book, it is overtly exaggerated, giving the whole thing a cheap smell.
This film (which was shot on video, by the way) is rather low quality.
The expanded role given to the cabin boy does nothing to advance the plot, and the young actor playing him is rather irritating.
In another major plot change Catriona, the eponymous heroine of the sequel, appears a book early as the feisty daughter of the noble James of the Glens (rather than of the villainous James More MacGregor).
However, having lived in various third world countries it seems to me that what is portrayed is a very real part of the Philipinnes, Also it does not matter because in a film we should be looking for art rather than for advertising a country.
If people set out to make an independent film and sink a lot of their own money into it, why not make something interesting and unique rather than trying to imitate the crap that already comes out of Hollywood.
There is also a romantic interest, a cigarette girl named Irene (Kelly MacDonald), who is rather pretty but stands out no more than any other of today's actresses.
The ending is rather abrupt and the viewer is left wondering just how they could possibly pull it off, nor are we shown the details.
Constant errors in the dialog, strange and rather improbable plot structures and a lack of a genuine sense of humor ruined this film - one which had so much potential, and was bandied around the Australian television and radio airwaves as a potential Aussie classic.
The issues of family and comradeship were dealt with rather well, especially in relation to the main character (Benny G, played by Glenn Robbins), but the film left the audience wanting more from the heavily underutilized cast.
Having said this, the four leads all give solid, believable performances, and, for the most part, cover up, rather than expose, the inconsistencies in their characters' nature.
And finally, the main reason why this movie is farcical rather than stimulating is the movie styles to which it chooses to pay homage.
It was rather funny watching Rex Harrison, (Charles Dyer) playing the role as a homosexual considering his real role in life as a womanizer who was dating Carole Landis who killed herself.
Instead, they were rather corny.
The James Dean movie might have been done much better had it been a feature film rather than one susceptible to the limitations of a made for TV movie.
Even the more "authentic" emotional moments such as the rocky relationship between the young actor and his estranged father are so tightly bound in overt dramatizations rather than something more lifelike.
The rest of the cast was actually rather good (did I detect hints of fear in some eyes sometimes?
To provide examples of my tastes, I'll cite "The Beloved," "A Clockwork Orange," "Dogville" and "Stalker," (though not nearly as good as these, I'd much rather watch "American Psycho" than TotW).
I was hoping this would be the case for the film "Blindness" (which I saw before this one), but instead experienced a bland, rather conventional construction that was not compelling on any level.
This movie is so terrible, i'd rather see Halloween 3.
It's excruciatingly boring, the characters are tired stereotypes that i'd rather just die than get to know them, the production quality is nonexistent, the killer is as appealing as a sack of wet newspaper, and the movie has no resolution of who the killer is or why.
This movie was horrible,and I pride myself on loving all kinds of movies,but this was just terrible.The actors were very good looking the actresses were pretty with cute little bodies,but goodness I would rather them put in a few uglies than to have a ucked up script and story line.These people CAN NOT act!OK who drops down and does the nasty in an unknown barn,with a buddy missing?Not even in the worst horror movies has this happened.The story makes no sense.But if you can get a copy with the bloopers at the end,those are pretty good.The best part of this movie was the bloopers.The unfolding of the story was way too slow,the plot DOES NOT thicken,the actors can not act,the music sux,there's no "boo moments" as my friend calls them,everything that is going to happen is so freggin obvious its sad.This was a TOTAL waste of production dollars.Someone suggested that this seemed more like a student film,but as I'm sure that person knows,student films have been so much better than this before,as he said,that is no excuse.I recommend to try it because everyone has a different opinion,but ewwww!
I wish that I had more to say about this title but I forgot a lot about it and I would rather not remember it.
The plot tries to reel towards comedic tones but ultimately ends up as a depressing drama about a rather annoying guy.
Seeing that she's his sister, she's rather cool on the idea, and jumps into the labyrinth as well.
Even the way they move feels like watching robots in motion rather than a natural performance.
As a result it plays out like a long snuff movie with one violent death scene after another, until it all comes to a rather dull and sudden ending.
The movie starts by introducing us to a series of characters - the US soldiers - and we are given some interesting background to these men's personal histories, but then this comes to a rather sudden dead end as soon as the fighting begins - at which point the development of these characters completely stops.
And not just the fastest either, the Italian movie industry, especially in the late 1970's and early 1980's, was probably also one of the most prolific and could churn out seemingly hundreds of films on any given theme (the theme being usually dictated by what happened to be successful in Hollywood at the time) Take for instance the success of George A Romero's Dawn Of The Dead (which was released in Italy as 'Zombi') Within no time at all, enterprising Italian producers had released a whole slew of cheaply made (but often rather watchable) virtual copies of the film.
Even the climatic battle between the hero and the main villain was handled in a rather hopelessly lacklustre manner.
Her clothing may have been normal small town 70's gear rather than 1800's gear.
Yet it has the ultimate sin, which I do not often encounter in movies, which usually have something to recommend them, of being rather dull.
The film maintains a bleak, free-form nihilism throughout, its plot (much like the war it's invoking) a jagged sequence of events rather than a simple matter of connect-the-dots conflict resolution.
McNamara at one point in the film says that whenever he went before the press, he never answered the question asked but rather answered the question he wished was asked.
I would much rather they just bring the show back.
There are actually one or two decent moments, and the grimy look works to its favour, as these things could make for campy fun, but it all comes off rather boring and worthless to care much.
The world looks more colorful and uncertain when you are aware of its capacity and emptiness, rather depressing.
Maybe I wouldn't rather go to the dentist, but this film still isn't very good.
I do consider The Curse a success in regards to how it can effectively make your skin crawl, but other than that, I find this rather foul in all respects.
the dialogue is still full of problems but the plot is rather good.
I wanted to find problems with the movie but found more good points rather than bad points.
Screen writer-director John Hughes has aimed his sights once again at the easily pleased young audiences, and it is surely the only target he is likely to strike with this rather misfired teen comedy.
The funniest scene in fact would have to be at the church near the end of the film when Sammy's rather heavily sedated sister attempts to walk down the aisle with daddy.
Lets face it, the character got his start in commercials as a rather annoying individual and it was funny to see him torment Vern, but more funny to see Vern get back at Ernest for bothering him in the first place.
However, most of the movie is rather groan inducing and to top it off it gets overly sentimental at times as well.
Suffice to say he has not gotten over his daughter's murder and intends to expose her death as not a mistake but rather the evil machinations of one of the sisters.
After an extremely bizarro pretitle initiation scene where a sorority pledge is murdered, "Sisters of Death" becomes a rather dull affair.
While it is accompanied by a typically rousing score, the action often comes across as confusing rather than exciting (not to mention unintentionally hilarious during the climactic monster mash).
All in all though this movie bogs down more than once as it seems it would rather focus on the people rather than the monsters.
At least in Rats everyone dies, and it is shown that there are all types of soldiers on both sides rather than just good Americans and bad Vietcong.
To me it seems as if this film is being instructed by two VERY different directors, because the depiction of Alabama population in the last 2/3 of the movie reminds me most of all of cartoon characters rather then actual homo sapiens.
I'd rather sit through 'Gigli' 100 times.
In addition, while this is a bad film, so much of it is rather dull and had NOTHING to do with the plot, so it really failed to excite the bad movie buff within me as well.
I'd rather work in godless Texas again, than watch this ugh!
Now though, this particular films makes for a rather nostalgic time, but it's truly not a very good movie.
Directed by Stuart Hagmann Tarantulas: The Deadly Cargo is a pretty obscure & hard to find made-for-TV film & to be brutally honest that's a bit of a blessing as it's rather crap.
In closing, I think it would have been better if Singleton did a sequel to Boyz N the Hood that takes places 10 years after the original with Cuba Gooding, Jr.(Note: Cuba's brother, Omar, is in this film), Nia Long, and Laurence Fishburne returning rather than making this movie.
Despite a compelling theme, some truly sparkling dialogue, and terrific performances by misters Plummer, Wagner, and Walsh, this film comes across rather uneven.
This strange idea seemed to impress most of the reviewers but I couldn't get into it--mostly because it all seemed rather fake and I also thought that children playing war and acting as if it's all lots of fun just seemed a bit grotesque.
The writers sitting down and figuring out some tighter storyline rather than getting the easy way out and shrugging off all coherence.
Some of them are innocent and would really rather not be dead, but others are twats who deserve it.
It's an ambitious project and I feel bad for rating it so poorly, but it's rather pretentious and just doesn't offer enough gruesomeness for the particularly blood-thirsty.
Then there's the notion that this rather unlikely not to mention very middle class serial killer thinks that what he is doing is art.
In Man Bites Dog, this was genuinely achieved through skillful and subtle film-making rather than preaching pseudo-philosophical student claptrap at the audience.
The murders are rather silly, and the whole "I followed you from the video store" line just tacky.
I think my nationality has rendered my some point of patriotism, that the war criminal could not just get away with this, of just like the blockbuster "Pearl Harbor", in the spitting of the people of China, plus the modest performance of Harley and Trevor, I would rather delete it from my PC.
The only sad thing is that no longer could you imagine seeing movies as plays on the stage, something which was very easy with the old rather over-acted melodramas...  Keep up the good work and I for one will be waiting for the next release!
If it dared to be a little more left-field, rather than ticking the predictability box, it could have been a lot more, but it chose to stay on the path, rather than stray away.
The first slasher half is rather exciting, with a couple of truly nasty murder sequences and the most laughably inept police investigation ever, but the second half is painfully tedious and derivative of much better films.
Directed by Tom Berry made an rather boring supernatural horror film that has nothing to do with the previous "Amityville" movies and even the house is different.
Go see Knocked Up again rather than waste your time on this tosh, as did all the cast.
Unfortunately I payed for laughs but got rather little of them, as well as a slow, slumberous story that takes far too long to get going.
I was also rather surprised at how liberal our censors appear to have become.
I have just watched this adaptation of the Miss Marple book "Nemesis" and am rather lost as to why this telemovie should be called the same.
For being the introduction to one of the most enduring horror series in European cinema, FRANKENSTEIN'S BLOODY TERROR is rather lame - apart from being an edited variant of the original Spanish cut, bearing the more accurate title THE MARK OF THE WOLFMAN - but one tends to forgive Paul Naschy the many shortcomings of his script on this occasion because here he was still treading the waters, as it were.
As a mostly-sung stage show (presumably set in 1885 Britain, rather than "present day Los Angeles," justifying songs like "London Fog" that are otherwise totally illogical), "Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" probably wouldn't be so bad.
I was impressed with one unusual camera set-up, when a fat pedestrian's face is dirtied and we see a close-up of his reflection in a hand mirror, rather than his actual face.
'Standing Still' begins so slowly it took us nearly half an hour to decide that the movie was possibly intended as a comedy rather than a very long cigarette ad.
There was good acting but only in scenes meant to show off good acting rather than to move the plot in any understandable direction (watch the interminable "mother of the prime minister" scenes).
Terrible in a way that it's not fun, but rather makes you grit your teeth and quiver.
We will often pursue goals and attitudes in our lives that put higher values on monetary and material goods, rather than the unseen goals and attitudes that would bring us our true happiness.
Therefore, it's rather sad to see Susan Sarandon so open-mouthed and hesitant here, kowtowing to a perfectly dreadful Edward Herrmann in the opening scenes of "Compromising Positions".
None of it works, it never comes together as one coherent piece & the fact that it's so unfunny, childish, predictable & rather boring doesn't help my love for it.
I'm sorry, it's just that his delivery of a lot of his lines were rather cringe worthy.
The story it self was very enjoyable and the actors did their job rather well.
Unfortunately, he is not in it enough to save the pick, rather he is sort of a movie bookend.
If you don't understand its "R" rating, just watch (or rather listen) to the scene at the beginning, and then you'll understand why.
Performances come across rather drab, but Laura Banks, Frederick Bailey and especially Leslie Scarborough kick up plenty of spruce.
Director Keller turns in a competent film & that's the only reason this turd gets two stars out of ten rather than one.
Then, rather abruptly, the film switches to an outer space film.
Then, some rather random caveman video is included--that is, until you find out they are VAMPIRE CAVEMEN!!!!
This is the kind of incompetent garbage that would be made bearable only by either good-natured silliness or barking mad humour; but since the tone here is rather nasty, and laughs are pretty much absent (funniest line: 'What the sh*t?
I think the scene is the worst part, because the earthquake made me laugh rather than be scared of Jun's fall...
But if you ask me about ingenuity, I would rather go for RAINCOAT, by the contemporary film-maker Rituporno Ghosh.
Well it is rather bad, but what can one expect from the Afterdark series I have given up on them a long time ago.
i would rather rub one out in front of my parents then watch this again!!
The direction is also rather uninspired, and with much of the action taking place in the dark, the film is a real strain on the eyes (and one's patience); it also makes seeing what might've been some half-decent scenes of gore almost impossible to make out.
and is an awfully good shot with a crossbow), who many might know from the DAWN OF THE DEAD remake as the irritating mall security guard whose attitude towards the survivors was quite unkind, has a heroic role towards the end as the kind of tough character who everyone else quietly respected, despite his rather negative reactions to what the community was trying to accomplish.
And, Nicole DuPort's character Dakota, a soft-spoken, rather weak member of the group who was sleeping with the professor, putting her complete faith and life in his future plans, metamorphosing into a bloodthirsty savage with warrior paint, nearly had me laughing my ass off.
It's a rather overripe, humorless adaptation of Mary Webb's book "Gone to Earth" involving a gypsy girl in 19th century Wales who is caught between two men.
The irony being: the aunt avoids taking any responsibility for the potential ramifications of Megghy's sex adventure, when she acts as a sister figure to her niece, rather than a surrogate mother, who in that capacity, would tell the young girl to wait, before dragging her back on the boat.
The mathematics and science are brilliantly weaved into this story of everything good and pure about us, or rather, what could be.
Seems like this dog, Greta, is a rather sweet and lovable Rottweiler.
Anyway, this movie doesn't get many points for coherence, but it does make a rather good point at the end: do NOT upset Rottweilers.
I found the ending rather bizarre but slightly surprising.
As hard to take as HAINES was the rather ordinary looking ALICE DAY.
Guess that means movies like 'Deepthroat' should be regarded as social documentaries rather than porno junk.
Most of the jokes weren't hilarious at all - they were rather washed out, old and often simply not funny.
Think of a meeting of a dozen of "Uncle Joes" ... Wouldn't you rather be anywhere else?
It does start off in a rather amusing fashion, the first seven minutes (which also include the starting credits) promise a funny spoof in the tradition of ZAZ films like "The Naked Gun".
I'd rather eat a turd than watch such a pitiful attempt at cinema.
The movie begins with Maria, a rather annoying girl mourning the suicide of her sister (and by the way, we never do find out what made Lucia kill herself), going on a small vacation with four "friends".
The music at the approaching of El Charro is rather good.
We never get to realize why Regan is in danger, the priest's aim during the whole film is rather incomprehensible and all the "synchronizer" scenes with the light bulbs going rapidly in and out are so annoying!
The screenplay (co-authored, surprisingly, by Brett Easton Ellis himself) is completely unaware of itself, and so tiresomely arch and condescending that it feels, again, like a product of the 1980's rather than some kind of commentary of it.
American Psycho aside, if you want a to see Ellis' rather one-note universe rendered shrewdly on screen, you should really check out Roger Avary's severely underrated Rules Of Attraction.
If you a big fan of the author's body of work (his novels or their adaptations) you may as a completist make an extra effort to enjoy this but aside from two or three memorable moments, such as the conclusion, things are rather flat.
I have no idea how well this is gonna do at the box office, although Amber Heard's constant nudity will certainly catch some attention and give her lots of job offers (too bad her acting skills are still rather poor).
Foster and Raido seemed like actors "acting" like the types rather then being the types.
The plot dealing with mistaken identities and misunderstandings is simplistic and rather dumb.
Lee Dixon (a gawky, untalented amateur and rather obnoxious) appeared in only eight films and had his sole hit in creating the role of Will Parker in the original Broadway cast of R&H's OKLAHOMA!
Louise Fazenda is rather a hoot as Keeler's mentor, Jane Wyman has a bit as a snappy secretary, and Lorenz Hart's brother, Teddy, has a bit as a stage manager.
I thought it was a rather contrived, emotionless effort that didn't do much justice to the artist.
It has some very strong features such as the cinematography that captures the artsy feeling of Paris 1919 and, despite excesses, manages to create some visuals of hallucinations and the wild madness of painters painting canvasses; a rather complex peak into the lives of several of the more revolutionary artists of the time; and a substantial feeling for the interchange between artist and model.
The main problem with the film is a script that is banal, limited in historical validity, and concentrating on a single rather silly motif of a painters' competition.
What this film delivers is a rather annoying portrait of a young consumptive artist who drank and drugged himself to death at a moment in his career when renown was just beginning.
Destiny just practically copied everything from Seed, except doing them backwards, rather than the ZAFT steals EA's mobile suits at the beginning of the season, this time is the opposite...and ZAFT have shitty mobile suits this season, the only fights that are worth seeing is when Kira kicks ass with Gundam Freedom, and later on both Kira and Athrun kick ass with their Infinite Justice and Strike Freedom.
There's also a rather nice father-daughter dynamic going on, with Robin trying to shelter his daughter from the dangerous life he lives.
The clothes may be medieval, but the attitudes are rather modern, and in that sense this is a rather typical adventure film, that doesn't let historical accuracy get in the way of a good story.
During the 70's, at the height of the blaxploitation film era, the genre was completely plot-driven rather than character-driven.
This non-traditional narrative might bother many, as the film does seem rather disjoint.
This movie also has Sherman Hemslely in a rather large role so once I saw that flash on the screen, I knew the film would be kind of generic.
As it was, Disney settled for neither ending, leaving me rather frustrated - that is, only as frustrated as I get from watching a movie that didn't do a whole lot character-building-wise, or plot-wise for that matter.
It featured a capable rather than first-rate cast, who were condemned to struggle with those banes of British television: an inadequate budget and a melodramatic script.
The only innovations here are to make the gardener black rather than white and the husband gay rather than dead.
The best thing I can say about it is that the story flows rather well, probably due to good editing.
True, Rhys Meyers is rather less overdressed than Henry VIII typically was.
Apparently they would rather ignore the background and lie about the reign.
MAD DOG AND GLORY sums up with what's been wrong with Hollywood for many years - It tries and makes cross genre movies that appeal to everyone  Robert DeNiro plays Wayne Dobie a cop who's too affable for his own good and who'd rather be a photographer .
What he's a cop in a big city and after so many years it's just now struck him he'd rather be doing something else !
He's been rather unreliable these past few years, so I turned to the 'user comments' section of IMDb to find some sanity amongst my fellow amateur viewers...only to find many of them sick with the same malady.
About the only good thing I can say about this movie (and it is a stretch) is that there are parts that are so bad that the campiness of the scene or character sticks in one's mind... but unfortunately rather like a fish bone in one's throat!
i would rather watch teletubbies over this movie!
If you're a Jon Lovitz fan and want to see him do a halfway decent attempt at drama rather than his schmaltzy performance in this movie, I recommend Mr. Destiny.
Its rather predictable what would happen next.
As other reviewers have pointed out, this film is rather one-dimensional.
Secondly, although Malkovich's intensely colourful campness is a remarkable achievement, he stage centres in practically every scene and if you cannot fall completely in love with it, the effeminate preening eventually can look dated and rather irritating.
It's an ultra-low budget animation, so poorly drawn that it looks like a rough draft rather than a finished animation.
All I know is that she was beautiful to look at but rather vacant.
Most audience members will figure out rather quickly that this romance will not end well!
And if you're worried about violence and gore, you should be because it's just very nasty, disgusting, and mean-spirited rather than scary.
She's definitely attracted to him and the two seem to have a rather physically intense romantic relationship.
As you can see this is a rather unclever film.
It's a rather poorly directed moment that seriously bothered me.
The acting in the movie is rather humorous at moments.
A certain scene when the director and his assistant meet the man who wants to produce the movie is rather hysterical.
Considering how arrogant and unlikable he is, it isn't at all surprising that he's soon murdered--and in a rather clever way.
I once had a strange feeling to start watching star gate series but now I know... hope I didn't offend some of U that actually like this crap, but for the best of planet earth I rather take Ori as my leader than to see any star gate again.
They pretend that this is to educate people, but sadly what they portray are little people parents who would rather put their kids to work than support them.
I'd rather the controversy of devil/angel that kept it off TV for so many years to a musical number from Solid Gold.
Now, however, I would rather watch a reality show than this horrible attempt at a remake.
Perhaps it was so they could include the famous "I'm Mr. Heat/ Snow Miser" song, but this rare moment of energy in this movie is rather jarring considering that this is not otherwise a musical and the rest of the score is missing.
It's about time John Woo got back to making movies, rather than two-hour-long self-tributes.
By removing the "team" element that made the series so great it makes the whole thing look like James Bond rather than Mission Impossible.
The throat elastoplast that enables people to talk like other people including perfecting their accents (South African, Scottish, American)  And finally the car and motorcycle chases that seem to break the laws of physics rather than breaking the monotony of the plot.
(Trust me, buy the record rather than waiting around to hearit.
The desolate atmosphere - more a result of the setting itself, rather than of directorial competence - is about all it has going for it.
Toxic Zombies is a rather cheesy film made in a rural area of Pennsylvania, and this is a good place to grow pot?
The killer and his motives are like something out of a bad "Scary Movie" clone rather than something that is attempting to be a serious slasher film.
That was not a scene between two consenting adults, rather between a teenage girl and an adult woman.
The incredibly sensitive poet/teacher/photographer and soon to be lover of Annabelle has a rather disappointing love scene with her boyfriend.
It was a cold and rather mechanical scene filmed above the boyfriend while he is literally "pumping" the conflicted lesbian teacher with the fervor and passionate skill of a mongoose.
Whether this contributes to make this movie a masterpiece is rather questionable, however.
I was left rather annoyed by this pointless work.
Chevalier defamed Vermeer's wife and family by crafting very unflattering and rather unimaginative character from their memory: Vermeer is the stereotypical brooding artist,his wife a vicious, ill-tempered,mean spirited, and jealous bitch.
It is a potentially interesting story, but it goes south once one realizes that the film is infinitely more interested in utilizing Nell as some sort of wise-beyond-her-years E.T., who will ultimately bring everyone around her together, rather than examining the world from her perspective.
It did not attempt to be entertaining, whereas this pathetic sequel does, it tries to portray Henry as a slasher or a character rather than the simple, banal evil of the original film.
Neil Giuntoli was the rather unknown actor given the thankless task to play the `new' Henry Lee Lucas.
Mask of Sanity is a rather redundant sequel without any mentionable aspects.
The acting is okay while the tension level is rather weak.
Silence has filled the lounge room....  Of course, in hindsight I should have turned the video off, but like a train crash where the driver of the train turns out to be the conductor's pet poodle rather than a qualified individual, a certain fascination took place.
Riots, it ends up becoming totally unfocused and rather tedious.
It starts out as a drama that puts an emphasis on a rather unconvincing love story between Joe and Hush.
It then shifts to comedy (rather lame comedy that is) during the middle of the film.
The costuming was terrible--fake hair, mustache's and beards abound...I'm surprised that they didn't use elastic strings to keep them on rather than the standard spirit gum!
The script was full of illogical matters like this, which rather kept it from being all that funny to me.
If you want to watch this film, promise to let me know how you liked it because I would rather not have suffered alone.
Finally (and frankly, I rather enjoyed this part), the police were such a collection of insensitive oafs, that you'd rather depend upon Barney Fife, without Andy, to handle all law enforcement and investigation in your community.
I can't believe I wasted an hour of my life watching this film, rather than learning how dairy products are made and marketed.
You never get to care or find out any information but rather just watch Henry have this steamy little fling and then somehow learn from it and graduate.
Dave Prowse, these days relegated to autograph shows (his signature: "Dave Prowse IS Darth Vader"), plays the oddly sexual Frankenstein monster in this rather cheesy flick.
All the characters who were to be judged weren't nearly as likable or unlikable as they were in the remake (BETWEEN TWO WORLDS) and their final judgment seemed rather anticlimactic and dull.
Montagu Love overdoes his pompous business tycoon,but he never quite gets to the point of being unbearable--he is actually supposed to be rather aggravating.
I read the novel, or rather, I was forced into reading it, and I am only being honest when I say that the novel was not one of my favorites.
Talking of the budget, surely it could have stretched to at least a visit to the butcher's shop for some offal rather than one sparingly used bottle of ketchup to cover all the gore requirements.
I was looking forward to this movie a lot.I wanted to watch it with my grand daughters.I am glad I saw it first.I was so disappointed with it.I never got the connection with the horse and the girl,didn't work for me.I also wanted to see the big race?The one that saved the ranch?She said Flicka the horse came they opened the gate for them to run away?Whats with that?Now oh god shes missing get a search party.I would rather have seen Dekota fanning do the part this girl was a bit over weight for it.
So cue "mass evacuation" scenes where five extras run out of a door and are filmed from three angles, sets where the paint on the plywood is barely dry, and muffed lines that are simply accepted rather than reshot (must have been running out of those Hi-8 tapes).
So, I'm rather mystified as to what went wrong.
I found it rather depressing, even with the good ending.
That and many other strange lines populate this rather boring film that has all the tension and excitement of paint drying.
A rather bland young man turns down a country road and finds witches, killer grandmas, and walnut ranchers.
Wouldn't you really rather have an upgrade than the same old parts?
Rodney (Ewen McGregor, Big Fish)is a robot born (or built rather) to become an inventor.
In the beginning, the transition to the opening to the main plot is rather sketchy and is probably the most potential-wasting part after the ending.
It played out like a soap opera rather than a slasher film, and I had to listen to endless talking between the two girls about how one of them should leave her boyfriend and stand up for herself...etc.
Policemen and detectives do not need to take voice lessons to expedite their jobs effectively, therefore, putting music to police responsibilities seems rather purposeless!!
All astronauts will be armed with giant laser guns that do not actually burn through things very deeply, but rather just apply pressure to them, much like a child's "super soaker."
Space monsters of "the future" will live on asteroids rather than planets.
And the Jack and Joan characters, who seem to look like they can take care of themselves, are saved in every danger scene by a natural complexion rather than their own smarts.
Kathleen Turner looks like she'd rather be in bed than on the set.
This sequel is rather quite disappointing to me.
  The sequel to romancing the stone is rather disappointing.
I was prepared to write a rather lengthy review detailing all of my many problems with The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, but after reading what others have already written on IMDb, I'm not sure I see much of a reason.
Of course, there are many more ways to portray Thai country lifestyles than a bunch of unnecessary, pathetic jokes that only trigger your physical reaction from your stomach rather than your intellectual reaction from the brain.
_A Whisper in the Dark_ is never even remotely scary and is, ultimately, a very slow-moving and rather pointless movie.
until the crazed killer strikes again, rather than doing the logical thing, like trying to smash out a window, break down a locked door, or whatever is necessary to escape.
They also tend to stand around in shock and horror after every death while the killer makes a long, drawn-out speech about their sinful lives, letting him say his piece rather than simply rushing the guy and trying to kick his ass.
Some kid walks out of a lake, gets on a bus, and goes to Church, where we find a rather loud Priest doing his thing...  and I'm sure all of this has something to do with the six "sinners" the story now revolves around.
Or you'll hate or you'll love it, simple as that and I am quite afraid that I rather hate it.
Giving a scientific edge to a creature based in fantasy, this film proved to be a rather refreshing step in science fiction, which means it won't be a well received one.
Although, it can be quite drawn out and you can call the disappointing ending rather anti-climatic.
Joan Collins, at this point in her career, seems to have been rather more coy about nudity than she was to be a couple of years later in films like "The Stud" and "The Bitch").
Though this one did feature a rather funny performance by Steve Martin.
As it is, any scene without him is rather boring and lame.
There is pretty much one part of the movie that actually makes you laugh, rather than asking you to laugh as charity.
There's a special agent out there, this film tells us, who has mammoth breasts and can kill criminals rather effortlessly.
While I think Chesty's unfeasibly large breasts were somehow supposed to be titillating (excuse the pun), they're actually rather unfortunate.
The characters are portrayed as superficially and rather clichÃ©d.
All we get to find out about him is that he hasn't the slightest conscience of killing people (in fact the whole thing means very little to him) and he thinks he's rather funny.
If I'm going to watch realistic disfunctional people with real problems, I'd much rather watch Six Feet Under on HBO.
The directing is poor and the cinematography is rather bad.
Strangely enough, and despite the rather cheesy & tacky monster designs, the killings are pleasingly gruesome and blood-soaked.
The finale is effective as well, since the gargoyle meets his death in a rather nasty fashion.
This time around, the heroine discovers she's related to the Candyman rather than being a re-incarnation of his white lover; that said, Kelly Rowan is no substitute for Viriginia Madsen!
Being nothing more than a retread of Bernard Rose's Candyman, this is all rather a pointless exercise in gory effects and lifeless acting.
The "Power X" premise is a rather obvious reference to the Cold War arms race, but that was pretty typical of science fiction movies at the time; it's no more heavy-handed than "The Day the Earth Stood Still."
It's almost as if the director realised that the acting talent within the cast pool was utterly incapable of putting the rather tired storyline across, and threw it in as a necessary evil.
It is so unintentionally bad, that it compels you to keep watching, right up to the rather predictable and clichÃ©d ending.
There's your typical dark side in this epic schlock, but time starts to drag at scenes when you'd rather see the Herc bending iron bars across his skull.
watchable movie not really unless watch most of it in fast forward.The opening erotic lovemaking scene tells you already forget the sci-fi it's just coating for some rather strange actions that the main character played by Grieco does.He is a pretty boy for the women viewers and that's it For the guys you get to see a lot of Maryam D'abo's body[it's nice] and some of Natalie Radfords body[also nice]So i give it two stars just for the nice bodies on the female leads.If you are looking for plot,acting good script etc Stay Away.
Your loved ones would rather love you Super-Intensely for a period of months than love you In The Mainstream for a lifetime; your impending sickness and death will enable further heights of emotion, creating an unending spiral cycle of Intense Love for generations to come.
The multi-award winning play is based on Puccini's opera "La Boheme," but the film rather apparently seeks inspiration from the screen version of HAIR.
Like HAIR, RENT features a rambling plot that only provides an excuse for the songs; but unlike Milos Foreman's underrated classic, RENT is saddled with rather mundane music and cursed with lackluster staging.
Ground - breaking stuff it isn't.Lance Percival tries a bewildering range of accents before settling on a vaguely Scottish lilt but cannot compete with full - on nutter Ronald Fraser or frankly weird Ian Bannen in the "Barmy Jock" stakes.Our favourite cockney veers between Bob Hoskins and John Gielgud as the whim takes him.Denholm Elliot sweats far too much to make a convincing officer,"We have a place in Wiltshire" he tells Cliff Robertson who absorbs this nugget unblinkingly Robertson himslf changes from a man willing to resign his commission rather than go into combat to a gung - ho battle - hardened leader of men in the space of ten minutes.Whatever he's on they should have given the whole U.S. Army and the war would have been over by 1942.
A great work to demonstrate the importance of a cinematographic eye rather than a compositional one.
If Lenin had seen this movie he would have gone into investment banking, rather than waste more time espousing communism.
What utter rubbish, i'd sit through this film a hundred times rather than watch 'Batman & Robin' again for even five minutes.
It bored me, and while technically it was rather standard with some bottom of the barrel choices in wonky make-up FX (no really cheap Halloween masks) and clumsy special effects.
His mom has bad hair and his sister can't dance, yet they wonder why he'd rather hang out with his dead grandpa!
The worst thing about the movie is the rather uninspired acting.
This is the second feature length film from noted short film director and writer Roystan Tan and I think this may have worked better as a short film rather than being dragged out into a 90 minute film.
Whoever is behind this would do well to give it up, take a job in sales and hope to one day hit the heady heights of their own car parking space rather than director chair.
Cathy and hieroglyphs loveis more sexual in the film than in the book, and shows lust rather thanlove.
Unfortunately they weren't so bad as to inspire actual laughter, but rather only a disbelieving sidelong stare.
The writers would rather spend every other scene with one character or another mentioning that "15 Years" have passed...read the title , got it.
The villains are odd and rather comical...moreso than the usual DBZ type--this seems more like it was made as a Dragon Ball movie rather than a Dragon Ball Z movie.
But the boxy, phony-looking headpiece, with eyes Â Like two weak flashlight bulbs Â Shining out from under the black hood, makes him look more like something from a grade-school stage play, rather than a terrifying apparition.
The humour is based on clumsiness and stupidity rather than wit.
And I'm not a prepossessed Lohan basher - I enjoyed her performance (or, rather, performances) in the Parent Trap remake - but she is just completely irritating here.
Lindsay Lohan is, or more rather was, a pretty decent actress, and there's no doubt she was heading to the top.
As usual with films like this, there is little plot and the thin plot we do get is rather difficult to follow as most of the film is taken up by sex and torture sequences.
The editor Raymond Franvel (Pierre Taylou) and his rather sexy secretary Anne (Lina Romay) are involved in staging fake black masses and satanic rituals, it's a hobby I suppose.
When he gives a mean mug to the camera he looks like he's taking a dump rather than looking tough.
I'd rather watch Ice Cube in his old role in Anaconda than this movie!
Although Celestino's focus on obsessive behavior was clear, it still remains a rather typical story with typical outcomes.
I think the problem with it is that its rather a dull movie.
The only excitement i got from this movie was from watching the rather pert behind of Tamara "Sexy Eyes" Davies who has clearly been doing some Yoga.
"China Cry" therefore seems more like a Sunday school propaganda film, rather than a serious examination of how the Cultural Revolution destroyed many, many lives.
But the story settles for the tinsel of a fairy tale rather than their timeless truths, sometimes dark, that make the great ones memorable.
But rather than tempt, taunt, and twist, as Hubby is clearly born to do, he's rushed by the author's fantasy into surrendering to the Cowboy, who's wish for a fateful, fairy tale romance is at least granted in a fairy tale's traditional trickster manner.
Too bad this surrender to tinsel rather than truth slams the door on the potential dynamics for tragic tension, leaving a melodrama limply collapsed like the deflated bosom of a disheveled belle in a dim parlor, teasing her damp wrist with a letter opener.
This is the kind of stereotypical film which gay media should denounce for what it is: a bit of eye candy in the midst of an implausibly tragic and ridiculously predictable story, with bad actors (excruciatingly bad in most cases) in a screenplay that almost seams dreamed up by the Christian Right rather than the egregiously untalented (not to mention unattractive as a "leading man") Gregory Christian (producer, director, writer, and star).
This movie is a rather quaint combination of a very thin plot idea stretched way too far and the seldomly successful occurrence of the writer, the producer, the director and one of the main characters being the same person, in this case Gregory Christian.
The story was rather boring.
After a while, it is all rather tiresome and fails to satisfy as the best of the old Columbo series did.
They ignore the accepted notion of science not being about seeking the "facts" and experts to corroborate a pre-set conclusion, but rather investigating phenomena and forming conclusions upon observations.
Somehow they all thought there was artistic merit to the lifeless nature of their work; rather than an unintentional defacing and humiliation to Mr. Derrida.
There are some golden moments but they are few and far between and could easily have been summarized in a 15 minute documentary rather than a full feature that seems only to try to prove, by "deconstructing" the documentary process that it is virtually impossible to do a documentary because the subject is aware of the camera and then doesn't act completely naturally.
The '83 version changes the hero from composer to conductor-- and its his wife who's "stolen" from him rather than his music, and a critic's office rather than a print shop destroyed by fire.
Overall this is a rather cheezy and lame attempt at the story, with the usual attempts to rewrite and revise the story.
WAR OF THE ROBOTS is, for some reason, included with Mill Creek's "Chilling Classics" 50 movie boxed set, rather than the "SciFi Classics" (which makes more sense to me), so it is available fairly cheap.
ACTING: $ (Antonio Sabato looks like he'd rather be doing anything other than taking part in this film but he grins when the script calls for it and issues the insipid lines of dialogue when asked).
The music is also rather similar.
Because it is complicated and the movie take more than enough time to arrive at the rather obvious conclusion.
Her physical antics here seem especially strained and her tirades rather forced.
But I guess the selling point to this movie is more to do with the music of The Beatles rather than character interaction but the music featured here is of the band`s early stuff and I much prefer their later material  As a strange footnote last year Paul McCartney`s daughter Stella was married on the island of Bute where I live .
It is rather like playing Cluedo with one character, one room and the candlestick holder.
This sophisticated melodrama from a Noel Coward play is clearly unsuited to Hitchcock's particular talents: the initial court-room sequence is the best, allowing the director to experiment with camera technique (especially his creative use of the dissolve to jump from the present into the past and back again); the rest is a succession of clichÃ©d situations, making it a rather tedious whole.
Like MURDER SHE WROTE, this comes off as some insane idea that old people with white hair have the solution to all the murders that happen and can solve any crime with little or no evidence; but rather just by talking their way to a solution with nothing to substantiate the story.
The casting of La Marre as Jesus comes off as a shock tactic rather than something natural.
Prince of Darkness is a bad movie from John Carpenter.the whole thing is ridiculous.take the premise,for example.A priest has discovered a long hidden canister containing the liquid form of Satan himself,or rather his son.said canister had been hidden deep within the basement of an ancient church.upon discovering it,said priest decides to call upon physics Prof and students to investigate it.soon,the liquid ends up in most of the students(don't ask) turning then into mindless drones whose only purpose is to aid the son(said liquid)into freeing daddy aka Satan.Anyway,the whole thing is ludicrous even for sci-fi/fantasy/horror.there just isn't any point.Carpenter really misses the mark here.With all due respect to the late,great Donald Pleasence,what was he thinking?the only redeeming feature of this movie is that it is (marginally)less awful than "Slither" and "Lawnmower Man 2".
The acting was competent, although I doubt that Bakula's confused, rather passive protagonist could have sustained an entire series.
This is a hopeful, funny, moralistic and rather off beat movie.
But above all, the notorious SS Experiment Camp is, in the final analysis, a rather silly film.
While this film is only less than 75 minutes in length, the bodies begin to pile up rather quickly.
Presumable because most of them are about money, pure and simple, rather than an interest in saying or doing anything new with established characters.
Finally (and frankly, I rather enjoyed this part), the police were such a collection of insensitive oafs, that you'd rather depend upon Barney Fife, without Andy, to handle all law enforcement and investigation in your community.
A rather inoffensive monster indulges his rock-collecting hobby after being partially revitalized by said rocks.
This is basically a missed opportunity and a rather dull way to spend your time.
The biggest problem is the songs: unlike the original, they seem unnecessary, detracting rather than enhancing the film; every song they played, I was just waiting for it to finish.
Have root canal work done rather than wasting your time and money on this!
His role was almost comical rather than scary.
I had a funny feeling that this film was going to be rubbish, and rather unsurprisingly; I was absolutely right.
I'm a big fan of trashy B-horror flicks, but the only two reasons why I enjoyed "Snake People" were Boris Karloff, who plays a rather small role in this, and the movie's unintentional fun value.
The story is bereft of any new ideas and the phallic imagery is rather puerile.
Wait a sec.. occasionally we do get a sight of a rather loud moggy (SPOOKY!
The story is rather old yet this type of movie can still make for a good popcorn film.
It isn't artistic but rather commercial film-making.
Meredyth Holmes gets the most screen time and has one of those strange faces that looks gorgeous when framed by a hat and rather ordinary otherwise (maybe her horrible haircut and dye job).
The film started life as the 'Modern Story only' prior to 1916 which was then used as the basis to have the other two main and one rather sketchy story cut into it (the Jesus narrative is, to be honest, not a story but a series of excerpts from the life which support the other three stories at certain points).
It seems as though the filmmakers were too busy adding as many special effects shot and characters as possible from the videogame, rather than worrying about any type of story or character development.
I really wish that the producers of this stinker would have put a little bit more thought into the actual plot rather than just money into the special effects budget.
The lessons of the first film, which was actually rather good, seem to have been forgotten with great fight scenes, pumping music and a sense of humour curious only by their absence.
I'd rather sit through an entire season of "Days of our lives" than even touching MKA again.
In addition to that, the action scenes from Liu Kang were rather fake, in contrary to his action moves in Mortal Kombat.
Clearly nobody would go into this expecting much more, but the fact that this is pointless gets more annoying when you consider that it's also rather dull and none of the characters are interesting.
I liked the minimalistic directorial job and some scenes (particularly the end) were rather interesting, but all in all it's hard to believe this film is from the same director of "Bullit" because it lacks of nerve.
The scenes with the crooked sheriff were very cringe worthy, especially the part where he (rather fake) hits some guy with his (toy) Beretta.
This reminds me of the early scenes of the original Stargate film, where, right after being transported to the other side of the Universe, the soldiers accompanying the geek Egyptologist, have absolutely NO sense of wonder and amazement, but rather, they entertain themselves by throwing his research books at him.
I would rather watch an old man watching paint dry?
The famed British studio were noted for making expensive-looking Gothic Horrors with limited means; here, however, the low budget shows through as the futuristic sets they came up with are rather shoddy!
Albeit, even set in 1951 a bit late, one might think (rather than the original early thirties).
With the right handling, she would have been a truly immense star, rather than the pinup girl she was fated to be at the studio most famous for the three stooges.
Spinell, who was completely convincing as a deranged psycho in Maniac, fails to generate the fear this time, instead putting in a rather weak performance which sees him rapidly switching from 'threatening' to 'whimpering mummy's boy' in a rather laughable manner.
This sweet young thing in the likes of Jennie Garth is so obvious it would take an idiot or rather horny devil to figure her out.
And Christopher Plummer is fine as usual - though he is definitely not performing Shakespeare, but a rather aphasic, gum chewing and cheaply dressed police inspector.
Little or no tension is built up, too much time is spent early on showing in a rather dull way, how it spreads from fox to cat to fox to dog to human and so on, that soon the viewer will be asking what all the fuss is about.
The folks at Blue Underground should be thanked for a fine-looking DVD of a true Italian rarity; still, I'd be thanking them more had they supplied some subtitles rather than the lousy dubbing.
Yep, for some characters--some extras, especially the kids, seemed to be smiling with delight rather than wincing in terror, but hey, they are kids (the little girl who played Sofia was quite real, though.
This may have been an interesting idea on the drawing board but it has one big problem, the locusts just don't feel threatening.In classic films such as The Birds and The Swarm you feel threatened by the creatures but in this the locusts are more likely to induce a yawn rather than any sense of panic or terror.Half way through the feature the locusts turn carnivorous and this gave me the feeling that ideas had started to run out.
While I don't watch movies or shows that are appalling to me (thus explaining why I watched "Locusts" rather than "Desperate Housewives"), I am entertained by pictures that I find ridiculous.
I don't mean the major plot point, about the mars mission, but rather an accumulation of little details that just seemed totally unrealistic even though I was able to buy the overall idea of the movie.
It's rather silly, you can make up your own associations.
Although the film has a space-travel theme, it is not really a science-fiction movie, but rather a political thriller of the sort that became popular in post-Watergate America.
The film story is pretty weak, and rather silly.
Over the two generations since Rocket to the Moon was released, films of this genre have gradually changed their intended appeal by becoming primarily skinflicks rather than Sci-Fi thrillers.
Sorry I couldn't give it more than two points out of ten, but this is an absolute (rather than a relative) scale, it was definitely a masterpiece for the budget they had.
I'd rather have a root canal than sit through this self-serving love fest.
The ending comes about in a perfunctory manner and leaves you giggling rather than feeling introspective.
Perhaps the production company would have been better off coming to Rochester to film rather than go across Lake Ontario to Toronto.
The acting was pretty good (loved Margot Kidder's portrayal of Bobby's mother) though some of the characters were rather transparent.
But I would not recommend you go out and rent the film; rather, wait until it is on TV.
But I don't recommend it to you as a good film, but rather an awful one.
Hard to believe Bogdanovich directed this rather than some high school kids.
I look forward to someday seeing a film of that, rather than this simplistic media gossip version of what was important about it.
Beatty, short and rather stocky compared to the real thing, is laughable, as are Dean and Joan Collins, whose physical resemblance is so bad that the viewers would never know who they are supposed to be if they weren't addressed by their character's names.
Well, I make it short: Don't watch the German version of the movie... the people who did the dubbing should rather be doing other things in their sparetime.
What makes it rather strange is that some of them have knives and even hatchets!!
This film, with a few exceptions here and there, managed to make gang violence rather boring.
Chris Penn and James Russo bring credibility to their performances and come off rather likable.
As the latter, she whoops and hollers and runs around, but to me, this makes her seem like a hyperactive child (of either sex), rather than specifically *male*.
Hepburn's physical acting is also rather superficial - dainty steps as a female (almost a parody of a girl's movements), and galloping leaps as a male.
It's supposed to be a charming comedy based on a Damon Runyan story, but the plot is not only boring but rather disturbing, and it's hardly worth a chuckle.
It was like watching a grade school play with midgets in the place of children...I think this film would be more appealing and amusing with an all child cast rather than an all midget one.
Obviously he caught someone's eye to recommend casting him as the mayor of Munchkin Land in 1939's "Wizard of Oz", from there going on to a rather prodigious movie career.
Admittedly the dialog and much of its delivery is B movie tedious, yet examining other scripts and performances of the time we find that this is rather standard fare.
I will watch "The Terror of Tiny Town" rather than that audio-visual vomit, "Moulin Rouge!"
There is no plot per say, but rather a microcosm of people floating in a fish tank: it's a study of characters.
From this point I'd have preferred somebody stick a knitting needle into my eye rather than having to endure whatever the remaining 1-1/2 hours had in-store.
Anyway, "Ghost" is a rather long and predictable story about supernatural love and vengeance from the grave.
There is a special effects disaster in the film, a rousing car chase and many other interesting technical achievements; but I suggest that in this unusual achievement, these adult devices help to move the story along rather than detracting from it as is more usual.
I rather watch an episode about a ship full of cylons, at least they are interesting unlike the forced Apollo/Starbuck romantic tension*yawn*.
Director Tretta manages to evoke a certain sadistic & nasty tone throughout the film simply because of the subject matter rather than what actually ended up on screen.
Horror movies buffs will be very disappointed with this flick.It is never never frightening,and the derivative screenplay borrows from "the exorcist" "Rosemary's baby" "the tenant" "the omen" and more.The first scenes ,notably the moment when the young couple enters their brand new flat (complete with a fountain in the yard) where a man committed suicide directly comes from Ira Levin/Roman Polanski 's story.All in all it is rather a -very soft -erotic movie where Lisa B. tries her best to be at once sexually attractive and threatening.The lines are very vulgar and use the word "f...." a lot more than they should.Do not bother.
Her voiceover narrative is sub-par and rather grating.
There are better movies out there to watch rather than waste your time and money on this one.
Maybe a few simple people that are in love with George Clooney will enjoy it, but I'd rather watch repeated reruns of ER.
Having recently watched both earlier versions prior to watching this film I'm left wondering if it wouldn't have been easier to just make something up rather than pay royalties for a source that the filmmakers were going to ignore anyway.
Both the 1926 and 1959 films are constructed rather haphazardly.
As a sociologist I couldn't help noticing that "Juvenile Delinquency" rather suddenly disappeared from college curricula.
They actually look rather young to have been there at all considering the war ended a good 16-17 years before this movie was made?
The result is unnerving because the torture seems to be inflicted on real men rather than movie actors.
Only once has she ever been rather brilliant at that was in the safe hands of master director Robert Rodriguez in Sin City.
When Denzel is shot by a rather large caliber bullet, he begins losing blood fast.
Then, the film becomes a giant "everything but the kitchen sink" extravaganza, where every few minutes, the action (such as it is) is punctuated by rather random song, dance, ventriloquism or comedy numbers.
I have no idea why, as it's a rather bland and stupid kids movie that completely wastes the team's talents.
--but it certainly is one of the worst full-length film they made--and this includes most of their rather lame 1940s and 1950 film (the only ones that are worse than BABES are THE BIG NOISE and UTOPIA).
I was rather surprised at the 6.8 rating this movie has received thus far, and I hope that more positive reviews will come in order for the score to be bumped up to at least the mid 7's.
Oddly rated "pg" for some profanity and adult situations that seem rather at odds with the rest of the film.
Disappointed with the cards life has dealt to her, she is uptight about her job much to the consternation of her group who want only to have fun rather than an education on ancient Greece.
It is so ridiculous, so irrelevant to the actual problems of this country, it is a movie that I'd rather forget.
The hero then tries to bury the car with one load of dirt, that he shovels in by hand, rather than using the front loader that he has available.
Comments: A rather bad movie that actually is rather hard to put into a genre.
story in which it seems to be a sidebar item rather than the cause itself.
I would have rather seen Jason use the same weapon over and over if he did it creatively!
I would rather be decapitated by Jason than ever hear those words spoken in a film again.
Everything is rather dull when Jason isn't slashing and gashing his victims.
Coming along more out of curiosity rather than seriously considering a career in this line of work, Eddie has to step in for his malfunctioning buddy at a moment's notice with a busty blonde starlet (Rhonda Jo Petty leaning towards matronly), impressing the female director Carolyn (magnificent Lisa DeLeeuw, who tragically passed away from AIDS in 1993, once again proving her mettle as a sophisticated comedienne) who will become equal parts help and hindrance throughout his subsequent professional life.
I totally agree with Keith - the Beckinsale version is a total rape of one of my favorite books and I would much rather have seen a carefully made version where the actors speak Spanish and fit with the characters in the book.
The title of the film, UNCOVERED, does not really relate to Kate Beckinsale's juvenile form, but rather to the Flanders panel itself.
The images of the rotting carcass sliming out of the lake is pretty creepy and the low budget sort of works in the film's favor, allowing it to be a study in moods rather than the all out assault on taste and senses that it probably should have been.
I would rather watch paint dry than this drivel.
Probably one gripe is that the lizard will rather watch and roam about more so then cause mayhem.
Admittingly, the special effect of having a giant gila monster is rather weak.
It's difficult to get a fix on just how monstrous our title monster is in the early going, as frequent close ups of the creature merely reveal a rather normal lizard.
The painfully simple camera work and the far overused, and rather barren, apartment set make the film less than visually stunning.
The transfer to DVD is rather basic - no letterbox, a bit dark and very little in the way of special features - but despite disgust at the fact that the film hasn't been digitally remastered and given more than a bargain-basement DVD presentation, I love the film itself every bit as much as I did the first time I saw it.
The film wasn't as funny as it took itself, but I'd rather it was laughing at itself more than it took itself seriously.
Both Paltrow's Maude and Aaron Eckhart's Roland are barely cardboard cutouts rather than characters, and the actors do little to flesh them out.
While this might appeal to zombie fans(..and, from what I hear, this flick has quite a following), I thought it was rather poor with no real explanation as to why the dead would rise and behave in the fashion of George Romero's zombies eating flesh and innards.
There is essentially no acting in the movie except a rather mediocre performance coming from Susy Allen as the harried, booze-filled mother.
As the film begins, it features a rather low and depressed-looking Earl Bassett (Fred Ward), who, unlike his partner Valentine Mckee, didn't profit from the appearance of the giant worms, now known as graboids.
So being that sincere to reality why rather they didn't terminate (Callas Forever) itself already ???
It's the way people would like things to have been, rather than the way they actually were.
For example, we cut in one scene to the lead (Mimi Rogers') character's teenaged daughter sitting forlornly in front of her school, which -- despite its rather formidable-looking concrete and steel construction -- has just been torn to shreds by a not particularly strong tornado.
By that I do not mean a grim undertone to the story... but rather how literally dark the image was throughout.
But the entire film is a rather convoluted mess, mainly for the spliced in footage.
The other films preceding it had benefited from the energy of Sellers characterization (rather subtle one, by the way: people tend to forget that clumsy and arrogant as Clousseau was, he was a brilliant detective - listen to his conversation with Lajoy in a sequence from A SHOT IN THE DARK regarding the suspect Maria Gambrelli - we know Clousseau is in love with her, but he points out very sharply she had no motive for the murder she has been accused of).
I prefer to think it was made as a tribute to Before Sunrise, rather than a shallow copy, a way for the director to say "This is really inspired by Before Sunrise, I love it too!".
I never found myself at all interested in any of the characters as each of them were very two dimensional and rather bland.
The few times it considered it you would wish it had rather not.
So you are in this movie-rental place with a horror section that is just miles wide and furlongs in length, and you are, just imagine, scanning the rows for anything that catches your rather jaded (maybe from too many low-budget or low-brow horror flicks, too much mockery, or stilted dialogue, too many effects or musical stings) eye in that special way that only a truly mongoloid flick can do--and what do you see?
Sex is only the external layer of a relationship, and the most superficial of all, it hides rather than it represents what the man and the woman in the couple really are, and it takes special circumstances and dialog for the truth to pop out - this is the essence of the story that is being told.
Director Matias Bize succeeded to make an interesting and different film, I wonder if he will be able to avoid closing himself in the formula or format of experimental films and rather continue to follow the emotional dimension he brought to screen in 'En la cama'.
The original two Hellraiser films are absolute classics, and while I quite liked the boisterous third part - I'd really rather they stopped making sequels after Hellbound.
Counterintuitively, the movie dances around, rather than engages head-on, the issues of class and race in American society.
The challenge in accepting Sandler's performance is not his attempt to be taken seriously as Oscar-bait, but rather his apparently limited ability to convey the complexity underneath what seems to be the perfect man - understanding, compassionate (though too passive at key moments of conflict), a loving father.
However, It is more a satire on the people that make it rather then the people it is depicting.
The Foundation would soon come back after a terrible decision by Crush to take out the ref rather than Bret Hart who was pinning Smash - deliberate or rookie mistake?
Only the dueling mob bosses seem to be constant, the result is that they play more as cartons rather than real people.
As I said its not bad, its just that you end up watching it to see how the twists go rather than because you're engaged with the characters.
Still, the spectacle of a man so intent on suicide, and finding it surprisingly difficult, was rather interesting.
Moreover, Hooper's wise decision to keep the violence largely off-screen enhances rather than detracts from the film's alarming power to scare and disturb; this welcome and refreshing concession to the viewer's imagination ensures that the movie never deteriorates into a mindless and revolting bloodbath while still allowing the jolting outbursts of sudden brutal violence to retain their ability to startle the audience.
You could not even really classify it as "gore" because the repulsive part was more the idea of the murders rather than what was shown.
As a great fan of Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell's original graphic novel and an admirer of the Hughes Brothers, I had rather high hopes for "From Hell" when first I heard of its production.
Even late into the movie, as all her friends lay horribly slain, she still stubbornly sticks her nose in the air with these ideas rather than just taking the money offered to her (and at this point it should be quite obvious that it's not someone trying to get in her pants) and getting the hell out of dodge.
Sound effects during the murder scenes sounded like someone was dueling with a cutlass, rather than eviscerating someone.
Watch the movies in order, because rather than get better down the line, they get worse.
One pair of boobs just right for the little boys would be the idiot twin sons of the Countess who do a rather intriguing mirroring-each-other pantomime, getting out of bed and starting their morning ablutions.
Watching her shine so magnificently over the ordure that is the rest of it is rather amazing to see, and the fashion show in the last 15 minutes has some fun costumes.
While there is no denying that the film is really going for your funny bone rather than your jugular, much of the humour is hit and miss(mostly miss) akin to a nurse with poor eyesight trying to find a vein with a needle.
There is one scene with them doing a pantomime which I rather liked, but the story, the rest of the actors, the less than inspiring direction make this film a far more arduous thing to sit through.
That is - in cinematic terms, at least - someone who prefers to see people try and face up to their inadequacies, rather than perpetually running away from them...
I would rather pluck out my eyes with a wooden spoon than watch any more of this horrid, waste of time movie.
Brundel's law as it applies to werewolves is, there are no such thing as pacifist werewolves, or rather, any werewolf movie depicting them is a bomb.
We see some amazing direction followed by actors acting like real Joe schmoes reading from a script who display their pleasure with this grand country as if we don't have problems, because this propaganda would rather have us ignore the problems because it's much better to just watch this comedy and forget our misery.
The dialog (in subtitles) was rather bad.
In order to achieve that he's written a rather coarse story about an epidemic of sex-addiction somewhere in middle America, sort of a spicy version of the "Invasion of the Body snatchers".
None of the major plot points came organically from the characters, rather from coincidence.
A rather uninspired film about the relationship between Ryan (Freddie Prinze, Jr.) and Jennifer (Claire Forlani) who meet as children sitting beside each other on an airplane and develop an inseparable bond.
The Hansons are clearly trying to keep their careers going, despite being rather long in the tooth.
Man I would rather watch the other American Hockey travesties like the idiotic chimp plays hockey film "Most Valuable Primate" or even Emelio-chimp in "D2: The Mighty Ducks" (yuck!)
There was one scene of a riot which tried to make the rioters out to be heroes and the police out to be violent oppressors (rather than people doing a pretty fundamental and difficult job already without having a bunch of people throwing bricks at them)which didn't wash well with me, and the difficult issue of the workers taking a bunch of very expensive equipment was never really explored.
I'd a rather Napier played him since Napier's role was mainly at the beginning and then the end as the crazed cop.
This film is, in fact, not a comedy at all, but rather one of those light entertainment films which is classified as a comedy simply because it's not a drama.
Most directors of today's Hollywood are too scared of the censors or go too far and make the audience gag rather than scream.
Or if the director wanted to kill Batman with a whimper rather than a bang, he succeeded.
I would rather watch paint dry than to watch this movie again.
But I wonder what it would've been considered if released back when it was written; Just as poor or rather interesting?
I bet even John & Janet were rather embarrassed by this one.
It's not really their fault because they actually work well as a team but the director, John Landis felt that it was more interesting to dwell on the rather tired plot about the possibility of nuclear holocaust which is played out too long at the end of this otherwise amusing comedy.
John Landis combines with funny men Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd to bring us a rather silly film about two misfit secret service men who are assigned a very dangerous mission.
Too bad...I'd much rather see midgets or really immature adults play such roles, as at least they have the ability to say yes or no about a career in films or TV!
There's really nothing wrong with this (the INDIANA JONES films and Disney's own BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS had also served up Nazis for a family audience); the problem here is that, unlike in other films, here Nazism seems more like a spice rather than an essential ingredient.
From the moment the guest appears on stage it is absolutely clear he will either   a) make an ass out of himself b) be ridiculed by the audience c) will receive faked sympathy and compassion by Mr Povich  or rather all of the above.
We join our heroes, the Navy Seals as they pursue some rather naughty terrorists to a lush volcanic island in the middle of nowhere.
The ending stinks   the actors stink  i would rather eat my own vomit then watch this movie again.
The result is a Twilight Zone style anthology that aims to please those who can't get enough of Japanese ghost films, but unfortunately it fails due to rather cheap production values, poor effects and a lack of genuine scares.
A couple of creepy moments and some rather fun dodgy CGI make this tale just about watchable.
Honestly I would have rather watched Step Mom.
The history is contrived; the family is pathetic; the Old Ones are rather useless; it's fortunate for Will that the enemy is inclined more to drama than to action.
Will is driven by self-pity and only gets interested in the battle when he finds he has real power -- and then he becomes a rather self-righteous little jerk.
He doesn't so much "seek" these things out, rather he stumbles upon them.
It's odd to think that The Seeker is more comfortable dealing with the ordinary rather than the extraordinary.
There were about 3 things about Susan Cooper's magnificent book that were preserved in this movie: a couple of names (but certainly not all of them--where was the difficulty in letting his father be named "Roger" rather than changing it to "John"??
wong came off too mellow for what i took to be a rather intense corporate hacker.
There's little effort from the production to create any suspense at all...  2) Because although some of the technical aspects are rather accurate (the Dumpster Diving and all the Social Engineering) , most of them are truly absurd.
It starts on well,have some very spectacular visuals of Africa,but it disintegrates,disorients thereafter.Its very good example how you neglect most vital part(rather say it soul)of movie that is SCRIPT and ends up most boring movie ever made.Storyline simple,leave it nothing to say more about it.I usually watch horror flick for special effect ,but it is not the case here.It seems director avoids such situation where special effect needed,if its there though very few which looks really primitive as compared to other Hollywood movies.I think it could have been better,overall its bad in all aspects except photography.
It actually starts off quite well and shows promise, but when the movie more-or-less forgets about one of it's main stars - The Crocodile - it slips into a boring movie about a group of people being attacked by angry African soldiers rather than being a movie about a group of people being killed off by a big nasty croc.
Except for Jack Elam in one of his very first screen roles; he actually was a rather good looking guy back then.
Id rather see THAT than this pile of trash.
As the movie wore on I began to accept the idea that the story was rather different from the original.
Jas was NOTHING like I imagined to be; a rather blank girl with an obsession with her fringe and the environment.
I'd rather read the book.
There is significantly less humour in this outing, as the parents that delivered most of it last time round have been dropped, but one thing I did find rather amusing was the way that the film used the wolf that wants to mate with Brigitte: probably a commentary on hormonal young men.
What sets this film apart from many modern day horror films of this nature is that it's story driven, and rather restrained in the gore department.
In short, boring, corny and generally you'd just rather go to sleep than watch it.
But I was impressed with Johnny Lever's comedy rather than Paresh Rawal.
The chemistry between Greenwood and Gilbert is nonexistent and their love scenes seem rather contrived.
I rather enjoyed this pilot episode of this proposed "Doctor Who" spinoff series.
His character is more appropriate for an episode of Batman rather than late eighties horror.
Findlay simply doesn't possess the fundamental skill set necessary to make a decent non-porn movie, her usual objective being to capture a juicy extreme close-up rather than to present a coherent story or obtain credible (non-sexual) performances from her actors (not that anyone from her dreadful cast looks capable of such an undertaking).
Things really aren't explained too well and there are a few red herrings along the way which really do more to hinder the plot rather than help it.
Meanwhile, a strange handyman is given a list and the next thing you know he is attacking a woman and her lover who is a rather clumsy kick boxer.
The only major highlights of this movie were the underlining suspense throughout the movie, the top-notch animation of the puppets, and a rather nice surprise presence from Emily Harrison, who plays Jane carried my interest somewhat.
Dr. Magrew show's Robert various living puppets made by puppeteer Andre Toulon that he brought in an auction some years previous & ask's Robert to carve the perfect puppet which Magrew hopes to inject with life & recreate Toulon's success...  Curse of the Puppet Master was the fifth sequel to the rather splendid killer puppet flick Puppetmaster (1989) & apparently had the working title Puppet Master 6: The Curse but by this stage it was probably a wise decision to stop numbering them & thus try to fool a few unsuspecting buyers.
Maybe something does happen in the final 4 minutes or so that redeems the rest of the movie, but I rather doubt it and am willing to risk the loss, because like the movie itself, I just don't care.
The climax is also rather nonsensical.
The focus is on the most exploitative, gut-wrenching images rather than on true analysis, and the director doesn't have the insight to conduct a truly incisive interview.
Director Jason Kohn has no interest in exploring or understanding the issues the film purports to examine, rather pandering to the audience by prodding his subjects to tell their most shocking stories and judging them immediately after.
Gary, a rather bad dime-store romance novelist, soon after watching a sensationalist tabloid news show about the recent rash of people that have been dying in their sleep, is worried about his girlfriend who is having trouble sleeping (he's an insomniac himself) So when his war veteran neighbor tells him about the Sandman he's frightened (not by the vet's story, more his demeanor) add to this the fact that Gary's worthless leech of a cousin has just moved in to his trailer.
The filler being so very bad (time spent on Gary's 'kooky' neighbors and a rather idiotic talk show being the chief offenders) To further compound my misery there wasn't any gore, nor nudity to attempt to liven the preceding up.
These days it's rather exceptional to see children and/or young teenagers getting killed in horror, so "Dark Ride" started promising to say the least.
Film School Project is actually being rather kind.
molly parker was rather weak and her character was thin - i didn't think the motivating force for her actions was adequate.
I really hope that people read The Mists of Avalon (the film couldn't hold the story since it was Hollywood- produced, rather than British) to counteract the bizarre way the stories of Merlin, Arthur, Guinevere, Morgan and the gang are drawn in over-simplified black and white in this 2-part film.
I'd much rather be stung by a thousand dung beetles (do those critters sting?)
The story begins somewhere in India, wanders over to somewhere in Australia and finally ends up rather ignominiously somewhere in the Australian outback (ugh) and is replete with such themes as the search for enlightenment, muscle-bound idiots, antlers on speeding cars, Old vs. Young, Man vs. Woman, Tom Cruise and Matt Damon-inspired adultery, attempted rape, battery and, get this, self-urination!
No more than most of us, and probably less rather than more.
Her reactions are those of a dime novel heroine rather than a real life person.
New York artist Joan Crawford, living in a rather elaborate 'hovel', marries ex-soldier and widower Henry Fonda as a response to lover Dana Andrews constantly putting his wife, children, and business before her.
This movie is rather unknown (only 85 vote on IMDb at the moment) and it should stay unknown.
The story is not really good and doesn't always flow or makes sense and is filled with some rather big plot-holes.
For me, they are both rather disappointing.
In a matter of thirty minutes of screen time he has packed up, traveled to Wyoming, broken past blocked off roads, found a new romantic interest, and by the end...well...let's just say that the conclusion is rather shameful on Spielberg's behalf.
Man, IÂ´d rather watch an episode of "Baywatch" than this kind of crap.
Ken leung is rather pathetic, he manages to "score" white chicks with stupid lines and then gets to act all superior towards them.
Hayden is rather irritating at times and obviously retarded cause she picks up bored looking Chinese men from a bus.Then tries desperately to act like a 16 yr old, with her weird antics.
Some films are so bad that they actually end up being very entertaining; For Y'ur Height Only, however, strives to illicit laughs by deliberately being dreadful, but actually ends up being rather boring.
The truth is known to only two others, the town's beloved Reverand Dimmesdale (Hardie Albright) who happens to be in reality secretly the child's father and Hester's returned husband Dr. Roger Chillingworth (Henry B. Walthall), who assumes that identity rather than be shamed by a cheating wife.
Having said that, it's rather bland and unemotional at times (which, admittedly, fits the stereotype of an early Puritan community) although in the few scenes in which there is emotion (I think particularly of the closing scene with Dimmesdale's public confession) that emotion is well portrayed.
The funniest part of this movie is, that I would rather watch this, over Brosnan in "Die Another Day" (2002).
It appears to be a comedy at first glance but that is rather deceiving.
The pace is slow, the film focuses on domestic drama rather than dramatic incident, there's nothing new here & the final twist is insultingly poor.
Yes, the story was ( better ) told rather 30 years ago, "Airport 75".
I am not a fan of Master P's music or movies, but I would rather sit through one of his CD's for an hour than be forced to watch his cinematic exploits.
It comes off like a comic book superpower, rather than an unmanageable affliction.
And of course, Laughlin's smug self-assurance that we'll agree with our heroes and their noxious political viewpoint is rather off-putting as well, but he gets around that problem - sort of.
The book had a rather realistic ending, not everything was sunshine and smiles.
Besides being rather short and less-than-satisfying in its plot resolution, my primary complaint about this film is the horrid transfer on the Region 3 DVD which is quite good for the daylight scenes, but irritatingly pixelated during the low-light and night shots.
No, I'm not talking about what I paid to rent this loser, but rather what they obviously spent to make it.
Personally, I'd rather watch something like "The Craft" or something with a bit of life in it.
A better film than "Zombiez" and "Dead Heist," "Gangs of the Dead" is still a rather pedestrian urban horror flick that thinks racial stereotypes and bad dialog are better than actually giving the viewer anything good as far as horror is concerned.
i know, even the original "Frankenstein" film wasn't close to the book at all, but at least it was done stylistically well and was merely "based" on the book rather than being touted as "the closest adaptation" of the book like this one was.
There are many scenes in this movie that are way too explosive, way too loud, and way too graphic to satisfy us such as this rather bloody and fast-moving stillbirth scene early in the picture that did not serve any real purpose in the story than just to give us something to look at.
The one thing where Fist of the North Star gains a few points is it's production values & design, it's actually rather impressive.
Take Malcolm McDowell who dies quickly, rather like the plot of this film.
A popular figure in this kind of DTV potboiler, Daniels was clearly hired for his fighting skills rather than his acting, and he's upstaged throughout by many of his co-stars (including Chris Penn, Melvin Van Peebles and Malcolm McDowell).
It was my idea during the initial pre-production of this film to focus one on interesting developed story rather than four under developed ones, but as the original idea of a group project was hijacked by three egomaniacs, group input ceased.
Safety, of course, should be regularly emphasized in dangerous industrial environments, but this message appears to be rather one-sided and heavy-handed.
The burnished cinematography by Peter Biziou and fine supporting performances from Colin Firth (in his debut) and Cary Elwes do help, yet I found this picture extremely cold and rather indifferently-made.
The humor is all slapstick-so Much slapstick-that I found annoying rather then funny.
wouldn't he rather see their anguish?
Unfortunately no one had the nerve to tell him it was a small role and he gives us his usual "lovable" foreign schmuck stereotype,shouting and waving his arms.His comical misuse of the word "Pussy" should have you rolling in the aisle.It has Tom Arnold in a rather bigger role.He too spends most of his time shouting and waving his arms in between "hilarious" attempts to kiss Hugh Grant.It also has Joan Cusack,a sort of madonna (with a small "m") figure worshipped for her fecundity.She too is very loud,her screams in labour are truly terrifying.And then there is Julianne Moore wafting through the movie half - heartedly,looking as though her mind is really on where she left her car keys.She is so disinterested she can barely be bothered to look at Hugh Grant,which is a sentiment I can at least have a certain sympathy for.
Why is "I don't want to be a parent" seen as a character flaw to be overcome, rather than a personal insight to be trusted?
My personal guess: no, and if they were, I'd rather not know about what.
HAUNTS is an almost forgotten film that would be better billed as a psychological thriller rather than a horror movie.
I only gave it a 2 rather than a 1 because I watched it all the way through.
Like life, it does not have a neat, tidy happy ending but rather leaves you with too many disturbing questions of an extremely disturbing story.
He does have a good presence as an action hero (very Steven Seagal) but sadly he is not enough to stop this dreary sequel from emerging as a sad re-hash of the last one, complete with inconsistent villains and a rather surprising lack of action.
Affleck was horrible and i mean just horrible in this movie, the jokes he told were supposed to be funny but were not and were rather lame, The scenes which were supposed to be touching and emotional were just plain re***ded.
GOODBYE, NORMA JEAN is a rather sad and pathetic excuse for a film.
All the Lord of the Rings New Zealand jokes were rather lame and I don't think Return of the King deserved to win all of those; it just did a clean sweep because it's a well-made, huge-budgeted and fantastically-promoted blockbuster.
Instead of dinosaurs all we get is a rather uninspiring crocodile and an even more uninspiring bird which wants to kill Littlefoot and company for reasons best known to itself.
)Also of note are the episodes when Pastorelli has a heart attack (or rather his Fritz does), which is not in the U.K. series, the U.S. version of Fritz talking to his dad, and the final episode where Robbie Coltrane stars as a Hollywood star.
The poor attention to the editing, again by Leigh Scott, has given The BeastÂmore plot holes than Emmental cheese, we are left scratching our heads and left feeling the efforts are rather curdled in the process and that this could, if at best, have been a half decent movie.
In emphasizing the personal story of the imperial couple, the director neglected the epic grandeur of the tale and period to the point that the result resembles a claustrophobic stage play full of talking heads rather than a real movie that shows EVERYTHING that happens in the story=thousands of soldiers, thousands of civilians, the endless landscapes of Russia, etc.
Then she rises up magically and levitates down the hall, finally getting hurled violently down a flight of steps (or rather, her blatantly obvious MALE stunt double does!)
Currently there seem to be two schools of drama; both rather irritating: In one, focus on characters is maximized but events are somehow super-heightened as to be unreal.
In this movie, when the burning man jumps off a quay into the water, the scene is shot in a manner that emphasises the danger he's in, rather than playing for comedy.
That the show is probably a fake doesn't make it any better, rather worse.
The blood flows in bucketfuls here and rather than bite its victims, the creature tears open their throat like a werewolf or a latter-day zombie would!
The action was subordinate to the plot rather than the reverse as is the case in all too many martial arts films.
Would actually rather have seen a 44th rerun of an old "Dave Chapelle Show" than to be subjected to this.
She'd rather live in Cleveland, just so long as she's with her man.
Paltrow plays an aspiring air hostess with ambitions to travel the world,rather than just domestically in the US,but is torn between love for her boyfriend back home (Ruffalo) and eventually goes back to him.And,er,that's it.A story so paper thin and obvious that it seems to have been written by an inexperienced,first time hack (as indeed it apparently was),with forced and shallow comic situations,dialogue and characterisations.Some surface attractiveness and slickness do not detract from it's persistent banality and lack of depth,and events did conspire against VIEW FROM THE TOP from the start.Filmed in 2001,it's original release was held back (due to the events on 9/11) until two years later,by which time it flopped rather dismally.
Myers raises a few smiles as a lazy-eyed air crew trainer,but it is still baffling how this eclectic cast felt there was any mileage from a minor potboiler such as this,especially Oscar winner Paltrow (who has since described the film as 'terrible' in a subsequent UK newspaper interview).Gwynnie is a fine actress,and has ability in light comedy (as proved by her AA triumph in 'Shakespeare IN LOVE'),but she can do little with the feeble,uninspiring part she has taken on here (though she does look lovely in the numerous,if rather tacky outfits she wears),as is the case with other cast members such as Ruffalo and Applegate.There are also some rather pointless cameos from Rob Lowe and George Kennedy (recalling his Joe Patrone character from the AIRPORT series,which are actually rather funnier than this film),and the short running time (around 80 minutes) also indicates that much re-cutting and deletion took place beforehand (it sadly didn't improve the quality).
Sorry for me being so negative but i seriously suggest that no one put themselves through the 2 hrs of this movie because i would rather stare at my ceiling than watch that film.
And then they followed it up with a sequel, Urban Legends 2 : Final Cut which was absolutely awful but rather amusing at the same time, mainly due to the superb Loretta Devine who is always worth watching.
Crappy computer effects, rather dull story, and silly supernatural antics undermine an ambitious idea.
This film has a rather weak heroine/protagonist and the film really isn't all that spooky.
The acting is well... meh, the characters are rather dull, but over all the movie's not a waste of time.
the ubiquitous bad guy in the group (and the group keeps growing/shrinking mysteriously with no explanation) murders one of the girls in cold blood, and the good guys, in revenge, rather than killing badguy outright, decide to punish him by sending him to the zombies.
Still, it does advance the story line and continues the plot of the original film rather well.
Yes, I would have to say all these movies would be more aptly titled teenagers of the corn rather than children, though I can guess they do it so they do not traumatize a really young kid.
First off, I thought this Children of the Corn film was better than the first for a few reasons, the major one being this was rather funny (unintentionally of course).
Seriously... if you have "Mein Kampf" or the communist manifesto - sit down and go through them rather then wasting time on this movie!!!
There are moments that you can see are Pythonesque , and that is more down to the fact that Michael Palin stars rather than the script but over all this film is just...well..Dull.
Still I had rather low expectations.
Although this villain is pretty mean as it should have, he's too bloody serious and cold-hearted, you'll hate him rather than like him for being mean.
Why are all the Delta Force soldiers or D-Boys dressed entirely in black, rather than in fatigues.
Yep, for some characters--some extras, especially the kids, seemed to be smiling with delight rather than wincing in terror, but hey, they are kids (the little girl who played Sofia was quite real, though.
McKenna's disembowelment is rather fun, but most of the splatter FX are the everyday `garden shears through the back of the head' type of thing.
The acting is rather good for a film of its type, the deaths rather gory for an R-rated film, and enough T&A to keep the peanut gallery interested.
The ending has a good twist that will surprise most viewers, but die hard film fans like myself will probably guess the killer's identity 1/4 the way into the movie (once you know it, is becomes rather obvious).
Unfortunately, the talents of Howard Keel and Kathryn Grayson tend to burn rather than smolder as the plot develops.
Better not to have included any women in this outing rather than settle for such unworthy additions.
The music sounded rather chipper for scenes that seemed dark and a plot that is haunting.
While some of their offerings are rare and hard to find, their DVDs are rather consistently of dubious quality and are rarely, if ever, restored.
As others who've seen this film have mentioned, 'The Eyes of the Mummy' is not a horror film involving any mummies; rather, it's an insipid melodramatic tragedy.
In 1995, Sam Raimi had become known as the director of a rather quirky and original horror film that, in spite of being shot full frame with terrible actors, displayed a talent for composition not seen in some time.
However, he had also given himself a rather large black mark in the form of an attempt to be "cool" with a horror-comedy where violence has no visible consequences, and everyone speaks like a reject from a teen soap opera.
I was particularly unconvinced by Sabine Timoteo's performance, whose talent restricted her to screaming rather than actual crying.
If they'd gone for the psychological horror angle rather than the gore angle this could have been a good low budget horror movie rather than a horror movie with really low budget crap gore special effects.
Buck is unaware of what is to happen when his friends take him to the bank and he finds out that maybe he'd rather just go to jail then be with these blood suckers.
I'd rather just stick with the original and I suggest you do the same.
The latter referring to a fastly closing comet as if the character already saw the episodes of this series and suspected it may not be a comet at all but rather an extra-terrestrial 'Ball of Light' made by a wannabe CGI-expert who normally does the catering.
To my opinion, the whole production of the movie is bad as the storyline loses thread and a viewer is thus left confused and rather disturb.
Introducing some very thought provoking themes and ideas about the boundaries of science and human power, it shows a rather creative way in which nature can punish us for our own idiocy.
The Alan Moore/"From Hell" comparisons are totally unjustified, except in the rather simplistic thinks-it's-much-clever-than-it-is ending.
This may have been an interesting idea on the drawing board but it has one big problem, the locusts just don't feel threatening.In classic films such as The Birds and The Swarm you feel threatened by the creatures but in this the locusts are more likely to induce a yawn rather than any sense of panic or terror.Half way through the feature the locusts turn carnivorous and this gave me the feeling that ideas had started to run out.
The only major highlights of this movie were the underlining suspense throughout the movie, the top-notch animation of the puppets, and a rather nice surprise presence from Emily Harrison, who plays Jane carried my interest somewhat.
Dr. Magrew show's Robert various living puppets made by puppeteer Andre Toulon that he brought in an auction some years previous & ask's Robert to carve the perfect puppet which Magrew hopes to inject with life & recreate Toulon's success...  Curse of the Puppet Master was the fifth sequel to the rather splendid killer puppet flick Puppetmaster (1989) & apparently had the working title Puppet Master 6: The Curse but by this stage it was probably a wise decision to stop numbering them & thus try to fool a few unsuspecting buyers.
While I don't watch movies or shows that are appalling to me (thus explaining why I watched "Locusts" rather than "Desperate Housewives"), I am entertained by pictures that I find ridiculous.
I thought the entire plot was rather implausible; plausibility isn't a requirement for a movie, but this movie is implausible for no good reason.
This surprisingly primitive 'streamliner' comedy from the Roach Studios -- with the collapse of the comedy short subject market in the mid-thirties, Hal Roach decided to go into feature production, first with films like the TOPPER series and later with second features that timed in at less than an hour -- contains all the standard cheap comedy motifs, including a Murphy Bed -- and runs through them in a rather mechanical fashion as made-it-from-scratch taxi fleet owners William Bendix and Joe Sawyer get tangled up with a girl who tries to kill herself and declares herself their responsibility.
Very little was slowly revealed but rather just bluntly stated.
This movie about a guy who moves into an apartment where he slowly gets murderous after a dinner of rather potent 'wine' and 'yogurt' starts off extremely slow and will leave you searching for the remote, but about a half hour in it gets slightly interesting.
and where the ending is rather disappointing.
Unlike most movies of the time (including the vastly overrated Godfather), director Bob Fosse does not keep the action entirely linear; rather event A will happen in scene 1, you then have scene 2 dealing with an unrelated issue, then the consequence of event A will be played out in scene 3.
This lets the viewer draw his own connections, rather than having everything spoon-fed by the moviemaker.
Nicole Fugere was bearable, but she rarely uttered a word, and her stare felt rather unpleasant.
This is the premise for Addams Family Reunion, a rather sorry entry in the Addams Family legacy.
Gomez is terribly out of character and is rather more like a prim English butler in a Gomez suit than Gomez Addams.
This movie was an embarrassment to anything related to the "Addams Family"  Tim Curry appears to have been pressed into a bad Raul Julia impersonation, rather than allowed to find his own style, Darryl Hannah and and the rest just don't seem to have been given anything to work with.
As an episode it's rather predictable with the 'hero' saving the day in stupid fashion during the lacklustre ending & a story that is very linear & a bit clichÃ©d.
But that energy fizzles out very quickly and what we are left with is a rather bad movie.
And then we go back in time, back to the beginning, to see how these two ill-fated lovers met and what brought them to the rather unfortunate situation we have just seen.
When Pam discovers what he is doing she is rather excited and suddenly much more enamored with her husband than she had been.
The seemingly endless confrontations and arguments between Chris and Pam become rather monotonous after a while.
As it is it's a rather tedious movie.
None of the sequels really offered anything that the original didn't and thus they became rather boring movies.
The plot leaves a lot to be desired and the characters all seem rather wooden and unrealistic.
Michael York took the role of the rather naive young man who while renting a room, falls in with Liza Minnelli and her hedonistic lifestyle.
20 mins into the movie and Pumpkinhead is created not this time by the witch but rather by some "thrill seeking teenagers" and I actually believe the group labels themselves as "thrill seekers" before they resurrect Mr.
Aside from the rather annoying "Money Makes the World Go Around" and "Cabaret", most people would have a hard time remembering the songs that play such a prominent role in the film.
Overall, the only true highlights in this sorry excuse for a film are the few short scenes of a rather luscious-looking Solei Moon-Frye (from "Punky Brewster" fame) in a small supporting role as an occult obsessed teen, and an admittedly creepy atmosphere which seems to mysteriously dissipate altogether after the first half-hour passes.
Although the academy is notorious for decisions based on emotions rather than merit, in this instance, I consider the splitting of best direction and best picture Oscars between the 2 films as a just outcome.
Directed by Jeff Burr I have little fondness for Pumpkinhead II: Blood Wings either as a sequel to the rather good original Pumpkinhead (1989) or a stand alone horror film in it's own right.
This is a rather late straight-to-video sequel to the Stan Winston movie "Pumpkinhead" from 1988, that wasn't even a big commercial success in the first place.
It's still a rather good looking movie.
Dennis Hooper gives some life to this film with his so-of-him and characteristic acting (the one he has been giving us every since "Texas Chainsaw Massacre II") but it makes it seem rather funny than scary or thrilling at some points.
i would rather go and clean the toilet than sit thru it again.
on second thoughts i'd rather come and clean your toilet and i don't like clieaning toilets and don't know you.
I'd rather listen to Jonas Brothers than have to watch an episode of this ever again.
I think many who think this show is some sort of misunderstood artistic masterpiece are just reading way too much into it, and it's the product of their own imaginations rather than any brilliance on the part of Tim and Eric.
They started with Tom Goes to the Mayor, which, honestly, was rather funny.
I wasn't watching a movie so much as a dramatized argument for the modern; there aren't people on the screen rather they are ideas.
The character of Daniel Pearl comes across as rather unlikable.
Instead it became a pointless sequence of rather boring events.
Cook's style was that of VAUDEVILLE, where a rather overbearing character is the center of attraction and supposedly well liked.
Maybe this would have worked better as individual shorts, shown over a duration of weeks "Jim Jarmusch Presents", rather than as a complete collection.
There were several shorts that revolved around (you guessed it) coffee and  cigarettes, with rather awkward encounters between cafe dwellers.
Watch CYBORG or BLOODSPORT if you want the real thing - and if you've already seen them - do it again rather than watching this uninspired one.
The first film was weak enough, but to top it with this splattering of childish and irrelevent plot, characters and emotions, not to mention the rather stupid special effects, I found myself wondering why I had even bothered.
The only saving grace in the film was that the stunts were performed by Kane Hodder, who played 'Jason' in several of the "Friday the 13th" films, but even that is just a point of interest rather than an extra star to the film.
Generally speaking House II: The Second Story was a bit of a waste of time as far as I'm concerned but it moves along nicely, it tries to be a little bit different & provided me with at least some entertainment, it was just a shame that the film ended up all rather pedestrian, tame & somewhat dull.
Not really my cup of tea at all, I think I'll stick with the original House (1986) rather than opt for a move...
The first part of the movie is rather good - grey sweeping footage over suburbia accompanied by monotone instrumental music sets the mood effectively.
Even Keith David, a talented character actor who almost always seems to pick lousy roles, couldn't do much even with the rather limited time he's on screen.
As should the performers, rather than trying to suppress them.
Predictable and rather poorly shot, even if there was a low budget.
I was expecting something bad after realizing I'd been ripped off and had spent 5 bucks on "Campfire Stories" rather than "Campfire Tales" (a good anthology horror film).
Being a rather cheap copy of Lars von Trier's original i found this mini series annoying after the first few minutes.
While for Stephen King this may be rather good, i find it just a disgrace when you compare it to the original.
But as I said earlier the worst part of this deal is not the quality itself rather than the abandoned promises... Looks like they promised us the stars but left us dangling in the gutter, instead.
But this...I would rather bathe in the waste product of all of New York then stand for this mini-series a second more.
No - rather it smelled of taking an eraser to the script and aimlessly wiping out huge elements.
As it is, it's rather a painful experience except for those who really enjoy cheesy SF movies, and there seem to be legions of those.
It was clearly done on a budget, with characters talking about what was going on rather than showing us things going on.
If you have food to feed humans, you would eat it yourself, rather than loose calories.
If the intent of the movie is to make me feel what the characters are feeling, it is extremely well executed, I felt gray, lonely, cold, and like i wanted to kill myself rather than continue on to the end of the movie, but like them, i suffered through...
He's clearly got some kind of a performance on his mind, the problem is that it comes off rather bizarre and not really watchable.
Unfortunately, despite sounding like a gore-hound's dream-come-true, The Redsin Tower is actually a rather disappointing film that suffers badly from an uneventful beginning (a good 40 minutes pass before anything really interesting happens), some rather confusing moments and an unnecessary sub-plot (featuring a psycho ex-boyfriend of one of the girls), and bloody awful lighting that often makes it impossible to see what is going on.
Its also rather sad to read comments from persons obviously involved in making the film trumpeting this film as a "10" in press release language.
Making Denmark an American corporation rather than a political state was also unsuccessful, for the continued use of the terms "king," "queen" and "prince" did not fit the new setting.
There are also the typical poor and misleading Arabic- English translations, such as "jihad" being translated to "holy war" rather than "struggle", and a dehumanization of Palestinians who believe in their right to the whole of the country.
But rather see it yourself, once you've watched you'll want to see it again.
So to make this show is not about Victoria Gotti and her 3 punk kids but rather its a form of a celebration of John Gotti's life.
I have mainly questions, which addresses said sloppiness, rather than a re-hash of the plot you can already find here: 1.)
I advise you to sit and watch The Urban Legends again, rather than watching Fingerprints.
Kristin Cavallari, reality-TV star turned actress, impressed me for the first half of the movie; her acting seemed genuine and she was rather charismatic on screen.
It's really sad that a generation of kids are being exposed to THIS variation of Scooby, rather than any of the classic cartoons - even Scooby and Scrappy-Doo (the most deplorable of all the series) was better than this.
It does explain how Reggie is involved but it's rather throwaway and unconvincing , the script would have been much better if it concentrated on niggling little things like how can characters be abducted from a supermarket and brought into a busy nightclub without anyone calling the cops   If you loved the original then you might enjoy this sequel but it was spoiled by a very clumsy script
Despite her strong feelings for her soldier, she refuses to become the wife of a member of the British foreign service, and chooses rather to be a spinster, and to love whom she wants when she wants.
This is a film with great actors who are becoming elderly and looking for a pay check and it is great to see these great veteran actors performing and at the same time it is rather sad to see at what steps they all take to make a buck.
In fact both Generals Grant and Sherman were rather anti-semetic.
It was also boring and rather sickening.
The plot has something to do with the adult children of a family finding out that their mother hasn't really been dead, rather she was changed into a vampire and had been kept locked up by their father in a secret crypt.
Instead, this was a rather depressing feature about a teenage friendship which turned into a love affair "by chance".
For two hours I was waiting for this movie to surprise me (you can guess what the mystery is rather quickly) and move me, and was disappointed.
I'd rather have a stroke than watch this nonsense.
A rather below par road movie, enlivened by Russell Crowe in the lead, and by various other noteworthy characters, such as his father, and a mad ex-KGB torturer!
admittedly, Russell plays a rather predictable role, but my wife claims that his god-like physique more than makes up for this!
Its dark style rather makes this movie an uneasy one to watch.
However, because it is Australian... Due to it being set in Australia rather than America or Britain (where incidentally for a long time it was a smashing hit, old chap) it IS more down to earth, and it is more realistic, but the margin is thinning year by year.
Despite knowing full well at this point Burke is an undercover police officer, rather than simply kill him they decide to resurrect the most homosexual super villain since the 1960's "The Joker" to do the job for them.
Non of the two seems like they even know what they are talking about and a tragic love story suddenly becomes quite amusing, in a rather painful way to everyone who actually likes The Picture of Dorian Gray.
He comes across as a good natured Guy Pearce appearing at some provincial theater rather than a haunted character from a Victorian novel .
I know everyone has a different understanding at this work, but i really don't think it would be what the writer himself wanted to reveal or rather conceal.
Students: note the grossly ineffective vocal inflections, the myopic combinations of fake-English-lord and California slurring, the twitching rather than walking, the gesticulating wildly while raising shoulders and rocking back and forth and jerking the head.
Several of the previous reviews for this episode remarked, in my opinion, more upon the reviewers love for the series rather then this episode.
If you go to movies to see the stars rather than the stories, then this may be for you.
Director Milius nails his allegiances down here, there are some really nauseating scenes of gross patriotism which I found rather laughable.
I am so sorry, but James Franco should start looking for a career in renting movies for people rather than making them.
In the end, however, the movie was rather weak and did not have the impact of the trailer or the poster.
They are certainly the highlight of this movie which in the end seemed to spend most of their time making that trailer and such which goes to show you can bring in some money even with a rather weak movie, if you know how to advertise.
attack in the middle rather than at the end of the film, where it makes less sense.
I later found out that it was not actually a TV show, but rather a television movie.
Even the special effects are rather weak.
The sooner they are eradicated, rather than pedestalled, the better.
The make-up job on Richard Basehart and the other creatures are excellent, but doesn't show much to save some rather unimpressive moments.
I was expecting a gory slasher with loads of teens being hacked up, but what I ended up with was far from that, a rather tame drama with a bit of revenge thrown in to keep any potential viewers just about awake through the 85 odd minute running time.
One of the most touching (because grounded) elements of the original is that Bogart had to give up the vivacious young Joan Leslie for the older, husky, used, and rather plain Ida Lupino.
This was shot on no budget and it shows: the sets are really shabby (although that DOES fit the tone of the movie); all the characters are unpleasant; people scream rather than talk to each other; the dialogue is banal; Stoler and Lo Bianco aside the acting is terrible; the music is hilariously inappropriate; the attraction between Beck and Fernandez is never explained and, quite simply, this is boring!
Predictable and self-consciously "arty," the movie never seemed to be about anything, but rather seemed to be a vehicle for Albert Finney to overact (as usual).
If you want something interesting, i recommend to rather watch static on TV and to avoid this film under all circumstances.
They all come across as actors on a stage acting a part rather than actually being the characters.
Like everything in the movie is far from real, but rather close to an LSD-trip.
So in many respects the movie comes off as rather gruesome.
Stockwell is acceptable as the low-key hero, Danielle Von Zerneck reasonably appealing as the geeky girl who of course happens to be already rather attractive, Raphael Sbarge stuck in the one-note, over-the-top, grating nerd role (he reminded me too much of Urkel and Screech), and Fisher Stevens displaying his usual comedic energy as the flamboyant and cocky Latello.
Despite relationship dramas throughout the movie,"Nowhere" stays away from too many romance factors to stay true to its rather avant-garde-esquire nature, which I found very pleasing.
Very little was slowly revealed but rather just bluntly stated.
I nearly bought MYSTERIOUS OBJECT, but after reading some reviews I decided to pass, as it sounded rather too strange and a little boring.
I would have rather been able to sum up Rag Tale as MINUS 10 but 1 out of 10 was the lowest I could award.
If this is meant to be a fly on the wall appreciation of a newsroom it is hard to imagine that flies can stick to walls, rather than fall to the floor suffering from some severe form of motion sickness.
And then, as the mystery unfolds, or rather the solution to the mystery unfolds, I found Hector Elizondo not the most engaging of Columbo's adversaries.
Memo to Oprah: "you need to stick to talking about nothing rather than what films are good.
Mr Jim Cazaviel with doe eyes and designer stubble seems to have persuaded a lot of people that he has given a performance of great sensitivity,but I am not amongst them.He is not traumatised,rather he is catatonic.
This was not based on a lack of evidence of the cause of death or who was responsible, but rather the notion that Canada as a society felt okay about mothers killing their 10-year-old daughters, under the right circumstances.
All this, and a plot based on the premise that the victims all choose to run around in the open to escape the wooden bear, rather than take refuge on the first floor of the empty house.
Eating toxic waste makes bears bigger, stronger, more intelligent and far more bloodthirsty than average, rather than the predicted scientific outcome of causing malignant tumors and killing them.
There aren't a lot of sex games, as one might expect with a title like this, but there is one rape scene which is rather mild and brief.
Aside from the rather off-putting shags, the movie is a succession of scenes that set up punchlines but never deliver.
Unfortunately, but rather predictably, Rock-A-Doodle falls well short of those lofty goals.
And when the movie sticks to following the book it is rather entertaining in a 1950s Disney sort of way.
The Battle of Lexington is moderately well done rather obviously leaving open the question of who fired first.
I think this has more to do with the directing rather than the acting.
Of course, his daughter is rather upset about the prospect of going there, however his wife and twin sons are a bit more supportive.
Also happy to see the family go is the crazy neighbor played rather good my Randy Quaid.
A neighbor who for some reason must cut his rather small lawn with an industrial mower.
Well everything begins to unravel rather quickly as the movers turn out to be familiar faces he does not want to see, the jokes on them with the new house, and the driver of the car has a bit of a mental problem.
So for a rather light Richard Pryor comedy that still has some good laughs, give this movie a try.
It is unfortunate that the rather pathetic Woody Allen, an admittedly intelligent man who alas squanders his considerable talents, firmly believes that the cosmos revolves around his legendary neuroses.
Morris is initially an obnoxious boob, then he is a rather sexist but loving husband with no great ambitions and then he becomes a HUGE high-powered executive.
Here, he seems rather bland and bears no similarity to the rugged character he would be in the 1940s.
I would rather watch a documentary on the making of "Manos the hands of fate" than watching this again.
The problem is that the characters are rather dull, and the actors aren't really charismatic enough to overcome this.
However, Astaire deludes himself further into thinking that the roughnecks who come into town eventually leave it because of his notoriety (rather than through the helpful 'armed and invisible' presence of his friends) and even befriends a much younger saloon gal who turns out to be the girl of the robber behind the crime Astaire was supposed to have committed in the first place!
It has a very amateur look and style to it, and the pacing is rather slow.
All she did was prancing around in so-called seductive poses, rather than actually dance, exhibiting what was then called Hollywood's best looking gams.
Jia has kept his style but lost some of his edge in this state-funded effort with its rather relentless harping on the irony of a globalized China whose underlings can't get out of the country and are stuck in menial jobs in Beijing, cut off from their native dialects and where they came from and reduced to expressing their strongest emotions in text messages and cellphone chats.
There is no gore, decent scares, excitement & the thing is rather flat.
It seems rather telling that the only other commentator who levies the criticism it deserves, happens to be Japanese.
I would rather listen to a cheezy song from a Disney direct-to.
Call me old fashioned if you will, but I think part of the beauty in animated children's films is the innocence they portray, and in Thumbelina the constant battle for the girl was not after her heart, rather after her body!
I would have much rather be left with the magic.
It's a mystery story with a rather common theme.
Afterwards, his career followed a creative downswing with rather mediocre works such as "au Coeur Du Mensonge" (1999) or "Merci pour Le Chocolat" (2000).
However, I really think that this film would have been a lot better off if they made it in documentary fashion rather than making as a children's film.
This movie was a rather interesting first take for Director Sobel.The story is interesting, the comedy works,somewhat,and the characters are well developed.The biggest downside is in the technical aspects of the film.
The portrayal of the English soldier as some sort of hero is utter crap and after reading other peoples comments on this film its pretty clear that they are motivated by their political beliefs rather than how bad the quality of acting really is.
Some of the dialog is so painfully bad it beggars explanation of how an actual human wrote it rather than a life-form or intelligence wholly ignorant of our kind.
I'd rather spend a weekend locked in a cell with Barbara Stone (Bette Midler's character in "Ruthless People") than 15 minutes with the insufferably egotistical, vapid Marty Durand.
Unfortunately the film's premise is so dull that even the technique of having characters speak exactly what is in their minds mixed with dialogue seemingly more appropriate for human ears and adding dreamlike sequences including some rather randy voyeurism - stage worthy though these techniques may be - just can't make this dreary story of a day in the dissolution of a VERY bad marriage work.
Even the silly sequel, National LampoonÂ´s European Vacation, seems rather fun in comparison.
Madolyn Smith is not bad as his wife, and itÂ´s rather surprising that she hasnÂ´t done any acting since 1994.
To summarize: DZ:VINW is really no worse, no better than the other under-shoe feculence of the Sci-Fi Channel (not counting it's rather good series, Stargate and Battlestar).
- The whole idea with alies invading tends to be rather overused and out of fashion.
The acting is poorly, the story seems...... lost in the storm and the special effects look rather silly.
The drama of the situations are robbed of their power by being recounted to us rather than shown to us.
Several of the characters tell us their points of view rather than showing us.
After watching the Police academy movies over the years (those were not masterpieces, either, on the contrary), I was rather curious if this series was worth watching and if the jokes were good or at least somewhat better then those on the big screen.
I found Smoke Signals to be rather uninspiring, there was a lot of hype, and not a lot of substance.
Because of consistent plot holes, or rather underdevelopments, the audience must take great leaps of faith throughout the entire film, hardly any of which pay off.
If u really have to watch a movie, then rent some old favorite rather than go for it.
So, if dumb, loud action films are your thing, then by all means give these boys a whirl, or rather let them give you one!
The murders here are dumbed down a bit, aiming for the more simplistic and spontaneous rather than the thoughtful and creative like in part 1.
Dolph's rather wooden, and we also have Shriver's annoying voice to contend with.
While it's always amusing to see Bronson Pinchot attempting to make Eddie Murphy corpse on camera, the fact that a homosexual coffee house owner has now become an arms dealer shows how events frequently serve the plot rather than any form of logistical sense.
Murphy would go on playing cops in two more movies to date, but here the general idea of having the outsider cop solve everything has completely lost it's warranty and try making sense of the rather trite closing showdown between the cop and the villain in the amusement park.
Tom Berenger, who plays the villain, does a passable job of Cain-raising as an off-his-rocker terrorist, but his character more often strikes the viewer as silly and stupid rather than scary.
The supporting performances are generally rather lacklustre, possibly because none of the characters beyond the two principal players carry much depth or interest.
All of the emotions and values seemed rather predictable.
It doesn't even cut it as a rather flat documentary, since the director freely admits taking liberties with what Mitterrand really said and did.
The rest of the time we're forced to sit through a rather tedious walk through of Africa, complete with stupid narration, idiotic characters, and some rather racist stuff as well (The white characters get a whole bunch of Africans to do all their dirty work for them, it's really all quite racist).
This is rather an improvement on the novel in my opinion; the book can't seem to make up its mind whether the source of the evil is the car or LeBay; in the film there is little doubt that it is the car itself (herself).
I was very disappointed in this movie as not only did it leave out important sections of the text, it was filmed in a manner that made it into a regular Hollywood police-chase-action film rather than the subtle encounters that glued the story together in the text.
I think that is the most memorable aspect of this episodic serial from the 1930's, as the rest appears to be rather common and what one would expect out of a serial of the period (cheap sets, cheap costumes and props, atrocious acting and simple plot lines).
From what I had heard and read of this movie, I was rather expecting to find a gripping story of animal activism in Africa, somewhat akin to "Gorillas in The Mist."
Basinger showed a few sparks throughout the movie, but for the most part came across as rather distant.
Even Maurice Jarre's music did not seem much inspired, as it careered rather hesitatingly among various influences, and indeed the best was when the native chants took over.
However much Italian aristocracy was purported to have been in on the events, they plainly became unstuck in this rather woolly-eyed misanthropic excursion which at times left me guffawing and ready to reach for my video copy of `Out of Africa', as so many of the scenes in this film seemed to have been borrowing chunks from that film and converting them to own use.
She just seems like she would rather be anywhere than in this movie.
I would of rather watched a soap opera than this movie.
Maybe singing at the Legion, with an audience, rather than in his garage.
But then, Kelly's every on screen moment seems to be "commenting" on her character's plight, rather than inhabiting that character.
This is a rather dull psychological thriller which finally comes to life ten minutes before the end.
The film itself has a lot of maturity in how it deals with the subject and for once young adults are shown as intelligent human beings rather than the DTPH, KKHH or DDLJ type plot-driven puppets.
Exposition-heavy fantasy keeps stressing the same trivial points over and over, and Montgomery is rather tepid in the lead (the whole film depends upon his performance, but Montgomery hasn't that much charisma as an actor to carry the weight).
But, even that is just a split second of viewing, to leave it rather questionable, as to if it was just a paint can.
The look of the film is rather stylish, but still it's a hysterically formulaic piece that overplays itself.
The direction lacked strong execution, slowly paced and was rather patchy.
There are some rather humorous sequences rather than frightening because of some badly staged scenes.
The plot was hardly convincing and rather flawed.
It has a good cast, but most of the performances are rather bleak and stilted.
The predictable outcome took way long to get into it and overall it was kind of a disappointment and rather overwrought.
I was very disappointed with this rather tame offering from Amicus.
The setting is decent enough with gardens, antiques, and other period specialties, but the illogical story, the lackluster direction, and the mediocre acting all portend a rather dull ride.
I'd rather watch golf.
The songs are repetitive and in fact tunes from a previous Rajshri film (Maine Pyar Kiya) can be heard in at least one of these songs (I have to watch this film again to be more specific, but I would rather be corrected than suffer through it again).
Most Americans don't know that Takeshi Kaga actually was a rather famous Japanese actor--famous for stage performances in plays by Andrew Lloyd Weber, TV and movies (such as the DEATH NOTE live action film).
Unconvincing acting ruins what might have been rather good dialogue.
The other major problem with the movie is the rather "blah" cast: Julianne Moore, Glenn Close, O'Donnell, that "country" singer, and worst of all - Liv Tyler.
The film is a good-natured spoof, but I found the humor itself rather lacking in quality.
Outside of some amusing set-pieces, like the much-discussed Carrie-inspired decapitation by can-opener, Everett's short-tempered surgeon yanking the innards out of his patient to hurl at his derisive colleagues, the use of John Williams' ominous theme from Jaws (the punchline to this bit is best left to the adventurous viewer) and virtually every moment spent in the company of a deliriously hammy Vincent Price, Bloodbath is a dour and po-faced affair indeed, saddled with rather too much genuine tastelessness (Pamela Stephenson rapidly coming to enjoy being raped by a poltergeist, for example) and the most feeble of finales to make much of an impact.
They had already used most of their surplus population in the rather thin population of Australia, Canada and New Zealand.
The ending was rather unusual.
The young Sikh teenager's transformation from dutiful son to gold-chained gangbanger was unintentionally hilarious, calling on caricatures rather than character development.
The Sikh gangbanger suddenly agrees to take martial arts lessons rather than fire off that gun with that DANGEROUS GANG he just joined yesterday.
I would rather be bored.
You'd be better off going to a good Indian restaurant rather than wasting your time and money on this film.
there certainly was zeeeero chemistry between the two leads but i don't think it was due to the lack of "smootching", ash and shahrukh had chemistry in devdas and everyone knows they didn't kiss, so i rather blame the actors in MOS who obviously were very uncomfortable with each other.
The verbiage was there Â the f-word being used liberally, as well as other profanities Â and felt abused/overused rather than natural flowing dialogue or shocking.
HELLBOUND was a rather plot less runaround but was still reconisably Barker inspired .
I would have rather paused it on one of the scenes of nudity, send some knuckle children onto the TV set, and go to bed.
Do not watch this movie, you can watch a cartoon instead with your kid rather than waste your time on this bad movie.
Do not watch this movie, you can watch a cartoon instead with your kid rather than waste your time on this bad movie.
Do not watch this movie, you can watch a cartoon instead with your kid rather than waste your time on this bad movie.
Do not watch this movie, you can watch a cartoon instead with your kid rather than waste your time on this bad movie.
I am a huge fan of the Golden Age of Hollywood, but even I had a hard time sticking with this old and rather lame cartoon from Warner Brothers.
A rather ugly film.
In many ways the story resembles another Benchley story THE DEEP which might not be a problem as such but when you've got a film called KRAKEN:TENTACLES OF THE DEEP then a prospective audience is expecting a giant squid to be the focus of the story rather than humans .
The producers seem aware of this shoehorning a squid attack just to remind the audience there's a squid central to the plot when in fact it's the producers themselves who obviously need reminding   As it's produced by Nu Image Films the production values are rather poor with the squid being a rather obvious CGI creation .
This provides for a rather solid story/background, despite the common problems the movie shares with other made-for-TV flicks.
The supposed budget of about $2,100,000 doesn't sound too bad actually so it's a surprise that overall the film is rather flat, bland & forgettable.
McQueen has some good, feisty scenes, but his character is rather hapless, and a Steve McQueen who does little but react to others is an automatic disappointment.
(Her preference for men in uniform - rather a poor officer than a rich banker, as she put it - would contribute to her end.)
She was a successful courtesan , though was known more for her eroticism and sensuality rather for her stunning classic beauty.
:-) While the WWI battle scenes were rather poor for their lack of hundreds of extras, the details of what WAS shown is very commendable!
We are expected to believe that nearly every one of these gay women elects to be impregnated via intercourse with Jack, rather than by artificial insemination.
Without getting into anything more specific, this is the set-up for Harsh Times, and the pattern the film follows for the majority of its runtime (before taking the two main characters on a rather obscure road trip to Mexico that lasts for the final act of the film).
I was rather surprised that nothing works well in this mess of a movie.
I love the way the director connected the story elements rather than use the same old flashback technique some films use.
Nevertheless, I found their respective introductions to the story - the most important in this version were Little John (David Morrissey) and Friar Tuck (Jeff Nuttall) - rather jarring and sudden, which I thought left the respective actors struggling a little bit with the parts.
In regards to the latter point, I didn't feel that Robin came across as particularly noble in this movie (although he does decide to return the taxes to the common folk) but rather he seemed interested primarily in Marian (Uma Thurman).
George Macready, who belongs in things like "Gilda" rather than oaters like this, kept getting shoved into Randolph Scott Westerns (four of them).
No, the court case is summed up rather than dealt with.
It seems to be great resistance at first, but rather than make the men come to him - he went to them at their favorite hangout, a Caribbean takeaway restaurant.
Financing came mainly from Telefilm Canada and Chum TV, rather than direct scripting she would create situations where the actors would develop the dialogue - this was reinforced with constant research of gang violence in T-Dot as Toronto is known.
Still, it may have been jarring, things such as the >1 year journey that is inside earths orbit also jarred me, but other than that first one I don't think the average viewer should have noticed, and unreal-ism, even in the case of this movie, shouldn't lose more than 1 point from movie's score, rather it was the plethora of other problems that doomed Sunshine.
Spot-on characterisation, beautiful long shots and rather familiar set design (watch out for the cockpit).
The crew then decide that they'd rather be in "Alien" than "Solaris" and go to investigate.
Me, I'd rather watch Space Truckers again... and that's saying something.
I was rather disappointed by this effort from Freda, who's visual style I have always admired.
"Iguana" is by comparison to many of his other movies rather clumsily assembled and Freda is not very sure in his timing of the shock-effects.
The plot is uninteresting and rather muddled, the score and cinematography sub-standard (for a film directed by super-stylist Riccardo Freda, I mean) and what is this hilarious obsession with sun-glasses!!!
You groan, but would you rather a cheesy parent/child relationship?)
I didn't buy the hype surrounding 'Jaane Tu ya Jaane Na' (a film of similar persuasion) and thankfully this one was not hyped up (at least not in the part of the world where I reside) so it is easier to just watch the film as a time-passer rather try to figure out why I'm not feeling what other people are feeling.
This show seemed to be about a rather large, plain woman who was regarded highly for her singing but spent a lot of time trying to keep men out of her pants.
He reminded me of Ben Affleck, but I think I would have rather seen Affleck than him.
Let me repeat that: I would have rather seen Been Affleck in this movie than Zack Ward.
It might actually be that people who clap themselves are educationally subnormal rather than believers in one country socialist democide   The second point about being a philosopher is being able to state the painfully obvious , as in " the more coke you drink the more thirsty you feel therefore the more coke you will drink the thirstier you will become " To be fair to Zizek he does point out out that there is decaffeinated coke but no one spends a great deal of time and money drinking decaf , we drink coke because caffeine is an addictive drink and thirst has nothing to do with it .
Perhaps one might enjoy this film if one were at all familiar with his work, but I doubt it--why not just read more of his work rather than waste time watching this hodgepodge of soundbites?
Slacks nearly dragging the ground is so ugly, and most of us who's upper arms have gotten a little bigger, don't want to wear sleeveless or cap-sleeves, but rather kind of loose and to the elbow at least.
So I was rather surprised to see that virtually all of the participants were women.
In fact, some of the jokes are rather disgusting (as in bird and human feces in the face a number of times).
It didn't help that I didn't really care for anyone in the film and found myself feeling pity for our anti-hero because he was "in love" with someone who seems rather dull.
The DVD also looks like it was copied from a VHS tape, rather dark, and about three quarters of the way through, the movie suddenly backs up about 15 seconds like someone accidentally hit the fast rewind button, then goes back to play.
If you are not familiar with the series this is not a good way of getting into it as it leaves you extremely confused and frustrated with the random parts of story lines crammed into the duration of this film, the sequel,"the end of evangelion" is fantastic only wish I could have seen the series first rather than this released, for the sake of making money, film.
It felt more like an essay than a movie; rather than chronological development it was as though a point was made and evidenced and then moved on to the next point - I much preferred the chronological growth of the characters in the series.
In many peoples minds child abuse is a taboo subject, and, rather like the way that the phrase 911 has become iconic, the subject of child abuse, particularly child sexual abuse has become a metaphor for the most unimaginably awful thing that can happen to a human being.
There is some vague voice-over about her home and school being littered with traps but this sounds more like a statement taken from the script notes rather than A genuine voice.
This would have been far better if we saw a balanced side of this dispute, rather than a rehash which will have all the armchair socialists and unionists nodding sagely from their living room, without ever getting down to the nub of the issue.
I can't name one single explanation for his acts and that is rather frustrating once one has realized that.
To add insult to the injury they make "funny" comments on some rather good songs, such as "Broken Wings" and "I Will Do Anything For Love".
The show is quite nice except for the actress should learn to act a bit more natural rather than trying to so call act cute.
This film is about a husband and wife, and their young son going to what appears to be their rather lavish riverside home, unaware as they drive past their friends that there are a pair of degenerates who are terrorizing the community, one family at a time.
Case in point: in a scene where the two villains are debating the quality of the female victim's body, they decide they want her to take her clothes off- and to effect this, they stick a sack over her son's head and twist it to the point that these rather loud screams of pain and anguish can be heard.
The idea of how the heroes have their powers is ridiculous, putting it on a scientific theory that is an incomplete theory in the first place: "evolution" To say that a person needs the ability to fly is rather foolish as the brain is people's weapon, and if they want to go on Darwin's theory of evolution, they best realize that it's also "survival of the fittest" which goes into the idea of the food chain.
Patton was one of the last of the American leaders who acted based on their 'old-fashioned' beliefs in Duty, Honor, Principle, and Character rather than on the work of the assassins and spinmeisters who tend to predominate today.
It is the camp's intention to bring the teens face to face with their problems, although in a rather unorthodox manner.
The second movie Dr. Dolittle is now a rather rich doctor.
Written & directed by Cartney Wearn I watched Pray for Morning last night without knowing a thing about it, the title is rather vague & could have referred to anything so I didn't go into it with any great expectation yet I still found myself disappointed & not particularly having a good time.
It almost feels like you're web-slinging through a map of cubes rather than buildings.
Written and directed by Paul Morrissey I was very disappointed by this extremely talky, overlong and rather dull excuse for a horror film.
In fact it's more of a historical drama/sex film rather than horror.
David Yallop's "Let him have it" was riddled with inaccuracies and half - truths,consequently I approached "Chicago Joe" with some trepidation only to find that here he has got most of the facts right only for the entire movie to fall victim to the 1990's fad for faux 1940's retro,failing to grasp the most elementary fact that people during the second world war neither looked,spoke nor behaved anything like they would half a century in the future.Mr K.Sutherland is,brutally,nothing like a G.I deserter,rather he is a time - traveller visiting the past and trying to fit in to avoid discovery.Miss E.Lloyd, given the crutch of an accent to assume,does rather better as his moll/muse.
As film makers grind their way through "Notable British Trials" they might care to study one or two of the well - known cases where subsequent investigation has given cause for concern rather than ones where the defendants richly deserved their fate.Take Dr Crippen for instance,there is absolutely no evidence that the remains found in his fireplace were those of his wife.....now that,surely,would be the starting point of an interesting movie...
Emily Lloyd and all the other women in this film have coiffures and make-up reflecting somebody's 1990 notion of 1940s retro, rather than actual 1940s styles.
The younger of the brothers, Will (Andrew Stevens, who also produces here as well as contributing heavily to the screenplay), a rather artless character, does in fact espy Nikki in flagrante delicto, but this apparently fortuitous event for Brian is nullified because Will has succumbed to the physical charms of the wayward wife and has decided to withhold the evidential tape from the musician and his attorney, played by able supporting player Paul Carr, causing a viewer to recognize that the lovestruck security guard can not be considered as an example of rectitude.
It's hard to imagine that something so bad could have been directed by Harold Ramis (usually a rather reliable director/writer).
It too is filmed from an African perspective rather than a Western one...but it actually has a relevant, engaging storyline with fleshed-out characters for whom you actually care.
Instead, Blackbeard, whose beard by the way, was rather odd looking, being so long and narrow, was played by Angus Macfadyen.
I would rather play in a radioactive waste dump then endure another 160 minutes of this piece of trash.
Maynard apparently is sent to deal with Blackbeard by someone else entirely and essentially ends up shanghaied into the pirate's crew, where he hides his real nature, and rather successfully until the time comes for him to save some folks.
Contemporary viewers will find the forced insertion of Trevor into most of the scenes rather puzzling, at least in part because she has little going for herself as an actress or a screen presence.
The film under review, then, is original to be sure and mercifully short â but also rather pointless...to say nothing of dismal-looking, dreary and thoroughly depressing!
However darkness cannot hide the film's defects.The film maker has surely not done his homework well due to which viewers are forced to watch a crude succession of abominably cruel scenes in which women are traded like cattle.Most of the actors too suffer in this film as their roles have not been defined properly.Recommendation:better watch this film and be bitter about it rather than being sullen without having seen it.
I'm not a hater of Pauly Shore by any means, he can be a very funny guy and I rather liked Biodome which came after this film.
The relationship with Watson was clearly misunderstood, and personally I found his rather surly characterisation irritating, Dr Watson is supposed to be conduit for Holmes' brilliance, so us mere mortals understand what is going on not to behave like a spoilt schoolboy made a mockery of.
Watson (played by Ian Hart) is at last an intelligent doctor rather than the bumbling idiot he's usually portrayed as, and Richard E.Grant makes for a sly, scheming Stapleton.
This may sound like a serious film, but it really is rather quite funny and has some real classic lines to it that I'm sure will endear you to the film.
With all displays of Holmes' deductive reasoning dropped (even the famous scene with Dr Mortimer's walking stick is gone), his disguises omitted (he just appears on the moor as if he were still dressed for Baker Street) and his drug use wildly overdone (rather than resorting to narcotics when bored, he even jacks up in a public toilet while working on the case in this version), he's such a blunt bull in a China shop here that rather than pay the cabby for information, he beats him up instead as if he were a 19th century Popeye Doyle.
The film's message need not be smartly portrayed; rather, it should be portrayed repeatedly and simply for mass consumption.
The flick's cannibal clan aren't that demented enough and the direction is rather limp.
The scene then devolves into an even more embarrassing fight between the characters amid rather perplexed diners.
Wango, as well as Goona, were islands created by Mother Nature back some 10,000 years ago where the men of Womgo were boorish brutes and the women were gorgeous babes and in the case of the people on the island of Noona the men were Greek Gods and the women were homely wallflowers.This made dating romance and marriage among the young couples of Wongo and Goona an act of duty rather then an act of love.
I'm giving this 2 stars (rather than 1) since it is so bad that it bounced off the bottom of the scale and began heading towards the entertaining end of the spectrum again.
Its sad and pathetic but still rather humorous watching the film makers trying to co-opt the religion of the Jews as they cram Old Testament harshness into modern American Fairyland.
I laughed exactly four times throughout the whole movie, which is a rather bad quote for a comedy.
The main problem is that although the imitations of the original movies are rather well executed and the famous-actor-look-alikes really look similar to their counterparts, the directors somehow confused simple references to famous movies with being funny.
This is a truly awful movie and it reminds me of a part of American history that many of us would rather just forget.
This is a rather extreme step down from that movie.
...but rather just a list of movies that the filmmakers wanted to parody, strung together by the weakest plot in film history and a lot of unfunny jokes.
It turned out to be a cheap trick that in the end made the movie a cheap exploitation rather than the gruesome thriller it could have been.
Our super agent, one Bart Fargo by name, is a bland layabout loser, who'd rather be sleeping than out saving the world from bumbling super villains.
Cem YÄ±lmaz puts in a rather insipid performance as the stereotypical Turkish every-man Arif but comes alive in his brilliant turn as Commander Logar with solid support coming from the likes of Ãzkan Ugur, Rasim Oztekin, Ozan Guven and the gorgeous Ãzge Ãzberk.
Sound exciting, but the story is rather dull.
I'd rather send my kids to college!!
As it is, this movie is a poor tribute to those who died that day, and a ghoulish attempt to satisfy our curiosity for what it might have been like to be on the plane that day rather than help us understand what happened and why.
Upon return to School, his old friend Dwight (Pitt) decides he would rather humiliate him than to be his friend again.
However, the impatient nature of production companies to get content out quickly rather than developing it to its maximum potential is resulting in a stream of uninteresting shows to be rushed out before given enough breathing space to mature from flash-in-the-pan neat to truly exceptional.
I should also mention the faces of the satanists/devils, they have white faces with blank eyes which looks rather disturbing.
Now the fact that William Shatner appears in DEVIL'S RAIN isn't much of a surprise, but it is surprising that his performance is rather restrained.
It's all rather gross but funny at the same time.
Most of the movie is sadly rather underdone.
A rather good cast doing nothing more than going out to the abandoned town and getting themselves kidnapped by the evil cult led by Ernest Borgainine in a rather good over the top performance.
Which is the highlight of the film, a rain that comes down and washes the cult members away, rather good effects, especially for the time, but this does not make up for the rest of the film.
He tends to pick on people like his own band mates rather than challenging bigger, tougher authority figures.
Sadly, she meets a rather bloody end, but her presence alone is enough to save the film from the scrapheap.
The whole thing with the drunken waiter got old VERY fast and was so overused and unfunny, it had me cringing rather than laughing.
They both seem rather unpleasant and whiny.
That annoying kid with the camera (I forget his name) and the rather bland and boring fat girl.
Even Jesse Spencer, who I rather like as an actor, wasn't that great.
Lame people can be jewel thieves too.. just as psychotic rednecks can be goofy rather than aggressive... ARRRRGHGGGHHHHH  LAME LOSER JEWEL THIEVES VS GOOFY JERK OFF RETARD FARMERS WHO DON'T KNOW A CHAINSAW FROM A MICROWAVE!!!!
This movie is another example, and a rather extreme case at that.
None of the roles were portrayed in a believable fashion, and the dialogue was rather amusing in its unoriginality.
No sir this is the president of the United States after all , he`d rather dissolve than give in .
GORE When I picked up the DVD the title and the cover was rather catchy.
The special effects were a bit weak, but I found the opening sequence where the mission goes bad and they have to abort to be rather exciting.
It could have shown how people who are friends grow apart as they grow up (but that might also include showing ACTUAL individualism and something that could happen in the real world rather that a bunch of annoying, clingy girls who would die without each other).
Bratz does not approach teen movie fame; I'd rather watch Date Movie again.
Or rather, I went in with the expectation that it *would* be a bad movie, and even one that would go to such ridiculous lengths as to be awesomely bad, to the level of something like Ghost Rider, where taking it seriously would provide brain damage, and by not would give some form of entertainment (especially if you have friends to make jokes with during the movie, which for something like Bratz isn't inappropriate to 'ruin' for the rest of the audience).
In a rather distasteful staged script, the bride, Melissa, went off the rails the day of her last bridal gown fitting because she found her fiancÃ©, Brian, in bed with her wedding planner.
But it was rubbish, the politically incorrect dinner guests were all crude stereotypes, and the ethical 'discussions' at the dinner parties would have been better left as an msn conversation rather than turning it into a script and subjecting viewers to sit through it.
It is rather unfortunate that anyone with a camera, free time on their hands and spare change in their wallet can make movies these days.
But when Barbe's character tells Iris that she can't take the shoes off, she gives him a quick look that says "ok, so you want to play this game" and decides to do it, preferring to live something rather than nothing.
I'd rather watch Ben Affleck and Jenny from the Block in that other awful movie that we dare not say its name, while watching it with Chinese voices dubbed over it and bamboo being shoved under my finger nails.
Along the way you get to see him kill people in rather stupid ways to get their hearts.
Some scenes though are rather gory such as the flashback scene where they show how the kid managed to escape, but in the end these scenes are too few and far between.
The story is rather depressing and dark, and the events of the movie didn't strike me as a very realistic.
Even as a kid I wondered if there was a better person to perform the role of superhero/goodguy Serpico, rather than Al Pacino with his favored expression; the dead-eyed stare.
It was also rather dull, at times though, maybe it's because I'm not a major baseball fan either so I wasn't that into that part of it.
The main character comes across as a rather big and stupid bloke, but not someone you bother engaging with.
Because the story is absolutely meaningless, which becomes more and more obvious as it developsÂ also the "real life" killing footage is absolutely tasteless, especially because it is advertised so strongly on the front of the DVD coverÂ No wonder the critics walked out during the screening in Cannes Â (I don't think it was because of this films "controversial" qualities) Â rather the embarrassment that a film like this could reach Cannes!!!
The East European setting, with the old buildings and whatnot, provides the movie with its only plus -- it's very nice to look at, even if the fog machine gets a rather strong workout.
The filmmakers are so blatant with pushing the whole allegory motif that it becomes rather irritating.
Other than that, this was a rather entertaining venture into the future of the vampyric race, in spite of the vastly missed potential.
I honestly believe that we got a pre-release work print rather than a finished product.
Don't you think it's rather absurd?
There is one rather surprising (or maybe shocking) sex scene in which a puppet dog is involved.
To sum it up, "Let My Puppets Come" is a rather bland and boring curiosity movie.
They played 15 year old teenagers but appeared rather old and a little bit feminine (at least Perry) at the same time .
What we get is a rather bad Jean Claude Van Dame movie with the same old stuff you would expect with his movies, and a few differing things.
Almost a needless part of the plot as she is a rather weak cyborg with no fighting skills or anything that would even indicate she is any different than a human.
Even some rather natural and, frankly speaking, amazing scenes, for example, with strange fish crawling in aborigine's fundament or the reanimation of a monkey with the help of rubber tube can't save the movie from total failure, at least in my eyes.
When Cannibal Holocaust 2 reached the shops here in the UK (released by the 'weak' VIPCO label) it seemed like a rather intriguing title.
Having only been cut by a few seconds (according to the BBFC) I was expecting something rather extreme, to say the least.
There were some good moments as far as drama goes -- they are very soap opera-like in how they deal with girlfriends -- but the actual ghost hunting is rather weak.
Every shot is held three times longer than necessary... the script lacks any exploration of emotions that would be warranted by the circumstances and is filled with banal chatter rather than driving a story.
Gonzalo wants to sexually possess the wife rather than love her, more out of revenge and hatred for his brother.
night diet,( she suspects her husband is gay since he'd rather do almost anything instead of sex with her (not a bright bulb), she wants a child, she loves phallic paintings, she hates Bach, she's dangerous with a microwave.
Mr. Stroud is not a daredevil, nor a thrill-seeker for its own sake, but rather a dedicated outdoors-man and supremely accomplished survivalist among his other complimentary talents.
The father and son dynamic is rather good in this one, making this film an installation with some merit.
Four college students rent rooms at an old, creepy looking sea side house, run by an elderly woman and her rather reclusive son.
I've heard people saying it is a simple story though i din' found it simple rather i found it irritating.
Plus, the naked ladies were rather attractive--though this makes this far from a family-friendly flick.
Except the MGM musical-style village in full summer bloom (Christie's novel was set in dark winter and in 1930 rather than 1950) not only is the sugar-coated McEwan a miss Marple miscast (and why is everyone treating this snooping old hag as a royalty?
As I have already mentioned, the original version had a quite dark ands sinister edge to it, with low-key lighting and the rather brooding winter setting.
The story is rather derivative of many other films and focuses on a woman who has moved to London after losing her child.
However, when you consider the fact that prisoners are wrongdoers who are in jail to pay their debt to society, it's rather hard to sympathize with their "plight" in this film.
I disagree, being a Christain myself, I see the violence representing more of a spiritual battle rather than physical.
The basic plot is rather vague, all over the place.
Except I'd rather watch Max Von Sydow than Tina Turner.
The Flash's costume was also rather well put together.
OK in this case it is not taken too far but it still feels false and as though it has been added in just to keep the lady's in the audience happy (or rather the Hollywood executive's idea of what will make lady's in the audience happy).
As for the rather abrupt ending, I find it a bit of a stretch that the geeky self-hating boy would, after one horrible dinner in which he basically pouted the whole time, land the ferociously hot, model-esquire party boy Marc, who apparently instantly forgets all about his major crush on Caleb and acts as though he's been pining away for Kyle all this time.
Moreover, the picture just freezes at a random point, while the counter keeps running, then the disc ends (cuts off, rather) a minute or so later.
The characters are bleak and the script draws their personalities rather inconsistently.
Carroll Baker's character, for example, is initially portrayed as a real bitch that protects her poodle from the burning sun rather than to rescue fellow human beings, but when the climax approaches she suddenly transformed into one of the most amiable people on board.
I would rather repeatedly jab a knife into my arms and legs than to ever, and I do mean ever, sit through this horrible excuse of a movie again.
The plot, or rather the idea behind the plot was pretty good.
While the basic story transposes rather well Â a down on his luck prospector who sold his wife and child for a gold claim and rose to rule the town that grew up around it finds himself on the road to destruction when they reappear and he attempts to make amends Â it's little more than an underdeveloped skeletal outline that never grips, feeling less an attempt at subtlety, more underwritten.
Peter Mullan is superb as the Mayor, convincingly essaying the kind of man who can rule an entire town by sheer force of will alone, but while you understand his emptiness, the film never allows you to feel for it, leaving the finale a rather empty spectacle rather than genuine tragedy.
Unfortunately the supporting performances are rather dull and characterless: Nastassja Kinski has little to do but waste away, Sarah Polley isn't able to do much with her cardboard good girl, Milla Jovovich lacks the moxie her saloon manger cries out for while Wes Bentley tries to coast on charisma without ever having enough to do the trick.
It looks like a work in progress rather than a finished film.
Even the final plot twist--rather, the only plot twist--does not save this film.
Screenwriter Larry Cohen has written & directed some rather inventive films in the past but you'd never guess that given his lackluster effort here.
Yeah, 'Uncle Sam' is rather peculiar to say the least.
So it takes itself rather seriously by flinging about inspirational speeches and critical symbols and messages that are hard to overlook and since the actual context is absurd, it needed a bit more humour to soften it.
The fun factor felt rather short.
But even with these reliable names they all seem to be on cruise control and give rather soporific performances.
The second rate direction by Lustig is rather tosh in patches and kind of restrained.
It's rather likable.
Id rather watch a real cat sleep then watch this stupid cat wander into another Stephen King short story though, so go figure.
Lewis Teague starts proceedings on a reasonably good note with a story about a "Quit" smoking program which achieves results in rather unorthodox and unpleasant ways.
The story itself might have been better if told chronologically, rather than using a flashback of a flashback.
Which is a shame because what little there is of Sheridan is really rather great.
Even with all the big name actors/actress it was done rather poorly.
Shaky camera, BAD acting and a lot more things I'd rather not get into made this the worst experience in my life.
Oddly enough, I always think of that scene with the hearse driver coming to get someone, but this scene was not even in this movie, but rather in the film "Burnt Offerings" another horror movie that for the most part was not exciting.
This was a rather pedestrian version of the Agatha Christie short story thriller (Philomel Cottage).
I felt this film was more of a comedy, rather than a horror film!
You later see his face poorly pasted on a stained-glass window which causes a female character to scream rather inappropriately.
i'd rather have my eyes gouged out than be exposed to the shittiness of this movie again.
I would honestly rather watch House of the Dead four times in a row than ever sit through this garbage again.
The film is also misstated: this film takes place before Cruel Intentions so therefore this film is actually a prequel and rather stupid one at that.
He'd already been a pirate and an outlaw for director Michael Curtiz, but in 1939 Errol Flynn was cast in the rather unexpected role of sheriff Wade Hatton in Dodge City, part of the western boom of 1939.
Dodge City merely appears to have been intended as a kind of rough homage to the western rather than trying to take the genre anywhere new.
Then I found out today that it was not really intended to be a new movie, but rather a television series, Manchester Prep.
It is thus very hard to sympathise with her, or any other of the rather uninspiring characters.
Suddenly I saw a rather shabby looking movie that seemed to be science fiction related, so I stopped and watched.
Haber's desire to mold a better world through George Orr's power, his attempt to convince George to join him in the effort rather than resist, and his inability to see that the consequences of meddling with reality are unpredictable -- all of this is lost in Haas' adaptation.
By today's standards it is rather surprising that the Southerners are seen as the heroes and the Union cause identified with Surrett and the villains, but this was the era of "Gone with the Wind" when Hollywood tended to treat the Confederates as romantic rebels, if only because a film which treated them in any other way would have done no business anywhere south of Baltimore.
And if it WERE the former, rather then the latter, all the likability of Brian flies out the window as no matter how charismatic a stalker may be, the fact remains that they ARE in fact stalking someone.
It's good to see that any schlub can now get his message out there rather than all the power in the hands of the elite.
Even casting aside memories of the infamous summer of 2005, (during which the Internet Movie Database's Film General message board was overrun for months by the director's friends relentlessly hawking this documentary - and getting extremely unpleasant when challenged about their behaviour, trolling the board - in a monumentally misguided attempt at viral marketing that ensured everyone who encountered them waited for it to arrive on television rather than pay to see it) this film is impossible to like.
Sorry, but in such cases i rather read something in between.
Frank McHugh plays a rather restrained (for McHugh) supporting role as a newspaper man--in probably one of his best performances.
If you want to see John Wayne in something different from his usual fare, then "McQ" might appeal to youÂ but everyone else will probably come from the film feeling rather disappointed.
He's completely full of himself, which is rather odd for someone working a menial job on an oil rig.
Why can't they just try to create a work of art themselves, rather than make a joke about something beautiful?
What made the movie bad wasn't its juvenile sense of humor, but rather the lack of overall jokes.
Some recent spoofs that have hit the cinemas, including Epic Movie and Date Movie, have been rather below par, so I thought there might be some hope with this video spoof of 2005's renowned documentary March of the Penguins.
Or rather, how ridiculous the idea of talking penguins is.
This may rank as one of the low points in the history of British TV;12 "celebrities" are flown off to some exotic tropical Island to see if there is any mutual attraction with each other,hopefully leading to sexual attraction.The word "celebrity" once had rather more respectful meaning for most of the 20th Century;mainly with those who had achieved fame because they deserved it,through endless hard work and great ability at their chosen field.In the 21st Century,particularly in the UK,it is now mostly associated with tawdry,dislikable,intractably pointless excuses for human beings most interested in seeing their names in equally reprehensible tabloid newspapers or c_______ magazines.
It has plenty of unintentional laughs also, and is rather entertaining at moments.
You can find it in the documentary "Toonheads: The Lost Toons" on the Looney Tunes Golden Collection, and its status as part of Looney Tunes history is about the only thing that makes it worth watching (in fact, I wish that the documentary's narrator had poked fun at it rather than praising it).
I'd rather have a stroke than watch this nonsense.
Kate Winslet, always a watchable actress, fares rather better in the smaller role of the plain but spirited Hester, who attempts to help Tom solve the riddle of Claire's disappearance and of the stolen cryptograms found in her room.
There's such a dearth of thought-provoking cerebral movie thrillers that it is almost tempting to applaud "Enigma" simply for attempting to engage the brain rather than deliver the usual crowd-pleasing but mind-numbing thrills and spills.
Several key plot twists seem to occur in expository dialogue rather than being actually depicted, and this tendency increases as the film draws to its rushed, some would say botched, climax.
Either way, even for The X-Files, this one gets dark fast, and the moral ambiguity present is wonderful as the cultists' lies turn out to be rather more well- intentioned than the comparatively friendly words of the demonic substitute teacher.
Nukie and his brother Meeko are ugly little aliens with big heads and runny noses who fly through space using some sort of personal energy rather than ships.
The 5-minute "Attack of the Psycho Tree" (aka Whomping Willow Workout) scene they put into the third film seemed rather random too, after all.
It's a good scene, but I've got to say that I'd rather have the original scenes.
I blame this on Warner Brothers who obviously views the Potter property as a ticket to high profit rather than an experience that filmgoers and book lovers can share together.
The Burrow burns down during x-mas break due to Bellatrix and Fenrir (who is never described as a werewolf) perhaps for the lack of action at the end of the movie...the Dursleys are completely cut from the movie, meaning when Dumbledore picks Harry up for the summer it's at the train station for some apparent reason...The Ginny/Dean/Harry dichotomy is skewed, there was no break up between Ginny and Dean and Harry is clearly in love with her from the start of the movie which eliminates his confusion on his feelings during the school year...Hermoine prematurely spills the beans on her feelings for Ron which was only speculation in the novels...Lavender Brown becomes a obsessive and crazed girlfriend rather than simply over-affectionate (a reminiscent Unis from She's the Man)...the battle scene is missing from the end giving Dumbledore's death an anticlimactic feel making it all the more unemotional and disappointing...Harry hides under the floor simply holding his wand looking like a coward while Dumbledore dies, Snape sees him hiding rather than Harry being frozen under his cloak compliments of Dumbledore ...There is no funeral or break up with Ginny at the end of it (there is no relationship between the two either simply a kiss)...Hagrid is basically deleted from the movie as is Neville...Pensive trips are deleted and the Horocruxes are never explained, not even slightly...Luna finds Harry on the Hogwarts Express rather than Tonks...The Slug Club simply makes a cameo rather than a proper introduction and explanation...the Inferi look more like skeletons compared to the white bodies described in the book...I'm sure more discrepancies are present, however I can only remember so many of them.
I ask, and not for the first time: Where a part requires an actor to speak in a regional accent, can we please have an actor who is capable of delivering that accent accurately, even if the actor is hitherto unknown, rather than some "big name" actor who is happy to earn a large pay packet for insulting viewers with a puerile attempt at the accent.
); later, rather than shoot an unwary American sentry, he simply knocks the man unconscious.
The Germans take English villagers hostage but honorably let them all go unharmed, then die together fighting for the Fatherland rather than surrender.
--------- Jimmy: "I daresay Bundle, I'd rather be drawn into some international intrigue for the weekend, at our country house."
Admittedly, I do recognize that perhaps most of "Save Me" was not written / planned to focus on a "couple" but, rather, was aimed at exposing overzealousness by some in the religious community and their need to "reform" homosexuals.
From now on, thanks to SAVE ME, I will be able to look for the humanity in gay "recovery" crusaders, rather than condemning them out of hand as bigots.
Reno is the one holding it together, although his ennui is rather more phoned-in for this one.
The sound is somewhat uninspired, with rock music(a rather unlucky habit that seems to have formed recently, with low-budget slashers) in the chase scenes.
Robert "Maniac Cop" Z'Dar is a hulking guard named Brad who, along with other men, forces patients into the hellhole and has a rather lame/disappointing fight with Cox's Ron towards the end.
And that is what makes BHD a horror movie rather than a war movie really.
I find it ironic that many of the comments being circulated from outside (rather luckily, I'd say) the hornet's nest of U.S. news media are doling out the most thoughtful and reasonable opinions on why "Black Hawk Down" is such a rank slice of flag-waving propaganda.
Inking his soul over to the devil, Ridley Scott employs the mandatory, quick-edit style of pretentious music-video directors the world over, and rather than drawing interest into the almost nonexistent story, instead makes the film bomb even harder.
I'd rather not offend Mr Craig, but I must admit that he is the worst casted James Bond ever in the history of the series it's not his fault though because the filmmakers were the ones who chose him.
The plot is rather mixed up, everybody had a motive, but the change is so fast that it makes no sense, and at the end the secret guy comes up to take the prize.
He would be better as the villain's No 2 henchman rather than Bond.
"Quantum paleontologist" Dr. Rick Marshall (a gone-really-feral Will Ferrell) provides another apt description of the agony in store for viewers of this thoughtless rehash, but it is so sacrilegious that he'd already be erased if he'd said it about the Prophet, rather than about Jesus.
I don't know if anyone ever bothered to watch the deleted scenes of Bruce Almighty but there are a few scenes in which Jim Carrey was given some props and told to do Jim Carrey-like things, shameless and uninspired directing which thankfully didn't make it in to what was an averagely fun movie, however Brad Silberling must've, as this film was one long series of bad set pieces designed to make Will Ferrell do Will Ferrell-like things and the terrible bits made the finished film rather than the extra features of the DVD.
from the start it was a total disaster to me and not just that it could not make me laugh but rather I felt like being insulted by it.
French Stewart proves once again, like he did in the excrement that is Home Alone 4, that he falls well short of the charisma and energy of his character and came across as rather wooden.
I much preferred Rupert Everett's suave take on the classic villain, and Martin hamming-up came close to embarrassing rather than entertaining.
A mediocre film, rather predictable film, not helped by lazy imagineering work on the spoken form of the alien language - it consists simply of lists of Swahili words read from a phrasebook, and distorted by some kind of vocoder.
Production values aside HANGAR 18 is a rather dreary film script wise .
The only entertaining scene in the film is the performance of a hip hop version of the British national anthem, which is actually rather good.
The only thing that is half-decent is the special effects, or rather, the sci-fi bits from the future, and the passable intro with the meteors hurtling through space and plunging into the Earth.
However, this movie was a disappointment to me as it laked all the good things of Death Notes movies such as tight paced plot, adequate and intriguing twists n turns, the mental battle between Kira and L and the Reaper....   For the starters, movie plot involves the last 23 days of legendary L as he tries to battle out a group of environmentalists whose plan is to make world a better place for living by spreading a deadly Virus (mixture of Ebola and Influenza virus) and thus reducing the size of ecological footprint of mankind by reducing the number of living people rather than researching new energy efficient technologies etc.
Another dampener is that there is no one intelligent enough to stretch L's mental abilities to the last point (as Kira did earlier) rather here L acts more like anyone secret service agents (he even throws something to save the lil kid in the movie).
However the makers of this spin off must have forgotten that if it is any other secret service agent movie than please there are better options than watching almost physically disabled L. So in the end, it is a movie with a hole ridden plot that dwells more on mannerism of L rather than a good storyline.
Unfortunately, the result is corniness rather than adrenaline.
But you know something's wrong when your counting the good moments rather than the bad ones.
I would rather watch the grass grow for the next 4 years than have to watch this again.
I have to say, this movie left me rather baffled and disappointed.
He does not appear to have consulted the actors at all about what is required, rather plonked the script in their hands, pointed the camera at them and told them to get on with it.
A Fine Movie, but lacking in story... A puzzle-box movie, similar to rather Butterfly Effect than Memento.
Maybe there's some will of creating contrast by concatenation of hope and tragedy in the same movie but, if that was the real will, the movie fails: it gets absurdity rather than contrast.
If you love stories where young people learn from old people, you may prefer other kind of films rather than this one.
There wasn't any sweet romance in it but rather something else .
It's all rather predictable, plodding & uninspiring stuff throughout.
The house's dark past is far from exciting & the film ends rather limply.
Talk shows actually do better on radio where you don't have to see the host or the focus is on the guest rather than the interviewer.
I would rather be stretched on the rack than sit through this atrocity again.
He offers stock apologies that seem manipulative, he steals cars and furthermore seems to rescue his wife out of jealousy rather than actual love.
Mitchum seems embarrassed, Hamill is hammy and Gersak is a rather weak heroine.
Well I must admit that his shows are rather interesting, coupled with great and well choreographed fighting scenes.
But this latest offering from Jackie is rather dull, with little action scene and hardly any humour in it.
This movie has some humorous moments, but is actually rather sad & full of people searching but not finding their goal.
I am sure Naomi Watts would rather have changed Samara's diaper then done this film!
The beast is a rather tragic figure, really, since it's some poor schmuck in a gorilla suit with some kind of rigid ugly mask.
I was also surprised to see the gushing reviews that this rather clichÃ© film garnered from some major critics.
I would much rather just look at the car after it is done and not waste a half an hour of my time.
I would much rather have a car that has a nice paint job and a new engine then a bunch of unnecessary things that make my car the perfect target for a thief.
I found this a very refreshing film in that the camera angles are creative without becoming annoying, and the focus is on the characters rather than on effects.
Director Leonard, a veteran stuntman, crafts some nice car chases with a rather nice car stunt at the film's end.
Gloomy looking Bette looks as if she'd rather smack him than kiss him and gives a very dour performance, heavy with sarcasm (too heavy for comedy).
Presumably Joss Whedon's script originally had rather more in this direction; it seems to be set up that Buffy and her class are vampires too, but nothing is done with this idea.
Kudos to Fox for being talked into taking on this botched project for a remarkable series, and, for that matter, for suggesting Sarah Michelle Gellar should play Buffy rather than Cordelia.
The fact that Simon, the main protagonist, is dead at the end of the movie is not a clue to the story, it's rather the RESULT of the different choices he makes while time-travelling to the past.
The significant thing is that he was in the same hospital in 2000, after the (rather unintentional) murder on his brother, and the car crash he got involved in together with his nearly dead brother (presumably while on the way to the hospital).
This is a haunting movie with a really nice, twisted plot, a lot of suspense (especially in the first part of the movie), overall decent acting (I thought the character of Anna and the guy waiting for a heart transplantation were done especially well), but rather uninspired music (although the sound effects are nicely done).
Instead, the characters appear rather simple-minded, and longer dialog has been substituted with cheap gestures and editing that tries to fit in too much story points into too few minutes.
I'd definitely rather clean the cat box than see this again.
Indeed, the action of the film (such as there is) is so preposterous, one can't imagine it happening anyway; but then this film knows not whether it is sci-fi or thriller, mystery or psychological drama -- no wonder the audience is reduced to focusing on its stars rather than on what they say or do as characters.
$$$$$$  People tend to hate this film for its premise rather than it's film-making qualities.
the lead actress maria pitillo seemed to try and get by on cuteness rather than any acting talent.
the movie portrayed godzilla as a crafty but mindless animal, so that when they finally killed him, the audience is saddened rather than happy about it.
Puzzle-Box films challenge you to think and discover the answers, rather than spoon-feeding them to you.
Such things as gold fish, black water, a plethora of beached starfish were all taken as signs from some powerful fairytale entity rather than even considering any natural solution.
Maybe it's because the character is moving at the speed of sound, rather than having the slightly fantastic under-cranked zip of silence; maybe it's because this Harold is a stuttering, stumbling, unsure boob rather than the confident, intelligent boy of yesteryear; maybe it's just because Lloyd was running out of ideas; but this is far from his best sound film, let alone being his best film of all.
I couldn't help but wonder what JoBeth Williams and Craig T Nelson felt while making this sequel, an obvious decline in all areas from the first film, from the rather embarrassing plot to the dialogue they are forced to endure.
This film basically sets up what we already saw in the first film, with an opening that's rather interesting, but it suddenly falls into the original's formula with some idea's being changed around (It's no longer the TV, but a toy phone that's the medium to the spiritual world) and a feeling of deja vu.
It's rather haunting in keeping such an alarming mood.
Some problems that the film faced are that there are too much dwelling on what happened in the first film, the film's pace is quite slow, rather humourless, some rather meaningless scenes, a lot of talking that has no real interest and overall it's rather a pointless sequel with no meaning to the narrative when it finally finishes.
The performances are nothing special, but just rather sound.
Zelda Rubinstein isn't as annoying like in "Poltergeist", with a far less eccentric performance, but when on screen she's rather tame.
Its running time is rather short in length, but because of that it kept my full interest.
Eventually, he believes (based on a rather shocking incident during a "flashback" to 2000) that he can go back in time to undo past wrongs and, as in so many other films of this type, things do not go well.
This is a good thing, considering that Phillipe is in every scene, and the other actors all have rather small parts by comparison.
The characters showed a tendency to say things like "oh" "ah" and "ooh", in response to their environment, to a degree which was excessive, annoying, and rather silly.
About the only thing it has in its favour is the fact that the people who made it did so with next to no money (supposedly), and did so for the sheer joy of making it rather than for commercial gain.
It was so bad that we were entertaining ourselves poking fun at it and decided to leave before it was over rather than waste our time any further.
The DVD is clearly based on the the same script as the TV version available on VHS Cassette but there are many small changes which somehow conspire to cause most of the jokes, which are very funny with the VHS cast, to fall flat and as mentioned before, the sound track irritates rather than complements.
A few moments of fun emerge from the mix, but it's rather heavy fun.
He has bones to pick with the city's mayor (Charles S. Dutton) and rather than work things out, Thomas is set to quit.
In addition, the lack of destruction was 1) rather unbelievable, and 2) annoyingly sparse.
I just finished reading Henry James' "The Bostonians," and though I found the book to be a fine read and rather effective in capturing the many waves of emotion that flow through its often unappealing characters, I can't say I was taken much with its mean-spirited and narrow satire.
This three-sided love story involving a feminist spinster, her rather dim protÃ©gÃ©e and a Southern knucklehead (I'm simplifying wildly here) involved me more than it should have, yet it left a bad the taste in my mouth.
Vanessa Redgrave is rather remarkable, as is Linda Hunt, but everybody else comes off sorely lacking, especially poor Christopher Reeve who tries to be dashing but makes Ransom even more odious than in the book (which I didn't think possible).
The audience at a cinema (the monster comes bursting through the screen, a rather nice touch).
He was reading some notes about the movie - the man is an unexpectedly dull, and rather inarticulate speaker.
There he was a 30- or 40-something man, pretentious, and a rather smarmy/unctuous presence.
Almost all the publicity for the film beforehand was based on this, and it is rather shocking to find that it was just that, and the ploy played no part in the film.
We all know why he won Best Actor, however I felt his performance here was more superior in this movie rather than in Lagaan.
David Ogden Stiers' body was covered by black leotard (not a bad thing), rather than mostly exposed, as the Manhunter is portrayed in the comics.
To be honest, in the end I rather enjoyed watching most of The Descendant, though I couldn't admire it.
Although it's set mostly in the Mexican deserts, the film is rather claustrophobically directed by Arturo Ripstein, who lets several of his scenes drag on too long.
Its first rate comedy and very enjoyable, but you feel rather like a customer in a restaurant whose been presented with their main course and desert on the same place - nauseated.
***** end of spoiler ********  I suppose if you really like to laugh AT movies rather than WITH them then you've really got to get this.
B western regular Raymond Hatton also puts in a patented supporting performance as some kind of wilderness man to round up the rather generic but pleasant nature of the cast and film generally.
For instance, when the uber-annoying regional bureaucrat (Robert Barrat) is murdered rather obviously in the midst of a fray by Scott's trapping buddy (Hatton), the military officer in charge (Harvey Stephens) barely bothers to investigate and suddenly switches plans and agrees to help the ranchers.
The other issue I have with this film is how it focused on the investigation of the assassination rather than the political implications.
Mr. President, rarely called by his name, justifies his killers: "the protesters"....something that recalls Jesus, rather than J.F.K.
But this movie wanting to kill the President which is what it is really about due to the war in Iraq, should have more truth about this, rather than the empty glorification of the act perpetrated on JFK now transferring it to President Bush (*)
However, if the movie let imagination run wild we would have a memorable commentary rather than a boring CSI botch-up.
(Strangely enough one of the recent knockoffs I saw Thailand's Ghost of Mae Nak used Final Destination death scenes rather than the black haired white faced knockoff to get scares.
Although I appreciate the spirit behind WAR, INC., it depresses me to see such a clumsy effort, especially when it will be taken by its targets to reflect the lack of the existence of a serious critique, rather than simply the poor writing, direction, and production of this particular film.
We're supposed to give a damn about how war affects Cusack's shell of a character rather than the millions of lives torn apart by war.
It used to be that a John Cusak movie, while a little offbeat, was, in the end, rather good.
The plot relies on sensationalism and innuendo rather than clear, satisfying explanation.
I would've much rather seen Preity play a different character and come back in the movie.
), his mother (who always seems to call him from the door entering the hallway to his room, rather than stand in his doorway OR ENTERING THE FRIGGIN HALLWAY HERSELF), and a grumpy old uncle (who loves his booze.)
If you're with a group and you're rather giddy, you might have some fun taking potshots at it.
Well, if Pat and Chris from Saturday Night Live-fame had a child, it would resemble Pod People's little femme boy waif, Tommy... a bug collecting, perky little blonde he/she that spends too much time to itself... of whom finds itself more comfortable with circa 1970's shag-carpeted, peanut-snorting, karate chopping aliens, rather than his alcohol-soaked uncle (I think) and his Bonnie Frankin (One Day at a Time TV series) haired mother.
What are terrifying are the ants themselves, the CGI effects are awfully staged and rather shoddy.
The corny acting was rather standard for this type of production, but there are some recognisable faces.
The acting might have been better than expected but also the cinematography was rather breathtaking in bringing the Alaska's wilderness on the screen.
Thematically, the film is a variation on the classic INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (1956) with a small town gradually taken over (though not by an alien organism but rather a vanished Â and, typically, superior Â civilization); despite the sensationalistic title, the creatures Â 'possessing' their victims through small punctures at the back of the neck Â are never actually seen, leading to a wonderful POV shot (perhaps the film's highlight) depicting an attack on the hero's girlfriend.
To give it some credit it moves along like a rocket, there's no boring exposition here even going as far as having a few scenes narrated rather than try & condense the information into an ordinary conversation & at only an hour long it doesn't outstay it's welcome.
The story is not engaging, and lacks emotional portrayal either, as it keeps going on and on about rather unusual acts between the children.
They would've had a lot less material overall and only could've done about 2-3 seasons rather than eight series, like the BBC version.
I don't know about the time of the film's release, but these days the sexperts chat is unintentionally hilarious, as the foursome are humourless, po-faced and rather brusque in their talk (as well as being an extremely plain verging on ugly bunch).
Here the film falls even further into risibility, as although these couples are meant to represent (or actually be) real people, they are so one-dimensional, robotic and mono-subject orientated that they seem like no one anyone has even met in this world, rather being dead ringers for the inhabitants of some future Brave New World-type dystopia.
It feels like everyone has returned because they knew they had a sure-fire hit on their hands rather than any pressing concern to continue this story arc.
Due to John Hughes' fine screenplay rather than anything on Columbus' part.
Her character is completely undeveloped and rather wooden (except when she inexplicably wants to drop everything and get herself killed for absolutely no reason late in the film).
He is completely expressionless throughout the film, and portrays Nostradamus as a rather dislikeable, arrogant person who seems to inexplicably attract the ladies at will.
It's a rather nice dog.
If you are reading this to decide whether to watch the movie or not, I will suggest you to watch movie Snatch rather.
There are far too many films like this that are made or rather 'remade' in Bollywood without rhyme or reason.
Released in 1956, the same year as George Stevens' Giant, Chill Wills must have been been rather amazed to find himself in two such different movie productions in the same year.
Ultimately, I found this film a big disappointment and suggest you read the book rather than endure the film.
Cruz puts in a rather languid performance which is stronger than most of her acting due to the fact she is working with a Spanish (specifically, Catalan) director.
Aside from that, the movie protrays Arab customs rather poorly, on one side, the director of the movie is keen on showing Arab rich people sitting on the ground and eating with their hands from one big plate (to somehoe portray primitivity) and forcing Fonda and Kristofferson to do the same (which doesn't happen in real life, they give guests plates and spoons if they need them), but the director makes a bigger slip of showing them shaking hands with Fonda and sitting right next to her in the dinner.
Starting with the positive: X is pretty to look at and has a great premise - the two opposing sides that make up the narrative have valid reasons for doing what they do, rather than the "we're good and they're evil" style of anime plot writing that is very common.
X (Live Action) ---------------   The idea behind 'X' is rather good.
This leads me to think that perhaps this was a film specifically designed for those which have a great knowledge over the "X" saga, but I would have thought the directors would wish to be inclusive rather than exclusive (I refrained from using the inane 'X' pun).
Let it be felt rather than explained.
I found the better parts of this movie were the parts that actually engaged with the characters' culture instead of using it as an excuse to get all sappy, and I actually rather enjoyed the way the dialog went back and forth between Filipino and English almost breathlessly.
There are exceptions, Joan Severance and Peter Riegert are professsional and competent, but the chaos around them is overwhelming and they would probably rather that this monstrosity was removed from there filmographies!
Since it was the final film of the night, it worked well as a nightcap, or rather sleeping pill.
He'd rather let his son carry the full load of embarrassment himself?
I would have much rather had seen a full-on documentary on the director instead of some avant-garde deconstructionist short film.
Brenda Fricker has a (rather questionable) role as 'The Pigeon Lady' a woman who lives in Central Park and talks to anyone-until Kevin reaches out.
And only then does it sound rather basic.
The scenes of Harry and Marv being tortured almost to death could have sounded awesome if there were a rather more sophisticated soundtrack.
to Prince Nuada as if it's some sort of witty insult, rather than something that nobody has said since fifth grade.
Others probably will find the whole thing rather silly and dull--though I think this gave the film some of its cheesy charm.
This time she is paired with Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and they are a rather attractive couple.....but as usual Bette does not have much to do here except use a phony Southern accent and sport that platinum hair.
It's worth watching just for the ambiance of the early '30s and the rather honest appraisal of the Depression and its effects.
It has also another rather unique aspect: it's a sort of alien-revenge-flick (there aren't many of those, are there?)
It's nice to see him again, but his performance is rather unnoticeable, and you get the idea that he's only any good when he can deliver witty one-liners.
Please, if you take nothing else away from my admitted logorrhea, synthesize this: this movie is awful, Martel likely a hack worthy of condemnation rather than scatologicaly-founded praise, and above all else, I implore you, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!
This is a meandering, rather oddball film which hopefully gave its stars a nice vacation in Italy (at a time when production was booming there), but did nothing for their careers.
This is a rather typical Columbia production -- decent actors thrown into a fairly silly plot where the implausibilities keep piling up.
Indeed, the two characters' personas were deemed so inconsequential that essentially Stiller and Wilson opted to simply play themselves -- or at least dust off their well-used screen images -- rather than to even attempt to find something unique about the characters played by Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul on TV.
So, rather than partying the night away with cheap-o aliens, my friends and I mostly just fell asleep.
Two of the scientists are so blasÃ© they would rather hang around the lodge and play with the ham radio than check out the crash and maybe save someone's life.
Sorry, I have to agree with Leonard Maltin on this rather controversial movie.
He's just retarded in comparison to his father, uglier, has no style, has no ability, is more sickening rather than cute... Storyline was awful.
Term of Trial does not explore the indiscretion, rather it examines our expectation of it.
I would suggest that it is not Auster's choice, rather it's the Moncrieff's choice (and Ebert's bias).
Either way, it's a pretty inaccurate and humourous look at the effects of marijuana on some rather dumb teenagers.
Besides the rather loose and fast rules about drugs (Calling marijuana more dangerous than heroin for example), the producers also tend to have difficulty with things like suspense and continuity.
It's interesting to note how the husband-and-wife relationship shifts constantly as they are confronted by each new setback: at first, George is rather dismissive of his wife, using her primarily to "verify" facts to be later used in the courtroom.
Though she subsequently commits some rather foolish acts, such as handing over George's $200 watch to a strange caped man, the couple do eventually acquire a mutual respect towards each other.
Mickey rather likes the posh life, and the affection of Trevor and his wife Alyce (Marion Burns).
The movie ends rather abruptly, after Letty's friend remembers some incident or other from the boy's infancy, saying something about how cute he was.
It's all rather sick, but not because of the incest issue, which isn't really very shocking due to the ineptness of the script, but more so because of the abominable selfishness and stupidity of the characters.
I actually didn't find too much all that disgusting about the relationship upon which two of the main characters embark, and I find films about unfaithful husbands and wives rather interesting.
Hayden Christensen is a good Anakin Skywalker, the problem was Lucas decided to make Anakin a whiny teenager rather than a young Jedi with demons (e.g.
I'd rather watch Lion King for the 10millionth time with the kids, than watch this one again.
The plot is rather amazing, in that it is simultaneously both poorly-thought-out and amazingly predictable.
In a rather funny sequence, we see Bette going through all sorts of indignities (running in unglamorous sweats; climbing on monkey bars; and not at all looking like the actress who played all those feisty Warner Brothers heroines in the 30's and 40's.)
This inspired my friend and I to watch some Borgnine films, and he suggested this rather obscure yet terrible piece of garbage (though he meant well, and I certainly didn't mind giving it a shot).
The interiors are rather meager and rely on clichÃ©s upon clichÃ©s.
Truly, it was rather painful.
Plus, instead of story, the film is full of rather disjointed sadism and blood-letting.
In hindsight, it probably would have been best to end the film shortly after he finds love, as up until then it was a rather decent (if "boobified") film.
Anyway I was really rather disappointed with this.
So on to the house where people, other than the pool victim, die in rather uninteresting ways and a new heir is on their way to being chosen.
One noteworthy silver lining to  this dark cloud is provided by Sam Elliot who, in a rather cheeky  turn, saunters through a bathroom in his birthday suit (with, it must  be said, absolutely nothing to be ashamed of!).
I went into the movie with rather low expectations, but still i came out totally disappointed.
The camera movement is as uninspired as the script, there seems to be no greater design to the angles chosen, and the editing seems rather random, and does not lend this movie anything in the way of flow.
i liked seeing robert downey jr. he is cool but looked too goofy for a bully; i think he walked off the set of 'back to school' and didnt change his clothes; or rather vice versa.
Seriously... if you have "Mein Kampf" or the communist manifesto - sit down and go through them rather then wasting time on this movie!!!
The only good comments I can make about the whole production is that there's a rather nice musical score lurking somewhere behind everything, and Adam Greenberg's cinematography is rather good.
When you get past the clever wordplay and eccentric characters, the plot is rather mundane.
I only wish the script had given the audience a bit more to chew on, just a little food for thought, a ham hock or two, rather than Pablum.
In all honesty, 80% of this movie is for the most part uninteresting, dealing with romances that I really didn't care about and political machinations that were rather confusing to say the least.
It had a cheap feel right off the top, performances that were plodding and, as an Italian-French production, was rather poorly dubbed into English.
I'm thinking that it's extremely unfortunate, from the perspective of this film or of those who would like to enjoy this film, that Jacques Tourneur seems to have departed from the production rather early.
Instead it features many dialog scenes and a rather dull political story that Bava is unable to make digestible.
In short, this bloke seems to be a rather irritating idiot and, putting it kindly, not exactly authentic in his excessively self-conscious eccentricity.
Stone's delivery is actually very well timed and delivered with aplomb, but this doesn't match the rest of the cast, and it is initially easier to put the blame on him, rather than the real perpetrators of the poor delivery.
Interesting take, but all things considered rather stupid.
"Northfork" adds up to some fine acting weakened by dreary cinematography that fails to make any coherent statement and a muddled story that irritates rather than enthralls.
I would rather watch the worst film by Ed Wood or Edgar G. Ulmer than something like this.
I was turned off by the movie's story.Gradually,the movie became,for me,rather a source of unfavorable comparison with the GREAT Mrs. Moreau movies.She deserved better than this "Lisa".
If anything, rather the opposite.
The weirdest thing I've seen in this film is the "Sensor Recall" device, which basically amounts to the robot being able to see into the past, something that belongs more into the realm of magic rather than science fiction.
There's even the rather inexplicable addition of a police lab robot which acts as a comic-relief (although we don't really need it since the film has enough comedy), even reading comics & being interested in a colleague's fries.
I rather enjoyed the nihilistic tone, and there are moment that you think it MAY get better, sadly like empty promises that never come through, it doesn't.
It's all off-screen which is what makes this film suffer as it is shot rather decently.
When exposed Hunter doesn't care because he's in a rather loveless marriage to the rather frigid Katharine Alexander.
The dialogs are mostly predictable and shallow, and it seems the focus of this movie is on a disappointing 'cool factor' rather than absorbing the viewer into the story.
I would have even rather heard circus music as a soundtrack.
I would have rather watched a film that had yet another group of hapless victims entering the Hive and getting slaughtered...
I saw it rather accidentally all through to the very end as I really wanted to know if every other minute will be as stupid as all the previous.
- Give Andromeda an actual (and completely dumb) origin, rather than leave it mysterious like the novel   - Bore us all to death with environmentalist clichÃ©d 1960s Star Trek-esquire moralising   - Bore us past death to "government conspiracy" plot line that's so horribly overdone   - Provide no reason as to why there was lots of rubble falling down the central shaft  But perhaps the most burning of the flaws with this miniseries was the action that occurred when the nuclear fail-safe was activated.
Besides being motivated by a plot contrivance rather than logically occurring as it did in the novel, it was also horribly dragged out.
Let me first start with saying I rather liked the first three seasons with Prue.
The show started on a rather superficial base and went completely overboard with pointless en unimaginative story lines.
The stories were rather well written, and the acting wasn't bad.
In looking at the more recent seasons, and looking back at some of the worst parts of the older ones, I have come to this conclusion: Charmed is a rather bad show.
Back then, the episodes were rather grounded and serious.
The offense here is not that the cast is at least, admirable, but rather that the writer and the writing steals from the pain of others.
Herzog's strict adherence to the text eschews the opportunities afforded by film and left me feeling rather bereft...
I could have accepted a lot of the 'artistic license' used in this film if it were claiming to be a movie based on fact, rather than presenting itself as a documentary.
That's probably incorrect and doesn't represent the original theatrical release, but rather some random individual's timing from a DVD or VHS tape that wasn't complete in the first place.
On watching, I found the storyline of this production rather fanciful.
It reads well as a synopsis but feel that emotional immaturity of the production has been reflected in rather major flaws in the logic of the plot and consequent over dramatisation by actors that would, under other directorship, produced sterling performances.
I think the problem is that Rescue Me often times feels like a sitcom rather than an action/comedy.
Conclussion: if you like Donnie Yen, try and watch "Heroes among Heroes", his cameos in "Shanghai Knights", "Highlander:Endgame", "Blade II", or the original Monkey (All but Blade are recommended) rather than this.
The camera work is bad (I actually spotted one instance of camera shake in this film), the fight scenes are poorly choreographed and badly executed, the dialogue is a bit iffy at best and is rather clichÃ©d at times and the stereotypes of Colombian drug lords are laughable.
What makes the film also rather cheesy is the editing at some points.
The opening scene where trained assassin Stallone suddenly develops a conscience is stupid, the scene in the police station where James Woods threatens an entire room of cops with a homemade bomb is ridiculous as the cops would have shot his head off, the sex scene between Stallone & Stone is one of the most unerotic & frankly ugly pieces of film I've ever seen & James Woods losing it in front of all those cops & telling them all to shut up is just hilarious & his character comes across like some sort of clown rather than the hard as nails bad guy he should have.
It's as if the filmmakers had no previous experiences with the franchise (whether it be the movies, cartoons, or comics) and, rather than pull from existing popular story arcs, writer/director Stuart Gillard thought to himself, "What would be a WACKY adventure for these guys?
It's all really rather lame and I find myself unable to get worked up enough to either praise or damn the movie with any energy.
I will never know what persuaded Elias Koteas to return as Casey Jones (and, in fact, as a glutton for punishment he takes on TWO roles this time around though neither of them get that much screen time) but he's a small ember of enjoyment in a rather stinky quagmire of a movie.
While the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles will never be confused with the likes of RoboCop, the first film went back to the roots of the original comic book and depicted a world that was, for all intents, rather dark.
The first 2 had a rather believable Splinter but now he's juddering and stiff and obviously operated by a couple of technicians loitering a few feet off camera.
By discussing their various theories, they form communities and reinforce their mass delusion that the game had depth, rather than a simple lack of proper presentation.
When the final sequence of events took place, I could not help but feel cheated at the rather superficial treatment of the primary issues that the filmmakers were attempting to address - especially considering all of the screen time that was literally wasted during the first 75% of the film.
Possibly I don't know , but he directs CONFIDENCE in an entirely fast paced way , rather like " MTV Meets The Coen Brothers " which may give audience members a potential headache  Despite the directing which comes across as garish and shallow we're left with a movie that is let down by the script and one can't help thinking the screenplay is what caused the director to look for Scorsese's CASINO for inspiration .
This is a rather tedious, unoriginal movie, with none of the snappy, quick dialogue that films of this era often display.
Lance Peters's script seems to be a formula of what people think a Carry On is about, rather than a film in its own right, while the overlong scenes and flat direction justify why this one killed the series off.
A film which has very little to offer other than racial hatred and some rather disturbing scenes of violence.
A supposedly realistic account of the destiny of various Cubans Âamong thousands- who sailed from Havana to Florida in the early 1990's to escape Fidel Castro's regime, I find rather curious how the filmmakers move at ease from Havana to GuantÃ¡namo or Florida, and are always in the right place, in the right time.
It's difficult, while watching this Giovanni flick ,not to think of Jacques Becker's "le trou" (1959) ,the script of which he wrote.But whereas the heroes of Becker's masterpiece were digging a hole to escape from jail,the "heroes" of " les egouts" are digging a tunnel to rob a bank.The characters are not endearing ,former firebrands ,although the lead rather recalls some kind of "true life" ArsÃ¨ne Lupin ,but a humorless Lupin.One does not see why one should take an interest in those men (and woman).Robin Hoods ,they definitely are not.
Other than the 3 points I pointed out, the movie is plucky and it has a rather moving ending.
The running scenes were a work of art, the actors choosing to jog rather than run from their attackers as they were gripped with too much fear to use their legs properly.
Forget about any hordes of zombies rising from the lake as suggested on the DVD/video artwork, it doesn't happen as this is a straight faced ghost story rather than a zombie film.
Then she is taken hostage by somebody in a hotel in south africa (She chooses just to wait there rather than escape).
Comments: A rather uneventful and badly acted western.
The Three Stooges play the most insipid group of firemen ever on the screen, and it is rather insulting to the profession to even see this presented on screen.
OK, I can't think of a third good film struggling to get out - but what we are left with is a rather dreary flick that struggles to get out of second gear.
But the plot, such as it is, follows Raymond Chandler rather closely otherwise.
I found the apartment rather charming, a hell of an improvement over this abandoned railway car that I live in.
I will concede that had more effort been given to fleshing out the story and had the producers picked a real editor and had a real score been made for the film rather than that awful 70s-like soundtrack used and had some more realistic special effects other than blue screens and the like been used - then, yes, this might have been somewhat decent.
I even rather like very bad movies.
In this near-copy of Dirty Dancing, the acting by Julia Stiles is nothing short of atrocious, full of indication and melodrama, rather than real, in-the-moment expression.
Jeff Fahey, plays Richard Murray a pathologist who really just does paperwork rather than examine bodies, and is haunted by the death of his wife, begins to receive messages from the dead of murder victims of a serial killer.
I WANTED to like it, but I think I'd rather watch Nastassja read the phone book, with her OWN hair.
The story, rather than having much of anything to do with a mental institution OR the plague, is about an orphanage in which a series of terrible thing happened to five of the orphans.
Had this shied away from the punk-teen angle (like that of Bava's 'Demons') and headed for straight horror (maybe on the level of 'El Orfanato'), it could've had the chance to be a rather good film.
I just cannot say one good thing about this movie; I'd rather watch tv-shop for two hours than this one again.
I Thank the heavens that a good 20 minutes of this movie was cut for theatrical release because it just made the pacing even worse!, most of the footage cut was more pointless forced comedy moments and the only high point of the footage being reinserted for the Extended TV Version shown numerous times in the late eighties were the newly created opening credits in space, rather then the credits appearing during the opening montage in the theatrical cut.
I would put the blame squarely at the feet of Lester and the Salkinds, who seemed to want to make a "Richard Pryor" Superman movie rather than a film that was true to the spirit of the characters and the original film.
When you're laughing at a film, rather than with it, it's trespassed the lines of parody.
Well, look no further than Stacy, a movie built more around odd voice overs rather than the typical tenants that drive the zombie film genre.
I'd much rather see a piece of crap film like this one and laugh my ass off at it.
This time, however, the movie is a bit different, as the extras are all Korean AND their command of English is amazingly bad--so bad that it's rather funny to hear some of them stumble over even the simplest words.
There are unnecessary subplots involving a rather bland-looking actress and her boyfriend as well as a Colonel who is a total idiot (and needs a good haircut to even remotely look military) and curses CONSTANTLY--possibly more than any character in the 1970s.
Some moments were funny but the entire plot line was just a little too....clichÃ© and rather stupid.
The plot is pointless, the way some of the actors {Anne Judson-Yager} cheer is very annoying.I'd rather watch a blank screen for days then watch this movie for even five minutes.
But if it's something like this one, i rather not..
I LOVE the Bring It On series and I actually do prefer the straight-to-DVD films rather than the original (my opinion!
I strongly suggest that those who love Freddie Prinze, Jr. should stare at his picture for 90 minutes rather than paying $8 to endure this torturous abomination.
There are various mistakes & errors & the special effects are generally poor except a rather good stop-motion animated toy soldier at the end.
After having seen the gory and over-the-top silly "Dr. Giggles" hundreds of times and loving it more with every viewing, it's rather difficult to accept that Manny Coto's debut film "Playroom" is such an ambitious and serious-minded psycho thriller.
Jake seems rather uninterested when he is informed that Muslim extremists in the north of Thailand have kidnapped his daughter, but that's only a cover for his apparent unlimited rage, at least according to the tag line.
Even though they're rather cool, they're as far from the typical Seagal fighting style that it's possible to be.
I am loathe to say this as I rather enjoyed having a proxy version of my favourite (London) past time - watching people.
The script is poor; characters pause too long to deliver lines (probably scripted and not the actor's fault), or say rather pointless, uninteresting things.
The characters were already rather despicable and unrealistic, so you just don't even care about them.
I would much rather have my kids watch something they know is not real and not intended to be real, such as a good fantasy movie that may have some questionable content, than encourage them to watch something crappy and misleading, masquerading as "real" and "good".
I'd rather watch the cheaper and dafter "Starcrash" anytime over this.
The movie basically revolves around mummy curses rather than an actual mummy.
Now, if you're that is not to say I hated this, but rather I expected lots more here.
And the mummy is incredibly cheesy, looking rather like Eddie, Iron Maiden's concert mascot.
The Legend of the Mummy is so bad, I would rather have my brain removed through my nose and my innards scooped out and placed in jars than watch it again.
Although it did have a rather contrived sub-plot which was even worse than the already almost non existent one.
Yes, this film was mostly annoying for 90% of the time and never funny, which is rather vital for a comedy...
At two hours long, it is a true endurance test, particularly considering that I would have gotten up and left after 10 minutes (or, rather, not gone at all) if I hadn't been dragged to it by someone else.
It starts out as a woman trying to take control of her life and ends up depicting her as an obsessive, submissive nut who is convinced she married the best man at her wedding rather than the groom.
The most interesting part of this documentary, rather than the heroin scene with Steven Drozd, is Wayne revisiting his old Long John Silver's and enlisting two young children to reenact a robbery which launches him into a spiel about the rather un-poetic reality of death.
The reason I went ahead to see this flick was because of the near 6 vote it had and much of the commentary which was rather positive.
Miss Davis looks like she would rather be somewhere else and has little to do.
Oh yea, and the characters have rather stupid names and act in a too hysterical way.
The story revolves around three troubled sisters in a Southern town, who reunite when the youngest, Babe (rather a bizarre character), gets herself in a jam after shooting her husband.
Taylor Negron and Diane Delano play an older couple who are rather repulsive.
I though I would never say this, but I'd rather watch a Uwe Boll movies instead of this.
I find Abhishek Bachchan rather charming and Aishwarya is obviously divine, so I expected quite an entertainment.
The story is rather regular but lacks of charm and character.
There are a few rather embarrassingly long close-ups of him making some ridiculously 'serious' face.
Aishwarya wears some rather ugly clothes all the time which is even worse considering the fact that she plays a designer...   And what's up with the synopsis in the middle?
But they're upsetting less on account of any contemporary resonance that might echo in the wake of 9/11 -- truth to tell, there isn't any such resonance, anyway -- and rather more because of the realisation that one has coughed up Â£3 25p in order to view a movie with so little idea of the rules of engagement where audiences are concerned that writer and director ought to get back (or possibly,enroll) in the nearest neighbourhood film school as soon as possible.
And why would the NSA and the ambassador (whose life was saved by the colonel) rather see a war hero executed than an aging ambassador lose his job and the Yemeni government embarrassed?
Or if Jones's character had uncovered ANY evidence that supported the colonel's story or contradicted the official version, rather than making it a matter of faith.
It's certainly one of John Garfield's best roles, finally getting into the ring: the play Golden Boy had been written for him only for the producers to cast him in a supporting role instead, so there's an element of unfinished business here, though Abraham Polonsky's script is much better that Odets' rather patronising fairytale.
That said the cast do seem more interested in giving good performances rather than enjoying themselves which isn't always the case with movies with a large cast of big names .
And, the film begins rather well as a typical melodrama with a double tragedy.
Surely Gordon didn't spend all his money on the cast: Marjoe Gortner, Ralph Meeker, Pamela Franklin, and most especially Ida Lupino all look as if they'd rather be elsewhere.
Since comedy seems to be what this movie was to be about and the pace seems intended to be rather fast - maybe they should have gone for a director who could make something out of it?
The only element that has the slight bit of remote interest is Randy Quaid as a rather quirky bodyguard robot.
My only complaint about the movie is that details on the band's history and specific works by them are rather skimpy.
Perhaps it was her reaction to a camera instead of an actor that made Audrey Totter seem chilled in their "scenes" together rather than Claire Trevor's cold hearted user and Lauren Bacall's cool cynic in the earlier Marlowe incantations.
I rather enjoy watching Dolph Lundgren making an ass of himself instead watch this movie again.
In the first part of the film, obviously wholly lacking in any meaningful direction, she tries to portray the flighty young Anne but does so as a 2008 girl, complete with the same knowing looks and arrogant insouciance you would expect to find in that wonderful satire 'Clueless' (1995), rather than in a period drama.
I rather doubt it.
I think Jeffrey Tambor is a fine actor, but Jill's character tries to make us believe he's rather desirable when he's rather overweight, with jowls like Droopy the dog (yes!
I rather see something interesting yet loosely based on fact than something closer to the truth yet of the quality of a dramatization in a documentary.
Sadly it turned out to be rather boring.
Though he's supposed to be a powerful and deadly force of nature, he actually comes across as a rather dopey circus creature who wouldn't hurt a fly.
The book, upon which the movie is based, has some Socratic undercurrent; the movie "cleverly" translates it into dogmatism (with a hammer over your head) rather than irony (if any questions are raised by Fernando, they just hover in the vacuum of the director's confused efforts to figure out where his movie is going.)
I think I would rather watch Orca for 72 hours then watch this again.
One major turn-off for me was the rather gaudy, tacky, cheaply-made look of the film.
In fact, the whole thing looks rather false and plastic!!
The film's "plot" (if you can call it a plot) is merely a derivative for a rather predictable and stale girl-on-girl love story.
All of the actors seem as though they would rather be somewhere else.
I'd rather nail my eyelids to the floor than sit through this tripe again.
A movie only for those who collect quantity, rather than quality.
Still, there are flares of inspiration - or rather, imitation with skill.
Of course he does it really well ... filling out some rather ugly 80s-wear very nicely indeed.
I was rather appalled to see this movie so many people are mad about - and to see that it's nothing else but a meaningless bunch of fight scenes, full of blood and bad taste.
My score of 3/10 reflects Kirk Douglas' reliable work and the rather good set design.
The list is rather impressive, with "Star Wars", "2001 Â A Space Odyssey", "Alien", "Zardoz" and "Dark Star" as the most obvious ones.
but, at least, Harvey Keitel brought to it his typical intensity and intelligence - though I'm sure it's a film he'd rather forget.
The film emerges as a rather muddled and unappealing mess, with flashes of eroticism and very sporadic flashes of action.
The saccharine sweet narration can be rather vomit inducing at times, however in places it is delivered in a dull, lifeless monotone.
There is an excessive amount of pyrotechnics used to stage various explosions making the whole affair feel rather fake and forced.
It is rather inconceivable to know that the show's producer & writer is none other than Ash Atalla, the producer of The Office.
Mind you, a zombie movie where the undead pose less of a threat than humans is rather anticlimactic.
The way directors Michael Bartlett and Kevin Gates arrange the stories rather bugged me, truth be told, because they had opened the film with a young news crew heading outside London into the country to film an interview piece, and then completely abandon them.
Whoever plays the pitiful old shopkeeper rather embarrassingly seems to break character a couple times.
That is not obvious here, rather, Steven Soderberg's film goes the longest way possible to get a conclusion that is obvious, if indeed the film has a conclusion in the first place.
It's rather like being trapped watching the home movies of a group of very artsy, very neurotic, very self centered, and ultimately very boring people.
All-in-all I really hope that schools in England are, or were, not as depicted in this movie, and that actual teachers and Dons at Oxford take offence rather than sympathise with this shocker.
This transcends the "so bad it's good" genre so completely that it has created a new "so bad I'd rather be tortured by the Stasi" categorisation.
The acting is rather unrealistic, the characters couldn't make you care less and the plot evolves unbelievably slow.
There is a dog and also an unfunny butler and maid...all in all a rather talky movie with a lame monster that appears here and there.
I made the mistake of starting to watch rather late one night, and found that my eyelids were drooping so badly that I had to stop the tape halfway through and continue the next day.
It is, however, rather watchable in an odd sort of way... Not quite in the Plan 9 fashion, where you're left laughing all the time, because the production values here aren't all that bad for the time.
Most of the fun is in observing these hapless, smug characters - only just managing to keep within some rather ropey genre conventions - and finding the unintended mirth in what they say and do.
Darkly comic tale, brightly-produced yet full of cynicism, has brief moments that go out on a limb, but is ultimately a rather formulaic "Heathers" knock-off.
This film was a disaster at the box office, cause it was produced for a rather large amount of money.
Maureen Lipman as the unaffectionate Miss Minchin was excellent as well-I couldn't have envisioned a better interpretation.Her authoritative nature,absolute conviction in herself, business-like mind, made her the unchallenged captain of her ship; she was a born leader, and relished conducting her crew with the correctitude she deemed right.She would ceremoniously give a speech to "her young ladies", as on Sara's birthday or before the Christmas dispersal of the pupils, and characteristically clear her throat when effectuating what she considered a rather jocular statement intended for the younger girls, as she did before announcing in an incidental manner her message from Father Christmas.A great touch that I thought went just right with her character.
The younger brother Josh, live a messy but rather okay life, he hang out with his friends, doing silly things.
Whining about fabric that should be maroon rather than cerise, Watson underscores filmdom's concept that gays are silly, shallow freaks with no values of consequence in their lives.
It can be called action just because there are few fights, and sick not because there are poor filmed few tortures, and not because of sick idea of story, but rather because of sea sick that viewer gets, because of camera shooting.
Perhaps the filmmakers didn't have enough faith in their leads to provide realistic combat, but it's a shame that, burdened by the rather thin story-line, it can not deliver on what it's supposed to.
Then I realised I'd rented it a couple of weeks before and rather enjoyed it.
The musical scene at the restaurant reminded me of old Yeller (someone please shoot him or rather me).
Most of the movie is spent searching rather than studying.
and "Close Encounters" are top-notch, although the aliens in "Close Encounters" were rather disappointing at the end (a bunch of bald little people surrounding a tall bald anorexic - a benevolent Ann Coulter without the hair).
Dialogue is, in fact, rather scant.
It was shown during a holiday season station fund-raiser and promoted by ghastly comments by an attractive Â physically Â woman who made the sorts of comments I would expect a rather silly grandmother to make to someone else's grandchild.
And after this he becomes, well, not any kind of ancestral hominid but rather an ape-headed hairy monster whose idea of decorum is to smash furniture and tear cops limb from limb during his blackouts.
She also has a rather effective strip scene, removing her gown inviting pleasure.
All in all this film was fun for a laugh and making this review, I recycled the box for another DVD and the disc itself has ended up a rather artistic drinks coaster.
Musharaf used the paramilitary Northern Light Infantry, and irregulars to attack India, not with the objective of winning, because you don't use paramilitary forces against India if you are serious about winning, but rather to scupper the possible peace deal between the two nations.
FINAL VOYAGE must be the full scale cringe on the resume for both Dylan Walsh and (the ridiculously named) Ice T. For this he should be billed Ice Berg...but that sounds like a Jewish Eskmo rather than a black man.
Generally thought to be the first official Laurel and Hardy release(although PUTTING PANTS ON PHILLIP is also put in this bracket),the boys don't wear their Bowler hats and have their heads shaved,but are very much a team in this early effort,more so than PPOP where they play against each other rather than for.There's plenty of amusing incident and situations(especially when they attempt to escape the jail as painters);one slight quibble is that as convicts,the characters they have to play here have a very slightly more unpleasing edge than they would be establishing only a few films later in the partnership.Still funny though,and Jimmy Finlayson's double take and fade away is worth a few more laughs as well here;in early publicity material the boys were sometimes billed as 'Hardy and Laurel' in this film;that soon changed.
Luggage is in below decks storage rather than in people's staterooms, as if it were an airplane.
But I'd rather watch a fun horror flick with bad actors than a clunker like this with decent actors.
Okay, I rather liked that one.
Hell Night is a series of rather lame characters not doing very much interspersed with a couple of rather lame deaths committed by a rather lame maniac.
In fact it's rather boring.
Linda Blair seems a bit bored all the way through and her acting is rather limp.
This is probably the scriptwriter's fault rather than the actors, though, as the the pace of the plot really didn't allow for the characterisations to be expanded upon.
Without being a "spoiler" did it not seem to anyone else that the movie simply ended rather abruptly??
The British troops had witnessed day upon day of hellish bombardment of the German positions and a lot of British soldiers had begun to feel rather sorry for Jerry , and no one but no one in the British lines had any reason to doubt anything less than a swift , spectacular British victory .
but the rest is rather poor history and a rather poor film that seems to have homo erotic undertones
By definition, I'd really refer to this as a shocker film rather than as a scary movie.
I would rather watch Alec and Kim in The Getaway(1994) which I thought was a lot better than the 1972 original.
It has practically nothing to make it worth recommending, only those very few distant things mentioned above and I think it is rather impossible to watch this film again.
Then there's the matter of the radiation measuring devices they wave around reading the rather trivial level of only about 2 mr/hr or less (it plainly says so in the on-screen close up) while the scientists act as if this were a deadly amount.
Until tragedy brings everyone together, the characters are fairly exasperating--and, since the characters also function as gags, the "comedy" is rather mean-spirited.
I didn't think Kitt Kittredge: An American Girl could've been an exception to the rule, but I was hoping it kind of would because I thought the atypical scenario, different era and diverse cast could have delivered a rather unique movie.
It's not that this movie was bad, but for a theatrical release it's rather pallid.
It feels rather like Saturday morning cartoons to me.
I'm not the target audience here, but my cousin and her friends are, they were rather bored.
I'd rather have that ninety minutes of my life back.
Diane Lane is (or rather was) a favorite actor of mine, and I am disappointed that she would participate in a piece of garbage like this.
A big disappointment is that there is no "twist" as you see who the killer is fairly early on, and the motivation for the killer's actions is rather weak.
For example, rather poor acting from John Wayne, Pedro ArmendÃ¡riz, and Thomas Gomez, laughable dialogue, most of the dialogue in the movie was totally modern talk!
And not from fans of the actual movies, but rather from the series instead, which was mildly entertaining but had no real story to it.
But I would rather let everyone see the TV movie.
And I would rather have had the last motion picture be the the final chapter of this saga.
there is NOTHING about this movie, absolutely nothing, worth watching NOTHING  if you liked the movie, if you liked the series, do yourself a HUGE favor, do NOT WATCH this  1) the music is terrible (cheap at best)   2) the writing is so amazingly bad   3) talking heads, rather than acting   4) stilted acting, wooden heads reading lines from cue cards   5) worthless directing   6) INANE dialog   7) the ending?
The direction tries to seem cool but it ends up rather boring, and the acting is poor.
The two stars are rather over-the-hill for the genre.
To even think of this movie as a thriller is impossible: the focus is more on the Baldwin and Swanson characters rather than developing a true thriller plot of who is killing all these people.
The plot changes are ridiculous: Larry drives an ambulance instead of flying a plane; he goes with Gray rather than by himself; Sophie and her husband are married at the beginning rather than later; Larry and Isabel sleep with each other; Sophie's a prostitute instead of a whoreÂ and she falls truly in love with Larry rather than dutifully, as she does in the novelÂthe only way that her leaving him makes sense.
Gray, rather than being the commonplace everyman, is instead some spidery sort supposedly war-mates with LarryÂa foolish depth to a relationship better left at its tenuous state, as the book does.
In order for Larry's character to make sense, he needs to be left alone during the war, rather than have some mate from Chicago there to observe his transition.
The end result is a palate of flat, rather dull characters who belong to a soap opera rather than the host created by Maugham, individuals who make poor decisions at times, but who, nonetheless, we can never wholly condemn.
Animated children's movies should really stick to real fairy tales rather than manufacturing them out of grim novels and grimmer history.
The match day is worth watching but it may render you only sad because everything that comes before it is rather unpleasant.
Strange gave a much stronger impression of willful mastery of magic, yet here he is rather the reluctant hero, which was never present in the original.
All in all, this Strange fan was sadly disappointed in a film which seems sloppily tossed-off without careful consideration for the original source as well as a rather Saturday morning effort on the part of the filmmakers towards the technical side of the film.
The non-existent chemistry between her and Krasinski makes for a rather redundant romance, as neither fails to captivate the audience or capture their sympathies in the slightest.
I'd rather see you retire than flush the rest of your career down the tubes.
The only thing that makes me give this 3 rather than 1 star is that I like the actors.
Unfortunately, the movie goes to such extremes that we are not so much charmed by Frank, rather we are terrified by him.
I walked in rather neutral with my expectations, and after the first 10 minutes realized that this ball of cheese was not for me.
The problem is not that its so bad as to be bad, rather its because its so badly paced that its really really dull.
But the acting do not elevate the average at all, so it is rather poor too.
", rather than hugging and shaking hands with your friends that have just come back from a dangerous mission!!
I would much rather use my own humor to make my own jokes to degrade this movie.
I rather watch MR.Hands.
Leonardo promptly appropriates all of Archimedes' ideas, proving that he was a lucky idiot rather than any kind of genius.
Some families are broken as shown in this movie, but unfortunately, those same families will walk away from watching this movie feeling vindicated in living this lifestyle rather than seeing this as an embarrassment to their lifestyle.
My nightmare scenario would be to suffer sudden total paralysis in front of a TV when this movie comes on and therefore to be unable to either suicide or destroy the television, rather than watch it again.
The plot, about a town in a cotton pickin' county, is rather lame, involving a dishonest female judge and a sleazy cotton grower.
Now, things got off to a good start, and I do have to give the movie credit for showing rather than telling: as Jayce first walks the halls of her new school, the camera pans to show the very revealing clothing worn by many girls.
I used to hate the music from Fito Paez, but I beg to God that the guy stays on that s*** rather than go back and make another movie...latin american cinema is low on resources, they shouldn't be wasted on films like this.
I found the books to be interesting but the show was never enough to scare even a 6-year-old, and I wondered why Stine was actually the host on this show rather than rejecting writers Billy Brown & Dan Angel and hunting for someone more faithful.
Unlike anything else I've seen, this film showed the young mother's perspective and I could actually feel Jacey's pain as she didn't know whether she'd rather have her baby or keep her secret.
The Visitors come across as imbeciles rather than ruthless villains.
There, lots of John Waters' friends roam doing rather random stuff as Pearce lays there looking comatose.
It speaks to the contempt that the film's producers hold for the American viewing public that they had to use Khruschev because his name might be recognized rather than present historical fact.
This film was a solid attempt to reach people with the Gospel of Jesus while still portraying him as the Messiah rather than just a spiritual leader.
There was nothing that great about this movie, and a few things that were rather annoying.
By the time the end sequence came around I was rather bored, and the ending, although good, couldn't make up for the earlier scenes.
And the action was rather bad too.
For my time, I would much rather watch a Charlie Chan, Saint or Sherlock Holmes film--they seemed to have better production values and writing as well as a leading man that was more likable.
But sadly it's all let down by its camp atmosphere, ridiculous psychedelic images, extended concert scenes and that rather irritating young boy.
Not to mention those pointless cartoons which turn Hedorah into a figure of fun rather than the serious threat he is supposed to be.
The production looks good (particularly when Valli is led down into her cell, or when Peck inspects her glamorous bedroom), but the courtroom showdown is rather rote, as is the finale.
Chasing continues and rather bland uninteresting dialogue ensue until they run into Red Green.
It consists of a rather ugly older couple getting frisky with each other and culminates in a brief but sweet kiss.
The acting is decent and the directing is OK, but this does not save it from being extremely painful to watch, I would rather burn alive than see this piece of crap again.
I think I found her character funny, mostly because of her rather disgusting appearances and behavior.
Also most color schemes are rather dark, except for the halls in the apartment block and Vecino's apartment as it is there that consolation is found by both women.
Its style is rather distant, so expect no cheap sentiment here.
and tons of gratuitous nudity--with women who looked rather skanky.
In other words, voices were added in some scenes and the voices were too soft and rather garbled--sort of like the way Popeye talked to himself in cartoons!
The only saving grace to all this is that the film is rather short.
I would rather read Times of India.
Wallace Ford is a rather obnoxious reporter (a standard clichÃ© of the day) who is assigned to Chinatown due to some suspicious murders.
Easily the least of the series, there's really very little to recommend here other than the rather cool final fight between Chiba and his nemesis (in other words just fast forward to the end)  Overall then, this proves to be a somewhat sad way to end the series.
It starts out as a rather intriguing character study in a beautiful agrarian setting.
Duncan is also rather stupid.
The actors are great, and there are a few suspenseful scenes, and Duncan is rather lovable if you don't think much about it, but if I weren't an Emile Hirsch or Thomas Guiry fan, I'd skip it.
A film so bad that halfway through I found myself wondering if the production company could have gotten away with paying the actors who portrayed Henry less for a non-speaking role (the character is mute) rather than following the story.
In all honesty it's what I would have expected - amusing rather than outright funny and with a somewhat confusing story that held my interest but was never well enough explained.
Supposedly Carl Reiner was responsible for this mess, but I find that rather incredible.
The acting is nonexistent because the narrator frequently reports character speech in third person rather than the actors speaking.
The result is all of the characters seem like cardboard cut outs rather than real people.
Personally I would rather watch the version by Raymond Bernard again or almost any of the other version of the story.
The sequence of meeting Marius in the convent is rather random, as is Marius' later accusation of Valjean being in love with Cosette.
But rather, you're always careful to hold on the words of the character, sure that you're able to put the mystery together, but there really is no mystery.
As for Jackie Gleason, I heard that "The Honeymooners" was actually a rather cruel show, so it's not really any surprise that his role here is a piece of drudgery.
The special effects are fine but the story is rather hammy and the performances are not very good.
Unfortunately rather overlooked as this film came out the same year as AlmodÃ³var's 'Todo Sobre mi Madre' which went on to reach fame and glory.
Ana FernÃ¡ndez is magnificent, playing just right the rather confused, unlucky thirty-five year old young woman a bit given to alcohol, not overplaying her part; MarÃ­a Galiana as her mother shows even at her age that she has come from good theatre, as no less does Carlos Ãlvarez-Novoa as the lonely neighbour.
Jim Swaffield's rather perfunctory committal of R Kelly's plan to video must rank, in both senses, alongside.
The English dubbed version is very weak and I found ALL the voices rather annoying.
Although just over an hour long, this amateurish home-invasion exploitationer is still rather tedious stuff, being extremely slow and very predictable.
It also features a poorly developed plot and characters (apparently due to a rather rushed production in order to meet distributors demands), several totally unbelievable moments (Lisa being able to dismember one attacker in the bath unseen, and then even convince the gullible 'nice guy' that his partner in crime did it!)
The story is rather dull with almost no action and the characters are very stereotypical.
There's no gore, just some blood which was rather fake, red paint that was way to bright.
I guess we have institutions like The Daily Mail to thank for this film; not for the making of it, but rather for the fact that it still has audience when it should have been forgotten along with most of the rest of the Last House on the Left rip-off's almost thirty years ago.
A lot of Slice of Life movies since the late forties seem to me to be rather pointless, rather tragic - or worse - both!
The ending does come rather abruptly.
To sum up, "Kiss Daddy Goodnight" is rather disappointing.
Most of the story is a heavy-handed commentary on religion, war and the use of nuclear weapons - the dialogue is so pompous and the idea so pretentious that most of the acting seems more fit for the stage rather than the screen.
The other characters are developed rather nicely.
Frankly, I'd rather the film didn't make any money so that would teach Michael Keaton a lesson.
Indeed, there is some rather nasty gore on display; but it's nowhere near as gory as the best films that this genre has to offer, and the gore is hardly shocking as the whole production is so badly done.
Needless to say, the plot doesn't really go anywhere and the overall effect is really rather dull.
I would rather have a TangÂ® colonic than be forced to watch this movie again.
Despite the rather grim & glum nature of the film, there is an underlying current of humour that's a welcome breath of fresh air.
You may have to search this one out a bit, as it was originally produced in 2006, but has been getting rather scatter shot distribution.
Bit disappointed, it could have been a really entertaining movie, rather than the cringe it turned out to be.
The film ultimately is about watching Bradley and company mowing down men dressed up because real ninja would have finished them off rather quickly.
The Werewolf Shadow lacks the gore and gratuitous nudity that usually make these affairs bearable, and despite some unintentionally chuckle-worthy moments, the film is rather slow and uneventful.
There's basically no gore whatsoever and the few death scenes, are rather effortless and insipid.
Without giving too much away, let's just say that many a time, you're wondering: "Gee, why would ANYBODY like that annoying, obnoxious, selfish pig of an executive, especially his own rather good-looking wife and a supermodel... who, of course, has an indefatigable heart of gold?"
To give you an idea how awful it is - i rather watch a movie with Paris Hilton.
I'd rather be water-boarded than watch this filth again.
And crashing down it does and not in the good 'bashing your opponents face into the pavement' way, but rather in the bland character's, bad acting, convoluted and totally unbelievable story kind of way.
The end give's us a nice little hook to see the next one as they mention Ryu and the Street Fighter Tournament, but if the same writer and director are to do it, I rather save my money and avoid watching it, especially if Charlie Nash (Chris Klein)will be in it.
I would rather down a bottle of Ipecac than watch five minutes of this "movie" again.
Most of the movie looks rather like a bunch of giddy little high school girls doing a project for the lit.
Henry Thomas was much better in E.T., and even he seems to realize there just isn't much to work with in this tired story of the boy with a penchant for fantasy who isn't believed when something rather fantastic actually happens.
However, as widow whose main employment seems to have been as a lady who lunches, her work skills are rather non-existent.
However, she eventually finds salvation in the sex trade as an unlikely sex worker however a rather talented one at that.
If you wanna see dumb entertainment that is popular today, pathetic excuse for a characters and story, Christian Troy's ass in every episode and some gross but rather impressive surgical scenes than this show is great for you.
As a younger viewer, it has a certain appeal but seeing it endlessly churned out nowadays on Challenge TV I am only able to see it for the rather corny and cheesy show it is.
In the case of "Love Affair" people should watch opera rather than this genre -- I highly recommend "Carmen" with Julia Miguenes-Johnson and Placido Domingo (1984) -- the epitome of a love affair as immortal as always!
The thing that makes giallo films great is surprising, if sometimes rather unbelievable, plot twists.
The performances are all rather flat too and most of the actors look about as bored as I must have looked watching the film.
Well, yes, we get this rather soon, and then we suffer through the restÂ Perhaps slow movies are not exact equivalents of slow food, after all.
This is a woman who just happens to belong to a rather dangerous looking Japanese man.
Can we really watch a movie lasting almost two hours just for its stunning cinematography and some glimpse of storytelling, or should it rather be the other way around?
Very quickly I didn't find it entertaining (the initial allure of Lauren Jones' looks wore off rather fast), but since it was the premier episode I decided I would give it a chance and stick with the show for the entire half hour.
Silly innocuous girl, she kept saying she was nearly 21 but acted around 14, had her head in a bottle - presumably spent the last 4 years at college learning to hold her liquour - at her sister's wedding, in a rather odd bridesmaid's dress, met the man she was to spend the rest of the movie with.
Though I believe it could have been magical, and it did begin well, to my disappointment, the journey and end were ultimately rather ridiculous and pretentious.  
These were some of the things that really grated: Complete absence of likeable characters (he a sad lech, she a dimwitted girlie, her family standard-issue clichZd stiffs, and a pathetic rent-a-bohemian crowd whose role in the movie was decorative (as in house plants) rather than integral).
To cap it all, Lancaster's every phrase and action that of a theatrical acting student performing Native-American-Warrior-by-way-of-Julliard, rather than that of battle-worn, open-sky-raised Apache.
Even Lancaster's motivation was so milky-white, you could healthily breast-feed your baby with it: victim of the almost Nazi-like racial cleansing of the late 1800s, of the Native American peoples by the Amerikan Military, his aspirations were NOT to challenge the White Eyes over rightful claim to The Land, but rather, to ASSIMILATE into the white community by GROWING CORN alongside his oppressors and raising kids in that enslaved environment.
It could have been a lot better if attention had been focused on the story and the characters rather than a bizarre twist that you end up waiting for, in the hope that the film can regain the energy that it has gradually lost since it began.
the house, then returns home...giving up rather easily on the woman he supposedly loves.
The over-reactions of characters at times leaves us feeling like we are looking at children rather than adults.
The fact that the husband rather than the wife initially died really didn't move me.
Also the film had a rather sexist view of women.
I would have preferred the film to concentrate on the characters a bit more rather than just sketching them as one dimensional stereotypes.
Well, my friends, that's why the world keeps shunning this film as an excuse to make money rather than a legitimate work of art.
after watching his zombie-mother be splattered by a Humvee one character remains in a rather jolly mood), and painfully clichÃ© stereotypes (the token "gangster" black guy wielding a makeshift bone saw-taped-to-a-broom scythe with ninja-like precision) defying the laws of physics.
Shirley Walker used Elfman's theme in this one and used it well, she also created her own themes and did a great job of not letting the music get too loud but rather score the emotions that the characters are feeling.
I can only assume that people rate it highly because of the significance of Watergate rather than the actual movie.
Director Ferrera plays a struggling New York City who lives in a tiny apartment with his girlfriend and her rather annoying best friend.
I'm actually rather surprised that DRILLER KILLER made it into the infamous "Video Nasties" list.
Another interesting and rather rare touch is the fact that the scriptwriters made a real effort to have the characters speak as people of the time would have.
It is degrading to the intelligence of anyone who actually condescends to watching it, it offers nothing of worth in any category and it loses itself in a festering ball of pathetic, sorry ass-felching crap that I would rather have a root canal than watch again.
If you are not yet familiar with the general set-up of Step Brothers through the movie's excessively aggressive and ubiquitous marketing campaign, it is rather simple.
I must say that this documentary is a rather poor tribute both to Robert Moog and the Moog synthesizer for a myriad of reasons.
The commercial use of the Moog synthesizer centered around a rather dated beer commercial.
The in-between footage, music and performances were rather disappointing and disjointed.
Not only is THEREMIN incredibly informative, but also rather touching.
Apart from some of the music, (which was slow mundane and boring); nevertheless, the movie seemed more like a mid-eighties film rather than a mid-ninety's production.
But its potentials were ruined by its laughable plot (though I understand the producers looked for something rather comic) and terrible screenplay.
Her husband, Jim Hutton, sees all the beautiful windows and space and pool out back and allÂand would rather live in an apartment in a high-rise.
This little time capsule comes from the period in which men thought nothing of telling their wives that they are psychotic rather than even making the slightest attempt to hear what they have to say.
What do you get when you cross legendary action choreographer Yuen Woo-ping (here directing rather than choreographing) with the plot of Speed 2, a bland leading man, an immensely irritating leading lady, an obnoxious and untalented child actress and some tired and uninspired action scenes?
In short, the man pulls everything off rather effortlessly.
The film's attitude toward gender will see a girl play football to a rather high level and consequently provide us with a male character in the form of Steve (Greenlees) as an individual whom looks as if he's at the top of his game in the art of cooking and culinary activity.
Until it was derailed by a rather disappointing ending, this was perhaps the cutest movie that I had ever seen.
I think the film itself was shot on location rather than studio's and has a generally good feel throughout, the production values were much better than I expected.
From the rather strange monster to the annoying computer-voice to the blocky white-painter architecture of the lab, its the representation of its genre: Those films that are so bad you have to laugh.
There are plenty of funny things I could say that I would rather do than sit through this mind-numbing episode again, but I'll leave that to your own imagination.
After seeing A Walk to Remember, I was confident that Mandy's new film will also be good, but it was rather disappointing.
), I was rather looking forward to the stylized action sequences.
He mucks through life as a rather detached cynic.
That said however, this is a magnificent statement of young love from start to finish and everyone of any age currently in love (or theoretically), ought to see it, sooner rather than later.
The sound doesn't match the video, which is rather unnerving to begin with.
It uses the STYLE of surveillance cameras, which is a clever idea, but the film simply exploits our voyeuristic tendencies rather than commenting on them.
Chuckle as the 'ladies' make it oh so easy to laugh at, rather than with, a gay population.
They're nice, they're gravy...but I'd rather have a well made movie.
I got the feeling that some rather heavy-handed editing had occurred, both with the plot and the final production.
I thought Bratt overacted, more times coming off like a swaggering quasi-cool Hispanic Matthew McConaughey (and I don't think we need another one) rather than a 'street wise' urban poet.
Through out the movie he was the most annoying character and rather than funny.
one word describes this film "rubbish" if you've got a couple of hours to kill, please do something else rather than watch this sad excuse for a screwball comedy.
Were this the only film made in the 60s about the subject, perhaps it would have played better, but the late 60's and early 70's were jampacked with one movie after another about the same suburban ennui, and by comparison "The Arrangement" with its rather misogynistic undertones and off-puttingly distasteful protagonist, comes off as REALLY old-fashioned.
What she'd rather do is scheme with family lawyer Hume Cronyn and family doctor Harold Gould to get Douglas sent to the booby hatch.
The title of this rather tired film should be called I'm In Love With My Best Friend's Husband!
This is precisely the type of material director Mike Nichols would have thumbed his nose at twenty years ago; working here rather joylessly, Nichols wraps all the phony uplift in cinematic Saran Wrap.
If you wanted you could probably kid yourself into thinking this was an art-house film since its foreign and attempts to deal with "issues" in societies, which it does rather clumsily, otherwise just watch it and laugh.
He sports some rather unwieldy protective clothing which he clearly didn't wear during rehearsals (assuming they did any) as he bumps into a pot plant when he exits.
He dashes around the world like a demented chicken rather than staying cool and making a few phone calls?
He sports some rather unwieldy protective clothing which he clearly didn't wear during rehearsals (assuming they did any) as he bumps into a pot plant when he exits.
Perhaps they should have spent more time developing the characters, rather than having every single person prattle off historical facts about tattoos.
As the title would suggest, there's a handful of hardcore sex scenes thrown in; but they're not very well filmed either, which really makes this a rather torrid seventy three minutes of film viewing.
A junky, and quite limited production (which is directed by Full Moon founder Albert Brand) comes across being rather grizzled and glum.
It's rather amusing to see a plethora of canines getting vampirized as opposed to people Â so much so that, at times, it feels like one's watching an antropomorphic rendition of the Bram Stoker chestnut!
He sports some rather unwieldy protective clothing which he clearly didn't wear during rehearsals (assuming they did any) as he bumps into a pot plant when he exits.
Normally, I would try to explain the plot and tell you more about the film but I'd rather not and just scream loudly "THIS FILM IS HORRIBLE--AVOID IT LIKE EBOLA!!!!".
-- to show him eating, or shaking his bountiful belly, or wanting to eat...until, of course, at the movie's climax, when he (or, rather, a stunt double) suddenly turns kick-boxing action star.
Now, I don't know any of TV3's producers personally, but it seems to me like they're torturing us rather than entertaining us.
I would rather go and watch paint dry than see this again.
The movie contains about 50 scenes where you know that in 2 seconds time, there will be a BOOOO effect and when it comes you do not get scared rather angry that you actually paid money to watch this rubbish.
Although the movie has the same theme as the Sixth Sense, its ending is rather chaotic and unbelievable.
If I had my druthers, I would have rather seen 10 $5,000,000 independent art house movies.
Lang in top hat and tails singing "Love for Sale," which rather than depicting the classic film noir era is most evocative of "Bugsy Malone," a far more accurate film.
The love scene, between Swank and Harnett, is just as amusing with Bleichert and Linscott having a little pillow talk while she's wearing nothing but huge pearl earrings and a long matching necklace with pearls the size of small onions, ensuring, I would imagine, a rather bumpy ride.
They obviously didn't intend to make this a serious movie, but rather it was a cheap attempt to imitate a Film Noir sometimes, a TV mystery sometimes and then other times I don't think they knew what they actually wanted to do.
This is probably best viewed with a date, rather than with just the guys.
The plot is rather thin-- Brundle's son is born, son grows up into a fly, tries to find a cure.
Decidedly adult-oriented slapstick-comedy, though it was originally marketed towards the younger crowds, that has two very different brothers (played by comedians Nathan Lane and Lee Evans) suddenly left broke and homeless directly resulting from a couple of disturbing and rather unfunny circumstances.
"I've Been Waiting For You" (another eye grabbing title) is a feebly light-weight teenage aimed story mixing elements of witchcraft (leading girl interested in the occult / the town living in fear of a curse) / slasher staples (killer with metal claws, black cloak and a hokey looking mask) that when it came to the crunch it's rather diluted, but doesn't hurt.
The singing is among the most high-pitched and ear-shattering, the songs are dull, the acting (at times) is suspect, the film features comic relief (Leon Erol) that isn't all that funny and the love story is rather creepy.
The film begins with a not especially attractive lady singing a song rather poorly.
For the 39% of Playboy Magazine subscribers (e.g.--Janet Reno, Gore Vidal, Madeleine Albright) who pay monthly for the articles rather than the pictorials, this Playboy movie will be taken primarily as a cautionary tale about the corruption of the world pharmaceutical industry.
Watchable from a rather aesthetic point of view - dramatic changes of scenery make it fast and sometimes even fun.  
This will be rather subjective but I like the lady a lot despite her fashion style (she never appear cheap though, so treat her with respect).
First, while Hill aged rather well, Spencer looks significantly older than he actually was, much as if he was sick or something.
Once King realises that the truce has been broken he & the rest of Vampire hunting mates gear up for action once more as they are the only ones who can stop Bathorly...  Edited, written & directed by Leigh Scott who also has a small role in the film under lots of make-up one has to say that The Asylum doesn't have a great track record in making good horror films & Dracula's Curse only goes to enhance that reputation rather than change it.
I, for one, would rather choke on LA's smog than have to watch this movie again.
Released at the tail-end of the disaster movie craze of the 1970's (which might have already ended in 1979), Irwin Allen's WHEN TIME RAN OUT is more of an afterthought rather than a comeback as it was intended to be.
Still, it does offer one truly wonderful piece of droopingly phallic imagery as a rather unfortunately designed volcano-monitoring center falls into the crater that's almost worth the price of admission on its own.
If the volcano caused a tidal wave, chances are it would head away from the island, rather than heading back to it.
This is a rather aimless mystery, with an implausible murder and an utterly impossible solution, requiring the witnesses to the murder to be death dumb and blind, and the corpse of the murdered to be light as a feather.
The problem is that this one is, by its story, stuck on a limited number of sets, and the dialog is not enough to sustain interest over the rather brief run time.
I would rather watch a rerun of the Adam's Family or set through another season of political campaign debates.
This movie is astonishingly biased and is based on the opinion of gang members rather than true fact.
This balances the film nicely, rather than have Koby or Jai recount their own court cases and possibly omit certain details.
Apart from that rather thin plot line, we are treated to Jackie Coogan in a fuzzy bath robe and really short shorts (frightening).
(Coventry): I thought it was childish rather than child- friendly, but that's one man's opinion, of course.
For example, the alien's use of children rather than adults is not dictated by the logic of the story: it is basically a poetic device.
To me it feels like Rockstar realized that the game play was sluggish and rather than scrap the whole thing decided to do was singers do when they have a terrible song, make it so it gets band (Well Almost).
The Brooks gag formulas are definitely still there, but seem lazily inserted as dependable fallback material, rather than inspired stylistic substance.
Aside from a few good jokes here and there this one was rather dull.
one cannot comment on the elections of others without knowing the motivation behind such decisions, but it can be safely assumed that the viewing of this film could not possibly be attributed to the aforementioned ailments/symptoms, but rather a morbid curiosity begat by boredom and the senseless desire to subject oneself to the efforts of a hungry director and the economic needs of actors that said, "Hmmm.
The movie defies logic in several places, and the plot is the derivative tripe that makes you laugh, rather than scares you.
Blue flashy lights stand as most of the "horrific" effects and the blood shed is rather limited.
Even though this movie was shot rather recent - in 1989 - it looks incredibly dated and above all cheap !!
ONE OF THEM is not so much a devil-worshiping movie; it is rather an evil demon-worshiping movie.
The academy is totally out of place in this movie, and looks more like something from South West England rather than the United States!
The guy playing the teenage brother of one of the main female characters looks as though he'd rather be somewhere else.
Olivia de Havilland looks about 50 here (Myrna Loy is supposed to be decades older, but they look like contemporaries), rather than the ingenue the role calls for.
She seems rather wistful or even sad when attempting to discuss the Prince with Menjou or offering "motherly" advice to DeHavilland.
This is a very sophomoric episode, not worthy of the standards of Rod Serling, but rather an inept attempt at some sort of ironic black comedy.
(On the other hand, I rather liked Lithgow's nutty over-acting.)
Obviously it was no one's dream to make this movie, but rather, this was concocted in a board room somewhere, then produced with cold efficiency.
In short, I'd rather be stranded in the middle of the desert than having to see this film again.
As my gym teacher used to say, on the whole, I'd rather be at the disco....
The only enjoyment I got out of this movie was watching Dean Stockwell....I loved it when he was frying up eggs for breakfast, and then asked the dad if he would rather have granola..or (with great disdain) Yogurt!
Nobody seems to have told Elaine Stritch that this was supposed to be a serious drama rather than a comedy, as she plays Diane as an over-the-top comic caricature.
The male half of the cast are rather better, but none of them are outstanding and Sam Waterston as Peter is nowhere near as good as he was to be in "Crimes and Misdemeanours".
Wouldn't an assassin just shoot his target with a gun & be done with it rather than coming up with silly plans like placing a bomb in someone's party cracker!
As far as nudity is concerned, all we get is a laughable 'sex' scene, featuring Betsy and her boyfriend making a hot-tub 'whirlpool' (by walking round and round in the water) whilst a naff 80s song plays in the background, and a coy cuddle (inside a sleeping bag) between a shrew-faced woman with a nasty perm and her mustachioed lover (rather him than me!).
All of the effects are rather basic and unconvincing, and to make matters worse, the entire film is shot at night with poor lighting, making the action very difficult to see.
There is nothing here to suggest that this is a cult classic rather than a cult wishing this was a classic.
The documentary looks at the impact PLAN 9 has had on our culture, and the events that led to its "re-discovery" years after its rather uneventful debut at movie theaters and drive-ins.
But how do you forgive scripts that attempt to create tension by having the protagonists do stupid things rather than by having the antagonist do evil things?
But personally, this wasn't much of a sequel, but rather a rehash of the first film.
Sadly, the mix rather than becoming an intriguing stew, becomes a weak broth leaving the viewer unfulfilled.
How the brother found her location in the middle of a forest from the rather uninformative photo is not explained.
Italy has made a million exploitation films like this one, and that considerably lessens its impact as rather than showing the ills of the C.I.A.
The movie works rather well and has a rather good cast too, Bruce Campbell is in it too and that is always a plus as he adds a spark near the end of the movie.
I stuck through to see how it would end, not because I was tremendously interested but rather because I had made it through half the film and thought it might improve.
Fed electric brownies made from a box (rather than from the most famous recipe in The Alice B. Toklas Cookbook), straight-laced but simmering Harold Fine (sic.!)
Everything is shot in a rather small sound stage (as opposed to Russian sci-fi classic Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet), and how some viewers can deem this dermatine-plasticine world to be eerily alien, is far over my head.
it gets a three as there are two rather witty deaths, ones that i have not seen in any other film franchise, but even then they are not as spectacular as they could have been.
It was obvious right away that this would be a rather cheesy and/or bad movie.
The only difference is the ending, which has the pretty blue humanoids escorting humans to their Earth-bound ships at gunpoint, which I freely admit is a rather neat sight since my ancestors were American Indian, Irish, and Scot.
Anyways, rather than try and balance my review with what was good (the visuals, the 3D, the sound effects), am just going to say what really sucked.
Personally I would just stop letting prisoners inspect incoming mail rather than risk the lives of investigators.
The action races on at a pace fast enough for the voyeuristic, dim-witted viewer to be thinking always about what happens next rather than the rubbish that has just been shown.
Well, I hate football and rather go to the dentist than see through a whole game, but why can't people appreciate it ?
I'd rather listen to Faith No More with my Algerian friends than deal with their "Silence concertoes", whatever that is.
Its twisted and depressing, and deals with some rather adult issues (not sex or anything like that, just mature things like loss, death, and infinity) Nevertheless, it is an unusual film with interesting ideas and themes--definitely do NOT recommend for children.
I think maybe you should judge a film on it's own merits [or lack of] rather than seeing big names and expecting greatness.
I was left feeling rather annoyed by the abundant use of voice over which spoiled the whole idea of her silence for me.
In all seriousness, I rather enjoyed parts of this movie.
The ending is rather predictable, but the script does manage to do a pretty good job of not telegraphing it.
A rather inconsistent start, The Cold War is still there, plus the global warning, and maybe the toxic assets.
Instead, he's a rather flat and expressionless superhero, able to control people's mind remotely or bring down helicopters with his hands.
and lots of stadiums, trucks and the like, Klattu surrenders to rather poor mortal mercy demands, and leaves the planet.
McKee knows how to create a mood of foreboding, but he chooses to do it through artistry rather than through cheap manipulation.
The visual tricks are good but repetitive and rather confusing.
is that Dr Gore makes some rather pathetic comments along the way in this 'movie'.
I've chosen my divinity rather than my divinity choosing me."
He's chosen his authenticity rather than his authenticity choosing him.
But when ignorance, poverty and needless suffering are the lived reality rather than a marketing tool I have a hard time caring whether there's "beauty in it."
Actually, I thought it opens rather well, but then not too long it falls away quickly.
This movie is rather ridiculous and predictable.
It would have at least been bearable rather than a travesty.
The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter, was a film based on the book of the same title, and which followed the theme of the Carson Mc Cullers novel rather well.
I would rather shoot myself in the head than watch another episode of The "REAL" World, because watching this show is actually more painful than that.
The film certainly has scenes that are simply hilarious but most of the film is rather lame.
To begin with, there is only a fair amount of nudity but little sex in itself and none of the hardcore variety; in fact, it's rather heavier on horror content compared to the original, even going so far as to include a completely irrelevant (if reasonably eerie) marauding mummy scene!
For example, the film opens with a rather lengthy soft core coupling sequence showing a man cavorting with two women to background music.
In fact I think the majority of the running time was taken up with the voting rather than the singing .
Also, the film got too wrapped up in the emotions of people whose lives were affected by personal debt and debt of loved ones, rather than tackling the inner-workings of the consumer lending industry, which I would have found much more stimulating.
The fact that she could deal competently with an obviously paranoid boss, maintain a normal, healthy friendship with a coworker, remain friends with a thoroughly unlikeable brother and sister-in-law and engender the affection of her spoiled niece all indicated that her initial problems ran no deeper than being a rather homely wallflower who had compensated for her lack of an intimate human relationship by being closely - but not pathologically - attached to her dog.
If you paid attention to what he said, you discovered that he was abused terribly in childhood - and the most probable reason that he was unable to have an intimate relationship with either a woman or a man was a not-too-subtle suggestion that this abuse produced a physiological rather than psychological incapacity (mutilation?
Peggy is not headed toward some sort of happy ending at the end of the movie, but rather has retreated fully into psychosis.
One wonders exactly how much Kosashvilli knows about real life rather than what he has gleaned from third-rate Hollywood pictures.
The movie is very slow paced, so I would call the movie rather crime than action or thriller.
I do not deny that the movie was rather innovative for the late 1960s.
One of the problems that pull the rug from under this movie is that there is just too many characters, and none are really fleshed out properly, and there isn't really anything under lying the story to get your teeth into (sorry) making this rather chaotic and boring at times.
And it's not just the fact that the "film" is to the most part incredibly dull: it's supposed to be like an indirect "homage" to Romero's zombie trilogy and other horror-movie greats; hence the rather trite "idea" of naming the idiot characters after real-life directors, actors, or horror-film characters.
The end-credits look like a kind of post-production celebration party by all the idiots involved, in which they indulge themselves shamelessly, and with some rather pathetic attempts at humour.
I would have rather brought this news clipping up on one of those old timey news paper viewers and used my own imagination to fill in the gaps.
What it does do is present us with a granddaughter's rather guileless investigation of who her family are.
She can't know why the Rosenbergs chose to die rather than betray political beliefs, friends, and their nearly religious conviction that Socialism was humankind's only hope.
The film just goes way overboard and is, at times, rather sick and nasty--more about this later.
I proceeded at my own peril, especially since I have rather enjoyed some truly awful movies in the past.
Well personally I've been in enough discussions about this to know that demanding proof of God is rather useless.
At first this discursiveness seems rather stunning and unexpected, but a quick look back over a few points of the first half of the film start revealing that indeed, it seems Pabst really didn't have a clear understanding of overaching tones, themes, motifs.
The film ends with Hardy getting kicked in the face by a mule ... an image which left me wincing rather than laughing.
Of course, not everything is quite what it initially seems, as Nat begins to realize perhaps something more sinister and deadly in Finch's rather clandestine way of bringing home the bacon.
You almost wish they would've told the predictable story of self-delusion in a straight, lucid manner, rather than an all-out assault on our eyes and cerebral digestion.
No, I'm not referring to actual physical battles, rather to battles of wills.
The fact that the submarine looked like an oil refinery rather than something where space is of a premium.
And, the crew seems to die rather quickly from the virus, though the villain, Kretz has a vile of it crammed in his mouth and survives for a very long time.
Ugly to look at to make matters worse, and the actors all seem to affect Irish accents, rather than Australian as the real Ned Kelly was.
and not only that, but you get to see some really weird scenes on the movie (such in the ending when both Kelly's brothers kill themselves in a rather artistic way).
But that of course is not the main strenght of the movie, the main thing that this movie's got going-on is of course the horrible performance of Mick Jagger, who doesn't really act whatsoever if we consider it, but rather just stands around being the lead singer of the Rolling Stones than Ned Kelly.
Traci Lords fits pretty well into the action genre - her pouting expression shows believable contempt for her enemies - but she is better suited to "bad girl" rather than heroine parts, IMO.
As it turns out the attacker is also ostensibly rather thick as, after being given a quick pasting, he reveals that the reason for his decidedly anti-sociable behaviour was that he had in fact resorted to a spot of DIY justice in response to the rape of a number of women down the alley in question.
Several savage beatings later at the hands of our hero, the bruised miscreants run off to lick their wounds and resolve to team up with a Japanese crime organisation which is headed by a rather rotund looking fellow who has a disturbing propensity for beating up his own sister!
As it turns out, this organisation is rather more malevolent than the one the traitorous crooks formerly belonged to and even comprises a small army of ninja!
Now if you'll excuse me, I have a rather pesky ninja infestation in my lawn to take care ofÂ..
(I'd rather see the cast of Dawson's Creek take each other on.)
Throughout this inconsistent story we experience lots of annoying plot gaps, which render the movie a rather boring experience.
We also get southern beauties who present themselves with three names like "Amanda Ray Ross" and "Becky Ann Culpepper" and you just know that the first thing Fletch does is make a rather suggestive remark that the women find irresistible and they immediately jump in the sack with him.
Or better yet they were both working to become dental  hygienists and Frances McDormand's character worked with  bands that never really quite made it rather than Bowie, Iggy,  Springsteen...and the record release party was at a dive rather  than that penthouse suite...
I also like the actor playing the uncle as well, who would rather watch porn on TV than read to his nephew.
We did not feel concerned or interested in the story, two gory moments are out of place and seem grotesque rather than horrible, dialogs are flat, the main character is supposed to be some kind of a would-be poet but the lack of interest of his reflexions is only matched by the adolescent prose of his wife in her diary.
The film also makes good comment on a Society so pill-laden, that the use of psycho-tropic drugs is common place and is used to deal with our day to day existence rather than with our real emotional selves.
They also point out that Quintis has become rather smug toward the end of the movie.
I've heard some rather positive reviews of this movie but it is not a good movie.
First, allow me to acknowledge that MP is the most sexual of Austen's books, dealing with Edmund's purely physical attraction to Mary, Fanny's rather incestuous love of Edmund (yes, I know that it was not strange to marry one's cousins in that time period, but her fraternal and romantic feelings are rather mixed up), the whole thing with Maria and Henry, and Mary's outward acknowledgment of it - she insists that the only way to get Henry to marry Maria is to let them keep living together, at which suggestion Edmund is properly horrified.
One of the best of the "overlooked episodes", and actually rather violent & filled with more physical suffering than usual for Star Trek.
In fact, Rozema's take on Tom is rather bizarre; in the book, his arguments with his father center around his irresponsibility and his profligacy.
The (in)famous sex scene between Maria and Henry takes place at Mansfield Park rather than in London and, because Rozema has played with JA's chronology of events, Fanny is already back from Portsmouth, and it is she who catches them in the act.
I was grateful to see this film for free on local television rather than renting it or God forbid, paying to sit in a theater with no hope of escape.
In the "Purple Rose of Cairo," Woody Allen finally stays behind the camera for the first time since 1978's "Interiors," stepping away from constantly playing these neurotic show- biz/writer characters to brings us more of a romantic comedy that celebrates film as a form of escapism rather than a form of art.
This odd fantasy element is intriguing in concept, but it's rather jarring in the film to start with.
Well, for starters, I feel that this show is somewhat stolen by the rather entertaining character 'Panic' (because he never panics apparently).
This film has a warm fuzzy feel to it which stops me being particularly vitriolic about it, but I can't seriously recommend it to anyone either due to the rather slow pace and predictability of the whole affair.
I would rather watch Miley Cyrus on the Disney channel.
Also, the main character exhibits a stronger than normal addiction to pot that makes it appear to be more of a physical addiction like crack or heroin, rather than psychological as is more commonly considered by the scientific community.
This is a "stoner" movie, or rather it tries to be one.
Her "trips" are more indicative of acid or special k, rather than cannibus.
The idea of the movie was good; the message (that we all waste our life at meaningless jobs rather than doing something we'd really like) made a lot of sense to me.
He was a funny guy, and his movies showcased this talent of his off rather well.
Click never delves too deeply into the psychology behind being your own God, because it is more obsessed with making it a personal tale rather than make the main character a metaphor for the audience to relate to.
The plot is ridiculously simple and rather dull.
I dont know if anyone knows this, but there are a few actors in this film who are rather big in Australian TV.
The acting was rather weak, although it was not painful, to watch.
De Niro looked rather bored and blasÃ©.
CatonÂJones will not raise above the level of his own BASIC INSTINCT 2 and THE JACKALÂstarÂvehicles, essentially derivative and exploitative; only that CITY BY THE SEA is below those, and yet another wasting of a De Niro performance (--though CatonÂJones is not alone to blameÂas De Niro himself looks rather uncooperative--).
The worse part of the film is its rather blunt homophobia.
Thus homosexuality is treated more like a dirty little scandal rather than a naughty little secret; something to be held at arm's length or viewed as a rude little joke, like Lady Chablis.
Just having those two random musical numbers seemed daft rather than stylish.
The film features a voice over that shows us what the psycho is thinking and feeling and it's all rather generic stuff and the film could have done without it.
The gore is even grosser than most FT13th films, and the violence is rather cruel, especially the final murder.
Let alone Robin Williams, I guess he would rather have his name removed from the credit.
I would rather choose the first of these.
Now, I would rather have paid $4 to have not seen it.
THe scene where the kids realize they are going on an RV vacation rather than Hawaii, no.
A rather convoluted and tedious 'action' movie from the 80s, Wanted: Dead or Alive stars Rutger Hauer as Nick Randall, a tough-as-nails bounty hunter on the trail of nasty Arab terrorists (led by Malak Al Rahim played by Gene Simmons), who are out and about in L.A. blowing up innocent people.
But with its rather dull script and pedestrian direction from Gary Sherman, even they can't save this movie from being a less than average production.
Shark Bait (aka: The Reef) sports an all star cast (and I use the term rather generously), but is badly marred by a weak story line, horrendous dialogue, cheesy references to other films, and third rate computer animation.
I tend to think Shakespeare movies tell you more about the period when they are made rather than when they are set (much like the plays themselves), and this one is no different.
That's not to say there are no positive qualities to the film, but it is far more burdened with flaws, and it's more likely to ultimately annoy rather than entertain.
There are a couple good sequences, but they tended to be those focused on "action"--when characters were up and about, doing something rather than sitting in a room and talking, and the climax was great (I even cheered).
Farrow is the Depression-era movie fan whose film idol walks right off the screen and interjects himself into her life--brightening it, at least for awhile, until the rather downbeat ending.
The film's only saving grace was the references to insects, which was rather interesting.
Other than that, a rather boring historical picture with some shocking subject matter to make it relevant.
Fortunately for us, the Predators have been watching the movie from space, and they'd rather go for a little swim in the Aliens' acid-blood than sit through an Armageddon remake.
She kills the Alien rather than the Predator killing it.
You may have noticed that I haven't said anything about the actual characters yet, apart from mentioning Lance Henriksen by his own name rather than that of the character.
The previous Predator films are contradicted as well because the Predators are portrayed as creatures who are noble warriors, who actually respect humans and will help them if need be, rather than the ruthless merciless hunters who killed for sport and would kill a human just out of spite if he looked at him funny.
American Me: 3/10: In all fairness I have to admit I was expecting more of a gang picture (albeit a serious one) with Mexican overtones rather than a straightforward prison drama.
The films was rather long and slow moving and could definitely benefited from editing.
"Fear Runs Silent" tries to be more psychological rather than typical,but fails miserably.OK,there are some good points especially a wonderful location sets(a snowy mountains,forests)-delicious!All in all,I was really disappointed with this one.This is not completely bad picture,but isn't good either.
Writers have got to learn that audiences are sophisticated enough now to find such clichÃ©s embarrassing, rather than cool.
Then you need to instruct your actors to act, rather than pose for the camera.
I suppose I just enjoy going along on the ride more so than having the story be given to me through the eyes of the documentarian covering the deaths of the filmmakers, although the ending does give us a rather splendid surprise.
"The Last Broadcast" fails miserably as a film not because of its low budget, or cheesy production values, or less-than-stellar performances (all of which exist); rather, the movie creates its universe, then, for the finale, decides to disregard everything that it has presented, in an attempt to be 'surprising,' or 'crass' or 'hip.'
When love and sex happened, it wasn't dirty in the original but rather a natural progression.
Essentially a remake, rather than a sequel, this is probably one of the worst "teen" movies ever made.
The Good: - Scenery - Soundtrack - Cinematography  The Bad: - Disregards the plot from The Blue Lagoon - Sexual "overtones" rather than "undertones" - More an attempt at capitalizing on the popularity of the original than an extension of the latter's story  Comments:  There aren't many situations that manage to capture the imagination as does watching two children blossom into young adults isolated from civilization on a dessert island.
It was the forgotten image of what children are all doomed to lose as they experience life based on societal dictates rather than the nature we are all born with.
I can only imagine what those freaky hillbillys from Deliverance would think of Buddy, the 300+ pound mentally handicapped killer who grunts like a pig rather than speaking normally.
I didn't, I expected a Drew Barrymore movie, but she actually has a rather small role, but I good one.
The story is rather stupid as well, centering around the discovery of Noah's Ark.
While rather good and relatively fluid, it shows that more money went into making a lousy movie look good than actually starting out with a decent movie in the first place.
Another rather bothersome element is the terrible voice acting done by the child in the movie.
our 'terrorist' has rather serious mental health problems, which seems to suggest that he has no rational justification for the acts he planned to carry out.
The acting was not particularly great as well despite a rather stellar cast.
I eventually reached the conclusion that these were to show off the wonderful cinematography (and some excellent Foley artist work) rather than to advance what there is in the way of plot.
There's no plot to speak of, rather it's more of a series of skits.
Is it also realistic that an all-powerful extraterrestrial force would only be able to shut down nuclear arms in sequence rather than all at once?
Just when you thought the nail couldn't be pushed any deeper into his coffin, Kennedy is back, and this time in a movie like Malibu's Most Wanted, or rather a movie where he is acting like a stupid white guy: Kickin It Old Skool!
The story is oh-so familiar, with a rival young hip group of kids just waiting to duke it out with Kennedy and his band of misfits, except duke it with fists they shall not, but rather their old skool moves.
I'd rather watch a political debate with toothpicks under my fingernails.
Perhaps Kennedy lost me when he started rubbing his fat best friends breasts, thankfully covered in a bra, but it seems that he often forgets which subplot he's working with, or rather what the main plot is altogether.
I can only assume this short's popularity has something to do with its political incorrectness; in itself it's rather lame.
One of them, William ("Wild Bill") Murphy invented sector therapy, which was a kind of psychoanalytic quick fix, a band aid rather than an psychological excavation.
Tim Roth gives a bizarre central performance which, rather than coming across as quirky, is simply irritating.
Robert Rodriguez' slapstick section is best by a mile, followed by Tarantino's contribution, but the rest is extremely unfunny and rather tedious.
Obviously, he's got rather a high opinion of his execrable acting abilities.
But the rest seems to fall rather flat with poor production and muddled continuity.
To be honest, I am rather ambivalent towards Howard's supposed talent as a film-maker: well-suited to light-hearted, life-affirming fare such as this, SPLASH (1984) and COCOON (1985), he has regrettably failed to convince when tackling more serious subjects.
Una Vela Para el Diablo, or the rather more poetic if pointless A Candle for the Devil as it's more commonly known amongst English speaking audiences, is set in a small Spanish village where American tourist Laura Barkley (Judy Geeson who is in fact English) is trying to locate her missing sister May (Loli Tovar) who is a photographer.
For a start the body count is low, there's no mystery elements or interest in whodunit as that's made perfectly clear from the start, the exploitation levels are virtually zero & to try & spice things up a bit there are a few unpleasant sex scenes, I mean if your going to show a sex scene at least have a decent looking actress rather than a near old age pensioner.
The motive for the killer to randomly kill women(..and the men who get in his way)is rather limp.
Slumber Party Massacre III is fairly well made, special effects are OK & it's quite well lit but it's all rather bland.
Much worse than either the original The Slumber Party Massacre (1982) or it's sequel the rather impressive & fun Slumber Party Massacre II (1987) so watch one of those instead.
Which is rather strange as each wave was supposed to have equal explosive intensity.
The special effects also often seem to be on display rather than interwoven with plot.
The whole film seems rather disjointed and is unbelievably dull.
It's guilty of a few of the tricks it picks on Fox for using (fast graphics meant to "wow" and confuse) and adds a few others to the arsenal (interviewing mostly people whose views of Fox may be tainted by personal grudge; taking quotes from news shows out of context; using montages rather than quantitative data to sway the audience).
Most of the footage from Fox News is not even taken from broadcast quality sources but rather DVRs and clips from the internet.
"Tre Solar" could have been the top Swedish movie of the year, instead it is rather the low-point for the last five years.
Perhaps "Tre Solar" is the perfect example of the majority of Swedish films - some wish-to-be-made movie is granted financial support not because it is something people want to see on the big screen, but rather because it seems like an interesting aim to some people (namely the academy granting money to support Swedish film-making).
I watched it and didn't hate it, but it was rather boring and even for a drama it still was a major let down.
Maybe the complete belief in the 'universal' (rather coprophagous) appetite of the masses for a bit of cheap entertainment between reality show "Big Brother" and the soporifics Late Hour News...  On the other hand, a proof that prestige of American film in general, and of names like Schrader, Liotta, Fiennes are untouched   If I write here right now that we took it as a bona fide self-parody, or maybe an attempt to emulate Ed Wood in producing the worst film possible - Yes, things like that are already been said before on this board, as I read above...
They rather spend the whole film throwing mindless banter at each other in order to see whom is the colder of the two.
Except one gets the distinct feeling that love isn't behind this movie, but rather money.
Patrick Macnee has a rather lengthy cameo, as well.
As a result, the film becomes so utterly confusing that the viewer would sooner give up, rather than be insulted by a film that insists on staying one step ahead of you at all times.
Ralph Fiennes was a real enigma in this film - there was nothing wrong in principle in casting him as Steed but he looks ill at ease throughout the movie as if he's rather be elsewhere.
Sadly I don't think the chances of Warners going down this line are high; I have the feeling that this is a movie the studio would rather forget about than draw attention to.
The movie is too long; it's not that it's badly made, but, rather, the problem is that the dance scenes are utterly dull, and that Duncan was neither a "deep" enough person, nor was her achievement anything to shout about (I mean she was just a dancer - big deal) - and a Communist on top of that.
The ending was far-fetched and in all honesty is rather stupid and had me shaking my head.
We know where everything is heading but the attempts to hold our attention are rather lame .
This is rather impressive, as the story is very complicated.
The scenes of violence are not the subject themselves, but rather "vehicles" to get you to a certain point.
This film is repetitive, dull, sexist, out of date in its attitudes and rather pointless.
The movie was poorly edited and artistic for the sake of being artistic rather being incorporated into the plot.
We are left with a rather dull American police story.
Miss Morton also make some rather unusual facial expressions, she smiles when she hears she will meet the elusive Mr.
I am not even middle class myself and so therefore, my views on this film in no way are based on or influenced by some tabloid press but rather from a personal point of view.
In fact, one of the main problems with Crash is the rather daft plot- its all about sex, sex and sustaining injuries and losing control of their libido by dangerous driving and that its all done in a cheap, tacky, demoralising and distasteful manner.
When they have sex, they don't do it out of love for the other person but rather out of sexual arousal, out of desperation and out of weakness.
Sorry, but in such cases i rather read something in between.
The best parts of this are filmed on the island, before that it's almost all extremely long sex scenes which get rather boring.
This one, however, is bad in a rather different way.
I guess if the heroine was played by a genuine English actress an American audience wouldn`t be able to relate to her   INTERNATIONAL VELVET is a rather drab movie that`s best viewed on a boring Sunday afternoon which was when I saw it .
I will give the movie credit for the scene where the German rider falls off his horse because for some unexplained reason I found this rather amusing in a movie devoid of amusement
Save your money, or, rather, use it to go see the interesting and revelatory "Going Upriver: The Long War of John Kerry".
Part of a disturbing trend in recent film-making where complex ideas are expressed as propaganda rather given a fair airing.
It was also rather irritating (TOUCHY SUBJECT ALERT) that half of the plot was ignored.
Besides the bloodfeud and the poverty, it makes the impression of a rather picturesque life.
Well, a man who runs a rather crappy establishment has assembled these men to perform a robbery of an armored car.
It is rather interesting to watch in places as it does move fairly quickly and the lead guy is likable enough as is his wife who stands by him.
However, you also get to see a chase scene at the end that is to long and rather anti-climatic and the other guys in the heist are rather bad in how they are presented.
The plot is as thin as clingfilm and is a rather poor homage to Hitchcock's Rear Window (Please note: regarded as something of a masterpiece by many).
It was actually rather sad, on the filmer's account, to focus on the breasts of Rosy to create some kind of, whatever, image: an American teenage girl, smoking dope once in a while, looking good and showing off her bra.
If you wanted you could probably kid yourself into thinking this was an art-house film since its foreign and attempts to deal with "issues" in societies, which it does rather clumsily, otherwise just watch it and laugh.
Unfortunately, he proves to be rather inept at his job.. getting captured no less than three times and wasting the spell his dad gives him that makes his body invisible and invulnerable to everything (except fire, conveniently).
i rather enjoyed this movie, but thinking about it afterwards i thought it was a rather disjointed and hollow movie.
The cars in these shots are largely Ford-Model-A-block / any-odd-freer-breathing-head, rear-drive, backyard/filling-station bombs on Ford rails rather than anything from Harry Miller's shop in nearby Vernon, though there might be an early Miller 200, 220 or 255 (the basis of the famed Leo-Goosen-designed, "Offy" 255/270 built by Offenhauser & Brisko and, later, Meyer & Drake).
music should compliment the story line rather than overpower it.
The characters are written in such a way that they are not even recognizable as human, but rather just qualities.
One might wonder if he would have chucked the entire thing rather than release this to theatres under the Disney name.
Steve's father is an unemployed sot, his mother has left the home to be with another man, and his older brother utilizes him as a schoolyard dope dealer, plainly a dispiriting background for the youth, but as depicted one feels no sympathy for him, as his deportment appears to stem from stupidity rather than as reaction to socio/economic pressures in this erratically paced work wherein puerile incident assumes precedence above character development.
There's a rather large leap from her throwing him out of her place to her going out of her way to help him.
The story you'll see if almost completely depraved and rather shocking even today, as prison sodomy, senseless murders, drug abuse, rape and the most psychologically twisted semi-incestuous family on film is what you'll see.
Now this might be really hard to take, but having the actors (particularly Shelly Winters) overact so severely actually made most of it seem rather funny instead of realistic.
The overall atmosphere of the film isn't bad, but there seems to be a lot of gaping holes & the overall story is rather confusing and vague.
The story is down to earth but lacks visceral qualities and is rather forgettable.
Four years after original Dragonheart movie, which I liked a lot Universal released on video this cheap and rather pathetic sequel.
He and Drake fight i the air, despite the above-average special effects for its time, it was rather boring.
The historical errors are so serious that the movie changes facts and constitutes rather a distorted image of the Roman Empire than the true history.
If you have not seen it then watch it rather than this film.
it's an absolute howler of a movie with a rather nasty plot straight out of the joesph goebbels school of poltical dishonesty.
4 stars because its in color I guess, I actually would rather a lame show like friends over this and I always turn the channel when Friends comes on, so there ya go.
I don't understand this logic; why would one risk their life for low pay in a conflict they didn't believe in for a country they resented, rather than simply take an out when it is offered and go get a job in the civilian world?
The gore is there naturally (in fact the title probably refers to HGL rather than the illusionist), but most of it could be created in your own kitchen.
I've seen an interview with HGL in which he came across very well, but I think it's more the case of him talking a good movie rather than delivering one.
The ending feels rather weak, as we don't see the transition from Paul to Malcolm McDowell and thus the final scenes haven't been properly set up.
In the end, all you do is sit there and get angry at yourself for watching this, maybe, just maybe, you'll have a laugh at the poor acting, or the strange unreal scenes (There's one car scene that made me laugh like crazy, cause it's so unbelievably unrealistic)  Watch it, don't watch it, that's up to you, i'd rather rent any part of the Friday the 13th-flicks and watch it again.
Instead the couple ended up with a rather dopey looking son called Adrian (Christian Magdu).
Then to top it all off we have Sean Connery in a role he'd probably rather forget as the "Green Knight", but he looks more like a Christmas decoration then an actual magical knight.
Yes, Sean Connery did not want to be Bond forever and for the most part you can say he has done a rather good job of doing roles other than Bond.
*SPOILER* for this films entire subtext/overriding theme below  Karen (Saffron Burrows playing it a bit too shrill for my taste, but far from shaming herself) is not the object of Gangster no 55's affections; she was not the person that 55 would rather see dead than be without...
The story centers on a group of friends--two of them being brothers--who return to their uncle's old cabin on some forested island, unaware that it is infested with a pack of vicious dogs that have either contracted a furious case of rabies or have escaped a genetic experiment (the writers seem to have a hard time deciding on which they'd rather go with, despite the stupidity in character's reasoning for the former).
But it mostly fails because using Moore's manipulative tactics to show how wrong those tactics are is a rather silly thing to do.
Trying to imply that Moore is just a glory-seeking filmmaker who would rather hobnob with celebrities than join in the protest, the point falls flat when you consider how the now infamous acceptance speech made by Moore (and the film itself) did more for the Anti-war cause than a street protest ever could.
The dialog (in subtitles) was rather bad.
"Waiting To Exhale", Forrest Whitaker's take on Terry McMillan's popular book, had a rather popular following upon it's release in 1995.
I don't know about how you would feel, but even to the kid crowd for which this western was clearly intended, when someone shows up with title to those claims it's going to be rather obvious who was behind all the homicides.
Alright, I just found this game rather bad, and I'm only posting this because I was surprised not to find any other bad comment.
And does Dumont have any problem with sex to paint such a bleak, boring, repetitive and at times rather disgusting picture?
They drive around in his brand spanking new Hummer, the wheel of which he turns over to his silly girlfriend rather casually.
In contrast, I rather enjoyed their nude bodies, their physical exercise and the wonderful landscape of the Joshua Tree Desert.
The pacing of the film is rather art-school generic.
Okay, this is a rather bad movie.
I love new age music , don't get me wrong , but I would have much rather have heard more of the natural sounds coming from the ocean.
Nineteen year-old Helen Slater in her first film appearance is a perfect choice as Supergirl; she looked like she had jumped right out of the pages of the comic books for Supergirl, she's charming rather than sexy, graceful and convincing in the flying scenes with her little costume and her nice blonde hair.
In the third scene, champagne glass beside his feet, we notice his aim isn't quite what it was, and the title takes on rather a different, less iconic meaning.
GANGSTER's abstraction - that it's subject is gangster mythology rather than one particular protagonist per se, does not mean that it avoids social grounding - the vivid recreation of 60s London, only makes the unaccountable, inexplicable appearance of this phenomenon all the more alarming.
IN 1989, Warners Realised rather late in the day that Rather than have a campy looking guy who wears his jocks outside his SuperSuit people wanted something darker and a hero who beat villains up.. Warners Re-invented a much darker hero called Batman.
And rather than just whine and complain, i call for a remake, but this time, let's do it right.
On the other hand, what comes along as "funny" is often rather serious in reality and so in my opinion, the movie wants or tries to be "lighter" than it actually is.
The main thing that did this movie in for me was a rather leaden performance from Romain Duris.
If you liked Jimunji, then just watch it again rather than ruin your self with this dreadful film.
They never seem to know what they are talking about, they judge the acts on entertainment value rather than talent, and they are all biased and opinionated.
The caliber of entertainers on the show is rather low; most of the acts are very amateurish.
In his modesty Cowell doesn't realize that the success of his shows is linked to him being in front the cameras rather than behind them.
Filled with gratuitous nastiness and gross-out violence, this movie, rather than being redeemed by such a good cast, serves only to add a black mark to their career resumes.
In which I would rather get high on mushrooms or whatever, then endure this again!
I was rather astonished at his ability to transform his extraordinary brooding good looks into those of a kindly, elderly gentleman with a twinkle in his eye.
Meaning it does lack tension in parts and the mystery of the house does get rather bogged down to be totally effective.
The photography was rather outstanding, especially the moving angles throughout the house.
Bernard Knowles directs a simple, but yet slightly engrossing picture that has a solid plot (if rather slow going), with a tight script and exceptional performances from the likes of James Mason and Barbara Mullen.
Or rather, was spared from.
Anyway, I found it all rather silly and not really all that interesting, although a bit funny in places.
Here, the cultural clash between hippies and the middle class allows him to adeptly explore a number of themes, ranging from hippie ideals as a trend to be followed rather than ideals that are believed in for their own sake, to the psychological conflicts of intrinsic desires either against other intrinsic desires or against cultural conditioning and expectations.
These are all multi-faceted characters - the humor is mined from their situations and their personalities, rather than being punchline driver.
People tend to skip these lost gems, because they consider it to be rather 'ancient' - however it is so good, that if the same script and direction were used without any amendments, but with a different cast offcourse today, this movie would stll be a hit, and would even score at the Oscars.
So, rather charmingly, they decide that however hip they seem and wish to appear, deep down they are as old fashioned as you and me !
Hung and Ann(Pauline Chan and Rena Murakami)are down-on-their luck prostitutes trapped in Hong Kong.Pauline's boyfriend,Sam back in China,who is under the impression that she is away working at a factory,is double-crossed by Billy Chow,and while looking to escape;flees for Hong Kong and winds up at the brothel where Pauline is employed.He is crushed when he finds out the truth..."Escape from the Brothel" combines plenty of gory fighting,romance,sleaze including several violent and unpleasant rape scenes and comedy,all into one.There is plenty of full-frontal female nudity and I'm not complaining about that.The violence is rather brief until the full-blooded finale,although one scene where a woman is strung up and has her nipples wired to a portable electric generator is strong stuff even for Cat III sleaze.A must-see for die-hard fans of smut!
The movie is tense without veering toward melodrama, and although it begins rather slowly, the final twenty minutes or so are unsettling, nerve-wracking suspense.
He understands the volatile nature of the film medium, preferring to illustrate the motives of his characters rather than simply state them.
While not a good double-feature match for "Rebel Without a Cause", it is dark and serious enough to still have some relevance  While presenting a rather tame portrait of California's surf and beatnik counterculture, it fits solidly with the better coming-of-age/generational revolution stuff of the 1950's and 60's.
Watching Jeremy squirm and ultimately become frightened out of his wits was a ton of fun.The ending is a bit silly(..and rather logically unsound), pointing out another schemer out for a payday, but overall I think it's fun, if derivative somewhat.
But the plot and execution of Part 3 is rather boring and never really provides the viewer with memorable images or even a few chills here and there.
This is definitely not a talentless production, rather one of those rare occasions where a few young talented actors come together and show some signs of what will make them future movie stars.
i would have rather watched grass grow, hung myself, or stab myself in the eye with a knife then watch this movie.
How Brolly dies is also gross as Goku blows him up into shreds rather graphically and Paragus is crushed to death, though we are fortunately spared the gory details.
Japanese animation has brought forward many films which are regarded as classics of the genre (for now ignoring the fact that anime isn't really a genre in and of itself, but rather a style of animation which encompasses several different genres, eg.
Or rather stop a bit too often.
What sci-fi elements there are, are primarily of added interest rather than the main substance of the film.
The sets and special effects are all well done, never detracting form the believability of the story, although the Kilrathi themselves are rather under developed and one dimensional.
This is a film more about humanity in conflict rather than a film about exploring a new and original alien race or high-brow sci-fi concepts.
He keeps the pace going while maintaining the mystery elements of the plot so as to keep you guessing, for such a simple idea it all works rather well in my opinion.
Anyway, I'm a bit surprised because that actually sounds like quite a lot of money to me at almost $8,000,000 & considering there's no big name actors, no special effects, only two or three locations & functional rather than spectacular production design it seems a lot.
), but rather that the last three games are better MOVIES than the movie: they had better casts, better stories, better dialogue, even better visual effects (in the cut scenes, at least) and better musical scores!
Anyone else will like this film if they don't mind watching quality entertainment rather than some three hour epic.
Saffron Burrows (Angel) was great, except that she handled her "crisis" at the end rather badly.
About the only cast member who seems to have recovered from being in this abomination is TchÃ©ky Karyo, and I am sure even he would rather forget this one.
The young Blair was portrayed exactly as I would have expected, not too sure of himself, too willing to scurry into a corner rather than face confrontation.
The ships shot bullets, rather giving us bright and technical laser beams.
This leads the ghost (I think his name is Lewis) to speak of the great grandfather and how he had lots of money, but he never gave it to anybody, rather put it in the basement of some house.
Unlike Leigh's other films, the drama is externally applied rather than coming from one or other of the protagonists.
The acting is of a high standard although the actors are, in this light, pawns rather than agents and I find the film consequently weak.
It's true that it is a rather depressing movie, at first sight, when you don't look closer and don't get involved in the story.
Her role is played up too much and seems rather forced.
This is a rather small and quiet WWII film.
Omar Gooding is Neb, rather in a more modern and assertive vein than the novel's characterization.
The derivative nature of this device, despite the use of material from the Verne novel, classifies the 2005 version as more of a remake of the 1961 version rather than an original adaptation in its own right, a choice that diminishes the film's possibilities from the outset.
The Nautilus itself again is rather too closely modeled on the one found in the 1961 version.
There is one thing that was really funny about this movie: Some of the effects or rather some of the sets where probably originally from the mi of the 20th century.
And Liz must surely be rather strong, if she can plunge him in the river so easily.
And rather quick, to put the key in his pocket without anybody (in the audience) noticing.
The teaser itself is more of a pace setter and establisher rather than a shocker and a stunner.
THAT SINKING FEELING feels like 90 minutes of self contained sketches rather than a feature length comedy , and maybe this is why everyone was discussing " That bit where .... " it's really not the most cohesive screenplay you'll see .
Secondly as a comedy it's made the cardinal sin of being silly rather than funny .
Here, you have a pleasant cast of assorted (and somewhat clueless, but well-meaning) young guys and their rather innocuous, but desperate attempt, to make some money.
(Therefore, read movie's "Plot Summary")  This film has no "happy end", but however, I thought the ending was rather predictable.
The second flaw is that the transitions between different parts of the film can be rather confusing.
As opposed to the rather charming cover picture that appears on the IMDb entry, the Region 4 PAL DVD cover features both Daryl Hannah and Denise Richards so prominently that one could be forgiven for thinking they are the stars of the show.
The movie feels like a rather weird and failed experiment to mixes documentary with a scripted story and characters.
The movie is made in documentary style mostly but the style, scripted situations and actors makes the whole movie feel rather artificial.
It's a shame that what is essentially a documentary had to be interlaced with the frankly pointless nod at the commercial market of including the uninspiring fictional Hannah/Richards subplot, something which ruins rather than enhances a movie that has very little technical merit of its own, but solely succeeds through the testimonies of the people that live and work in the industry.
It was interesting, I really liked the foreign use of language and subtitle, It makes the story more real rather then fake Hollywood.
Forget about any scares as it's all rather inept & cheap looking, the last twenty odd minutes & the exorcism itself is an eyesore of bad lighting & camera angles.
All in all check it out, it's not a masterpiece by any means, although it rather strikes my fancy!
Anyway, everyone is rather round the bend, off his rocker or stark, staring bonkers as we British youngsters used to say near half a century ago.
Along the way he manages to pick up a a couple of cohorts, one being a rather dim-witted metal-head who works at a record store, the other being a TV talk show host that pretends to predict the future.
A summoning is done, using available things like white bread instead of hosts and LSD instead of the preferred mushrooms, and a rather hurried search for virgin's blood also ensues.
Of course, despite all his bumbling, Father Angel is perhaps correct, but it's a break-neck race to the finish to find the correct location of the birth and plot side-lines and the main story all collide at once to make a rather spectacular ending and then a rather quiet epilogue.
It looks rather low budget as nothing really impressed me with the sets or the cinematography.
Certain scenes and characters have stayed with me with dogged persistence---a swarm of jellyfish that seem to electrocute or burn their victims to death rather than poisoning them; the deaths of two juvenile characters that hammer home the realization that, like in the film *Cube*, every last character is expendable; and the image that probably haunted me most of all, the scene towards the end involving a forced cocooning that speaks volumes about parental coercion and a pigheaded refusal to see reason.
With the unusually well observed character details provided by the script and the use of many supporting and bit actors one hasn't seen in lots of other pictures, THREE STRANGERS really has something of the atmosphere of London in 1938 rather than of London-via-Hollywood.
By the way, the print shown on TCM is rather dim, sketchy and full of harsh contrasts so it's hard to judge what the film was actually meant to look like.
I would have certainly paid $8 to see this film rather than to see "Soul Plane", "You Got Served", "Baby's Daddy", etc.
I will admit that this is a rather predictable film, but what PoirÃ© has done is taken a used story and restyled the "fun" fit in this modern day of cinema.
This is not a negative aspect, but rather a very poignant element that PoirÃ© chose to add to this film.
In spite of a couple of red herrings, it is rather obvious.
The less said the better, not because its bad, rather because its the sort of film that is best left to its own devices.
This is also a film thats going to be better on DVD rather than in the theaters where one is a bit more forgiving of the flaws.
rather, its music that is really hardcore and i just love it.
From the comments on the movie that I have seen is just awful how they say thats the movie has so much thats wrong with it but to me I think this movie is attracted by the younger community rather the older.
Reaper is much more tongue-in-cheek/takes itself far less seriously/embraces the absurdity of the situation, rather than focusing on the drama aspect.
Whilst the show is rather formulaic, and rarely deviates from its pretty simplistic premise, it does make attempts to try new and different things on occasion.
I could go on forever, but I'd rather leave it to others to watch despite my spoils.
The poorly written script should have been based upon the novel by Warren G. Harris rather than fantasy while the casting offices should have looked for actors better suited for the parts.
If you are brilliant enough of a magician to suspend the image of the real Clark Gable and Carole Lombard long enough to see through the historical inaccuracies and rather mediocre acting, Gable and Lombard can be enjoyable.
Although the plot is rather ordinary, this film is generally much better than most blaxploitation entries, thanks to hard-hitting direction, powerful performances (Kotto is a standout), thoughtful script and multi-dimensional characters.
Quinn gives a gruff performance as a thirty year veteran police captain who would rather beat a confession out of a suspect than coddle him.
In fact, in a very odd way, it was rather compelling--though certainly NOT the type film I'd like to see very often (if I did, I'd have to change my name to "Dieter" and move to someplace chic, like Paris or Prague).
Aside from the 'The Battleship Potemkin (1925),' a prerequisite for any budding film buff, I'd previously only seen his debut effort 'Glumov's Diary (1923),' a brief and plot-less short that is rather difficult to come by.
In many ways the film seems a bit ordinary today, though for 1971 it was a rather extraordinary film.
But rather in the same morbid way as I imagine watching a train wreck taking place would be.
I discovered this cartoon rather late in life, like at about 50.
The way the main villain in the sixth episode (who is utterly brilliant, by the way) is finished off struck me as rather too sudden, as was the end of the battle in episode 5.
This story ended up feeling like a sappy soap opera rather than a gritty indie feature, which is what is should have been.
We don't learn about them from what the actors playing them do or how they act, but rather through the lines they read, and we're almost always aware that they're reading lines.
As an awesome IMAX experience 7 out of 10, though try for 3D rather than 2D.
It does explain how Reggie is involved but it's rather throwaway and unconvincing , the script would have been much better if it concentrated on niggling little things like how can characters be abducted from a supermarket and brought into a busy nightclub without anyone calling the cops   If you loved the original then you might enjoy this sequel but it was spoiled by a very clumsy script
The violence isn't too strong here, some gory gunshot wounds a & some punch ups is as violent as it gets but at least it's a solid 'R' rather than a 'PG'.
Nick Nolte is excellent as the tough but rather dumb cop commuting between mayhem zones in his tired and much abused Cadillac convertible.
Sure, it's not a patch on 48 hours, but it does stand as a perfect example of ne plus ultra 90s sequelitis as tougher, simpler movies are retooled into flash bang gee whizz action paintings with money flushed into entourages and re-doing the same things they did almost a decade earlier on the cheap, only this time they all actually get paid (rather than the studio running off with the money and leaving everyone to wonder why a major success still isn't in profit).
Familiar scenes are replayed again by people now so rich (and yes, I'm thinking Eddie Murphy here in a redneck bar) that the good guys come off as cruel rather than heroic.
Here's a question for those who have already seen this (not a spoiler): Why wouldn't the Commodore have reused the "S" stencil rather than asking for two?
Characters get rather elaborate introductions and then play no more than the usual minor roles.
I recently watched Born to Fight and Tom-Yum-Goong, and OK the action sequences are better made, but in total, both movies we're rather disappointing.
They try anyhow and crash land a bit later, at a rather extreme "flying circus" just as some of them actually were at the time, with flyer's who lived passed their expected time and definitely are ready to die for the glory...  Before they landed, did the spot a HUGE air ship in a cloud and that valuable information, plus the fact that they happen to shoot down a very impressive Gotha Bomber (forgot that part) just before they saw the girls...
Yes, almost everyone seem to act rather lousy, but that may be deliberate, just to make the story even more funny and then are many flying scenes rather sketchy, like a comic strip, but may be deliberate!
So this film is more than charming, if you like crazy adventure films and don't mind that they play strange and many air scenes look rather peculiar!
So what we have here is a rather odd dichotomy.
The cast of Bird of Paradise are a rather odd bunch, but it doesn't seem to matter.
Lead man Joel McCrea was a competent rather than an exceptional actor, but he has the ideal physique and manner for the character.
Even though the film is thoroughly enjoyable, the constant skips back and forth through time are rather mind-boggling.
By making it about Clare and how her life is affected, you only see Henry's condition as a nuisance rather than a life-threatening affliction that could tear them apart forever, (I liked the very intriguing Joy Division cover at the wedding, pertaining to this fact).
You still have to buy into the whole time travel thing, but rather than take the leap of faith scientifically with the printed version, you only need to want to see these two lovers grow old together.
Even though the film is thoroughly enjoyable, the constant skips back and forth through time are rather mind-boggling.
"The Time Traveler's Wife" never makes pretenses to the science behind it, rather it centers its focus on the story.
Famous story previously filmed in 1949 with Margaret O'Brien in the lead; here, young Kate Maberly isn't so much miscast as she is misplaced; inappropriately dropped into the tale, she's a too-modern tyke representing neither time nor place, and her youthful exuberance is rather exasperating.
Mary, materially spoiled but emotionally neglected by her late parents, is rather unpleasant and unhappy in her new surroundings.
In a time when more and more films are relying on special effects rather then a good script and a decent storyline, this is one that film makers everywhere should take note of.
In the end Alice & Matt got out without killing all the zombies because Resident Evil is rather a puzzle game and killing is not necessary.
The English dubbing, too, is mostly monotone, which only enhances, rather than hurts, the timeless, otherworldly atmosphere, with dialogue ranging from the seemingly lofty ("It is the destiny of all beauty to be destroyed") to the simply lewd ("Go down on me").
The opening of the coffin floating in the water and the black servant dragging the coffin actually rather reminds me of the German expressionist period and the film NOSFERATU (1922) in particular.
The movie's effectiveness really lies in the context that people can be so easily controlled and fall victim to cults, rather than the fact that Khorda possesses their minds because he is a vampire.
The movie's effectiveness really lies in the context that people can be so easily controlled and fall victim to cults, rather than the fact that Khorda possesses their minds because he is a vampire.
Not that the second half is all bad, most of the action takes place during this time and the final fight is rather good too.
In Vampyros Lesbos there's a stunning vampire girl (Soledad Miranda) who rather sucks the blood out of other females than out of men and in the end dies.
After having Arthur's character seemingly make her choice, they tacked on a rather strange ambiguous ending suggesting that the "losing" husband might still have a chance.
Jean Arthur is enjoyable, as always, but her choice of men is rather depressing, and there isn't any fun in her predicament when the hubbies are this selfish and childish.
Fred MacMurray's returning spouse comes on like an overgrown Boy Scout (and the actor's smug condescension towards everyone else on-screen is rather off-putting); Melvyn Douglas is a smoother fit for Arthur, but he's been directed to be boorish, with lots of heavy sighs and eyeball rolls (it's clear whom we in the audience are supposed to root for).
When I first heard the premise;a spouse declared dead comes back home after months alone on an island , only to find his beloved wife has re-entered marital bliss with his best friend, I thought 'it'll be interesting to see if they come anywhere near the brilliance of "My Favorite Wife"' And I also presumed this had to be a rather blatant rip-off of the Cary Grant-Irene Dunne classic released ,incidentally, in the same year.
The white men appear over the hillside as a kind of characterless swarm Â an impersonal force, rather than a group of individuals.
Although it sounds all rather easy, it's not.
I mean, in earnest, it isn't even the level of humor that is the problem, but rather the monotony of it all.
It was rather funny, as to be expected the jokes were hit and miss with there being more hits than misses for me.
I thought once again it could have been funnier and there were some unnecessary jokes, but all in all it was a rather funny flick.
This one actually plays like a sequel as characters from the previous flick are explained why they aren't here rather than just being ignored all together.
The opening is rather funny with Shaq and Dr. Phil doing a "Saw" recreation and there are other celebrities who make short visits as well however it is still the same group who forms the core of the cast.
First, rather than taking a straight-forward documentary approach, the entire story is instead presented using live actors on location in appropriate costume.
This is a fascinating, intriguing telling of a rather bizarre murder case with not only Coyote on top form, but also matched by Robert Loggia as his exceedingly odd, certainly unhinged partner-in-crime.
Polanski's wife was annoying rather than seductive, and how could you break a leg getting hit by a truck and become a paraplegic falling out of bed?
But if they're really going to carry on airing this propaganda piece for the religious right, then I wish they would just cancel the show rather than demean the characters/actors by doing this to them!
This film starts off a bit odd but moves on with good speed showing two peoples different lives combining into a rather sordid twisted sexual fetish.
Everybody has been known to take a sexually orientated or humorously intended remark or game too far and can surely recognise the elements displayed here even if they are written rather larger than we are used to.
But rather than demonise these interests, fetishes or notions; Bitter Moon gets across a state of wrong-doing, a sense that the repercussions of these activities when used despairingly can bring about ill-fated results, confusion and can form cracks within the relationship.
Taking a rather unflinching look at the inner workings of film making and the consequences that come about from such a lavish lifestyle, Minnelli paints a bleak portrait of the people we think have it all.
Told in flashback, we even get a brief trip to a derelict castle that rather obviously resembles the one in "Kane."
Ever resourceful with his trademark dimpled granite chin, Douglas does not make Shields a complete villain but rather an intriguingly textured opportunist.
It is only when the film is in the can that he breaks it off, rather roughly.
Rashomon or Citizen Kane it is not in trying to reveal more grandiose and amazing things about human nature, but rather a supreme rumination on the good times and the bad times, possibly more of the latter.
There's supposed to be a story, but the makers felt it better to emphasize action rather than plot.
There is also a rather pointless scene where Hercules must fight some guy who always gets back up and laughs annoyingly.
It's also unusual to see Jim Backus in a rather unlikable role.
Composer Patrick Doyle, who does everything well, deserves credit for a nice score that complements the story rather than overpowering it as so often is the case.
Based on a true story, eleven members of a women's institute group decide to pose nude for a rather untraditional annual calendar to raise money for charity.
The movie is very character driven rather then explosions and special effects rammed down your throat.
I think it's sad when a movie has to have it's back story explained on IMDb message boards rather than during the film.
It is rather painful, let me tell you.
How he and the people of Italy adopted this was amazing and rather sudden.
The ending makes this film memorable, but everything proceeding it struck me as rather lightweight, given the subject matter.
The Finzi-Contini's, however, believe that their position of wealth and their very home will shield them from being touched, and they move on, oblivious to the world outside, in a frozen period of time and space that seems, for a moment, to spare them, until it becomes rather clear that the walls that so protected them are beginning to crumble and that they are headed towards an inevitable train wreck which will destroy all that they know.
The plot is good, the acting is good, and it also has a rather sinister part - a half-living drawing of Chloe's dead father is lurking in her wardrobe and says "I'm coming to hurt you".
I rather liked Tim Thomerson, the sheriff, who's out of his usual stand-up routine but a 'stand up guy' in the local community, as he tries to keep peace as the drama unfolds.
...and I think part of the reason for that is, aside from some notable uses of symbolism (some subtle, some not so subtle, in part due to the photography), the story is rather simple.
In lessor hands (or rather, hands not as proficient in the soul-searching drama as Bergman is) this could be almost a TV melodrama.
Karin (Bibi Andersson, one of Bergman's key actresses) lives a rather calm, routine life with her husband Andreas (Max von Sydow) and their two children.
Despite being written by top teen-movie maker John Hughes and featuring a pretty decent cast (John Candy has a cameo and the two leads are both capable actors), Career Opportunities (AKA One Wild Night), is a rather weak comedy with irritating characters and very few laughs.
But of course, Ms. Connelly looking damn fine doesn't make this a great piece of film-making (just great eye-candy), and ultimately this is a rather desperate 'comedy' that comes nowhere near to the matching the quality of Hughes' 80s output.
Like Naish and Chaney, Lugosi was dying and many rather pointless scenes were dumped into PLAN 9 by director Ed Wood, Jr.. Like Wood, Al Adamson seemed to just dump film randomly into the film, as he took scenes from a planned sequel to SATAN'S SADISTS (a biker film) and dumped them into this horror of a film.
As one may guess, the cops appear quite useless and all the hippies in the area are preoccupied with protests rather than some horrific murders.
Oh no, this has a certain scuzzy charm to it that may be only appealing to bad movie fans like myself, but I think this is a rather fun, if messy, movie.
Frankenstein looks rather worse for wear, as his face looks like it's been in the water too long.
This is a rather old fashioned but fun old MGM musical that oddly stars Lana Turner.
When they played The Face on the Milk Carrton on TV I was rather excited, reading the books and all.
I would rather shoot myself in the head than watch another episode of The "REAL" World, because watching this show is actually more painful than that.
I would rather get whipped 100 times than watch this horrible piece of s**t ever again.
But, I did find the movie rather disturbing at some points, with the violence and rapes.
But unlike most military-crime dramas, he does not unfold some huge conspiracy that reaches to the very top of the command chain; rather, he has to come face to face with a reality that runs counter to what he knows about his boy.
Jones' performance was nominated for an Oscar, and it's well deserved (although I would have rather seen him get one for No Country for Old Men, where he was even better).
I like how Haggis makes him rather unsympathetic at times.
The information is available to those that care to know the facts rather than to follow the California nutcases.
They obviously haven't been in the military, and are probably the kind of people who would cross the street rather than say "good morning" to somebody in uniform.
The story itself is set in a time with its players back from their active tour of duty, and is an investigative drama rather than a ra-ra mouthpiece on the morality of war.
It's a very subtle anti-war message, hidden carefully without being like a propaganda, which is rather unlike the anti war message in "Home Of The Brave".
Realizing Crash's multi-story structure was a strength but also a weakness, Haggis goes for a more linear narrative this time, and chooses a rather controversial subject for it: the Iraq war.
Furthermore, one might wonder why the director cast a high-profile actress like Sarandon in a rather irrelevant role that doesn't require her to do much but be angry over the phone.
This film is not an anti-war effort but rather the facts are all presented, and one is left to come to one's own conclusions.
Its minimalism, either by the dialog scarcity, the remarkable ellipses, or the protagonist's blank face, convert the movie into a nearly pure cinematographic work, rather than a theater work adapted for the screen.
Perhaps its the Japanese concept of people being pulled along by the tides of life, rather than actors in our own destinies that is the real theme of this and his other movies.
We find ourselves sympathizing with his increasingly rotten soul, rather than empathizing with his victims.
Like most of Beat Takeshi's movies, you have to really observe it, rather than watch it, to really appreciate his movies.
He never earned anything, and i would rather be dragged out and shot than watch a two hour movie on how someone jams a needle into their ass every day to hit the ball 500 feet.
Maris (Barry Pepper) comes across as an all around good guy who would really rather not be in the spotlight, who nevertheless has to deal with a hostile media and less than supportive home fans, neither of whom really want to see Ruth's record broken and who, if it is to be broken, would rather see Mantle ("the real Yankee") do it.
Nevertheless, it was still rather fun to watch how this train wreck of a movie would get worse.
When I say lifted, I don't mean they borrowed ideas, but rather cut-and-pasted footage.
I, for one, am extremely grateful that they don't use the close-up filming as they did here, a distracting element detracting rather than adding to the presentation.
Although they might not perform on an academy-award-winning level, I rather thought everybody was acting pretty fairly.
His empathy with the character is profound, and rather than some quirky stereotype, his Monk is a beautiful, poetic character that will live for a longtime after the petty series characters of modern "hit" television fade away.
This movie is very dark in content yet because there is very little character development the viewer doesn't identify with the plight of the character and the absence of Hitchcock's signature suspense music allows a viewer to laugh at the awkward situation and the ridiculous actions of the characters rather than worry about what terrible outcome could come from them.
In Alfred Hitchock's The Trouble With Harry, the old geezer pulls our leg a bit, offering a sweet but rather cynical black comedy about how best to dispose of a dead body found by an old sea captain.
I would rather watch a red oak grow that waste my time watching this drivel.
Beat the dish thoroughly until sprinkling is quickly gone  Insert just a pinch of secret evidence about lodger's past  Be sure to place evidence near to woman  Knead the dough flat into a final conclusion  Keep doing this for a rather tedious 20 minutes  Chuck it in the oven, and voilÃ !
Unfortunately, this recipe is rather hard to swallow under normal circumstances.
Perhaps the cycle will return and will get away from Gangsta rappers and back to a style of entertainment that celebrated life rather than threaten it.
Yes, it is a one-joke film, but manages to camouflage its deficiencies rather well.
It was horrific, and as a secondary school religious studies student, i found it rather distracting and haunting and something i will always think of whenever learning about abortion.
Great movie, although it rather is a documentary...
"Win Ben Stein's Money" was one of the best shows that aired on Comedy Central when "South Park" and "The Daily Show" were rather new.
The plot was rather simple and predictable, the acting wooden overall, the heroine looked older, less attractive and lively than her opponent.
Both enjoyable enough films, but they fail at their core because they focus too much on the events that the characters face, rather than their response to them.
The ambition here is less than a Crash or Babel -- it's not trying to explain the modern angst of society or draw global interconnectedness links -- but rather to simply explore the lives of a small group of characters in a one city whose lives happen to intersect.
Even masterpieces like Big Fish, Edward Scissorhand, Chocolate, Green Mile (or already mentioned Eternal Sunshine of Spotless Mind) have a clear Hollywood sign, and after all those Rambos and American Pies, comics based blockbusters and remakes of French movies (what is additionally ironic because average American movie consumer would rather see a rattlesnake on the floor than French movie on the screen) this touch of Hollywood became odious, what is a tragic decline for this old temple of movies... just few decades ago the touch of Hollywood style was the best praise a movie could be given.
Some viewers may find the film meandering a bit too much: this is not linear storytelling but rather shifts in incidents and moods and gradual changes that occur among these simple but needy people, much like the coincidences and random kindnesses occur to the sensitive eye.
His films are more of a contemplative nature rather than a story with climax and an established ending.
The main actors must have been in much need of money to go through what they did, taking into consideration that he used non actors, mostly to accentuate, exaggerate and exhibit their physical shortcomings rather than to create and develop characters.
I'm just disappointed with the fact the film is not spoken in Galego, but rather in English.
id rather watch this film with subtitles..though the artistic expression of the body and a way to reflect Mexico's problems.
The film is framed by sexual acts, and explicitly realistic Dumont-like sex is sprinkled throughout, apparently designed to tweak our level of comfort rather than turn us on.
It was during these long shots, I realized this film was reminiscent of another rather *boring* Mexican film I had once lost 2 hours of my life to.
A plot that doesn't move, but rather seems situational.
I would recommend this film to people that, at the time that they leave the theater, really want to think about human nature, rather than thinking if it was an erotic or violent film.
I don't even remember seeing Jimmy Breslin in this production, One redeeming quality was it actually was rather clean by todays standards and probably wouldn't have upset a church group.
Finesse of conception, of treatment, of methods; brutality and brusqueness of the primary literary sourcesÂtestifying of Truffaut's decadent attraction towards the brutal and the sordid (Truffaut himself had a rather naughty adolescence, and his physiognomy shows a certain human stuff, there are Lombrosian traces that somehow are at odds or seem to contradict his reputation of a gentle, emasculate human being and his high and refined intellectuality; he obviously wanted to look like the angelic leadsÂLÃ©aud Â;he did not).
To be truthful, I think in the end it gives quite a neutral and rather dull view on Manuel Romasanta.
Rosi lets the images to speak for themselves rather than the Gian Maria Volente who is in the central role in the movie.
But rather intriguingly, Seinfeld has pulled off quite the animated picture, albeit one that is distinctively Seinfeldian.
I was not expecting a whole lot by way of genuine adult humour (disguised nicely like anything from Pixar, or just shoved in rather blatantly like in the recent Shrek the Third), but Seinfeld manages to land just enough jokes to impress even the most avid haters of his TV show.
Here, Seinfeld and company do it rather easily, and still have plenty of room left to continue on.
But even with its off and on dialogue, the story still manages to be effective and rather clever and creative.
If I had no idea who Seinfeld was, I might even have been inclined to think he was a voice actor all along (albeit one with a rather whiney Jewish sensibility about himself).
He would rather be a pollen jock and go out into the world and collect nectar, but he knows that job is but a lofty dream for a young bee.
I was waiting (along with 40 easily bored children, who didn't get the Pomp & Circumstance joke when I did, to my embarrassment) for some drama to cut in, rather like the revenge or rescue plots of the Toy Stories.
Seinfeld's vision of the bee world was unveiled, but not with a rather lack of detail.
The slapstick and physical humor rather misses more than hits, but the Seinfeld-humor (you whether understand this very well, or not at all) delivers most definitely.
None of the women in the video are exceptionally attractive and Mariel Hemmingways height and nose bother me quite a bit, though in some scenes she does look rather foxy.
However, true to the bizarre nature of this movie, it is not a happy tale of love that unfolds, rather a twisted tragedy in which neither side comes off any better than the other.
Tim Robbins is wonderful too, and rather pathetic, in a down-to-earth role as an aging war veteran, happy to have survived and soon to be confronted with some harsh realities.
Tim Robbins is wonderful too, and rather pathetic, in a down-to-earth role as an aging war veteran, happy to have survived and soon to be confronted with some harsh realities.
This is not a B movie, although the title is rather hokey.
This time, he's in Hong Kong and single-handedly (of course) eliminating the forces that conspire against his adopted family who also happens to run a prosperous casino that evil types would rather see under their control or (better yet) destroyed.
As I mentioned earlier the premise doesn't break any new ground, and is rather slight.
He was diagnosed with the psychological condition of lycanthropy, and given a life sentence rather than death.
One character is knowingly invented, and some rather unlikely theories are put forward in the place of that which is unknown, but the question of whether or not Romasanta was actually a werewolf is left completely open.
It is quite slow moving, and arguably it's rather light on actual story and plot, but that's about as far as the criticism goes.
I guess when this was made the director, Antonio Bido, was making a rather valiant attempt to follow in Dario Argento's footsteps.
There's even an attempt to capture Argento's stylishness, but that fails because the film is rather murky and almost grainy at times, unlike the crystal clear work of Argento.
Still though, this isn't a bad film, although it's rather typical Italian stuff where you have to pay attention because otherwise you can't keep track of the players without a score card.
I saw it rather accidentally all through to the very end as I really wanted to know if every other minute will be as stupid as all the previous.
Alright, I just found this game rather bad, and I'm only posting this because I was surprised not to find any other bad comment.
Don't expect to fight armies, or to even have to defeat a legion of regular enemies (if you've played ICO, you might be expecting to fight off the shadows), but rather a series of Colossi; a being of great power that takes tact to destroy, not random hacking and slashing.
(2) Once you are able to get on a Colossi, it is you vs. your grip, rather than the Colossi itself.
Putting aside anachronisms such as the lack of accents and the rather modern way much of the dialog is delivered, this is a solid effort from veteran genre director Gordon.
I am so honored to have been introduced to him in this way rather than in a titillating Maxim video.
It's really fun, in a nerdy way, trying to guess some of these words (or rather watching them guessing the words) along with the players.
This was a rather cute film...a little slow at first, but quite amusing as it went along.
Dominique Pinon (A Jeunet regular) plays the hapless wanderer Joseph, who turns up at a rather ominous butcher shop looking for work.
It is a dank, rather terrifying unspecified region of France, in a future when food is scarce and vegetarians reside below the surface like rats.
Into this sick micro-society comes a rather homely man, Louisan--the next unsuspecting victim.
I was rather disappointed by this movie.
This builds atmosphere impeccably well, and is rather exciting when it goes for that.
Parts of this are rather surreal.
All in all, rather than a real movie (yes, low budget and all ), it looked like an extended episode from some cable TV "adventure" series.
Being a slave for the rest of his life is an idea which Greg isn't too keen on so with the help of a rather good looking female slave named Delphine (Lea Brodie) who luckily for any male viewers wears a skimpy cleavage revealing dress & some of the local wildlife they decide to make a break for it, but will they be able to rescue Charles & make it back to the diving-bell before they are either eaten by some monster or killed by the Atlanteans?
Like the previous Connor films the monsters aren't exactly the pinnacle of realism, in fact most people would probably describe them as poor but I'd rather have the charm & personality of a man in a rubber monster suit than a cold lifeless fake looking computer graphic any day of the week.
Perhaps if Bill Paxton would have had a larger role rather than a get-killed-quick cameo... but other than that, I don't see what would have made this much better...
However, Next of Kin is the later creation and he must have fine tuned some of the mistakes from the rather slow moving Raw Deal.
Next of Kin takes a rather liberal view at a group of people not normally dealt with in films...mountain people...or hillbillies if you will.
From the score here I see that this movie is not enjoyed by all and is a universally well liked movie, but I thought it was rather good.
The bad guys in this one are rather good too and the action is not super shoot em up or anything, but it is fairly exciting to watch.
Overall, i think it will appeal only to those whom we shouldn't be encouraging, rather than any supposed underlying message coming out for the rest of us to consider.
The plot is all rather banal: young, and in all probability, wealthy German youth party it up at the annual Love Parade in Berlin.
A story capturing my mind: although most of the audience in the cinema were laughing a lot and the two user comments I found in IMDB both claimed it was a funny movie, I found it rather sad.
i'd rather watch "COPS".
Some rather large plot holes that could have been easily avoided, if one were going to be honest, and at times the thing is frustratingly obscure and careless with logic.
A shame this is so bad really, because I like bad horror movies and actually rather liked the basic premise: Back when the Spanish were being generally unpleasant to natives in America, they enslaved the local populace and got them to mine all the gold out of the mountains and basically ended up with a wet dream's worth of gold.
Loud music is no warranty for a climax and in this case it causes rather more of an anti-climax and irritation.
The two of them are rather gloomy.
As a baby-boomer, I'd like to see more pop-culture related sitcoms like this revived rather than more waste-of-time reality shows.
Plus, believe it or not, some of the jokes were rather subtle.
Thankfully, as poor as this is (and there's a reason that a crow down your underpants never became a comedy staple) Stan and Ollie are the more-or-less the focus all the way through, rather than playing support in their own movie.
It's not a story of a changing family (life); it's rather the display of a huge load on the shoulders of a little girl.
And, what's worse, I wanted to make no further effort at all to try and understand the movie better - which is rather uncommon for me.
Stephen, the more inventive one of the duo (or rather, the one that will whip up a plan with a quirk or two not unlike Owen Wilson in Bottle Rocket), devises the first con to be that of intriguing the hell out of a group of kids- first part introducing Bloom to a girl, which he likes right away- and then leading to a cave that tricks them all into believing something is there which, of course, is not.
It combines my love of humor, hockey and music in a tale of romance and transformation that is smart, rather than sickly sweet.
Kim Ki-Duk's films often rely on facial expressions and gestures to convey the emotions of his characters, rather than loads of dialog.
The two make their living by hosting fishermen aboard the boat, and also tell fortunes in a rather bizarre and dangerous fashion, by shooting arrows whizzing past the girl's head into a Buddhist painting on the side of the boat.
Love, or rather the risk of loosing it, makes you hurt each other.
At first glance it looks like Sergiu Nicolaescu as old prince Morudzi performs rather flat, however the character he plays is supposed to be flat with few emotional variations.
About the DVD release: rather effective (mostly true to the original Romanian script) and easy to follow English subtitles, however, the person who did the translation seemed to have used some kind of "didactic", Romanian-English Dictionary Â based equivalents for many Romanian idioms.
Plugging into the generic lead role this time out are Albert Dupontel as David Hoffman, the take-no-prisoners cop who'd rather get the job done right than follow procedure.
So in less in an hour, we have laughably bad fights, a joke of a song, scary stunt handling, a guy doing a non-stop comedy routine with a dummy, and rather offensive jibes at stuttering people.
All this, and this rather curious confusion with the 1930's wardrobe mixed in with western drag.
A rather strange, slow-moving story about a writer (Hutton) working on a screenplay based on the exploits of a stripper (Burke) he has fallen for.
I rather enjoy all live stunts and no animation.
Well, for one, there's no one there who recognized the genius in this film, released as "The Flyboys," rather than "Sky Kids," the original title.
Sadly Pan doesn't see it that way and keeps telling her Grandson to fight rather than repeat the whole "sticks and stones" concept at bullies.
That is not actually a rhetorical question because what he is like is clearly Stephen Fry on steroids - physically rather than intellectually you understand.Now I am old and flabby,but my excuse is that I'm also poor and anonymous,I don't go to the gym(I wouldn't know what to do if I ever got there)and I don't have a personal trainer,a life coach or any other of those completely essential adjuncts to showbiz fame.Mr Seagal has no such cop outs.He is an "Action Movie" star,not a bleeding couch potato yet his spare tyre is bigger than the one on David Beckham's Hummer.
The first ten minutes made me laugh more than the whole of "The Bucket List".A blonde - haired lady with muscular thighs and some sort of circus costume jumps on and off lorries killing highly - armed soldiers before disappearing from our ken rather mysteriously.That bloke from Bros should have stuck to causing pre - pubescent girls to lose bladder control because there's more future in that for him than in acting.
While the reasons for his psychopathic behavior do not stem from latent homosexuality but rather some extremely half baked mention of his mother, perhaps Hanson utilized something of Hunter's sexuality in casting him in this role.
The action is all filmed rather than using stock footage, as in the other Seagal and Don E Fauntleroy team up, Today You Die, which borrowed from several films.
I would rather get injection into the base of my finger nails then watch one second of this "film" which is in true poor taste and form.
I would rather get injection into the base of my finger nails then watch one second of this "film" which is in true poor taste and form.
It is this relaxed sexual freedom that is more the moral center of this movie rather than the sex itself.
The director isn't even content with having that message subtly portrayed, but rather goes in for the slapping us with it.
We the audience see Henry and June through the eyes of Anais, which may mean it's not exactly as they really were, but rather a romanticised version of them.
If at times she overdoes the melodrama, she should be commended for managing to purr out some rather flowery dialogue without sounding silly.
Kaufman and Rousselot make the numerous sex-scenes things of beauty rather than titillating, they get creative with them.
"Brooklyn Lobster" takes a close, careful look at a group of people dealing with major and minor problems in a rather unusual family business.
The only "I'm being taught about lobster farms" moment I had was when a character explained that they don't actually breed lobsters, which I thought was rather interesting.
I had read a few print reviews of "Brooklyn Lobster" earlier, so I was aware that some critics had been rather unenthusiastic.
Jane Curtin, a rarely used actress, plays Maureen, the wife that has decided to move on, rather than to stay with Frank, yet, she still stays close to home.
The acting was genuine and both Danny Aiello and Jane Curtin should be applauded for the fact that they participated for the love of it, for a project they believed in, rather than for the almighty dollar.
Sadly, even the great tune "Shaft" was gone and the music was rather bland throughout the film!
The singing is rather bad, even if it's comedy singing you want to have people who can sing to a certain degree, the plot is full of holes and some places makes no sense at all.
The Captain's quest to re- capture the spirit of America that inspired him to begin with is rather sweet, and Kate Fitzpatrick is charming as the spunky heroine.
Almost everything about the film really is rather detestable and as such the characters are hard to care for; making watching the film akin to watching a car crash at times.
There is even one rather graphic love scene between the girl and the man in the bathroom, which follows further nudity as she is seen coming out of the bath and drying out; that it does not feel reprehensible or exploitative is a tribute to the remarkably sensitive performance of Karin Trentephol (who, perhaps unsurprisingly, never made another film appearance) as the girl.
A Passage to Ottawa is a superb family film in the league of Kolya, Children of Haven, and Central Station - sans the need for English subtitles - driven by emotions and story plot rather than sex and action.
Hopkins also strikes "attitudes" and she often poses dramatically as she stares off into the distance and speaks rather ponderous and unfunny speeches.
For that matter, the notion of a woman simultaneously enjoying the favors of two handsome young men seems rather passÃ©.
So they have a dilemma - who would she rather be with.
I don't mind that Ben Hecht wrote most of the film's dialog rather than Noel Coward, who wrote the original play.
In fact, the censors must have had a heart attack when they saw "Design," for this is one of the most sexually frank of the pre-Code Hollywood movies; premarital sex, cohabitation, adultery and frigidity are all clearly portrayed-- but, as always with Lubitsch, they are implied rather than shown.
(This is also one of the few Lubitsch films where the lead characters are American rather than European.)
It nevertheless it is a rather good- and also entertaining enough movie to watch, despite its obvious flaws and bad choices in the storytelling.
The rather dull narration of the stupidity of an insipid girl who learns all too slowly a very basic lesson about befriending wildlife - and gets off quite easily given the track record of that sort of thing.
While there's a nice moral at the heart of the film, and the rather quiet performance from NoÃ«l-Bruneau is quite lovely, the real star is the fox.
The movie, which boasts just one human being in its cast, young actress Bertille NoÃ«l-Bruneau, tells the story of the rather rare, though seemingly believable relationship between a child and a wild fox.
It's a little repetitive and in places quite harrowing and bloody scary for a younger child, particularly the rather dark ending.
I don't think this movie was made to be a statement, but rather to be disturbing, as the events it tells.
Still, some make-up effects in this film are Â although cheesy Â rather hard to digest.
The story may be complete bunkum, and the dialogue rather cheesy, but Antonio Margheriti's Cannibal Apocalype is still a great way to pass the time.
Margheriti keeps the action flowing nicely, only pausing slightly to throw in a sub-plot featuring a rather tasty teen who has the hots for Saxon.
The interesting twist this time is that THEY are the pursued flesh-eaters, rather than the other way around.
If i was any of the actors in the film i'd be rather ashamed but then again it could be just for the money.
The trouble is, it turns out she's rather willing to join them--which leads to a bizarre and confusing finale.
Re-writes were done up until the last minute and as a result the film seemed rather incoherent at times.
Additionally, someone decided to stick in a rather gross scene involving a stupid demon having sex with Nastassja Kinski.
That song depicts them getting together as companions in their struggle against their destiny, rather than sexually involved.
When they see the young boy, they figure he would be better off with them, rather than with the "termite people", the name they give to the white men who seem to devour all the trees.
Maybe it all could have worked if the scenes were build-up more seriously rather than so juvenile like.
The skill of the actors makes it painfully clear that they were chosen for their ability to arrive on the set, rather than talent.
For years, I've bemoaned the switch from film to digital video for low-budget horror movies, but I'd rather watch anything shot on video than watching the waste of film that is Dead Life.
Rehman..but its not fair to judge A r rehman with this movie because the music of a movie is to an extent influenced by the story and acting.......I wonder how someone like Ajith can ever be called an actor.....his dialogue delivery is pathetic and its better i don't mention his facial expressions......you'd do yourself a favour by not watching this movie...or rather watch it and educate others on how these kinda movies humiliate the once-enchanting Tamil film industry...Also....i beg the filmmakers not to cast people who are stone heads when it comes to dancing in roles that are supposed to highlight it.....For crying out loud, Ajith can't even dance to those funny dappankuthu songs...how can one tolerate him DANCING BHARATHANATYAM......the thought of him donning the role of a classical dancer would make good dancers of yesteryears turn in their graves.....And watch out for the scenes where Ajith is supposed to be projecting an effeminate side.....Its official ...he's the worst(or is there a worser term for that) thing that can happen to Tamil cinema.........
Despite a lovely murder scene that takes place in the middle of a load of bed sheets, the first half of the film is largely rather uninspiring; but as the film moves on, it mutates into one of the most grisly assaults that I've ever seen from Italy.
The plot follows a professor who is sent to stay with a fellow professor for reasons that are always left rather vague.
I'd far rather remember him this way than in the terminally un-funny 'Return of the Musketeers' from 1989 -- a corpse that should have been let lie if ever there was one -- and was extremely appreciative of the opportunity.
Unfortunately move-makers try too hard to make fathers seem "bad" in todays movies that Eddie's character seemed rather "forced".
The story is rather simplistic, which makes it great for kids, but interesting enough with enough humor to make it worthwhile for adults to enjoy.
Some parts were overly predictable, while the story flowed rather easily.
If you are looking for another Pirates of the Caribbean, wait for the film's sequel rather then searching for it in The Haunted Mansion.
Griffith doesn't even attempt to propose any sort of resolution, which does admittedly come off as rather hypocritical Â it is, after all, one thing to merely acknowledge a problem, and another to try and fix it.
I don't want to get a bad rep, so here's an OBJECTIVE comment, in context, for people who care about the quality of what they watch rather than just about the actor's looks.
If America only knew how good this was,it would be the highest rated Made-For-TV movie series of all time(hard to believe there are more people out there that would rather watch "The Columbo Mysteries" than Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe Chronicles- that just goes to show the power of major network name-brand advertising.
The main character dies and that is a rather suprise ending.
In this case, the idea is to deepen the groove, to follow the pattern and surprise with small things rather than the grand upsets of other stories.
The voodoo stuff was probably inspired by other Christie novels, such as "The Pale Horse" or "Endless Night" but it used up much screen time which I would have rather dedicated to actually seeing Lucky's death.
The adaptation also is rather lengthy, and there is some sluggish pacing in the middle half.
That room is getting rather full and flies are buzzing.
Contrary to what it's title suggests, Cannibal Man has nothing to do with cannibals or people being eaten; it's more a story about insanity in the mould of the 80's classic Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, only the blame is deflected onto society rather than the character himself.
This chain of murders could become rather dull, but the relaxed tone of the film and the way that we always focus on the escapades of the central character throughout his decent into insanity ensures that the film never turns into a riotous slash-fest.
If looked at as an insight into insanity; Cannibal Man is a rather potent film, which shows insanity doesn't have to be something that a murderer is born with.
The film feels rotten, like a slab of meat left out at the abattoir, and this helps to ensure that we always view our central character's plight with disgust and regret, rather than simply enjoying the killings.
That is a shame because it's useless to try and lure in horror/gore hounds for a film that's basically a nice moody drama that will leave one with a saddened, downbeat mood rather than thrills.
Though I'd rather have seen it in the original language with subtitles, I'm still happy Anchor Bay has rescued it and released it on DVD for folks like me who enjoy obscure films.
The neighbor's sexuality is handled in a rather refreshingly basic manner, not being stereotypically gay nor lecherous.
The violence works in context to the situations, rather than seeming gratuitous to satisfy those who feel they need to see that in order to enjoy a film.
Like many films of that European source and time, having no end credits leaves the viewer in a more affected mood with the film's rather abrupt ending.
The movie is the kind of comedy that relies on delivery of lines rather than action.
His current girlfriend reveals sexual exploits that he'd rather not have heard.
So now he has to serve a bunch of rather annoying or excessively weird people, with occasional help from his friend Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson), who "works" in the video store next to Quick Stop.
There are some very enjoyable parts to the film, especially the bits about the lemonade, but it is rather predictable in places and somewhat dull in others.
Black-and-white film clips interspersed with CNR's monologue detracted from the stories rather than enhance them.
In short it is a very bleak and rather depressing type of comedy.
About my only beef is the occasional clumsy camera & editing work that makes this film a wee bit of a challenge (the camera seems to be everywhere it's not supposed to be more than a few times,plus the framing seems to be way off,giving the film a rather clumsy,home movie look, such as 'Ziggy Stardust & The Spiders From Mars',which was marred by bad camera & editing work).
'Nude for Satan' just comes across as a rather pathetic excuse for loads of soft-porn love-in sessions.
It may be a combination of poor scripting or the fact I was rather tired at the point of watching this... in either case, I was unable to twig to the supposed outline of 'A doctor and the Devil battle for the soul of a beautiful woman'.
If you think it all sounds rather confusing so far, keep in mind that, for the sake of brevity and comprehension, I've left out most of the really weird aspects of the film in the above summary.
I went out into the world all doe-eyed and hopeful and offered myself up on the bloody alter of love and rather unsurprisingly, I got butchered.
This movie is more like a Wheat Thin, possibly underrated, certainly rather bland looking, but somehow much more satisfying and although it comes salty or in low sodium flavors, is surprisingly sweet without a trace of gooeyness.

Joe Fiennes is rather good in this sort of genre but I liked Monica Potter best of all, the American chick stuck on the end of the hook for the big US theatre going fish.
There is something wrong with the new American people, that whenever they can steal a dollar, they'd rather do that than earn it.
I could go on, but I'd rather not waste any more of my time on it.
The British government is the largest shareholder in these oil producing structures, and rather than pay the bad guys off, they hire a private mercenary (Moore) and his team to dispose of them.
This movie is worth watching if you get the chance as it is rather hold to get hold of.
Other than a cute girl (Sarah Roemer) who just moved in next door, the teen notices a man (David Morse) who acts rather suspiciously, and might be a serial killer.
This is a PG-13 movie that knows what it is and rather than titillate with coming as close to the line as possible, stays in check and deals out a healthy dose of mood and emotion rather than blood and sex.
Also, a lot happened throughout the film even though it only takes place within a day and within the same mall, rather than Clerks which was slow moving and downright boring in some parts.
While it is true that without his music Wild Man Fischer would have no claim to fame, and sometimes it's difficult to see the connection between all the plaudits lauded upon him by the various celebrities in this documentary and the numerous rather poor examples of his songs generously placed throughout the film, this documentary isn't really about how great or annoying his music is, it's about the Wild Man himself, and it turns out that it's a genuinely interesting story expertly told.
It's use in Lake Mungo has more impact as it is used as supporting material to support a larger story, rather than being the entire story in and of itself.
People expecting jumpy thrills will probably be a bit disappointed, but I rather enjoyed the fact that there's a bit more substance to the story.
The plot does not sound enticing, in fact, it sounds rather plain, however, this is not case fortunately.
Its all the typical restless ghost haunting a house story but damn is it effective... and even better, half way into the movie the ghost thing gets dropped when some rather earthly explanations start to surface and the family looks deeper into the last weeks of her daughters life.
It accomplishes much more than this year's other big effort, "Paranormal Activity", which, I found rather tame at best.
Nonetheless, I actually disagree with a lot of the other reviewers and say that I rather like the added visual effects.
Donald Westlake's book is turned into a rather dull movie by director Gordon Flemyng.
Directed by Gordon Flemyng this late 60's crime heist action thriller is unfairly rather obscure but is worth the effort to track a copy down, although you can compare The Split to The Italian Job (1969) since they are both 60's heist films The Split was made & released a year before.
The script by Robert Sabaroff was based on the novel 'The Seventh' by Donald E. Westlake can be divided into three chunks, the first third of the film revolves around the recruiting of the team with some fun set-pieces to make sure each member is up to the task, the second third of the film is my favourite when they carry out the heist & there's that feeling that you root for them & you want to get away with it & all the close calls they have & watching the plan unfold is pretty fun, then the final third of the film is perhaps the weakest as several random events come together & tear the thieves apart & it becomes a rather dull runaround after the money which goes missing through no fault of their own but does obviously cause problems as they don't know who to trust.
Then there's the ending when everyone gets shot & it just all seems rather pointless.
Selecting his ex-con cohorts by means of making them display their muscles (not especially their skills) is rather perplexing, though it works for the movie.
Great classic film, but the acting at times gets boring and rather phony sounding.
A total bomb when it first hit in 1932, Rain today holds up rather well for today's audience to enjoy.
Crawford's outfits and make up are rather bizarre, one part gypsy, one part hooker.
Barnet catches up to Muni later and tells him that "Sadie" chose the Marine rather than the "cloth" (Minister).
He tries to persuade her to go away with him, rather than return to the U.S. to "pay for her sins" as the missionary has convinced her she must.
Jack Clayton's direction is good, if rather literary, the house is a spooky, claustrophobic menace, while the child actors are uniformly excellent.
I enjoy films that don't spoon-feed me the answers, but rather allow me to draw my own conclusions.
I wanted to like this I really did, and to it's merit it did start off rather well, but as it went on it became a casualty of too many twists spoiling the stew.
If I have any gripe at all about the series of 'Holmes' films that Rathbone and Bruce made is, they are all between 60 to 75 minutes long.... To me, that means rather short...
This is rather surprising and disappointing for a PG rated film that was written by Tim Conway who was always so very funny on the Carol Burnett show.
Although predictable (we know that nothing serious could happen to our stupid heroes), the entire show is rather amusing and keeps the viewer's interest.
Presented at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival in the 'Quinzaine des RÃ©alisateurs' category - a category promoting abstract and rather unusual movies - 'La Moustache' follows the intricate story of Marc Thiriez (Vincent Lindon), an ordinary Parisian architect who slips into a vicious identity crisis after he spontaneously shaves off his moustache.
i was so looking forward to this film... methought the title held much interesting promise... i was cozy to it at first, however, as the film progressed, I couldn't understand why the director chose to propagandize rather than tell a story depicting the human condition... all the material was there to tell a great story of two peoples, but instead the director prostituted himself to covert politics instead of the art of storytelling... too bad.... the content turned me off as i was never given a chance to make my own mind up, but rather I was constantly told how to 'feel and think' about the story's dilemma... the director missed a great artistic opportunity... that's why i'm giving it a score of 1(awful)...but I did like the score!
Great leaders of every nation and period practiced some form of religion, but many of these pseudo documentaries tend to bring the religion to the forefront rather than the politics of the era.
It's important to realize that this is not an objective view but rather a very professional production burdened with a bias in favor of Islam.
Andy Griffith shows his Matlock image rather than the lighter Andy Griffith Show personification.
Each is given excellent coverage but it is very much a secular description rather than a religious one.
Quark, the uncle of one of the thieves tries to get his nephew released and Sisko says he will release him on one condition: he reopens his bar rather then leaving the station.
I was astonished to see Miles and Keiko O'Brien becoming part of the show, which affected deeply their personal lives as they moved from the excessive perfection of the USS Enterprise to the station that resembles our gritty reality rather than Roddenberry's perfect future.
I'd much rather watch 90 minutes of the producers, screenwriters, director and actors being flogged Â they've certainly earned some punishment for perpetrating this nuclear disaster on an unsuspecting audience.
An absolute trash B movie that I'm sure many of those associated with would rather forget, it is nonetheless hugely compelling.
My only complaint is that there was too much silly playing between the lost boys and Peter in the middle of the film, and I feel that this became rather monotonous.
The Lost Boys were terrible -they came across as bratty, overindulged hoodlums rather than young, innocent, mischievous children and it was quite impossible to feel any empathy with or them -they were good actors but badly written characters   Nevertheless, despite these flaws, this is still a worthwhile and enjoyable movie that I think young children will enjoy.
The only downside is that it could have been longer, although the rather short (compared to most movies) length does a good job of not making the flow feel dull or boring.
It should be noted that most acts of terrorism are done with ideological motivation, rather than religious ones, but still in this movie you see the 'terrorists' praying to the east every other ten minutes, and in almost every line they speak about Allah, and their devotion to Islam.
It seems more reasonable to classify Traitor as an exciting drama rather than an action flick.
Fareed is no Mohammed Atta (fanatic ringleader of the 9/11 terrorists) but rather an urbane yuppie-type who thinks nothing of drinking alcohol in front of Omar and Samir (supposed devout Muslims).
Then he also manages to shoot the two terrorist masterminds without any bodyguards being present (Note that the main boss, Nathir, again is no scary Mohammed Atta-typeÂbut rather an ordinary businessman).
The father/son relationship doesn't work, the over done helicopter shots make you dizzy like its a glossy infomercial for Gallo wine, and the sunlight thru the pepsi ad commercial barn house feels like directing of a Michael Bay-wanna be, and how on earth did they pick these horrible young actors that are way 'too pretty to be anything but a TV soap star or model' Even the bartender has glossy lipstick that makes her look like a Coyote Ugly girl rather than some 70s hippie bar chick.
About 60 minutes into the movie, one finally realizes that this is not a spy-thriller, or a mystery film, but rather a depiction of what happens when a bunch of self-centered morons are turned loose and run around like chickens with their heads cut off, so to speak.
The point I am desperately trying to get to here is that, I didn't laugh at either The Big Lebowski or O' Brother, Where Art' Thou despite the fact they are rather funny, I laughed several times at Burn After Reading, and I laughed rather hard to.
It's good for some laughs, and it's still rather Coen-y so go pick it up.
rather than being reassigned.
Ultimately, "Burn After Reading" devotes more time to infidelity rather than of espionage.
She doesn't get as many laughs as the rest, and it seems like the Coens just needed her as a plot device rather than an actual character.
Yes, some of the lines might be rather lame.
We also have Doug McClure trying to get back into Tina Louise's pants, Billy Crystal playing a rather fey steward, John Delancie in training for his future role as Q, and Peter Graves as one half of a former May-December romance.
The villain has much more screen time so you get to understand what she feels rather than when she didn't show rage and was cool and collected in the original.
I don't write this review to simply be critical of this piece of poorly-conceived garbage, but rather as a warning to all the Clancy fans out there still considering seeing this movie.
The characters are rather out of character for my taste, but thats only if you're traditional.
On the up side the script was sharp, with some great one liners, and at least the main characters were talking to each other rather than grunting at each other.
It's uncomfortable (c'mon, it's radiation poisoning we're dealing with here...it's frightening stuff we'd all rather not think about), and in a nutshell, it's depressing.
At over two hours, Mike Nichols' "Silkwood" is rather long and slowly paced, and not quite what I was expecting.
While it's not great either, I'd much rather watch Norma Rae again than this.
Nearly 75% of the movie is shot with what appears to be an 8mm videocamera rather than movie film.
This is probably the biggest mistake, as it only adds to the shoddy atmosphere, making it look like a home movie rather than a commercial production.
In the beginning, Karen seems to be an average working-class girl living a rather simple life, without any ambitions or hidden potential.
One of the things that many movies are missing these days are the small details and things that happen in everyday life - and how we are able to learn about characters through small visual clues rather than the large hammer of exposition-driven dialogue.
We don't know their tunes, though some might have been similar to early medieval or middle eastern type music rather than new age pseudo Native American dirges used in the film.
Herbs were used in medicine rather than cooking.
The story of the Peach Girl is rather familiar and I've seen several movies with very similar plots.
Because the story is rather familiar (I have seen several variations on this story made in both Japan and China), it is very competently and beautifully done.
The Movie Hero is a rather interesting metaphor for life.
Her presence is most rewarding in a rather awkward film.
So itÂ´s the directors folly, but itÂ´s very interesting to see the 80Â´s again, people like Nureyev, Harvey Kietel and Bibi Andersson, a terrorist groupsÂ´ way of thinking from the inside, and the looseness of the film is rather appealing if one can give reality a rest.
The Warrior Path, paradoxically does not lead to wanton violence, but rather effectively eliminates it.
You wait and wait for something to finally happen, something that will make half-way any sense, something that will connect the rather flimsy-looking dots into something at least resembling logic but then...
Funny thing is that its a clichÃ©d happy end with ghosts finding their peace but topped of with a rather bleak outlook for our main character.
So if you take the mysterious unfolding of Ring, the haunted apartment story of Ju-On, the rather down to earth story behind the ghosts from Dark Water and put it all in a blender with a hundred ideas from other similar movies you get the mash that Echo is.
I'd rather kill myself than watch Lipstick Jungle.
For most police series I rather watch British series such as Foyle's War, Midsomer Murders, New Tricks, Rosemary & Thyme, A Touch Of Frost, etc.
rather than those hyper tension ones that American networks are bringing out.
Michael Kitchen absolutely shines in this fine series; it is about moral dilemmas rather than crime.
The problem was I didn't particularly feel any sympathy for any of the characters (well, only the first victim) and the film's final revelation is rather flimsy and truly unfulfilling.
That magic was to suggest rather than to show; to plant seeds in viewers' imaginations and let them grow.
There is a sense of primitive feeling, of old religion, throughout the film, implied rather than stated, that is beyond the grasp of the hyper-rational lead players.
There are loose ends for sure, but Tourneur's polite, civilized touch dresses them up to appear profound and suggestive rather than threadbare, and the result is a pleasing conclusion that does not quite give the whole thing away; and we are left wanting to know just a little bit more.
Cornell Woolrich (whose novel BLACK ALIBI was the impetus for this film) was definitely ahead of the curve on this one and the Lewton approach (to suggest rather than to show; to imply rather than indulge) fits, if you'll pardon the allusion, like a glove... Woolrich and Lewton were both on the same wave length, and THE LEOPARD MAN comes highly recommended.
Such happens here, and it is rather pointless to have the subject of a documentary be so contemptible.
Their childhoods and adolescenes are best quantified by LACK rather than excess.
I would recommend spending your time on some other movies such as Dawn of the dead 2004 remake or something like that rather than this movie.
Appropriately grim with a rather downbeat climax as governmental biological teams finally arrive after night closes, with many of the cast members either dead or turned.
This movie had the look and feel of something much more mesmerizing and sedated than just your typical outbreak story, it had family values, emotional battles, REAL looking people rather than beautiful young teens and some very sad and unexpected moments.
Part of the time it's rather claustrophobic, with the tiny apartments crammed with space, or the restaurants and bars that are shoved into spaces that are half the size of regular shops.
I haven't been genuinely freaked about by a film in a ling time (I mean, I love the Saw movies, but I find them interesting rather than scary.
Some of the other reviews adequately cover the actual synopsis - I just wanted to comment on the way that Jim Mickle and his team (especially the actors and camera crew) seem to have pulled a rather good rabbit out of a low budget hat.
The title is rather misleading as the "rock" is only shown briefly and appears to be in the middle of a lake; as if swimming there would be going nowhere.
I can say from experience that the first segment of the film, "Fiction", is a rather accurate view of a college creative writing class.
it will also find an audience with people who would rather savage than understand other people, pre-judging them to something like Sartre's No Exit or a Neil Labutte (sp?)
but either way, you won't see the kinder, more humane moments of life in this movie, and for that, it is a rather sad, simple, pathetic kind of story.
I would rather not give a plot summary nor deliberate on inconsequential details of the movie, but suffice to say this is a must see!
Also notable is his defiant decision to, rather than cut his film according to MPAA standards to give it an R rating instead of NC-17, create a ridiculously large red box to mask the sex scene in "Fiction".
Worth watching, if only to see something you might not have see before (this type of match occurred only twice, I believe, and the other replaces Hart with Steve Blackman....who would YOU rather watch??)
The film is more of an adventure/comedy rather than a straight comedy.
Then a rather under-appreciated book by British SF writer James White, The Watch Below.
Second, the ending felt rather abrupt, the film could've done with a more rounded finish.
Thirdly, the pacing is rather slow and drawn out at times particularly in the middle half.
The only puzzling casting is that of Murray as the town's jovial mayor; he seems glib and cheerful enough, but it almost feels like he's being ironic, rather than being a part of the story.
Following the goings-on in the town including stuff about various locals, Babe's life at home with his mother and foster-sister (an adorable little gal known as "Pigtails" who sports braids that stick out on each side of her head) and Babe's interest in a local woman who appears to be rather fickle.
The animation is very effective and beautiful if rather simple.
Or rather stop a bit too often.
However, the movie seems to be made to provoke thought about the value of life rather than to amuse the audience.
There should be a scene of him interrogating one rebel in the middle of the film, rather than him describing it.
So, rather than build extreme tension between two people, like in the German film, Lee allows for a slow construction of backstory and relationship with all involved.
Jiazhi devoted herself into the love of Mr. Yee that she chose Yee rather than her first love and let Yee ended her life (she could have taken her pill).
LeeHom is rather wooden though as the de-factor youth leader, and his romantic moments with Tang Wei just falls flat given that it's not fully developed here, if not for the focus of love between Mr Yee and Mrs Mak.
Albert Finney plays a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon whose clients start dying in rather gruesome ways.
(SPOILER END)  Gaston is effective as a shallow, egotistical fool and an obsessively persistent suitor, but attempts to make him a villain are rather contrived.
It also has its rather funny scenes as a couple of those deaths that happen when they are filming those bad commercials are just great.
The cast is rather good too, as Albert Finney may not be an action star, but he does really good here.
For people wanting to see the 'real' Australia, rather than the Crocodile Dundee myths, this movie is a classic.
The episodes that feature other actresses in action, rather than Krista, of course, aren't as interesting.
He seems to really enjoy jamming with some old friends rather than offer any directorial suggestions.
He speaks endlessly, and makes big broad gestures, pretending to be the genius that we know he is, but coming across as rather full of himself.
Neither washes, with the solving of the crime is rather rote and unexciting.
For me, at least, I'd rather not see it: what remains, and what should for God sakes be shown to a wider and more receptive Beatles audience, is very good stuff.
There also is an element of the renegade in this coming out party, with John at last showing the liveliness for which he was famous as the group rather audaciously decides to wake the old town up.
The scenes where Phillips shows Clark round 'Project Tic-Toc' impress even now, with sets that look designed for the cinema ( I was reminded of the Krel complex in 'Forbidden Planet' ) rather than television.
Remember people tend to like and appreciate anything that least offends them rather than pure truth, as the clichÃ© goes , truth hurts.
arguments in which there IS an _opposing_ point of view, rather than just blind anti-Republican, anti-Bush hatred (8-9)*5 For proof (rather most recent of many), of the many just watch his defense of Kerry Nov 2 2006, soon after his (Kerry's) gaffe about lacking education and ending up in Iraq.His hilarious attempt at bolstering his position is even crushed by his own guest Thomas Ricks.

Its ironic that he constantly rips on right wing talk show hosts for being so hateful, but in my opinion he is just as hateful (if not more), just from the left rather than the right.
Each story is covered in depth rather than spending 10 minutes endlessly debating a few points that other shows do.
He and guests discuss the topic with a genuine interest in the facts rather than the spin.
Ahmed is NOT a character performance, Oscar material or anything, but Valentino instills this cardboard figure with the warmth of life, a quickening of the pulse, all very controlled and tasteful and humanly affecting rather than superhumanly virile.
Some is even rather dumb (such as when Janet Leigh confronts Valiant at the 50 minute mark).
Today (2001) it is rather passe to have a black actor in a major role, jazz as the defining music, unstructured modern dance a la Martha Graham, and progressive political ideas bantered about.
Our characters don't exactly progress through standard melodramatic devices but rather through a process of self-recognition best exemplified through the relationship between Kitty (Jeanne Cagney) and Tom.
Personal taste will have to determine the picture's ultimate value, though Cagney's low-keyed self-assurance (some may say smugness) is rather enjoyable--and his presence is certainly odd in these corny circumstances.
Cronenberg is fantastic as a director because rather than being concerned with making the film accessible, he cares more for making a good film and projecting his vision.
I would have preferred to see Stathis the fly monster rather than Seth because for a man that sweet to change that badly, really gets me down.
At this point one of the girls in the room rather loudly asked of the tutor, jokingly but in something of a shaky voice, "Why are you doing this?"
While I could try to explain the plot as well as how all these characters come together in the film, I'd rather not--as the film is a super-frenetic mess.
More could have been done with the mythic Greek elements of the story, rather than falling back on Edgar Allan Poe's "The Premature Burial".
Nestor Paiva played a helpful ambiguous peasant and Joseph Vitale a rather unhelpful serious dancer, some of their best stuff was to come later with Paramount.
I've always loved the film and, while I concede that it moves rather slowly, the atmosphere it conjures up is simply marvelous (Jack Mackenzie's cinematography is outstanding) - with the island setting recalling I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE (1943), but given added strangeness by being played out against a backdrop of war.
By today's standards the movie may seem tame, 'stagey' and slow but if you sit there with the lights off and the volume turned up and prepare yourself for some old time atmospherics and chills rather than shocks and gore, you're in for a real treat.
This one is suggestive rather than shocking, and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes the subtle horrors of Cat People, The Innocents, or even Rosemary's Baby.
Samuel L. Jackson is too typical, Milla Jovovich is WAY too typical, and Doug Huchison is rather disappointing.
The themes include a robbery plan that goes awry though here it is more of a con rather than robbery and it is executed without resorting to violence.
Second theme is domed love   which in this movie is rather short, more of this later.
I am really glad that the Disney Channel took the time, money, and effort to make this rather dazzling movie!
When I knew her very slightly as a youngster, she was 57 and rather uncommunicative, and she seemed depressed, so I never knew the 'lively Loy'.
After Loy spends some time with Powell, she decides she'd rather be with him, and eventually they marry, and Powell moves from DA to governor.
Recommended, but please don't judge it by the first 20 minutes which are rather slow-moving, but still entertaining.
At first, seeing that this film is on Sundance's ASIA EXTREME-I could've sworn it would be horror rather than a disturbing drama.
Whatever one feels this film is rather oddball given its subject matter and content.
His characters never follow any kind of real internal logic, but rather act according to the scenario he conceives.
It reminds me of an old Italian movie, I can't remember the name or actors because I've seen it when I was a kid, with a mafia boss that falls in love with a woman, kidnaps her but wants to charms her, rather that rape her.
This is also about a generally violent man who's attention is captured by a beautiful girl and he also wants access to her soul, rather than her body.
I'd also like to point out Dink's friend Jonah, a black kid whose character is handled rather tastefully: "That's Jonah.
Wallace Beery had some lean times after motion pictures transitioned to sound, however he got a new lease on his career at MGM, and it turned out that his coarse voice attracted fans rather than repelled them.
The Champ also sees Roscoe Ates in one of his largest roles, and for once getting to appear as a normal person rather than the stuttering fool he was usually required to play.
I know the concept of "real sound" is a disputable one, as sounding real on screen may just entail being a good actor, rather than a realistic one, but nonetheless he does seem far more genuine than the rest of the cast.
Yes, the fight scene is rather hokey: had they tried to use Wallace Beery's telegraphed-the-day-before roundhouse punches, even the toe-to-toe sluggers of 'The Champ's bygone day wouldn't have survived one round in the ring.
"You mean she would rather imagine herself relating to an absent person than build relationships with those around her?"
It was just so refreshing to watch a movie where your imagination was free to soar rather than feel confused by the apparent deja vu from last year's first installment of the same pointless drivel.
I rather enjoyed watching "Shooting Fish" on a hot, humid summer night, when there was nothing better to do than rent a video.
Compared to most other films "Amelie" (and I will stick to "Amelie" since "Le Fabuleux destin d'AmÃ©lie Poulain" is a bit long to write) is based on a rather ordinary and plain story everyone can relate to, but it is given to us in a very special kind of way, mixed with wonderful little subplots and an almost chaotic amount of details.
One wonders whether a better portrayal of a fascinating story would have been achieved with the lead played by a more natural actor, rather than the wife of the director.
However, this rather stiff style is of it's age and so hardly surprising as it was not made in the times of Susan Sarandon or Meryl Streep.
Enjoyed this 1950 true story about a young woman named Madeleine Smith, (Ann Todd) who lived in Glasgow, Scotland in 1857 and the story begins with the Smith family looking for a rather large home.
Ann Todd is a good actress, though an internalized one who comes off as rather cold.
They never crouch or lie down for better aim, they rather stand up in clear sight.
The success of Jeanette MacDonald was due much more to her sex appeal rather than to her singing voice.
This is a breezy romp rather than ART!
Of course, Greta Garbo,(Lillie Sterling), looked very sexy and rather young and having an old looking husband, who was Lewis Stone,(John Sterling), who loved and adored everything about Lillie.
It is rather overlong and could have been trimmed by half an hour without any ill effects.
There are also two sequences, one a chorus singing a title song, the other an elaborate (overlong and rather boring as well) presentation of native Javanese dancers, complete with a chorus, claps, calls, stomps etc.
Even in what for her was a rather minor film, she is a marvel to watch, beyond superlatives, exhausting all adjectives.
He also is the umpire for the local baseball team, the pitcher for whom is a teenage lad Dave Tibbel (Trevor Morgan), a boy whose mother deserted her family leaving Dave and his younger sister Ashley (Sonia Feigelson) in the care of functionless distant father (Timothy Hutton), a man who would rather avoid any conversation or emotional support with his confused kids.
The action is fast and well staged, and the film's humor is so effective that it has often been seen (mistakenly, I believe) as a spoof of its genre, rather than as the fine example it is of the genre at its best.
It's nice to see an indie film use an actual orchestra and choir rather than capitulate to the compromised sounds produced by computers and synthesizers.
If I were the filmmakers, I would not market this film as a horror, but rather a thriller.
I'd rather follow an antÂ´s trail straight to their home instead of watching this crap again or any similar attempt to kill the most insignificant sense of film appreciation in a moviegoer.
It is cool to see a Romantic Comedy have an all Latin cast and it was good to see Latinas being successful in life, rather then just being a maid or some illegal.
Here again, the movie doesn't nosedive and morph into a conventional love story; rather, the romance builds in a backdrop to the main story and culminates in a heartwarming finale.
A bawab is a doorkeeper, more like a concierge or a super in New York rather than "janitor" as it's translated.
It's a rather sad picture with its disapproval of the present and nostalgia for the past.. And again, despite the three or six million dollars spent, some exterior sound is awful, the wrong kind of lens is used to pan up and down the city buildings, and some of the Islamicists' beards look pasted on.
She makes her character accessible, and plays her with a savvy, rather than naive sensibility, and it's a portrayal that works well.
It's a somewhat neglected film, maybe because it's basically a gangster picture rather than a noir, and rather late in the day for such things.
Particularly in the hard-boiled flicks, a menace that was somehow felt, rather than seen, and therefore more powerful.
The story is not exactly Shakespeare, of course, but naturally most people will be tuning in for the porn and the story helps to ensure that it actually has some point, rather than just being a collection of random sex scenes, and that does benefit the film immensely.
When he sets up the first scene as we see these "undead" monks chanting a rather harmonic tune, the wind ever present, you kind of get an idea that something within the atmosphere of this place in unstable.
If it has a fault, it is that I felt the film was perhaps a little didactic, an instructional piece of history rather than an emotionally engaging human drama; we witness Mitchell's career frustrations and achievements (oddly, it is never made clear just why Crisp blacked out with almost fatal results in that early seaplane competition; one would assume it was from the hitherto unexpected g-forces produced by banking at such record speeds, but the issue, subsequently a well-known fighter pilot phenomenon, is simply dropped unexplained)... but it is only at the end of the story, where Mitchell in effect deliberately sacrifices his own chances of survival in order to get the Spitfire design finished, that we are actually drawn into the tensions of the tale rather than merely observing.
It is undoubtedly a pity, however, that Leslie Howard's directorial career was cut short by enemy action; in his choice to serve his country in wartime cinema rather than pursue a Hollywood career, he proved himself to be a weapon of considerable effectiveness, and it is ironic in the context of this film that, as in the case of R.J.Mitchell, it proved to be a choice that may well have cost him his own life.
The soundtrack on most broadcast copies is rather poor,but the quality of the music score is beyond question.The composer ,william Walton was commissioned at the time but his music was not thought particularly noteworthy .It was not until the 1960's his music was accredited rightly in my view as a work of sheer brilliance.
the guy's ceiling caves in and the girl starts to get annoyed and well it's kinda a weird metaphor for the simultaneous pleasure ,degregation, and pain of a rather intense crush.
there's also a kinda zombie-virus-sub-plot too and a lot of weird little scenes where the girl acts out her desires through rather innocent and kinda fun 50's doo-wop sequences.
There's an utter, nonchalant demystification of almost everything about his characters, sidestepping backstory or most cultural signifiers (which does amplify the isolation of the characters), making THE HOLE - and his other films - rather disorienting, but also always fascinating and insightful.
Still, it has many redeeming features, including the To Die For gorgeous Michael Praed, the always fun Catherine Mary Stuart (playing what was a black amazon woman in the book as a rather uninteresting white girl - can't blame HER for that).
Even the crazy Michael Des Barres is great, but I would have rather seen the oh-so-cool pocket void-head explosion brought on by the blood-pressure-increasing psychic drug scene, over the silly cuts-off-half-his-head-and-he-keeps-on-fighting nonsense this movie had.
The story was beautiful and provoked deep emotions in many sections, but I felt that much of the talent was aimed at displaying the ordinary communication within the family rather than the love of music or whatever passion the main characters may have had for their chosen lives.
The author answered it on his web site - "It was that month that I began writing "Loose Change," a fictional story about my friends and I discovering that September 11th was not a terrorist attack, but rather, an attack by their own government."
A film called screw loose change debunks practically every point made in loose change and rather convincingly.
And it seems this is due to lack of trying rather than difficulty of mixing.
Like other Canadian horror movies, this one too, is rather mild and benevolent and opposed to the recent wave of mean-spirited American productions.
This, not unnaturally, leaves the audience standing on the outside of the film's reality rather than entering it.
The scares in this film were okay, I enjoyed the chest bursts and the spider-things, but they weren't scary, rather they were just plain weird and unexpected.
The aliens when revealed are nothing special in themselves & look rather dark & drab & to save on the budget very humanoid in shape.
AS I have already said the film spends too much time on dull teenage angst & dramatics rather than genuine chills of which there are virtually none.
"Decoys" is loaded with fake scares and plenty of bad CGI imagery.The almost complete lack of gore and violence is also hard to forgive.There are some mildly humorous moments,but the pace is rather slow and the acting is weak.So if you want a proper and intelligent Canadian horror watch again "Ginger Snaps" or check out late 70's slasher classic "Rituals".
As a scene ends it always seems to tell what is going to happen in the next and this is rather annoying as well.
True, the ending was lacking in continuity, and left one with a sense of disappointment, but my husband and I rather enjoyed this movie.Contrary to other comments below, Jessica Lange and Johnathon Schaech did fine jobs!
There was real scope here for a wittier script, instead it all got rather tedious, 30 minutes could easily have been lopped off the running time.
This was a film that got a rather high score in the Leonard Maltin Guide--saying the film was "still potent".
Hunter emphasizes suspense and atmosphere over violence, and his clever script maintains an impressive degree of logic, isolating potential victims through careful calculation rather than narrative contrivance.
I would recommend that rather than watching this you spend the time looking for other, better, films to watch.
What he discovers is a rather sophisticated operation of gambling and drug dealing.
Desperate interns, a seductive and crooked ward nurse played by Colleen Grey, and a rather demented hospital maintenance man (Pops) played by Richard Tabor, together call into question the very integrity of the famous hospital.
Sam Neill and John Rhys Davies appear to give powerful performances as "Norman dogs" people not so much afraid for the good but rather absorbed by savage brutality.
If someone insists on me to say which one is better, I'd rather say both are good films.
Summing up: The film portrays Medieval England as both civilized and savage, and the castles and costumes are plausible rather than costly.
The movie seemed so serious and rather dark at the time.
They should have the scale be a zero on this movie, because I would rather put that instead of a one (because it doesn't even amount to a one).
He IS rather likable if you aren't looking for an Arnold or a Clint to carry your movie.
I rather suspect with that strong chin and wedge shaped face that he is the type that looks much better in person than on film, which is the sad case for many otherwise decent actors.
Okay, I can't stress this enough but the 'hero's' chin really does focus your attention on him rather than what masquerades as a plot.
