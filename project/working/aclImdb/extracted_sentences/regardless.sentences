As usual Gary proves able to sculpt a sympathetic protagonist who is able to win over the audience into rooting for him regardless of the sometimes violent methods he uses to defeat his foes and here his vengeance against the criminal fraternity who destroyed his family and friends is nothing short of apocalyptic.As well as the superb physical skills that Gary brings to his performances he is capable of portraying strong human emotions also.He is always very effective indeed in scenes involving children and it can be no accident that he is often cast as a father in his films.Martial arts are absent from this tale until the final thirty minutes and when they finally appear in a series of brutal and superbly well choreographed fights you realise that you are watching a master at work.There are simply no current screen martial arts stars (Chinese,European or American)who could have brought what Gary Daniels brings to this role.This is a movie that should be sought by anyone who professes to enjoy action and if they enjoyed it half as much as I did then it won't be long before they seek out other Gary Daniels movies.They won't be disappointed,if anyone working in this genre delivers the kind of energy that Gary Daniels does in every role then they are being very quiet about it.Keep the British flag flying Gary for there isn't any young actor in the UK today who looks as if they even have the strength to even lift the flag up.Only the US is capable of producing a movie like RECOIL and long may they continue.
