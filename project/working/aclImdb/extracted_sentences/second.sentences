As she slowly makes her way to where Willis is, Zemeckis chooses to cut to Hawn for a brief second.
The definite challenge for a film director is his second movie.
This film is a Western, but combines a number of strange bedfellows - the romantic comedies of Hawks (two men fight over a woman treated as a slave); melodrama (the film is brilliant at visualising the limited options open to Rachel, from the proscenium curtains looking out at a world she has no freedom in and the metronome ticking away her life, to the overall claustrophobic setting (a small farm) and limited dramatis personae), and even psychological thriller (like REBECCA, Rachel is a second wife living in the shadow of a perfect predecessor; both films share a cathartic conflagration).

This is an odd little Korean film about 4 slacker-types who rob a gas station, and come back to rob it a second time.
Stylish and action packed (and a close second to Glengarry Glen Ross in the most swearing stakes).
I hope that maybe there will be enough inspiration or imagination to make a second season.
There is the friend(ex-partner) who is setting him up for the second time.
You will go back for a second and third look at "Night Nurse".
The second half of this film is just a real shift in the focus of this story to the very oddball starvation/murder plot.
The second part of the film concerns Stanwyck being assigned as a private night nurse to some kids who are being slowly starved to death.
Jean remains ubiquitous in Marie's life, he is always there and only disappears in a few scenes when reality comes in her life for a second.
I disagree with a few comments below: first, I believe it 'is' appropriate to switch back and forth between French and English because the character is an english literature professor in Paris and has bilingual friends; second, I feel it is unfair of anyone to characterize the main character as elderly, she is sensual, attractive, and tentatively has a good life to live in her future.
The second scenario is of the same thing happening to an Arab man (they never really say which country he's from) being hooded and abducted and taken to an FBI building where he's questioned.

The second Arnold steps onscreen, you know it's time for blood and bullets, plain and simple.
This in my humble opinion is probably the second best sci-fi movie of all time.
The epitome of this nonsense is the proto-goth, heavy-faced heaven-aligned "heroine" of the second season who is having trouble deciding whether to kill the antichrist Malachi, or play kinky dress-up with him instead.
I would definitely like another season to see what happens after the finale of the second season.
I for one enjoy watching it and am currently watching the show a second time.
this show is about feelings(mostly sad ones) and about both avoiding and facing your destiny...  **major spoilers ahead**  True the first season were very different from the second one, but they had the same mood and theme.
BTW the 2nd series is way better than the 1st so if you watched it and believed it was mediocre watch the second season cause it is brill.

Epidemic has been scheduled in order to obtain money for another movie - Lars intended to ask money for two different movies and to use almost all of the money to realize the first one (Europe), leaving few dollars to realize the second one (Epidemic).
This second feature by Lars von Trier reveals many of the director's obsessions with cinema.
Last month, I went back for my second visit, 7 years later.
okay first of all what happened to the bad ass Kalina she is now an old whore who is aways calm but in the second game she was evil twist did whatever the *bleep* she wanted she didn't care who she hurt or how it was done she would do anything to save herself.
next is the prince himself he was sissified since the second game now he is stupid and who ever voices him should burn inf *bleeping* hell!
the awesome sound track from the second is replaced with the worst band in history maybe i did make the mistake of playing the second game first but it did rule.
This can be disturbing, though it is not as bleak as the second one.
The second season just started and you can be able to jump in without having any knowledge about the characters.
I really hope it gets a second season at least.
Would have rated it a lot higher if the lengthy, jerky, and dizzying camera time lapses were cut to a smooth one second blur like the One Second Watch in Trancers.

Unfortunately, Maha's second movie about a murder on a Sunday morning fails to capture any of the reality of the North Carolina murder case, and ends up being nothing short of fantasy.
After bulking up your knowledge of the opposing viewpoint and forensic evidence, watch The Staircase a second time and experience a whole new set of "Aha!"
This effort is worth a sincere second look and a re-release.
That is why films like the Star Wars saga really aren't Sci-Fi, but action/adventure first (and in the case of Star Wars, fantasy) and science fiction second at best.
Yesterday it was shown again on TV and it had exactly the same effect on me throughout this second viewing.
As it has been said on IMDb, there are many wonderful quotes and the comedy is wound up and running like a second grade class full of Hershy Kisses.

That is why films like the Star Wars saga really aren't Sci-Fi, but action/adventure first (and in the case of Star Wars, fantasy) and science fiction second at best.
So I watched it with them again and after seeing it for the second time I remembered some really funny characters Dana Carvey does.
Richard Tyson plays one hell of a werewolf and his character can definitely be placed under the second category.
If you want a serious well made movie which this one is grafted from,Deliverance is the Gold Standard and Southern Comfort comes in a close second.
The second story revolves around a teenaged girl (Amy Irving) who discovers that she too has paranormal powers.
Glaringly funny at points however it has fantastic intricacies you only catch the second time around (the old C4 logo needless detail but makes a massive difference).
Seriously, it deserved a second series on the strength of it's one song alone!
I truly hope that Darkplace gets a much needed second series.
It comes second to Arrested Development for me, and that is the only show that I would ever rate 10/10.
I, for one, can't wait for the DVD and/or a second batch of episodes "from the Channel 4 vaults".
The second big revelation is that Ross originally had a very low key ending with no real dancing in the final dance sequence.
Reverand Shaw (John Lithgow) is even more intense than that guy in "Chocolat" -Great action scene at the start with Lori Singer car surfing (watch the slightly impossible way she gets back in the car) -Also look for the great David Hasselhoff 2 second cameo -Great scene where the Rev turns off Lor Singer's ghetto-blaster.
Call me genuinely sappy, but Sidewalks of New York deserves a second viewing.

The second is fund by what appears to be a prostitute and this child is raised in a poor household.
FYI--The film's second billing went to Maggie Cheung--a relatively famous Asian actress who has made a variety of excellent films.
The second and third of this series are no fun stinkers.
While I don't believe the end result for a second, this film will do whatever it takes to make us believe the relationship between 44 year old Nora Baker and 27 year old Max Baron can work.
My second comment is that I didsn't really enjoy the script.
Wow, sad comments from a guy who owes his sobriety, and second career in the music business to that guy.
I do not understand why Asoka was placed second to Amir Khan's film.
Yet Kareena Kapoor is a revelation (after her second two films).
For a commerical bollywood film, its cinematography & art direction is the most exotic & decadent works in reccent times and it actually makes one believe that the setting was indeed the second century B.C.
He is especially good in the second half of the film as his character takes on some major changes and Shahrukh Khan does good justice to each transformation.
But thank goodness for the second half, the story really begins to catch attention, and the main performances really begin to appeal to the eyes.
I would say that it does in most cases, mainly thanks to its overall look and a strong second half film for its saviour.
Sad to say, Samuel L.Jackson, as cool as he WAS, is now a hack, collecting a paychecheque for any movie that pays him to utter any variation on a sentence that includes the word 'motherfucker,' and sneer every second line of dialogue in that now clichÃ©d semi-yell he trademarked in Pulp Fiction.I saw this movie for FREE and still regret the two hours of my life I will never get back.
I saw it again on TV tonight for the second time, and found it to be a howler from beginning to end.

Some funny set-pieces (such as Roz's bit involving a lipstick mistake) and a predictably sunny, smooth supporting performance by Gig Young as a dashing Romeo make it tolerable, but the script and characters are really second hand.
From what I had heard about the first film, I was better off skipping it and watching the second.
The second was that it really did have a very distinctly Dungeons and Dragons feel to it, rather than just any fantasy film.

But the material and the striking performances had some disquieting effect on me, even if it did feel like it was copping out and became your standard fare during the second half of the film.
Just as a side note, there is a second disc that accompanies the movie which has more background on the order along with a wonderful segment of the Night Office.
Like if somebody was going to spend a second thinking about this movie.
The second story is pretty much a big mess.

They all find themselves in a world where the Commies won the cold war (after a brief slide to a world where a second ice age took over and must find a way back.
BUCK PRIVATES was the second movie with Abbott and Costello.
While this was the Abbott & Costello's second feature, and only Abbott's second film (Costello had appeared in several films as a stuntman and background extra in the late '20s), you sure couldn't tell, as the pair handled themselves like veterans.
My uncle who later served in France during the second World War was one of those whose lives was interrupted by the peace time draft before the USA entered World War II.
But because of that the film doesn't drag for a second.
Abbott and Costello's second feature, "Buck Privates," opened in January 1941.
"Evil Under the Sun" is also enjoyable, since its strong second half more than compensates for the overlong exposition.
One thing that still puzzles me is how Jane Birkin got second billing?
"Evil Under the Sun" is also enjoyable, since its strong second half more than compensates for the overlong exposition.

Real Time, the second feature of writer/director Randall Cole (19 Months) made its Canadian debut at the Toronto International Film Festival after being the opening night feature at the Slamdance Festival earlier this year.
Not only is this ending so great, it will probably make a second viewing of this film an entirely different and even stronger experience.
This process has been around since the 1920s and has been exploited by oil starved nations such as Germany and Japan during the second world war, and by South Africa during Apartheid and after.
People are quick to mention "Bringing Up Baby" or "It Happened One Night", but both of these films run a distant second and third when compared to "The Awful Truth".
Lucy spends the second half trying to win Jerry back, after he falls for the same misunderstanding again when he happens upon Duvalle hiding in the other room in her apartment.
As is Cary Grant's date's obscene nightclub performance and his martial arts irruption into a society afternoon recital where his wife (Dunne) is singing an Italian aria that none of Grant's pratfalls can interrupt, except for one, memorable, epoch-making, anthology-ready second and a half towards the end that no other (singing) actress could have pulled off.
The movie moves along briskly and doesn't play up the point, but we catch, for a fraction of a second, Irene Dunne squirming as she finds herself looking like the business transaction in question.
Beethovens 2nd is a pretty good sequel, not as good as the first as far structure wise, but it comes pretty close for me.Its fun, entertaining, and somewhat funny.Also it actually follows up the first one in a good way.It was very new and fresh in a way, and some what believable, that really the first one and second one capture in a right way.It was good to see the return of the original cast members, and to add in some new characters like Regina( who was a cool villain).It was really funny at times, especially at some points from Bonnie Hunt( who's character I love).I didn't care much for the ending, and some points it was a little too out there and unbelievable, and the dogs annoyed me at some points, as did some characters.Well, overall if you liked the first one you'll like this, and in fact this is probably the last good one sequel in the series.
If I were to walk into a room where this movie was playing, I would kill those viewing it as an act of mercy, and then swiftly take my own life in order to avoid these travesty a second time.
I thought the film lovingly produced and enjoyed every second of it, my only disappointment being that I did not manage to catch the whole film.
I never for one second lost interest in this movie, there's always something going on, usually something funny.
The second good point about this movie is the acting.
There's always a security perimeter that the general public can never cross and it's usually quite large.The second main weakness of the movie is how its subject matter is treated.
We are never told why all this is happening; why people's allegiances have been changed; why a hero secret service man is "punishing himself" for what he did, (considering we only know he took a bullet for the President, we have to assume he did something after to make it appear that he might step out of the line of fire the second time); or why the orchestrator of it all is seemingly working on his own.
Don't forget to watch every single second of the movie and the credits, with beautiful still photographs on it.
A shy, intense and mysterious young man who loves photography ( The actor is Hiroshi Tamaki also known as Chiaki sempai from Nodame's fame ^^) The second character is a shy, rather mysterious girl, who lacks self confidence but is cute and amazingly pure of heart.
This single moment is the most notable in the film; an instance of offensive racism being the only second that promotes something other than abject boredom.
The women that I know would not respond to a "kidnapped at the last second before earth was destroyed" situation by doing it as much as they did.
A depressed Young-ju skipped classes, and her English teacher had to look for her before the second last day of class, prompting her to return to class.

I did wanted to see it because i saw the other tow, but sadly i should have known that it will not be better then the second part.
This movie is not as terrible as the third one, but not as good as the second, not to mention the first.
The second one was pretty much just an excuse to show as many boobs as possible.
The third one definitely exceeded both the second film and my expectations.
The first Species movie was awesome, the second was a big disappointment, the third was surprisingly decent, but this is even worse than the second...somehow.
The other strange device are these lasers that pop out of the ceiling the second that anyone dies and burn the corpse to dust (Leaving the clothing).
After seeing the second and third one, I thought I was convinced that they couldn't make another one that would match up to the original with Natasha Henstridge but I was wrong because this one came very close.
Things get good during the second half when John Liu, a great kicker also, and Hwang Jang Lee begin to fight.
Let's hope for a second life in the USA from good DVD sales.
In fact, I need to see this a second time because there are a ton of movie references in it I don't think I've caught yet.
But, she wakes up in a strange room and greeted by a quiet and subdued individual (Tcheky Kayro) he tells her that she's been given a second chance at life.
Will Nikita take this opportunity at a second life or will she throw it all away?

He passes away, and the family he left ignites in a battle against the family he was a part of for the second half of his life.
Goga acts well for his age but acted very confused in the second half.
There is a lot of intensity in the second half of the movie as characters turn to brutal ways and creating misunderstandings about others.
In my opinion, the second best Mike Hammer was Ralph Meeker in "Kiss Me Deadly".
As is often the case in these early Porky cartoons, Porky gets star billing but very much plays second fiddle to another character, in this case a camel named Humpty Bumpty!
The next raid Frost led was on an airfield in Tunisia, just like the second raid in the film.
The second viewing of this film really paid off.
Finally, Eileen Caddy, another of the founders (who is still there at  the time of writing) may well be everyone's second favourite  granny (behind HRH The Queen Mother), but she does not talk to  God or even to god.
The second shortcoming was by far my biggest grievance.
The second film is also quite good and in the third Shannon wasn't included.
Their prisoner is smarter than they are, but what sustains the over-long second half is that his sympathy for his kidnappers doesn't seem fake, just as his story doesn't seem contrived.
The follow up to all this is that Dunlap and Mike the Kid play a game of second guessing each other's identity and real intentions, and Dunlap winds up looking like a sap by the time it's all over.
), witty dialogues and a surprising ending made this movie pure fun watching every single second!
This is a wonderful, wonderful gem of a movie that won't bore you even for a second and will keep you thinking for days and days.
The mysterious owner, 'Blackie' (Robert Englund) gives them a second chance to correct all the blunders they have made in life and as a result of their success, lets them stay on as the new cook and waitress at the cafÃ©.
If you take a close look at the scene where Lucy climbs out the window the second time she's wearing pants pajamas but as she's walking across the store it shows her with a gown.
This is the first of the series I've played, except for a minimal portion of the second one.
Don't let this movie be your guide, The original Nightmare wipes the floor with this second rate follow up.
But wait a second.... Freddy is attempting this time to take over a young teenagers body and therefore become 'human' and no longer just a figment of perception, so far the idea is captivating to me.
This second installment stands on its own as a good movie but is not qualified as a sequel to the Nightmare series, in that many of the rules set by Craven in the 1st part have been broken in this one.
In the second film they attempt to use special effects and fail, in the third film they use special effects to their fullest extent and create a very good movie also scary in some scenes.
The second will be nothing more than a comedy to me.
The first Nightmare On Elm Street is one of my favorite horror movies.It had an original plot and was very entertaining.Now this is the first of the many sequels that followed it.Sure its not as good as the first and its the second worst one in the series(in my opinion).But its still an entertaining and good 1980's slasher flick.The cast is different from the first film and neither of the actors or actresses from this film return for any of the sequels.In this film, a family moves into the house that Nancy lived in during the first film.Freddy possesses the teenager who lives in the house and makes him do his killings for him.With the help of his girlfriend, he must stop Freddy.Though the sequels are known for their comedy, this film wasn't meant to be a comedy.Yet there are a few laugh out loud scenes in it.Nightmare On Elm Street 2 is an alright sequel that slasher film fans should enjoy.
Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2 (1985) was the second film in the Freddy Krueger series.
We don't know if we're seeing the first incident, the second, or the hundredth.
I guess the framing storyline qualifies as padding, on second thought, since it does fill out the allotted time, adds some exposition, and is absolutely inconsequential enough that it doesn't stick in my memory.
I even went out to get the second movie.
Richard Pryor(who also produced the movie) stars as an ex-con who is given a second chance to redeem himself.
Joe Braxton is a parolee who has been given a second chance to rebuild his life.
They all shine because of the writing, first and foremost, and because of the Dogma rules, second.
Sherilyn Fenn was great as the imperfect Billie, Dave and Jackie were also brilliant characters, and of course Trudy who was really the second star of the show.
Simon's character may have been changed from a plump prostitute to a petite laundress (this was the 1940s, after all), but the first half, based on the story that inspired Stagecoach, is still a remarkably effective adaptation that segues comfortably into the second story, linking them both by a battle of wills with the titular bored Prussian officer who wants the population to submit to his whims purely as a mark of obsequiousness.
Very quoteable "just a second a minute" or "we don't want the goat anyway".
Add to that some really unique characters and what you end up with is a movie that's always coming at you from the most unexpected angles, and not one second of it feels false or forced.
My main problem with "Manhattan Midnight" is that it tries too much (especially with that overbearing music score) to play like some sort of poetic tragedy, when its main character is a smug, unredeemable professional killer who doesn't mind killing innocent people (the "second" Maggie twin being an exception), and whom by the end you'll probably want to see dead as well.
While the plot of both movies is pure fantasy, the second movie adds more characters to the mythology of Halloweentown, and builds on the foundation of the first movie by reviving the villain in a new guise, and shows both the naive nature of the teenage Marnie - and of her vulnerable mother.
In the first one she seemed very one dimensional and didn't show a lot of emotion, in the second and third she has more character and showed better emotion.
It was a very good continuation of what I can understand, even though I've never seen the first one and this was my first time watching the second one.
I'll second all other comment-writers who point out the witty humor and Errol Flynn's still nimble swashbuckling at 38 in this very entertaining film, but I'd also like to point out another feature of Errol Flynn's performance (also applicable to many other of his films):  He is also good at delivering more serious lines in exchanges with the villains (in a very believable, underplayed manner) and, for that part, more sincere dialogue with the beautiful ladies.
The costumes are amazing, the sets splendid, the Technicolor never looked better -- but to top it all off, the swordplay, choreographed by the legendary maestro Fred Cavens (Adventures of Robin Hood, The Mark of Zorro) is second to none.
UPDATE 2/9/07 This film will soon be available on a new DVD in the second Errol Flynn collection box set, along with another good Flynn film, The Dawn Patrol.
The rest of the cast reads like a Who's Who of Hollywood during its second (and last) Golden Age: Nancy Kwan, Elke Sommer, Nigel Green, Tina Louise (of "Gilligan's Island" in her small role of Lola Medina), among others.
I was also open to a cast of second tier actors (James LeGros, Ron Perlman).
After a second fatal incident, he convinces Ed to travel with the team to a hospital for examination.
This would have been a solid albeit ambiguous ending; if you must watch further do it on a second viewing and consider it a deleted ending.
Ronald Colman in his second outing playing a dual role.
These were dark times and this film doesn't show the tragedy of the second world war or the Holocaust.
One thing I noticed in a second viewing is how much of the time the film shows people working.
There are moments in this film at which the viewer will just stare at the screen not knowing what to think, and scenes at which one is barely able to breathe in laughter, and every second of the film is very strange.
None of the assorted 'fine character' actors helped anything, all their words and actions are forced to the point of being painful, their lines were very poorly delivered and none of them were believable for even one second Â for which I blame director Richard Benjamin.
Nominally each of the two TV seasons has its own principal story arc; the first season features the way the world is, the second features someone who would very much like it different.
The second improves greatly upon the animation standards.
Both title tracks are sung by Origa, and by Jove, are those song 'hooks': even if you donlt care for anime or watching TV anyhow, these tracks glue you to the screen form the first second you hear them.
But in spite of a numerous the plot twists that are transparently inserted in the second half of the movie to move the viewers emotions along to a happy ending, the warm and clever performance by the female lead carries the day.
There are some fairly graphic sex scenes in the second half of the film that contribute to this realism as well that are shocking but not gratuitous.
Choregoraphy - especially with the police in the second act was first class.
But the second one, come on, my dad and I, movie lovers, almost lost our dinner watching it.
The second TOPPER film Â TOPPER TAKES A TRIP (1938) Â is curiously unavailable for appraisal (unless you happen to be one of those born-lucky U.S. residents who have the privilege of a TCM connection) but it seems to have followed the same route as its predecessorÂexcept for the non-reappearance of Cary Grant which, following the release of one of the peaks of the Screwball genre THE AWFUL TRUTH (1937), he had become a bona-fide film star in his own right and his services had evidently become too expensive for Hal Roach's limited pockets!
If not, the American release copy is a worthy second.
It's possible there now for someone to attend something like 50 or 60 shows for a month - one every evening and a number of breakfast or matinÃ©e performances - and never see the same one twice, with additional ones available if one wishes to begin a second month.
EKLAVYA is an intriguing period piece.It blends ancient settings with modern lifestyle.Giving the film a unique look.The film functions like a thriller,but focusing more on melodrama and characters,that aren't well written.And it's a well made drama that borderlines on melodrama.But the film has flaws,especially in the second half and by the time it ends,it feels incomplete.It's a relatively short film by Bollywood standards and I was more than surprised.Not only did it manage to tell an engrossing story but also wrapped it up with style with its short length.And the best thing is that it's devoid of songs,only one song throughout the film.But,I guess,because the story is wrapped around an epic setting,it needed a longer running time to develop the plot and characters more.Some of the characters were weak and not well written,some of their back stories are never told and leaves a lot to be desired.
First half or so into the movie,you are hooked and quite entertained,but after the interval,the film slowly drags,since the plot becomes weak and it's going in one direction; so there isn't much to tell.Subplots are added to compensate the running time.In other words,it could've trimmed a little more of the length and finished it quickly.That would've made the film perfect.But it gets boring as it drags the story and adds subplot and makes the whole of second half contrived.But the third act,which is the big revelation of who is behind the whole scenario,somewhat pays off with satisfaction.
Now this film promos shouted classic from the top of the roof but sadly the film comes only half   The film starts off well, Sharmila's death scene is well handled and the drama thickens The film keeps you involved but sadly we expected much more The pigeons part was not well integrated in the plot and also the second half gets predictable and we know the actual killer  Even the Saif-Vidya romance track and the climax is half baked  Direction by VVC is excellent in parts only Camera-work deserves 5/5  Amongst actors Bachchan proves yet again he is an institution His body lang, dialogue delivery, expressions all are flawless even if he is just standing behind some lead actors he makes a maximum impact One of his best works Saif too does a great job,showing his growth as an actor Sanju is full of fun in his role and is brilliant in serious scenes His look and role is similar to THANEDAAR but he does a great job Vidya is mechanical Boman Irani excels in his part, Jimmy too excels in a negative role while Jackie is perfect
His performance is the second memorable followed by Boman Irani as the king and Vidya Balan as Harshwardhan's lover Rajjo.
The second reason: the acting.
The second half in particular is slow paced.
His desire to do something out of the ordinary is evident all through the film, but he is particularly audacious when he chooses to blank out the screen completely for a full 90 second.
If you really don't have anything to do at home, don't watch this movie, go see Pirates of the Carribbean 2 for the second time.
It is genuinely scary, and it makes one have second thoughts when standing in front of a mirror.
I was somewhat let down by the second ending and I thought maybe it could've done without it.
The ham-fisted premise is taken off Richard Matheson's novel "I Am Legend", and was the second feature to be based upon it.
Although this is the second version of "I Am Legend", Based on a novel by Richard Matheson (Duel, A Stir of Echoes, What Dreams May Come).
The Omega Man is the second film version of Richard Matheson'snovel I am Legend, the first being a low budget Vincent Price vehicle.
this is the second filmed version of Richard Matheson's novel,I am Legend,the first being The Last Man on Earth,starring Vincent price,and the third bearing the same title as the novel and,starring Will Smith.i really enjoyed the first version,and pretty much hated the third version.this version is,much closer to the third version,in terms of my opinion of it.i found a lot of this movie lame,lacking in any real excitement.the acting was pretty poor(though Heston wasn't too bad).i also felt the movie was a bit too talky at times,and there is no real air of mystery to the story.having said that,there was one good thing about it.this one had a plot,(as slow as it was)which i felt the third one didn't.it was just this side of boring,for the most part,occasionally slipping over into the area of boredom.i was able to get through it.but i wouldn't care if i never saw it again.it just really didn't anything for me.my vote for The Omega Man is a 3/10
This was the second time around for I AM LEGEND; perhaps the third time will be the charm...
This was the second movie, after 1959's THE WORLD,THE FLESH, AND THE DEVIL, to successfully pull off the eerie effect of being the last living human being in a huge empty city.
The apocalyptic world that makes the first half so captivating is destroyed by the second half's plot device.
This is the second film ( Dead Men Walking) set in a prison by TheAsylum.
Michael Arias' use of computer graphics is second to none.
The second was the story, I don't want to spoil it for you let me just type you will not be disappointed.
But the second half was the pay off.
my second example is near the end when black meets the minotaur and learning that it is the darkness in himself, with a inner journey he learns that the minotaur wants to let black use all his "dark" powers in the meantime white is freaking out because slowly the darkness (yang) is winning.
I don't know if it would be good with a second movie.
THAT FORSYTE WOMAN is based on THE FORSYTE SAGA's first novel, THE MAN OF PROPERTY (with a bit of the second novel IN CHANCERY thrown in).
(I'm certain this is going to play better on a second viewing).
Rant over, I will still be going out to buy the DVD, and will enjoy every second that is on offer, superb!!
Sharpe's challenge has his flaws (begin of second part the story goes a little flat) but the last half hour makes up for this and is as great as it should be.
This second theme resonates with a fear of old replacing new, yet the new not being perhaps as grand as everyone believes it to be, it is a fear of traditions being eradicated by a machine which has no need for sentiment, and this feeling, from both points of view, is embedded within characters on all sides of the battle.
For those of you who have read the books, here is the basic plot - I am doing my best to remain vague so as not to spoil the story: the plot opens with almost a word for word copy of the opening of Sharpe's Triumph (the second Sharpe book set in India).
Watching it a second time, readers will realise that while most of the action in India is true to the book, it picks events almost at random from Sharpe's Tiger, Sharpe's Triumph and Sharpe's Fortress (the three books set in India), while simultaneously moving them from the period of 1799-1803 to 1817.
First, the massive plot holes, especially towards the ending, and second, the fact that they gave up on the mystery of the room by the final third of the film.
I really liked it, but I only saw the first & second nights.
I have seen two of the three episodes and I have to tell you that this miniseries has me watching every second in awe and wonder.
If you missed it the first time; don't pass it by a second.
But Dreamer (or Sonador as the horse is named) takes a slightly different angle in this tale about second chances and comebacks.
That would make President George W Bush the second in command of AMERICA.
KNOLL EAGLE comes from the 1963 alleged JFK assassination and the grassy knoll where there had to be a second shooter based on the number of shots fired and their accuracy that could not be duplicated.
But the cast in general plays second fiddle to the cars and explosions.
Bronson fans (like me) will note this is the second of his 'samurai connection'westerns...Magnificent Seven being the first...though the debate will probably never be resolved as to which was the better performance.
In the second and most compelling 'chapter' of the movie, Harry (now played by the utterly talented Josse De Pauw) grew out a fairly intelligent adolescent, yet he still hasn't experienced physical love due to a severe (better make that EXTREMELY severe) case of acne.
The third and final chapter sees the once bright young boy as a drunken waster who cuts a stark contrast to the boy we saw in both the first and second chapters of the film.
The second segment focuses more on the idea of teenage alienation and sees the film take a darker turn as the sensitive young man is rejected by all the girls because of his deforming acne.
In the second part of the movie, we are in the 1960's.
But that 'problem' was easily overcome by the second and the third part.
When you see in the second part how he suffers from his acne, you can only feel very sorry for him.
The same about the third part, although this story is something completely different from the second.
In the second act, in the early sixties, Harry is a shy 19-year old, his face horribly disfigured by a grotesque form of acne.
I found the second and third acts the strongest, but all three segments show remarkable cinematic harmony.
It all a very American feel to it, especially the second act.
The lead performance by Josse de Pauw who plays the adult Harry in the second and third acts, is a joy to watch.
Supposedly in order for there to be perfection, all the imperfections of the world must be shed of like a second skin and dissipate into nothingness.
It looks as though he's going to break his guitar, burst into tears, have a stroke, or all of the above at any second.
And I didn't regret it for a second.
Maybe it's just me, but I really did enjoy the every single second of the film, just wondering how people find this one "boring" or "pointless".
The question is what is "Izo"?, there are many answers to the question, my personal opinion is that, Izo is the Japanese part of the second world war, and japan in war situation trough the history, and the cruelty of the human nature, he is the dark side of every person.
The whole thing start to make sense if we relate it to the second world war.
I found the movie a bit confounding at first... but it definitely makes more sense after a second and third viewing.
A second viewing is what I must give it eventually.
Here is the premise of this show - Boy loves girl, girl rejects boy so boy gets involved with another girl that he doesn't really like (the only bit of originality in any of these series is why the boy gets involved with the second girl).
This is my second experience with a Corean television drama and I came into it with a lot of skepticism after being disappointed by my previous attempt with Winter Sonata.
And in spite of my stern admonishment above I don't believe that the feds have come clean on the incident, mostly because whatever may or may not have happened was "covered up" so quickly that there isn't a paper trail that can prove OR disprove the wildest of allegations -- That a flying saucer crashed, a rancher found bits of the junk, that a second crash site was found complete with alien life forms who may not have been quite dead.
The second crash site is important because, like all good conspiracy theories, it answers one of the basic problems with it's core premise, in this case the legendary "debris field" reports: Where were the working parts?
The basic story is about a drugged up vicious street punk serving a life sentence for killing a cop.She is given a second chance at freedom of sorts, by a top secret French assassination agency.The movie shows her transformation into something better then she was and the affect it has on the two men in her life that mean something to her.
The big thing about this movie is to get to know about what happened in that time, because no one spoke about this when we were talking about the second world war in history class.
Here in his first movie the flow is at the forefront, in later movies it achieves a balance with the plot, finally taking second place in his later works.
This is a film that one can watch for a second time and value the story line.
It depicts a rare insight into the exclusivity of sibling relationships and utilises a neutral tone that ironically intensifies every second of the story.
Perhaps it is due to her lack of dialogue that I find the first half of the picture far superior to the second half.
Sergio Corbucci is not considered only second to Leone in the spaghetti western realm for no reason.
The professor also leads a rival rag-tag army of students who are fighting both the Mexican Army as well as Mongo's men with Lola (Iris Berben) as the professor's second in command.
The second scene for me is the scene where Lulu murders her husband (Bellamy) in cold blood.
Jean Delannoy stands as one of the best (if not simply the best)Simenon adapters.In the short space of two years he made two gems ,while the nouvelle vague was insulting him ,and these two gems should not be missed:"Maigret tend un piÃ¨ge" and "Maigret et l'affaire Saint-Fiacre" (1959),both absorbing,both featuring a top-notch cast,both packing a real wallop.The first one is an urban psychological thriller,the second one takes place in the country,in the castle of old aristocrats.
Jean Gabin would go on to appear as Inspector Maigret in 2 subsequent films - MAIGRET ET L' AFFAIRE SAINT-FIACRE (1959; which I've caught up with a couple of years ago) and MAIGRET VOIS ROUGE (1963) - and work a further 5 times with director Delannoy (including the afore-mentioned second Maigret film); interestingly enough, Delannoy himself would abandon his own artistic aspirations shown earlier in two major French films of the 1940s - L'ETERNEL RETOUR (1943) and LA SYMPHONIE PASTORALE (1946) - to concentrate on modest genre offerings (of which MAIGRET SETS A TRAP is the best-known and probably best overall as well) for the rest of his career.
The second order of control is the social network the screw-up belongs to -- the friends, the peers, the community.
And that's what finally does Emily/Audrey/Mabel/Ginger/Xanthippe in -- the second level of social control, community gossip.
For example take the comic second scene of the film where Bill Cody has to wait for a letter, while the postman delivers the mail according to rank.
The second part begins when he moves to the East, loses his son, separates from his wife, defends the Indians in the civilized society until his retirement.
The second part is when Buffalo Bill goes east, and that is when the film is at its best.
Then if we come to the second conclusion that he never repented, we are then facing a more intimidating mentality.
As I watched this film a second time, I saw the real reason that LaBute created this picture.
The first climax makes the movie a success, the second makes the film great--only then do we see Labute's true intent.
It is when the second movie starts, all with different faceless-actors in a dark room doing stuff.
What starts out as a well-acted exploration of family tensions - especially those between a relatively uneducated set of middle-class parents and their college-educated son - gives way to the clumsy, overwrought melodramatics of the second half of the film.
The number of frames used per second and the backgrounds for the animations in their new non-MGM toons were strictly bargain basement.
Both of them hot, especially the second one.
Both of them too short, especially the second one.
I wont lie to you Disney, in the past has done some terrible second takes on films, ruining the reputation of the original.
I love Disney animation (I also enjoy drawing drawing it to), but usually second takes to the films animation is terrible.
All in all this was a one of a kind in Disney second movie films!
But its the second half, when "The Graf Spee" hides in a neutral port where it kicks into high gear.
Actually, this is Jones's second collaboration with, and the second feature film of director Brendan Foley, following his equally disastrous debut The Riddle, where Jones was also the lead.
I've recently seen Mills Watson in a couple of episodes of the Six Million Dollar Man in bad guy roles and as a sheriff in the second Incredible Hulk TV movie as kind of a pre Perkins role.
And the move to Atlanta in the second season was a mistake.
This is a conceptually intriguing project: 40 film directors from around the world each make a 50-some second film with a restored LumiÃ¨re CinÃ©matographe.
The repeated questions about why the directors make cinema and whether it's "mortal" receive predictably lame responses, but the glimpses of them at work, punctuated with their 50 second films, is mesmerizing.
This project with its 40-odd 50 second vignettes done by a mix of directors of varying talents and celebrity, using an antiquated camera, gives an opportunity to see snapshots of their work as pure art.
David Lynch's segment is a close second.
Branded was Ladd's second starring western after Whispering Smith and he proved to be equally well received here.
First, on its own merit; second, on its lasting appeal and impact.
Though second billed, she enters the story late, and leaves abruptly.
The second 1930's example is our today's "selection for dissection"; THE PUBLIC ENEMY (Warner Brothers & The Vitaphone Corporation, 1931) gave us a dramatization of the affects of "the Noble Experiment", National Prohibition on the working class.
Speaking of billing and stardom, Jean Harlow gets second billing in this film but really has only a bit part; Blondell gets fourth billing has only a few lines.
Cagney made violence and a life of crime magically seductive, and "Public Enemy" made him Warners' number 2 gangster, second only to Edward G. RobinsonÂ
The second surprise was that Kerri Russell was in it (huh?).
The second scene is when she goes to see her mother, the only friend she's got.
Reading the opening credits the second time I saw it, I noticed it was based on a book, which is quite understandable.
The second time I watched this, I seriously had doubts to why Forbin was acting the way he did at the end.
The second demon stirs the pot and then the lead demon (played by the director himself) summons each of the three individual spirits.
I have now for the last two months or saw seen all of the films that are related to this series and this ends up as the second best.
Sometimes characterized as a scene-for-scene remake, those critics should open their eyes a little wider because the end was completely different from the original, as was the beginning -- also taking the second paragraph's points into consideration as well.
In the second plot, various high-ranking officers are conspiring to overthrow Hitler and bring the war to an end.
But wait a second... What was the fuss all about?
Still, I was not prepared for "The Baron of Arizona," his second film and one that seems to have provoked little critical interest over the years, to be such a disarmingly lucid and entertaining effort.
Only slightly less impressive than Fuller's debut is this, his second film, with an excellent and slightly restrained Vincent Price as the eponymous title character, another true-life minor figure in the history of the Old West: James Addison Reavis, who in the 1880s concocted a grand schemed to defraud the United States of a large chunk of the then-territory of Arizona through forged documents showing a Spanish land grant handed down for a century and a half to the woman he was to make his bride.
Still The Baron Of Arizona is a fine second film by director Samuel Fuller topped with an impressive performance by Vincent Price before he settled into the horror film genre.
All screen villains should watch this, every second of his performance is filled with a gamut of emotions, and mundane details.
It's also my first for the Monogram entries, of which this one is the second.
Also along for the ride, for only the second time, is cab driver Birmingham Brown (Mantan Moreland)...The noticeable changes from Fox to Monogram, besides more comic relief with both Fong and Moreland, is some more time for the music score to go along with some more action sequences near the end before we hear Charlie's assessment of the case.
But I enjoyed "Dinosaur" the second time around.
Seeing it for the second time, I appreciated and liked it more, so, once again: you've got to take it for what it is to really enjoy it.
I have been a huge Bogart fan for close to 25 years and this movie defined him right at the start of his second, more mature venture into films.
He is quite convincing, obviously modelled on Dillinger--sitting, glowering, pointing w/ his gun and ruling the second half of the movie as he does the BBQ w/ ease.
The second aspect is Mrs. Henderson's feminist counseling of Gaby.
Delving deeper, it's the conflicting world views expressed by Allan and wistful dreamer Gabby that deliver the film's resonance, even as the immediate life or death threat of Mantee's muscle overtakes the film's second half.
An outstanding, maybe even great film derived from a basically second rate work.
The movie is made with an obvious low budget, with only four actors (five, if you count the Peter character in), and most of the action takes place within the confinement of the second couple's house in the period of one and the same evening, so it's more or less like you're witnessing a theatre play.
There is a second story in this movie mixed in with the main story.
The second series, however, left something to be desired in my opinion.
The writing seemed uneven and flat, and where the first series made you care about the characters, the second leaves you feeling rather unsympathetic.
However, even the second series is worth watching, and there are definitely some good moments to remember.
Also, the scene of the confrontation against the gang members is a redundant second climax.
Let me say that Ben gazarra is a great actor, and a lot of the scenes appear to be improvised, but all throughout the second half, Cosmo appears to be in no pain whatsoever, running swiftly, smiling, and talking calmly without a single sign of pain.
All it really achieved was to destroy the plausibility of every single scene after the gun shot wound, so due to the fact that everything in the entire second half of this movie never could have happened, It is impossible to give it more than 2 stars, an extra star for Ben Gazarras performance.
Yet, it's very difficult not to be compelled by the story, especially as embodied in the character of Cosmo Vitelli, who Ben Gazzara seems to channel effortlessly, as if he were a second, transparent skin.
At the end of the picture he says how important it is to "feel comfortable" with oneself and while we don't believe for a second that Cosmo really feels this way, we know he *wants* to.
Tell Me Something is slick, fast, and entirely unpredictable up to the last second.
the things that were definite drawbacks and did Not make sense were more mundane; the cops have a very laissez-faire attitude towards their guns(and even More annoying,each time it's an obvious Portent Of Doom :P ),those dippy cops also missed a handful of important and somewhat obvious clues at first glance(even second and third glance).
Exhibit A: cop finds out his pretty but sulky witness has attempted suicide several times, turns around and leaves her alone in his flat with his one and only gun, then goes after a serial killer without any weapon, gets mauled in the process, survives the ordeal, chases the killer a second time, this time still without any weapon... And just when you think it can't get any dumber than this, well, that's exhibit A, and as Picard puts it, "Plenty of letters left in in the alphabet"  A thinking person's movie?
"Tell Me Something" starts of as a serial killer thriller clearly influenced by "Seven", but it becomes much more Giallo-like in the second half to become some valid social comment with its downbeat climax.
The second murder is truly unexpected and shocking however and despite the changes I was happily engrossed throughout.
I was disappointed the writers felt the need to have that second murder, with excessive gore to a sympathetic character.
I would say Girls Will Be Girls is the worst of all time, I can't even talk about that show without wanting to destroy something, Pop Cultured is second worst and then who knows, Punched Up, Keys to the VIP, Shakespeare Comedy, there are a lot of bad ones to choose from.
Their second guest?
So much so that many years later I named my second son REX!!!!
Benders storyline was too condensed for a one hour show; a possible second part could have been warranted.
Spoiler alert Compared to the original Mimic movie the second part is not a mimic of part one.
And as explicit as it is, it never crosses the line between good taste and sleaze for a second.
Every second of it looks like a very polished, big budget film.
Best of all, while Emmanuelle 1 seems horribly dated today, thanks mostly to the 1970's philosophizing of the Mario character, along with the tacky theme song, the second one has dated beautifully, thanks to the truly elegant and timeless fashion choices for Kristel and the rest of the cast, and also to the gorgeous soundtrack by celebrated composer Francis Lai.
Maybe I need to watch this episode a second time, or wait to see if season 3 will make sense out to the season 2's story climax.
All in all a job well done, but one that desperately needs its second half to feel entirely correct.
The viewers who are enthralled by this love story in the first half are astonished to see the twist of the second half.
I watched and the first half was pointless but at least the second half was a little better with the Twists.
The second half of the movie is supposedly taken from one of the best novels of all time _ the eye of the needle..Bolloywood has a great talent.. they can take the best and turn it into a piece of crap in minutes..
Tabu delivered a very fine performance, second only to Kajol.
It for one second you can't say that she is not acting as blind.
When you think you know whats happening but the second next you don't.
AS for the movie well the first half was Normal AND Believable but the second half got a bit abnormal for me.
well for the second half I GUESS they put too much effort on the second half.
I found the first half extremely entertaining and the second half was a pleasure to watch just for the sheer pleasure of watching two very high class actors perform as they never have.
I personally felt the second half of the film needed no songs, but that is my own quibble.
A drug-addict murderous teen is given a second chance by a government agency looking to exploit her penchant for conscience-less killing.
Owen Wister (1860-1938) was a classmate and close friend of Theodore Roosevelt and when the book came out in 1902 it was dedicated to the new president who was in his second term of office.
She almost overshadows the second and third lead in the film- Konkona Sen and Kunal Kamar.
Multiple Maniacs (1970) was Waters' second feature length film.
This makes the second half of the movie a bit uneasy to watch.
WOW  Nikhil Advani, Karan Johar and the amazing cast of this movie have come together to make only the second flawless Bollywood movie of this generation.
The first half is laced with witty humour and the second half is tinged with sadness .
One second SRK and Preity love each other, and the next she's still getting married...Why are we not shown the process that goes in between.
The portion of "6 din, ladki in" in the second half was a bit of a drag, however.
Now I'm not Mormon so I don't think I'm knowledgeable enough about the BoM to make a good argument either way, but I've got to believe that there is/was an entire other side to this argument that wasn't given a second of airtime.
The second series was filmed in Cornwall, UK where there is also a village called Hersham consisting of six houses while the main Hersham has population of some 18,000 people.
The second series was a bit hard to stomach at first but was still brilliant.
The second season even surpasses the first in extremity, if not in humour.
It is easier to watch a second or third time if you give it the chance, then you seem to be able to concentrate on the savage humour without feeling too much pity for the put upon characters involved.
The same people who will not attempt to think about (I don't mean "like," I just mean "think about") the second two movies in "The Matrix" trilogy are going to hate this film, because it is truly a science fiction film and not an action movie or a "sci fi" movie.
Low points: --- [1] The flaming Q-Tip in the mouth treatment for the Reptilicus clone in the lake is pretty badly done (Reptilicus gets tired of it the second time, too.)
She picks up the second phone and pushes "Listen."
This is his second film with Dasgupta.
Hitchcok received the second nomination in his career for Best Director at the Academy Awards for 1944.
When David O. Selznick got some loan out money from Darryl Zanuck for Alfred Hitchcock's services for two films (the second was never made), I'm sure Zanuck must have just loved Hitchcock when he told him that he wanted to make a film with just one set.
It was the second of four Martin made with director Carl Reiner.
This is the second great collaboration he did with the writer/director Carl Reiner, and while the man with two brains may be more laugh out loud funny, there have been few films more clever inventive and downright audacious in their attempt to recreate a bygone era by basically, well, stealing it!
The second bonus feature has Bo Diddley, Little Richard and Chuck sitting around a piano discussing the early days of rock and roll.
Robertson also mis-reads Chuck (I thought it was pretty funny), when he calls Chuck's second prison term, "running into a brick wall".
The scene where he goes with her to get diplomatic immunity was unrealistic, due to the fact that the boy (I refuse to say his name) is not American, and would be turfed out in a second, while the American girl gets immunity.
The film is chock full of character with names like "Marc's Trick," "Hot Shirtless Guy" and "Hot Clothed Guy" - I'd rather receive a hot glue enema than sit through this a second time, but this film does raise so many questions: Why do people see movies like this when there are so many quality films out right now?
By the second scene Brett was in, I was hooked.
I watched The Insider last night on video for the second time.
The second issue which had supposedly "independent" viewers up in arms was the aura of suspicion, manufactured or otherwise, that surrounded Jeffrey Wigand.
This second issue is at the core of my argument in defense of this film.
His ability to keep the atmosphere of the film going through image and music is second to none.
The focus of the second half shifts to Bergman's desperate attempts to get Wigand's interview broadcast after everything he has risked to blow the whistle.
Sure it was long, but The Insider kept your attention for every second of the film.
It is so intelligent about revealing the most important information little at a time, always at the perfect second.
The film makes many unexpected turns; in the second half, it smartly switches focus from Wigand to Bergman.
This 155 minute film is slow paced but gripping for ever second it is on the screen.
But unlike a lot of young actors who do this, he gives the impression of absorbing everything around him, being exposed to new things every second.
I'm not really the kind of person that goes on about television shows, but the second I saw this show I was hooked!
It's truly a shame that this show never made it into a second season.
The second time, I couldn't stop crying.
On second thought let's forget about this movie and speak of it no more.
I've got only good things to say about this second directorial effort of Mr Banderas; lush cinematography, good music, nice pacing, and an ensemble cast whose performances shine like gold.
Now that audiences are more familiar with Snoop Dogg as an actor I think this movie should be given a second chance.
Some may find him irresistibly attractive, but frankly I wouldn't have given him a second glance no matter how much he masked what a creep he is Â perfect abs and all.
It's not his promiscuity that bothers us, but the way he treats his conquests, refusing to ever have a second date, and finding the most ridiculous faults imaginable in each potential suitor.
Of the four short films featured here, the best acting was in the second film entitled "O Beautiful" by Alan Brown, with David Clayton Rogers and Jay Gillespie actors.
"O Beautiful," the second segment, was by far and away the most touching.
The second story is called "O Beautiful" and tells the story of a young gay man who is attacked and sexually molested by a group of homophobic men in a New Jersey cornfield, and is then rescued by one of his attackers who returns after everyone else leaves.
I wish you guys would make this show into a series, I would watch every second of it.  
Sunday, February 9th, marked the second episode of year one and in the most timely fashion, Yancey Arias (Miguel of "Kingpin" fame) makes a brief appearance as a gay car thief (Arnaz).
There are only six episodes, each an hour long, but it took me only 'til about the second before I was hooked.
But, you've got to see it at least twice...once to let your head adjust to the oddness of the story and then a second time to really experience the multiple levels of terror present in this film, both real and imagined, the most palpable being that lying buried in the human soul.
Lynch's second film is a 4-minute mind-boggling trip into the subconscious.
We fall into that second group seeing our first DeMille film circa 1957 THE TEN COMMANDMENTS (1956).
REAP THE WILD WIND (1942) was his second color film and we saw it in a re-release circa 1958.
"The Untouchables" is in my opinion De Palma's greatest work, with his other masterpiece, namely "Scarface", coming a very close second.
This was her second film for DeMille [the first being NORTHWEST MOUNTED POLICE] but not her last [ahead she was to play opposite Gary Cooper in UNCONQUERED].
One is a young girl trying to grow up, the second is an Urkel-type boy who loves to cause trouble and the third is a very young female who likes to eat.
One is a young girl trying to grow up, the second is an Urkel-type boy who loves to cause trouble and the third is a very young female who likes to eat.
One is a young girl trying to grow up, the second is an Urkel-type boy who loves to cause trouble and the third is a very young female who likes to eat.
First, Raft's younger brother is played by 21 year old William Holden in his second film.
This was Bill Holden's second film and his joint contract holders of Paramount and Columbia lent him out here.
The series actually got its start as an episode of another popular TV series of the time, "Trackdown", during the second half of the '57-'58 TV season.
In the second part, the level of discourse goes all the way from reciting the commonplace, to being juvenile and just plain silly!
In the second half, Catherine Deneuve, Irene Papas and Stefania Sandrelly excel in a small talk, and so does John Malkovitch; they wouldn't stop for ages.
The second part of the film consists mainly of a dinner conversation between the ship's captain John Walesa (John Malkovich), an American of Polish background and three celebrity passengers: Delphine, a French businesswoman (Catherine Deneuve), Francesca, a former Italian model (Stefania Sandrelli) and Helena, a Greek singer (Irene Papas).
So bad is this movie, they couldn't afford a second take.
The second half with the blind girl is so incredibly soapy as to be laughable.
When watching it the second time the shift does not take you off guard and you can just appreciate the film.
East LA is, upon second look, a timely take on the overreactive Reagan-era round-'em-up, ask-no-questions immigration policy, in which many legal residents and citizens were actually deported.
I had seen it before, but the second time around made the picture better.
A family that is constantly hoping and waiting for the father to publish a second great novel, the novel that will finally bring decent food on the table and acceptable clothes on their back.
The film happens to be the second teaming of popular Italian brawling duo Terence Hill and Bud Spencer (the first â GOD FORGIVESâ¦I DONâT [1967] â was actually a prequel to this!)
Actually, "Ace High" is the second entry in the only cinematic trilogy that Hill and Spencer starred in.
The first half of this film is pretty standard, but the second half involving Drake is where the film really distinguishes itself, imo.
Btw, this is their second appearance together, the first being GOD FORGIVES, I DON'T from the year before.
Since the billionaire is angry with these two consultants, he drills through the first's chest and electrocutes the second into a Blood Doll.
"Mr. Mascaro"'s appearance and his explanation why there is a second ending added a little touch of a "Tales from the Crypt" atmosphere, and it helped Blooddolls to gain a few bonus points.
The second thing this movie has is Mr. Mascaro.
Released at the same time as the mainstream-smash "Lost Boys," it finished decidedly second at the box office -- a shame, since Jenny's performance as vampire ingenue Mae was nothing short of brilliant.
Virginia searches for Brand's second novel, "I, Madman," after finishing the first, which involved a demonic creature who takes its revenge on its creator.
In the second story, the madman of the title has razored off his own facial features in order to please the woman he loves.
I remember this as the second of a two part feature on a Saturday afternoon in the early 60s.
The main action is interspersed with some beautiful animation of the puppy just being a puppy, switching from happy to confused to angry in a split second as he goes about his playful antics.
This is a movie with Fat Cop syndrome (two of them, actually, with one in drag for a while, I kid you not), a pink shirted sex pervert who has girlie magazine centerfolds pinned to the walls of his living room (presumably to comfort audience members who may be afraid he is gay), a second murdering loon who shouts "COME HERE LITTLE GIRL" so loudly and so often that we had to turn it down lest the neighbors think we were enjoying it (turns out he's her father, how charming), and for about fifteen minutes the movie tries to develop tension by having a repeating high pitched ticking sound clatter on and on and ON to the point where you start looking around the room wondering what the heck that noise is, and how do I stop it.
The second ends with the conclusion to the ball scene.
There were only two items I wish they would have included, I would have liked to seen him talk about his tax problems, and second, I wish he would have played a number with band he is in.
A young and up-and-coming Tyrone Power is second billed in the film and his part seems more intended for box-office appeal than anything else.
The second major liability is its star: Norma Shearer.
Â It was the second film she made with director William Wyler and the best of the three.
Â She also won her second Academy Award for the role.
The second half turns a little darker, but then, as they say, it's always darkest just before it turns completely black.
In fact, Fersen was at Versailles on and off throughout Louis XVI's reign; it was rumored that he fathered the queen's second son, born in 1785 exactly 9 months after one of Fersen's visits.
The second major flaw in the film's historicity is that Shearer would not play Marie Antoinette as a featherbrained, shop-til-you-drop type, which would be nearer the truth than the noble character Shearer gives us.
DEATH WISH tells the story of Paul Kersey (a fine performance from the late Charles Bronson), a happily-married architect returning from a second honeymoon with his wife to the scum-encrusted toilet that was New York City circa 1974.
Suitably impressed, the redneck presents Kersey with the parting gift of a handgun, which comes in useful during the second half of the film, during which the vengeance-crazed architect sets himself up as an easy target for muggers, only to wipe them out the moment things get nasty.
Bette Davis is positively magnificent in this film, and it won her a well-deserved second Oscar as Best Actress.
The greatest scene in the movie has got to be the humiliating Olympus Ball sequence, with Davis beginning to have second thoughts when she is ostracized by hundreds of aghast eyes, leering at her and Fonda as they waltz around an abandoned dance floor while she wears that controversial dress.
She begs her fiancÃ© to take her out of there, but he makes her endure every second of what she so defiantly wanted.
At present(2009) while the remake version is being filmed I have to say that; no matter who will perform Paul Kersey for the second time, he won't be able to impress us as Bronson did.
After Kaadhal this is second time in which barath has proved that he has all the required potentialities to become a genius actor one day.
She soon loses him for what appears to be the second time when she wears a red dress to a ball where all the women are in white.
Her first (problematic) husband disappears during the war; she gets a rich and handsome second husband who's only shortcoming seems to be that he's not truly attentive to her sons from her first marriage.
William Wyler directs this first rate costume drama and Ms. Bette Davis picks up her second Academy Award playing an Antebellum Dixie vixen that goes a little too far to make her fiance(Henry Fonda)jealous.
Director William A. Levey, working from a shamelessly trashy, albeit too talky script by Frank R. Saletri, manages to produce a reasonable amount of brooding gloom-doom atmosphere (the Gothic castle main location is an eerie beaut) and totally cuts loose with oodles of tacky excessive gore in the second half with Eddie killing various hapless folks.
It's the kind of movie that was intended to play on the second bill of a drive-in feature, or draw people into a sleazy theater based on the title alone.
Bette Davis dominates the whole movie with a mesmerizing performance,which earned her a second Oscar.
Most of the artists are not well known, but deserve a second listen.
Then he goes and does the same things over again, and we are left to believe it happens the same way the second time.
I've just watched it for the second time and it just gets better!
She won her second Oscar for Best Actress in this film and as her aunt who occasionally gives her a reality check every now and then Fay Bainter was named Best Supporting Actress of 1938.
Godzilla 2000 Millennium is probably the second greatest movie in the entire series, exceeded only by the original "Gojira."
***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** The first Godzilla movie in the third movie series, whereas GODZILLA VS. DESTOROYAH, the previous entry, aptly ended the second series.
In fact, it quickly bombed at the box office in Japan (starting out at 4th place, and sinking to 8th in the second week!).
However, the main problem is that things were not spelled out for the viewer (mostly because production was rushed in the second half).
This is his second FX direction job (his first was MOTHRA 3).
Despite having the less showy parts, Henry Fonda, George Brent, and Margaret Lindsay (always the second woman in a Warner Bros. drama) have strong screen presences, but most of all the star of this movie is William Wyler, who could always be counted on having Davis give exactly what she was required to do and not sabotage a movie due to her operatic demands and bombastic overacting.
This is my second favorite Godzilla film.
Clearly, it didn't matter, because Bette Davis went out and gave one of the best performances of her career and won her second Oscar for best actress.
This movie is probably the second goriest movie in the series behind the original candyman.
I liked the first one.the second was poor and not helped by the narration by a DJ.This is far worse with a very low budget,a terrible script.and for a horror film minus scares chills and thrills.The acting is bad and the movie is just rubbish.1 out of 10
Donna D'Errico of Baywatch fame stars in this second sequel to the 1992 modern horror classic ÂCandyman' as Caroline, daughter of Annie Tarrant from the previous instalment.
The second movie was mediocre at best in my opinion but this one was just horrendous.
while i actually liked the first two Candyman movies,i didn't' like this third and(so far Final)installment.i found it boring and repetitive and i didn't like the story very much.there's a lot of filler here,which suggests to me that the filmmakers didn't have enough of a story for a complete movie.i also wasn't too impressed with the acting.there was a lot of overwrought theatrics.as well,there were some things in this movie that did not fit with the previous movies,basically throwing out certain aspects of the lore.maybe i'm just imagining things,but this is my opinion on things.finally,this movie has none of the style of the second movie.adding it all up,this third installment in the series is much lower in quality on all counts.my vote for Candyman 3:Day of the dead is a 3/10
This is not meant to suggest that professional actors should work for peanuts...suffice it to say that, while "Saving Star Wars" (http://www.savingstarwars.com ) is clearly (and correctly, I believe) critical of the parts of the second trilogy that were then (2003) known, it is a lovingly critical work.
The second act of the film deals with Enid falling in love with Seymore, brilliantly played by Steve Buscemi.
She was the second, and now Holmes has been brought out of his bored lethargy.
This is the second film from writer/director/actor Tim Blake Nelson to disappear into film limbo.
And in this the film succeeds above many other films, and is worthy of praise far surpassing the melodramatic tripe that Hollywood usually tries to feed us in regards to the second world war.
By any reckoning Crime Wave is a minor film -- even a minor second feature -- but De Toth lavishes easy expertise on it; it's surprisingly well paced, well shot, as well interestingly cut.
I have loved this film since I was a little kid, I would'nt change anything about the story: Steve Rogers applies to be the guinea pig in a US experiment to make super soldiers to help win the second world war.
The other thing that I love about the movie is that there is not one second of wasted film, every scene has definite purpose and it holds your attention every minute.
It's difficult enough to write comments for films around fifty years old but when were talking 'silent' there's another dimension of difficulty inasmuch as one is moving into a world of title cards and 26 frames per second.
Then we move into a second extraneous, but still amusing, story regarding a battle between the North and the South that could've been excised and still having a decent, though simple, story.
The situation of fighting the Yankees during the second chase, and finding Marion Mack there "helping" him, are wonderful - especially when she judges which lumps of coal are pretty enough to be used to keep the engine fired (she throws away the ugly little ones).
The classic conclusion of the comedy is the battle of the two sides at the river, and the burning of the railroad bridge (with it's destruction of a second locomotive).
We move to the second chase, where Johnnie has The General and the Unionists are the ones pursuing him.
"Bleeder" following "Pusher" is the second part of a trilogy.
Unfortunately their second track was Bad a song I've never taken to and Bono spent so much time jumping into the audience to get a girl to dance with him that they had to scrap their third track Pride .
As you might guess from that synopsis, there are more than a few similarities to The Egyptian, not least Edmund Purdom selling his birthright for a second time for bit of nookie with a pagan temptress (he'd do anything for a bit of skirt, that Purdom: did he learn nothing from his experience with Bella Darvi?
It also includes appearances by John Durren as Deputy Abel Gance, Peggy Stewart as Bobbie Jo and Pearl's alcoholic mother Hattie, Gerrit Graham as commune leader Magic Ray, James Gammon as a leather salesman, Gene Drew as redneck Sheriff Hicks, Virgil Frye as Joe Grant, who makes the mistake of challenging Lyle on his quick-draw abilities, and future director Chuck Russell (also second assistant director here) as an unnamed deputy.
Then you are on the edge of your seat as the romance goes off the rails--with unpredictable twists--in the second half.
Damn right it was, this is Nicholas Winding RefnÂ´s second feature, and after his masterful debut: Pusher I really had my hopes up.
Most films that have somebody killed in the beginning have the next scene take place somewhere else or on the next day, the scene after it takes place the second after it!
Cheetah finds the wailing bundle of joy and whisks him off to Tarzan and Jane, who decide to adopt the lad, naming him Boy (Tarzan's second choice, after having Elephant rejected by Jane).
The second problem with the film is the long sequences where Tarzan and Boy frolic.
She was taking dictation from Gregory La Cava, who was preparing to cast "The Age of Consent", when, giving her a second look, he organised a screen test.
I just saw the movie for the second time yesterday and I liked it even more than I did the first time.
Gary Bakewell is really trading in on his resemblance to Paul McCartney being as this is the second time that he has played the man.
Phantom Raiders was the second (the first being 1939 Nick Carter - Master Detective) and the last film directed by Jacques Tourneur about the adventures of a popular detective Nick Carter whose character was created still in the end of the 19th century and who served as a protagonist of several films before this one during the silent era.
My favorite Scene: Emma Rae kicking her brother -in -law after she helped him to come in the second floor of the house through the window.
How could you trust that man for one second and be surprised when he cheats?
I thought the movie was well done, but as a second generation white American it did not have a particularly deep impact on me.
She demeans herself daily cleaning the house of a wealthy woman who treats her like a second class citizen and then has to clean another house and sew dresses nightly in order to put any money aside.
Not to sound too neurotic, I even have a spare (second) tape of it.
Besides Irene, the rest of the vocal chores are taken by Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in their second film together.
Folks of my generation might remember that the song got a second life as a doo-wop ballad during the first phase of rock and roll.
The first half of the story was much better than the second half.
Play it again Sam (1972) Dir: Herbert Ross With Diane Keaton's second feature, she begins her frequent onscreen collaboration with her occasional offscreen lover, Woody Allen.
is that because i'm bored after all that hours watching the first and the second season?
They really suck, the first movie was so disappointing and bad, but in the second movie, "The beast with a billion backs" was actually quite good.
Gable was never better, he seems to relish every second he is on screen, and there is none of the masculine stiffness about him that his worst performances have.
Anyone who has ever enjoyed a Marilyn Monroe movie is simply watching second best - Harlow was the original "blonde bombshell" - and is still the best.
The film somewhat succeeds in the first respect but fumbles its way through the second.
", you don't have to have second sight to interpret his statement.
Astaire-Rogers fans may be disappointed to find them dance only twice in the film together, the first well after the half-hour mark in an informal but energetic tap routine and the second near the end in their standard formal wear.
But the second half of the film about the scientists adventures in a post-apocalyptic world is dull and sloppy.
Eventually their satellite's computer is hijacked by an unseen entity who prompts an impromptu landing somewhere near the coast of Canada, sparking the second of the two B movie scenarios that becomes a post apocalyptic thriller centered around a makeshift totalitarian regime dominated by the prep school brat of an Army general who recruits other brats, arms them with machine guns, and herds the surviving populace into a ramshackle town comprised mostly of junk.
It goes downhill a little as we enter the usual post apocalyptic shoot 'em up of the second half but even so, everything that happens is horribly credible.
This may be one of the more underrated Canadian sci fi movies of the 80s, although much of the plot and characterizations goes way lame in the second half.
The second is THE BEACHCOMBER, which reunites on screen Laughton and his pretty wife, Mrs. Lanchester.
Newton (here young, vigorous, and not the slave to alcohol he became a decade later) learns that the key is at Jamaica Inn, a desolate, ill-famed hostelry, run by Leslie Banks (this would be Banks' second film with Hitchcock - he'd been in the original THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH).
Have this film in your life and just absorb every second of its absolute perfection.
And don't forget the ending with Anna (Alida Valli) walking along the road a second time just like an earlier scene.
Okay, okay, so you hear magazines complain about this remake of the old Hitchcock movie (Dial M For Murder) and ditch it without a second thought.
If you want to have an idea of how bad Le Libertin is, just check how many second hand DVD copies are sold on the internet and for what prices.
Whether if Kennedy had lived and won a second term he would have increased our commitment to a half a million men as Lyndon Johnson did is open to much historical speculation.
The replacements are a really mixed bag, a sergeant who Lancaster has served with before and respects highly in Jonathan Goldsmith, a very green and eager second lieutenant in Joe Unger, a demolitions man who is a draftee and at that time Vietnam service was a strictly volunteer thing in Craig Wasson, and a medic who is also a junkie in Dennis Howard.
And finally, by the end of the film's "second act" it takes on more of an "alamo" feeling.
John Wayne's second effort as star/producer (after "Angel and the Badman", in 1947), "The Fighting Kentuckian" is a VERY enjoyable tale, set in 1818 Alabama, of coonskin-capped Wayne, part of the Kentucky militia, falling for French immigrant Vera Ralston (in her second film with Duke), and discovering a plot to swindle the French community (composed of ex-officers of Napoleon, and their families) out of their land, by aristocrat John Howard and ruthless river boss Grant Withers.
This is Woo's second US movie, and is an improvement on 'Hard Target'.
It's such a shame that Woo's American career got off to such a dodgy start (this is the second US film he made, after the Van Damme film "Hard Target").
Elizabeth has a son from her first husband and then a second from Lawrence.
Directed by John Woo Broken Arrow was his second American action film after the fabulous Hard Target (1993), I personally rate Broken Arrow, & Hard Target for that matter, as one of my favourite over-the-top action flicks from the 90's & for that I apologise to no-one.
I don't think so, the truck itself had at least a 10 second head start before we even discuss how slow it would have to have been going for Hale to physically run after it & catch it up.
I hate to say this but I could watch this a second time and still not get bored with it.
Yes, Ms DeLuca is naked for a good part of the second half but, unless you're a twelve year old boy, you become engrossed enough in her predicament that you aren't focusing on that fact.
Whyte and Dean send for the police in order to find out who the first woman was and who had her killed, and Doris (the second and real one) must be able to survive until midnight when she gets her inheritance.
If you're tuned into His Girl Friday, Hawks won't bore you for a second, and it's a mighty achievement.
In this second film version of the hit play by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur The Front Page, New York newspaper reporter Hildy Johnson (played by Pat O'Brien in 1931) is now a sassy, confident woman (Rosalind Russell).
Russell charges across the screen and never loses momentum for a second.
In the second one vincent played the crow as insane, like he'd lost his mind.
The original didn't have any super cheesy lines, the second one was more comic booky so it was alright, this one just let them go.
This movie is better than the second Crow movie, City of Angels but this movie, like COA, could never equal the deeply moving love story of the original with Brandon Lee, nor the magnificent actor that Brandon Lee was.
I thought the action was better than the second film.
Most second sequels are restricted by tiny budgets, meaning tiny no-name stars.
Unfortunately, this movie doesn't quite focus on the poetry and melancholic views that the first one showed and maybe the second one showed as well.
Still, I'll recommend this one anyway even if it doesn't make up to the first crow, but it does make up to the second one.
After the first 2 movies, the fans of "The Crow" saga made enough money to put this and the second terrible sequel together.
This movie makes the second movie look like Schindlers List.
Just more second rate goons working for some puppet master... overkill.
The first time was because Mabius' friend distracted her before losing his own life, and the second time was because her gun only had one bullet in it.
Alex, unlike Ashe from the second film, has fun with his victims while he tortures/kills them.
Now all they need is to find a way to manually move the film at 24 frames a second.
In the technical sense this is "limited" animation - the handful of animators (just four are credited) charged with bringing the story to life restrict themselves, when they can, to less than the full 24 frames per second, and often use all manner of cunning tricks to avoid having to animate at all.
It's my second favorite (After One Piece).
George Lucas's second feature film is definitely an A-plus when it comes to life in the early 1960s.
All of the characters in this film have an imperviousness to the objections related to a perceived totalitarianism brought on in the sixties, not just because the radical aspect of the decade has yet to be, but also, because locking horns with the authority figures is not second nature to them ...(Even Big John Milner)...
Quite dramatic and brutal in the first part, warm and funny in the second.
Each time I cried it was real and sad, but each time I laughed it was heartfelt and even if for a fraction of a second that laugh made me happy.
I watched Birth for the second time the other night.
There are movies I've loved the first time, then thought on the second time around, hmmm, maybe not as good as I first thought - State of Grace, Fight Club, for instance.
There are movies I hated the first time, and hated just as much the second - Lost in Translation and In the Cut come to mind.
And there are movies that were magnificent the first time, and even more magnificent the second.
The second half is a love story.
From the IMDb trivia section: "The apprehension of criminals by arranging a "Meet the Yankees" breakfast was based on an actual event"), has two parts, the first one is the one I liked better and the second is just about a love relationship, the whole thing with the murders is sort of just a pretext.
Sea of Love is an entertaining film with a first part that is simply that, a fast-paced entertainment and a second part that, like I said, is predictable, with a sexy Barkin and with really bad scenes (for instance take the supermarket supposedly very sexy scene, very bad music is what stands out in that part!).
Now, I have seen only De Palma's Scarface and Sea of Love (just yesterday I saw it for the very first time), I think Pacino is just f****** great as Tony Montana and just good as Frank Keller, never really great, he entertains just like the film itself and certainly this performance is extremely far to be one of his best (from the IMDb biography of Pacino: "It marked the second phase of Pacino's career, being the first to feature his now famous dark, owl eyes and hoarse, gravelly voice").
The first hour shapes up like a mystery thriller Â a 'whodunit', for want of a better expression Â but the second hour focuses more on the sexual paranoia between Pacino and Barkin.
Detective Sherman, from a district outside Manhattan, joins Frank when a second victim is killed in the same MO.
But the second time she appeared, and smiled, I recognized her immediately and was stunned with her performance (compare most modern child performances on diction, delivery and command of emotion).
It's a great lighthearted Dutch comedy about mostly the second generation of Maroccan immigrants in The Netherlands.
This movie will certainly appeal to most Dutch-teenagers, as well as the second generation of Marrocan immigrants and immigrants of different descents of course.
They notice a face on a second computer, and a blow-up shows it to be that of Taguchi's, blankly staring out.
The second story makes itself present by introducing itself as another young man's incursion to the Internet.
I suppose a second watch might reveal more to me but we'll see, I reckon.
I've watched it twice now, and it's just as good the second time around.
In the second half, they must confront a dangerous man in search of the legendary Java Tiger, an artifact worth $8 million, which is said to be hidden in a cave on a remote Hawaiian island.
During the first World War the American hero out of that conflict, Alvin C. York of Tennessee, had to wait until the outbreak of the second World War for his biographical film to be made.
In my opinion 'To Hell and Back' is one of the best war movie ever made, (right next to 'Saving Private Ryan') because it was about a true story of a kid from Texas with a run-a-way Father and a dead Mother, wanted to do something for the war effort but was turned down by every other service except the Army, and the Army had second thoughts.
Maybe, you can laugh for one second about it, but everything is so obvious, trivial and vulgar that I found it very hard to appreciate.
The first time around, it's one of the most confusing, annoying things ever, but it makes perfect sense the second time around.
I got Rainbow Six a couple of years ago for a cheap price.I didn't really like this game.Rainbow Six is a fairly overrated game in my opinion.Its hard.I had this game for years and I am still stuck on the second level.The first level was pretty fun and had a fair amount of action.The graphics were great for 1998.However this game I thought was pretty hard and overrated.If you see Rainbow Six for a very cheap price buy it but by cheap I mean under $9.99.I have not played the other Tom Clancy games.
Contrary to how it appears on IMDb I saw the film in its correct order and enjoyed this, the first half, more than the second half because it was not as gritty nor as fundamentally sad.
Soderbergh's choices of camera angles, perspective, lighting and all the cinematic aspects give you a permanent first person angle in the action that is so involving that you actually die with Che in the end of the second movie...
The second one has smoother transitions, so i guess that actually the story had to be depicted in a non linear, sort of summarized way to avoid the running time reaching 6hs...
Maybe my conclusions are wrong and the second part will tell me something else, but that last question isn't worth asking because "Che" is a good movie; and that's enough.
Neither does the second part.
First is The Argentine, depicting Che's leadership in jungle and town fighting that led up to the fall of Havana in the late 50's, and the second is Guerrilla, and concerns Che's failed effort nearly a decade later in Bolivia to spearhead a revolution, a fruitful mission that led to Guevara's capture and execution in 1967.
The second part was to have been the original film and was written first and, I think, shot first.
Radical editing--or major expansion--would have made it into something more successful, and as it is it's a long slog, especially in the second half.
The second collaboration of Sergio Corbucci, the Italian Western's most important director besides Sergio Leone, and Franco Nero, one of the genre's greatest actors, after the ingenious "Django" from 1966, "Il Mercenario", a movie set in the time of the Mexican revolution, and therefore late for a Western, is a must-see for every fan of the genre.
The Camera-work on the film is complete crap, it looks like it was filmed on a second hand camera brought from a car boot sale in Tokyo, and edited on an old junk yard hard drive.
This is the second best game ever only beaten by Final Fantasy VII me and my brother disagree now again he thinks that Final Fantasy VII is the best game ever which I agree with on some points but, the ending for this game is the best.
This is the second best game ever only beaten by Final Fantasy VII me and my brother disagree now again he thinks that Final Fantasy VII is the best game ever which I agree with on some points but, the ending for this game is the best.
The youngest refused, so the second took her doll and her youngest sister and threw it into the raging fire.
The show makes us love the second sister, Ching-ling for her passion and dedication to her country.
The role of the second sister was well played by Maggie Cheung as she showed her love for her country, her wit (when she said that both she and the plane were made in China, so why could they not trust made in China goods) and her loyalty to the memory of Sun (when she stepped down from the party, feeling that its true principles had been betrayed.
We had a "second run" theater nearby where you could see films for a dollar or 50 cents before 2 o'clock, so I know I saw it at least a dozen times (it played at the theater for about 3 months).
They have taken the view that winning is the end-all and be-all of living, and that second or third or fourth place in the standings is worthless.
All were sure that he was not, and I deeply regret that I didn't pursue a second or seventieth medical opinion.
The opening cinematics had me from the second that they started as they are the coolest this series has ever had.
Clocking in at a trim 99 minutes, "Kansas City Confidential" doesn't squander a second and never wears out its welcome.
The second part involves the bank hold-up.
This vaulted to the top of my list of favorite films noir the second it was over.
Simply too short, even with all the extras on the second disk (many of which are excellent just as stand alone pieces-Lemmy is a highlight here too!)
a brutal event (an airplane crash in "Lost", a hijacked boat in"Tribe"), leaves a group of very different people stranded on an island; second, these people, despite their very different personalities, are forced to organize themselves in order to live together, and this cannot be without some conflicts; other elements are also common to the two series: the island on which both "tribes" are stranded on contains some traps and there are also the "bad ones" (the "others" about whom the survivors in "Lost" are warned about by the French woman in Season 1, and the bad encounter that the group of people who leave the island on the raft make are obviously similar to the sea pirates returning to the island in "Tribe", etc... etc...)And the name of one of the major characters in both "Tribe" and "Lost" is...
Watching it a second time gives you a sense of perspective though.
The second season tossed these two redeemers in favor of more formulaic stories and more action and humor.
Unresolved endings and dark story lines were the trademark of the first season while the second series succumbed to safer familiar territory.
I still remember being all psyched up for the first episode of the second season.
As for those that say it was boring, like all first seasons the show was developing a direction and was positioned for a killer second season (before they butchered it without giving it a chance to grow that is).
I'm convinced that had the original theme been pursued the second season would have been more exciting while still maintaining its scientifically realistic roots Â truly a loss for a truly brilliant show.
Another problem is that although I enjoyed the show, there were huge changes (mostly unwelcome) in the second season.
The second season was picked up by the CBC, but they threw it away by airing it Saturday afternoons at 3 pm.
and in fact started life as an aborted second season.
What should have been the second episode - 'Black Sun' - unfortunately went out later in the original run, meaning viewers missed an important plot point - the Moon had passed into a region of space where the normal laws of physics did not apply, hence Dr.Asimov and all those sticklers for scientific accuracy were misinformed in their harsh criticism.
However, it did well enough abroad for a second season to be commissioned.
The second season was arguably though, the most exciting, with upbeat music and lots of action, the flaw being that some of the scripts were pretty poor.
It reminded me of how the Monkees attempted to jump from the mod to the flower power era during the second season of their TV series.
Then watch for the second best part of the film crashing off the top of the stone quarry.
I'm just gonna get real nitpicky here a second and say - JackHammer was one of the worse movies I have ever seen in my entire life.
On second thought .
By the end of the second act (after the film's most neck-hair-raising moment, when all the corpses at the Motel are found to be missing), it is revealed that the Motel scenes have been taking place within a psychopath's mind, and that each Motel character was merely one of the multiple personalities of the psychopath.
Today I have watched "Identity" for the second time in less than two months, now on DVD.
This is my second viewing of Identity.
The two aspects I had a slight problem with on the second go-round were one, the plot didn't quite envelop me to the same extent (maybe because I remembered the twist?)
In the second installment to the highly successful "Beverly Hills Cop" trilogy, we find Axel Foley(Eddie Murphy) returning once again to Beverly Hills to solve crime.
Being that this is the second film in the trilogy, one would expect "Beverly Hills Cop II" to either be a step up or a step down from the first film.
Too bad TCM didn't get this for their retrospective on Hutton films a few years ago - it's one of her best even if she does play second fiddle to Lamour (though she holds her own).
Also keep in mind it was time just after aggression of US against Yugoslavia and time of victories of federal forces in the second Chechen war - everyone still remembered the humiliation of the first war as well as all previous decade .
The second installment (well, you don't really expect Balabanov to stop milking this storyline, do you?)
***SPOILER ALERT*** True story of a shipwreck, due in the film to a WWII German naval mine, that had the ship's-The Crescent Star- second mate Executive Officer Alec Holmes, Tyrone Power, take command after the fatality injured ship's Captain Paul Darrow Laurence Nismith, put him in charge of it's survivors.
This utilitarian theory conflicts with a second theory, the more conventional Egalitarian standard, which holds that all human life is of equal value.
Without viewing the film a second time, Stephen Boyd's character, I believe, comes closest to acting out a consistent Egalitarian standard since he refuses to sacrifice another without sacrificing himself.
I loved this movie, both the first and second time I saw it.
Anyway, if you see this film at a bootfair or second hand shop part with your 50p, take it home and watch it.
Edna May Oliver is probably second only to Marie Dressler as the most famous character actress of the 1930's and Miss Dressler was a star whereas Miss Oliver tended to play mostly second leads.
Unfortunately, my video store that I rent at does not have the second Beverly Hills Cop or the third, so when I stopped by Best Buy and saw the sequel for $6.99, I thought it might be worth a buy.
I loved Beverly Hills Cop 2, I hope I do find the third one, I know it doesn't have as good of a rating like the first or the second one, but still I love Eddie Murphy.
I admit that as a Christian I was taken aback at first but the little boy I first met in second grade was there for all too see.
But I don't believe for a second you're a satanist.
In one second a scolded Spot can go from excitement to rejection, to reproach, to dejection - all absolutely unmistakeably indicated by every part.
The second installment has Axel Foley trying to solve a case involving a criminal who goes by the name "The Alphabet Killer"(played by Jurgen Prochnow) after LT. Bogomil is shot by the Alphabet Killer's hench woman Sally, played by Brigitte Nielson.
Tempo slows down in the second half and the story runs on predictable line.
BEING the second entry into the Fleischer Brothers Studios' line of SUPERMAN Cartoons, 'The Mechanical Monsters (Fleischer Studios/Paramount Pictures Corporation, 1941) was released for theatrical exhibition to the movie going public in November of 1941.
The first half of the film is much better than the second, with the scenes in the guys' apartment really hitting the mark.
The script does lose its way a bit in the second half, wandering too far into wish-fulfillment fantasy and the arcane muddle of big business deal-making and stock portfolios for its own good, but that's a small enough flaw in a movie that otherwise provides an abundance of inarguable virtues.
In order to fit in, Vitus fakes a diminution of ability after an attempt to put on wings and jump from the second story of his house results in a concussion.
A second tank is disabled at a greater distance and with no more fanfare than the first.
agent (Simon Yam) gives her a second chance at life, but with brutal consequences.
It's the second time I've seen it in several years.
"The Dunwich Horror" is the second H.P.Lovecraft adaptation from art director Daniel Haller("Die,Monster,Die!
second one is the one scene that contains an explosion and where the cgi effects are VERY bad( while that is not important to the plot at all, somehow will affect your impression and visual perceptions since the suspense about around there is great- kind of a "let down" for a few moments).
On second thought, perhaps it would be best to stick with that notion; it just might go down easier that way.
The second is a gang whose members don't die very easily and their alien leader, though no one seems to really care or notice that he's an alien.
OK, so she`s not on screen every single second.
But on his second try, Fox approached it a different way and won the part that shot him to stardom.
Somewhere In the Night dates from 1946, the same year his second directorial effort Dragonwyck was released and it's well up to snuff.
Getting back to the rivetingly noir, Somewhere in the Night, this movie is not just an actor's heyday (which it is Â you'll probably miss the clever way one of the players signals the plot to the audience in the first 15 minutes, so watch for it on a second view), but a photographer's and set designer's paradise as well.
This was the second film Mankiewicz directed, and it's a big improvement over DRAGONWYCK.
On second thought... that's not a good thing.
Freddie Highmore did a great job as August Rush and made every second of the movie enjoyable.
My own son, Greg, was reading and doing math beyond a second grade level well before he began kindergarten.
Another highlight is the character of "Arthur X" a child musician who basically drives the plot forward all on his own for most of the second act.
Then they locate the second villain but Lady Snowblood finds out that he has died and won't be able to kill him herself.
In fact they know him for more than 10 years, yet nobody knows that he is the son of the second villain that is supposed to be dead.
So it seems revenge has been exacted but soon after we find out that the second villain who was supposed to be dead is actually alive.
I was abandoned a second time by one of my parents.
The story was unexpected and definitely better the second time around since I was paying attention this time.
The second most aggravating thing about the movie is Karen Allen's blue suit, which she wears in every scene.
The second half of the movie was strongest.
They entire thing stumbles in a gooey fog through second rate (why not use first rate?)
I second the comments about this influential cartoon and its effect on the course of animation.
It's an out-and-out classic, with a plot loosely based on the children's fairy tale playing second fiddle to beautifully drawn and animated scenes and some fantastic big-band music.
One was the walks and talks of Lizzie and Mr Darcy after their engagement and second, the reaction of Mrs Bennet after Elizabeth told her about it.
And do not worry about it being boring, there is something exciting happening every second!!!
Elizabeth, the second eldest Bennet herself is the one who utters the opening line of Austen's book -- and it's appropriate that she be the one who does so: listen to how she says it, not to when she does or who she does to.
So hunt this down and enjoy every blood drenched second.
This involved a fine piece of editor-timing; a split second either way, either too long or too short, and the poignancy of that moment would have been lost.
I just finished watching "Man of The Century" for the second time on the IFC channel.
Now, one freeze frame (if memory serves me correctly, the only one), of the baddie coming up some stairs, that may be the second Shurayukihime (apologies if it is) and one side of her face is visible in the freeze frame to alert the audience of this woman's arrival.
Kessler gently coaxes Margaret into pulling the string on a second "popper" to prove that she doesn't need to be a victim of her fears.
I then decided to have a second look a couple of years ago to see whether my initial reaction was correct and, if anything, I was too kind to it.
throughout the whole game you think you know who she is but in a second you find that she's a MAJOR character from the first game and the movie now all grown up.
He could also combine some elements from the second game since it has the best story in the franchise but whatever the case I have full faith in Mr. Gans and know he will make another masterpiece that I'll obsess over.
This has amazing music, if there may be more lyrics than earlier in the series; then again, they are fantastic, and like the second, this does, as it needs to, distinguish itself(without deviating so much that we get alienated), they can't all be carbon-copies, they have to do something new.
The film's cinematographer makes great use of contrast staging the first half of the film in a rural forest setting and the second half in an urban landscape.
It's a tragedy/travesty a second series wasn't commissioned.
Curiously enough, this is only Hammer's second foray into Wolf Man lore after THE CURSE OF THE WEREWOLF (1961); intriguingly, it's mixed here with a VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED (1960)-like brood of evil children Â while the sinister procreation plot is a clear nod to ROSEMARY'S BABY (1968).
But the biggest complaints to voice would be the lack of general thematic focus, and the fact that the majority of the better material in the story is told in the first half and the second, while still good, really doesn't work as compelling stuff.
'This movie will take you more than six hours, but it's worth every second it costs you to watch.
Reluctant to go to such a huge commitment of time, a friend convinced me to sneak into the last hour of the second half.
After the second, you feel like you know the characters as if they were your own friends.
I know six hours is quite long, but this movie was worth every second of it.
But the sadly heavy-handed, grossly unnecessary insertion of Matteo's "ghost" into the closing scene between Nicola and Mirella made me realize what an orgy of wish-fulfillment the second half is.
I sat for the second three hours today with people who sat through the first three hours with me yesterday.
It's usually Orgasmo that gets most of the fans; but if you ask me, this second version of Paranoia is the better of the two.
The first half of the film is much better than the second, as A Quiet Place to Kill unfortunately looses a bit of steam once it gets the first part of the plot out of the way.
The stylistic beauty of the first, where the traces of Comedia del'Arte could be observed, was stage beauty of one kind, and the long and winding path to the realistic stage beauty of the second one... made sense.
Maria is in love with Ned who is, at least, potentially bisexual while actually intimate with one of the king's favorites, the second Duke of Buckingham (Ben Chaplin).
So instead, she goes to a second rate company that puts on plays in a pub and emerges as Margaret Hughes, an actress in her own right who will challenge Keynaston's Desdemona and makes that role, her signature role as well.
And since this was released in the 1980s, our Italian friends threw in a little STAR WARS shtick in the second half for good measure.
The second tale is called "Cut" and surprisingly is the poorest of the three.
The second story, "Cut", also straight-forward, might be the weaker of the three even though it has some very tense moments: a director finds himself hostage to a situation with an actor who was little more than an extra, his wife attached to a piano like a puppet, and a child strapped against a sofa.
The second story in the film is Chan Wook Parks tale entitled "CUT".
The second segment, by the wonderful Park Chan-Wook of Oldboy fame, gets a little better.
The second story is "Cut" by Chan-wook Park.
The second short, entitled Dumplings, by Fruit Chan, is undoubtedly the most disturbing of the three.
Cut, the second short directed by Park has an uncanny resemblance to "SAW", as some might say.
BOX, being the second film that I've seen from Miike still leaves me in the grey with him.
Chan-Wook Park is responsible for the second tale and if you've seen any of the entries in his Vengeance-Trilogy ("Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance", "Oldboy", "Lady Vengeance"), you already more or less know what to expect.
The second story centers on a director who gets held captive by a film extra with an agenda.
The second disc which contains a text portion which explains the plot of each story, and then a "Making Of" extra for all three stories is very good.
I'll admit I trailed off a little towards the end, but this second Dirty Harry sequel from director James Fargo (Every Which Way But Loose) didn't seem very interesting anyway.
Harry who at first had little respect for his new partner woman cop Kate Moore later was almost in tears when she was gunned down saving his life, for the second time in the movie, by taking a bullet that was meant for him.
He was the unlucky bank robber in the first movie and pimp in the second.
This is the second of three times Edward Popwell appears in a Callahan flick, this time as a the leader of a black militant group.
I would rather hold my grandmas hand while she's on the toilet than watch even a second of this movie again.
This is the second and most lightweight of three very fruitful screen pairings they had during this period - the other two are the even more insane divorce farce, "The Awful Truth", from 1937 and 1941's child adoption tearjerker, "Penny Serenade".
Scott's laid back persona is perfect foil to Grant's more batty approach work, while Patrick in the tricky role of the neurotic second wife is fabulous, and it remains a mystery as to why she didn't go on to better and brighter things.
His joy of realizing she's still alive is second only to the manic gyrations he puts himself through as he tries to deal with the situation without letting his new wife in on the news.
Even on second glance, "House of 1,000 Corpses" is awful, simply because form and narrative is jettisoned for a near-endless string of abrasively avant-garde camera techniques (loud color filters, cut scenes that come out of nowhere, aged-down video quality, negative filters, split screen, etc.)
You'd think that at some point during the long months of pre and post production at least one member of the cast or crew would have said, "Hold on a second, isn't this all just a little far-fetched?"
There's really no other way to explain occurrences such as: The second victim throwing herself through a glass coffee table for *no* reason whatsoever, whilst the killer was hot on his heels behind her.
I watched House of 1000 Corpses today, and nothing has stayed with me; what little effect it had on me was gone the second I stopped watching it.
Rather than to simply ignore the old comment and pretend I never bashed it, I wish to write a new Â more positive Â review, if it were only to convince other people (who also disliked at first) to give it a second change.
She plays a stuttering, socially backward young woman living in a dark household where her petty, nagging father (Henry Hull) gloomily inhabits the first floor and her helpless, self-pitying mother (Fay Bainter) occupies the second one.
There's a good amount of suspense too in the second half, as the authorities keep closing in and things get very tense.
Dane Clark is very good too, even if he never got past second fiddle to John Garfield-- then too, his strictly blue-collar personality was a poor fit for the upwardly mobile 1950's, and by that white-collar decade, he was gone.
Well, I'll second that emotion.
It is only the second time (at that time) the story had been filmed.
In its second half, however, the story surrenders to the pessimism it tries to battle; the tone shifts from `Dilbert' to Kafka, and some of the characters suddenly become cold and unsympathetic.
It was hard to see how immune they have become to it that now it was second nature and how the black humour of it flowed between the two.
If you saw this on video or TV, you might want to give it a second look (like I did) on DVD because it looks a whole lot better.
Peter Cushing plays the doctor who needs bodies in this fine adaptation of the Burke and Hare grave robbing case.Donald Pleasance and George Rose are both excellent as the infamous grave robbers.The film is truly atmospheric-full of packed bars,foggy streets and deep shadows-and the performance by Peter Cushing is simply amazing-Cushing is probably one of the most recognizable faces in the horror genre.The film has an eerie cinematic style reminiscent more of films from the 1940's than 1959.The first half of Gilling's story moves extremely slow,but the second half has some gruesome murder scenes.A must-see for fans of British horror!
Oh yeah, Traci Lords has a cameo (this is the second movie I've seen in as many weeks with a Traci Lords cameo...).
The second is Kathleen Turner's manically over-the-top performance as Beverley, alternating between a model of bourgeois domestic virtue and a bloodthirsty maniac, and playing both with equal relish.
But several months and several 100 movies later, a second viewing(why I wasted my time I don't know) warrants a lower rating.
The first is how much you can tolerate the potty humor used in the show, and the second is how much you view the characters Billy and Mandy.
"Screams of a Winter Night" was made with student actors attending Northwestern State University in Natchitoches,Louisiana,a college that has since been abandoned,the neglected campus becoming a popular teen hang-out.It consists three genuinely spooky stories told by a young campers in an old cabin.The first one is about 'The Moss Point Man',a Yeti-like creature encountered by a local girl and her boyfriend deep in the woods.The second one is about a mute psychopath in an allegedly haunted hotel with the climax somewhat reminding me "The Blair Witch Project".The third story is about a sexually repressed girl turning psycho after an attempted rape.The strange,howling wind is becoming stronger and stronger...Creepy low-budget gem from late 70's without gore and nudity.It has some great scares and surprising twists.8 out of 10.
Then the movie started, and from the scary opening which is comprised of sound effects over the credits through the second story, I was scared nearly to tears by this.
The best of the bunch, and oddly enough, the one people rag on the most, has three frat pledges fufilling their dare to spend the night in an abandoned hospital with a rep for having a haunted second floor.
It's the second one that really got me.
Dark and dingy, with the characters pretty much spending the whole telling cowering near the stairway to the second floor, there's a real feeling of danger as each one of them goes upstairs and dosent come back.
There's a number of surprising plot developments during the film's second half, but the narrative is almost wholly subservient to the filmmakers' technical skills.
I had forgotten some of the twists and turns it takes, but enjoyed it just as much the second time around.
Please note that my history class is my second favorite class and the most enjoyable of the 11th grade.
The group has come down to us in history as the Rough Riders and its organizer and second commander became President of the United States on the strength of one afternoon's very bloody work at a place called Kettle Hill, better known as San Juan Hill.
A second star for some nice shots of Spain and tolerable music.
Jaws 3-D is a trashy second sequel to Jaws that's more likely to turn viewers' stomachs over rather than keep them on the edge of their seat.
DUM,DUM,DUM,DUM.....Just when you thought you were safe from sequels... Comes this second dreadful,horrid,and poorly acted film.Louis Gosset Jr. sports a terrible ghetto accent thoughout the film,probably hoping he won't be recongnized.James Bond Hopeful(at the time)Simon McQuade plays a Costeuo-like Documentary filmaker,Mr.Fritz-Royce who*spoilers ahead* gets swallowed whole by Mrs. Bruce.Bess Armstrong(High Road to China) plays the love interest,but hey, at least she's better than Karen Young in Jaws the Revenge.Dennis Quaid(The Parent Trap,The Right Stuff,Dreamscape) is the now grown up Mike Brody,who with Martin Brody out of the film,is the hero.John Putch is Shawn still afraid of the Deep Blue Sea(get it?
He's second in command of a prison stockade in the west during the Civil War.
  Good classic film that shows how the North dealt with the Confederates and American Indians at the same time during the U.S. Civil war.Good overall production and the ciematography was very good.To nitpick,the movie started slow and Parker's dresses were too unrealistic for the circumstances.Also the romance chemistry between Parker and Holden was lacking.The script could also have been a tag better.Still,the second half of the film delivered the action goods which will delight true Western genre fans.Only for fans of the genre who are not partial to the Confederate side and fans of the lead stars......
The film has exciting cavalry-Indian battle scenes, and the second clash is particularly novel in its execution because it is done by Indians.
The first thing the struck my is how much better looking the film is, and the second thing that struck me is that, other than the length and thickness of the plot and story, it is remarkably similar to his earlier films.
Luckily, a police officer sees the second thief and returns the stolen wallet to the thoroughly astonished tramp.
The production, like The Kid, was stonewalled numerous times with various situations, chief among them was a fire at Chaplin studios and divorce proceedings brought on by his second wife: Lita Grey.
I enjoyed this a lot more the second time when I could see it on a very clear DVD print.
For all those people that did not like Jaws 2, this third installment makes the second look as good as the original!
When she killed her husband for a second time, it was a DIFFERENT CRIME Â no double jeopardy applies.
I thought Grindhouse was a hoot but not worth another attendance, being a concatenation of two lousy movies in an amusing fashion, but I'd rather sit through three hours of that movie a second time than watch this one for the first.
The second great performance is Sir Anthony Hopkins.
That is probably the best film ever done and this is the second sequel and I like it, some of the effects it`s very bad but the film is pretty entertainment.
Elfen Lied is a little Japanese jewel XO I'm waiting for the second season (hoping that there will be one... but the end seems to say us "ha ha ha, it's not yet the end!!!")
The storyline is addictive, so stay away unless you are prepared to watch every last second of gore, tears, and kisses.
Well Kohta sad to never hurt somebody again, so I think when her second horn has broke off too, she lost her vectors, and she has died.
At the end when I saw that Lucy has kiss Kohta I really thought that they could be with each other forever, and when I saw that her second horn has broke off too, my heart has nearly broke too.
Only the ending is quite usual and poor - but the second part, after the first boring 30-40 minutes, worths the time wasted.
You get shlocky trash, you get unknown actors, you get dumb cartoon characterizations shot on the cheap for nickels and dimes--canned and sometimes original linear productions, first act second act third act straight action with a hint of sex ( and little more than a hint ).
Cheryl Hall left after the second series, so Shirley was written out.
As for Sharmila Tagore, she was the same as rajesh khanna.. the second half of the movie is quite touching..... Look at the way the song "BADA NATKAHT HAI" is used in the background when Vinod Mehra returns to search pushpa..
The second half is more curious, and ultimately more disturbing.
For the majority of the second half you watch as people put out the fires, dig through the oil, and rebuild, reintroducing technology and solidity and community to the landscape.
I Love this show (although I was a baby when the second series was aired) All the characters are so cool especially Tucker, Garvey, Nancy and Donna.
This was made in the eighty's a few years after the second one (not as good as the first, but pretty good), the first two were made in the seventy's and the sound effects and shark effects were worse in this.
My son is five, and he insisted we buy the CDs for the first and second movies.
But when i watched it for the second time i thought it was Fabulous.
But at least the second movie didn't come out like, 10 years later out of the blue, with different actors, and a lame plot with main characters not even related to the originals at least.
When I read that the second installment was going to be on Disney, I decided to tune in.
I think this second one is better than the first, and Troy's penguin slide at the beginning made me laugh a little.
wasn't enjoyed by me any more the second time around than it was the first.
If I had poison handy I would have taken it without a second's hesitation.
You know, I can't for the life of me think for a second that Disney released this film thinking that it was a good movie.
But the second one, well this was torture.
What's great about this second movie is, really it's about the reverse of that.
Still, if this second movie doesn't match up to the first, it's because of moving it away from the dream of Triple Talent Status.
Meanwhile Barkin maneuvers Fishbourne through sex into killing company head Frank Langella, showing that IQ comes in a distant second to sex appeal.
From there, the movie becomes a cat and mouse game with a policeman whom Alex recently had demoted doggedly determined to prove that Alex is the second murderer (the police found Lou's prints on one gun and an unknown person's (Alex's) prints on the second gun).
I guess what irks most Ratner-haters is the fact that he seems to think he's the second coming, plays the Hollywood PR machine, and overloads his DVD's with WAY too much information about himself, as if anyone watching Rush Hour 2 wondered "Wow, did Truffaut direct this?
These films remind me of the excellent B movies we have heard about that Hollywood made as a second feature in their heyday.
But the second half developed into a dark drama devoid of any humor.
Her emotionally wrought mother is victimized by a second husband, played with a fantastic sadistic quality by Arthur Kennedy.
The first one was pretty good in a cheesy, '80s way; the second was more or less forgettable (tell the truth, I can't remember one character from it)... but "Aces" - It has everything an action fan could want.
Consider the sad alternative: second rate hand-drawn animation rivaling that of Saturday morning cartoons.
The second story has Douie, Huey and Louie going to where Santa lives to try and be on his list so they can get presents.
Today I watched it for the second time after picking up the DVD at Fangoria's Weekend of Horrors in Chicago 2007 from the director himself, Lloyd Kaufman.
I simply didn't believe in it for one second.
Drew doesn't do relationships; he doesn't even do second dates.
Underrated, gripping thriller was a big box-office failure but it deserves a second chance on home video.
The second couple presents a woman , who wants to try out with other women and pure alpha man.
Fot the man in the second couple and the woman in the first it means nothing, cuz they were closer like characters.
The first couple breaks off after and second one seems to remain together but he film is with open final.
Jeanne Crain is the one I remember most in this film, I think it was her second film.
I rarely comment negatively about a movie, but in this case, a second choice to "The Queen" which was having projector difficulties, it was a total waste of time.
Christopher Guest is a creative spirit who has been able to make some very funny films like 'Best In Show' where his technique of avoiding a script by giving his cast of actors an outline as matrix for a scene, letting them ad lib the idea a couple of times, then accepting the second or third take as the final product - pasting all the bits together in the edit.
Every second of this film was completely entertaining and will have you on the floor with laughter.
Guest himself probably gave my favorite performance as the director of "Home for Purim", with Jennifer Collidge coming in second as the producer.
You Can't Cheat An Honest Man finds widower W.C. Fields running a second rate circus and trying to stay one step ahead of the law as he's creditors just about every place he goes.
No matter if you are gay or straight, liberal or conservative, you will all enjoy every second of this incredibly well-made movie.
If the BBC commission a second series, I hope they add more writers.
Thanks to Jere Cunningham and Tom Flynn, the world can now enjoy Second String, a delicious TV movie depicting a tale of a rag-tag gang of second stringers (thus the title) who are thrust into the position of starters due to an order of bad oysters.
The movie becomes a virtual traffic jam of personal problems orbiting around Aurora with the second half an endless series of dramatic climaxes.
Of course, Jack Nicholson won his second Oscar for his role as her lover.
In fact, Van Dien may be my second favorite Tarzan, after Gordon Scott.
On my second viewing, I forced two friends, who hate subtitles, and are as far removed from the gay world as anyone I know and they loved it.
She had second thoughts about the whole project.
The first scene of the movie contained a helicopter, the second one contained Jennifer Hill in a wet t-shirt, and the fourth scene contained Jennifer putting it all out.
It's simply ridiculous... One of the most amusing demonstrations of the ivincible armour includes someone jumping from the second storey of a building directly onto the stomach of a super hard dude...  You must see this...
Bette received her second Best Actress Oscar nomination for her commanding performance here, She lights up the screen whether Dixie is upstaging Eddie in front of thousands of troops during WWII, cursing out sponsors during her and Eddie's television show, or tearing Eddie a new one when she thinks he is trying to steal her son away from her.
This is my second favorite Bette Midler movie, the first of course being Isn't She Great.
But he finds his second in command (the superb Sheldon Leonard) has pulled a "Moriarty" (i.e.
I sat through the movie again to be distracted a second time.
It was such a wonderful show.It was absolutely brilliant and positively divine.I loved every second I watched an episode of this show, and there wasn't any I thought were horrible.This show is underrated and it is definitely under appreciated.All the characters are lovable and different in their own way, which is a good ingredient for any show.Each episode was so interesting and entertaining, and not to mention some were actually unbearably funny!!
It's my totally favorite show, with Rocket Power in close second, and As Told By Ginger in third.
She didn't like him, then she some what tolerated him, then she didn't like him again, then the second he comes back from Equador she's hugging him like they were married.
The second I walked out of the theater, I felt like I had just been in church for the last hour-and-a-half.
The guy from the first generation is a sexual maniac soldier that even does a sexual act with a dead pig imagining he's doing it with a fat old ladyÂ The guy of the second generation is a fat (but a really big one!)
Taxidermia is a beautiful film in many respects, and it never ceases to amaze me that this is only GyÃ¶rgy PÃ¡lfi's second film.
For those who have no clue what the film is about; Taxidermia is the second full length film by Hungarian film-director GyÃ¶rgy PÃ¡lfi (I have not seen his first film Hukkle) and is based on the short stories by Lajos Parti Nagy.
The second story focuses on a fat speed eating champion who was born with a tail (and could either be the son of the lieutenant or the son of MorosgovÃ¡nyi; which it is not to clearly explained and therefore up to our imagination) and is by far the most boring story out of all three, his character stays undeveloped, we learn little about him, he just eats and pukes, finally he falls in love with a fat woman and together they have a child, so begins the third and last story, as the child grows up to be a skinny and kind of creepy Taxidermist, who lives alone with his now even fatter and bed ridden father and his large mutant cats.
That said I'd recommend doing whatever you have to to catch this film, it's certainly one of the most original offerings I've seen in a long while and hopefully it's only the second of many to come.
Cut to around 20 years later; the second story begins.
The second part mostly ignores sexual deviation, but there's still plenty of vomiting and retarded behaviour as to please even the most jaded fans of so-called "shock-cinema".
Gyorgy Palfi's second feature Taxidermia is definitely a milestone in Hungarian film-making, it is a truly astonishing experience and I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone wanting to broaden their taste for cinema.
The first is a sexually frustrated soldier in the second world war, who dreams sexually of his comrade's wife and kids.
GyÃ¶rgy PÃ¡lfi's second feature length movie is Taxidermia, which is about three generation of a family, and all of them has something very peculiar about them: the first one is a horny officer, his son is a very big sport-eater, and his job is very important of him.
Is this game worth 50 quid?No far from it,but if you pick this baby up second hand your in for a treat.The extras featuring campbell alone make this game worth buying
Given that a second, bigamous marriage would in any case have been invalid, though, I'm not sure that Harold needed to put quite so much effort into reaching the altar in time: whether the ceremony had been completed or not, the girl would still have been free to marry her real lover half an hour or so afterwards...  Definitely better than "Safety Last", although perhaps more uneven: danger stunts in themselves leave me fairly cold, but there is some enjoyable character work in this picture.
Groucho, Chico and Harpo continued to work at the Studio; but there seemed to be a steady decline after the second MGM picture, 1937's A DAY AT THE RACES.
His main media outlets were records, radio, and as one of the premier nightclub attractions, especially when he appeared with his second wife Cyd Charisse.
Okay the second one was a wee bit iffy for me but still I loved it!!
In my opinion this is their second best live show surpassed only by Hooligan's Island.
but it's the second half that really gets me in tears from laughter.
When these two guys get together you know your in for a great laugh.The way they have to improvise when one of them makes a mistake is just poor class.As with there other video's which I also think are excellent if you in a badmood and need a little bit of cheering up look no further.I think that this video is ALMOST as good as some of the second season episodes and i hope they get around to doing at least one more bottom video
I sighed immensely after this second viewing...
Mainly for the noteworthy elements I mentioned in my second paragraph.
The "head crushing"-scene was nice (though they cut away just a second too soon).
Sure there are some little exaggerations(some of the goal, some of the football stunts), but the shivers that one gets when seeing Raul, Beckam, Ronaldo, Thierry Henry, Zidane and other football stars giving their best on the pitch is worth every second of it.
But in the second...he's got this poor accent through out the movie.
However, the second "Goal!"
Ben plans on leaving town as soon as possible, but has second thoughts after meeting feisty and fetching ambulance driver Lou (a delightfully spunky portrayal by the deliciously lissome Julie Warner).
I thought it was decent fare on the first viewing until I caught the last 50 minutes or so a second time around on cable late one night.
First off, just to let you know, Queen Latifah cannot act, she has about as much acting ability as my left nut, just because someone can go on-screen and play themselves, over and over again, does not mean they can act, second off, I wouldn't even have had to watched this movie to tell you it's a piece of crap, the only reason I watched it's 'cause I work at a video store and it was playing on the tele, even then I stopped looking up after five minutes and tried to block out as much of the useless chit chat they were spitting out, and I can tell I'm not the only one who didn't like it 'cause people where walking out faster then they were coming in.
The experienced Ann-Margret has the biggest, if not the only laughs in the movie, drinking without stopping for a second, and living next to his son Washburn (Jimmy Fallon).
Think for a second.
Ann Margaret must have been feeling desperate when she agreed to appear in this film as the lush mother of Washburn, but on second thought, it makes perfect sense that with a son like him, drinking is the only way this woman can go through life.
I'm not kidding when I say that this a remake of the three French films since although the film is mainly a poor remake of the the first film, it lifts sequences from the second and third films.
Certainly one of the best of Universal's second cycle, and a film that in no way deserves the bad reputation it's received over the years.
Through the minds of three precognitive and abnormally gifted youths who, when asleep, dream only of murder in technologically projected second sight, Anderton sees his own criminal fate and sets out to alter his unknown predestination.
With famed cinematographer Janusz Kaminski working his magic, Minority Report's presentation is second to none in visual appearance.
That one was paid by the inventor who then afterward committed himself the very crime exactly the way it was supposed to happen which enabled this second crime to be understood by technicians as a simple echo of the first one that was prevented and to be disregarded.
The second is probably true.
I saw this a couple years ago and was unimpressed, however after upon 2nd viewing, I must say It deserves it's praise, so if you didn't care for it the 1st time, give it a second viewing, you may change your opinion.This should honestly be in the top 250 in my opinion, and there are some fantastic creepy moment as well, plus I loved the depressing atmosphere it had at times, and This is almost like The Fugitive except it's set in the future, plus It also has some very funny scenes in it as well.
Bottom line, this is the type of picture to see twice, first to get the feel and presence, and the second to clear up any misunderstandings in the plot (or maybe to avoid Scooby Doo and Windtalkers), since this is indeed one of the best pictures of the year and one of Spielberg's best recent pictures.
His next two films were improvements (there was nowhere to go but up): the first anonymous but not bad ("Amistad"), the second bad but not anonymous ("Saving Private Ryan"), but they were both pompous gestures which appear to have been designed to win still more awards; and it wasn't until eight years after "Schindler's List" that the skilled director of old times re-appeared (with "A.I."
It was not a "B" picture, but had top billing on double features in first, second and third-run movie theaters in my home town.
When I first saw it I believe the second feature was "The Mad Ghoul," starring George Zucco.
Once in her apartment, he used HER typewriter to write the second letter to himself, which he then mailed to himself.
Her tragic and horrible death at the theatre and her second death when her father throws her in the well made Ringu 0: Baadusei an incredible sad story.
The initial transformation sequence where, from behind, Dracula evaporates into a bat and flies off in seamless motion is a close second, and is a really impressive scene as well.
This is the second indie film that I have seen starring Bas Rutten and this guy has a great screen presence.
second, some angles were terrible.
There were times in the movie I laughed, times I cried, but I loved every second of it, and it blows almost every Hollywood movie out of the water.
It wasn't good the first time around...it's unbearable the second.
You've got one really funny joke about Guru Pitka's mom getting a job that kills even though it was in the trailer, Stephen Colbert finally hits one out of the park as a robot cyborg after failing three previous times to elicit any laughs, Jessica Alba is gorgeous as always if you overlook her atrocious acting abilities, and Justin Timberlake shows he has no shame and steals every single second of screen time he is given.
I mean, the main focus is supposed to be the idea that Pitka has been hired to get the star player on the Toronto Maple Leafs back with his ex-girlfriend so that his hockey skills will return and win his owner, the second generation of a cursed family, "Stanley's Cup".
As for Romany Malco, our second leadÂalthough he got the shaft of no top-billingÂhe does well for what he has been given.
I can not imagine this girl getting down from the second floor by the stairs with all this stuff.......whahhhhhhhhhhh
At a second level, it attempts to create interesting dialogue between characters that are socially inept outcasts, whose prime activity is sitting round a table rolling dice.
And the second entry (which isn't too bad and reminded of "The Terminator") would go onto be a prequel, which explained a lot about Misa's past and how she became to be a witch.
This is where I feel the series began to take a dip thanks to TV executives demanding what they think people want, since soon into the second series, the same old routines and gags kept on popping up again and again.
Don't get me wrong; "Little Britain" was still good through the second and third series, and characters like the travel agent and Vicky Pollard were brilliant.
And all of these is being revealed right into it's true, fully mad picture by Jack Nicholson, a person whom I reckon the second most deprogrammed actor in the world, after the great Anthony Hopkins.
Better late than never Marino and the dolphin mascot back for the second half of the Super Bowl!
"I came here to confess, I was the second gunman on the grassy knoll" ... "That's what turns me on about you, your attention to detail ..." and when he meets Ray Finkle's parents.
It has a much better cast than the second (and last) Ace Ventura film.
This is the funniest movie of all-time, with "Planes, Trains and Automobiles" in a close second.
With the assistance of his new second in command, Tommy (Percy Herbert), and much hard work, Ambrose soon has the pier repaired.
DVD would be nice Mr. Turner (Hint, Hint) even if in a second movie collection ( FULL versions of Man in the White Suit, The Horses Mouth + All at Sea).
It is a bit dated and 'stagey' in its opening minutes, partly because it is taken from the play, not the novel, by John Steinbeck, and also because so many of the outstanding cast were only making their second or third film, and needed warming up and getting used to the camera.
It would take too long for me to go shot by shot, but one thing in particular which is good if you see a few scenes of it, but is annoying the first time is the frequent several second flashbacks...
The impact was great both times and i was moved to tears watching it with my family the second time.
The mood of paranoia that emerges in the second half of the film is perfect - turning trivialities into monumental acts of anarchy and betrayal.
3) Because Jafar wasn't killed off in the first one, they brought him back, and he wasn't so fortunate the second time round, apparently - I didn't see any bones, but if he was still alive, they would have brought him back for subsequent episodes.
4) This was the second most sickening thing for me.
LOL (This is the second time that Al nearly dies, but is then saved by Genie.
Aladdin and Jasmine are not married in this film, (even though they married at the end of the first movie) and the only really memorable scene is a brief goof, where the Sultan loses his eyebrows for a split second.
Ok, on the theme: I'll get serious for a second and say that this movie would be supported by neo-nazis.
The social commentary should probably be looked at as more of a plot device than intelligent thought, but I found myself watching this movie repeatedly and enjoying it more the second and third time around.
Freeman's outburst scene where he puts a bottle up to Reeve's face and gives him a 20 second stare is WOW.
If ever there was a visual account of Jesus that should be used as an evangelical teaching tool, (second to the Bible) by any Christian believer - THIS IS IT!
Perhaps he'll get his second chance at a Hollywood career--lord knows, he deserves it!
Both of us regard it as second only to "Singin' In the Rain."
I am a huge fan of James Glickenhaus, and when I saw this film for sale I snagged it, and let me tell you, from the cover it looked like a second rate tele movie, but it is stylish and intelligent.
The second one is more gritty and sadistic with a graphic castration scene and lots of gunplay.
This is one of those movies where the second time through will be better than the first.
SCREAMING MIMI has the gritty, B&W, low-budget look Hitchcock consciously sought for his film and the MIMI's director, Gerd Oswald, helmed a number of ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS TV episodes and was an uncredited second unit director on Billy Wilder's macabre SUNSET BLVD.
In my opinion, I think this movie was made almost with an amateur touch, like a second grade production.
This is the second and most lightweight of three very fruitful screen pairings they had during this period - the other two are the even more insane divorce farce, "The Awful Truth", from 1937 and 1941's child adoption tearjerker, "Penny Serenade".
Scott's laid back persona is perfect foil to Grant's more batty approach work, while Patrick in the tricky role of the neurotic second wife is fabulous, and it remains a mystery as to why she didn't go on to better and brighter things.
His joy of realizing she's still alive is second only to the manic gyrations he puts himself through as he tries to deal with the situation without letting his new wife in on the news.
I saw the film on two DVDs; I bought the second part by accident and was confused a bit by it.
The second of a trilogy of spirituals by the noted composer, Jacques Wolfe, 'De Glory Road' is interpreted beautifully by Mr. Tibbett.
It is a little too much of the same at the beginning but the very funny second part makes up for that.
Now it's the Gorillas against Bugs on first, Bugs on second, Bugs on third, Bugs pitching, Bugs catching; and it's no match.
"Clear and Present Danger" is the second adaptation of a Tom Clancy novel to feature Harrison Ford as CIA agent Jack Ryan.
This blockbuster is an excellent adaptation of the novel by Tom Clancy , companion to Â¨The hunt for Red OctoberÂ¨ with Ford taking over the role of Ryan from Alec Baldwin and second part Â¨Patriot gamesÂ¨ again with Harrison Ford , who's becoming the king of trilogies .
But what Ford doesn't know is that, on orders from the revenge-minded Moffatt, his second deputy (Henry Czerny) and the president's national security adviser (Harris Yulin) have ordered a rogue officer named Clark (Willem Dafoe) in with a covert military team to put a huge dent in the cartel's activities.
And when Ford finds out about the operation, he finds himself going down to Colombia a second time to help spirit Dafoe and the covert team out of harm's way.
It doesn't help that a good number of them were speaking a second language, and at that knowing they're going to be overdubbed anyway.
Worst scene of the movie: The extended orgy scene wins hands down, with the climatic re- animation of the drowned baddies (can't reveal more than this) coming a close second.
I wasn't too crazy about the second movie.
The second one was not as good as the first one.
This film doesn't try to be like the first two, it's is own film just like the second was to the first.
After watching the first one, me and my friends were in the mood to watch another comedy, so we headed out to find the second "No Retreat, No Surrender."
In the second, on the same beach, the new wife is masterful with the crab, and this makes Gegauff miss the 1st wife's now - endearing fear.
However, the real question this second act is this: If he makes a decision, what will it be based on?
Practically all my fellow IMDb-users are full of praise for this sequel to Ringu, but I don't second these opinion.
With the feel of hope at the end of the first one fading away in the second film.
It's definitely one of the best recent horror sequels I've seen, but then again it doesn't feel like a sequel as it seems to fit in like it was the second half of the original's story.
His wife, DaniÃ¨le Gegauff, plays second fiddle somewhat to her co-star, but also puts in a very good and believable performance.
Especially if the second movie, as is  the case with 'Ring 2', serves the purposes of explaining the  background further from the first movie.
Hence her characterization of one of the  victims is quite unbelievable, not to mention that she became a  second 'video ghost' herself.
Ring 2 isn't a sequel--it's the second half of the same story.
Kurahashi Masami, as far as I've read, wasn't there when Ooishi Tomoko died, so I'm not sure what will happen later in the novel, and how Masami became so central in the second half.
kills his wife on a cemetery, in his real live (just a few years after the movie) he was stabbed to death by his second wife, on Christmas' Eve.
As I haven't viewed a single scene from the original second instalment (written and directed by JÃ´ji Iida), it's impossible for me to say if it was deserving enough of its incredibly poor critical and public reception to be completely erased from the continuity of the series (although some who saw it commented that they would rather have watched Sadako's cursed videotape instead).
As in 'The Spiral', pop star Miki Nakatani, who was essentially a cameo in 'Ring' (despite being billed second), is elevated to the lead here.
Unlike Rasen/Spiral, Ringu 2 is so close in tone to Ringu that it seems more like a "second half" than a sequel.
I think she was at her best in "A Woman's Face" and "Possessed" (the second one) which show what she could really do.
The plot takes second stage but, honestly, the incredible acting performances will make you feel that a more complicated plot would be absolutely unnecessary.
Holy crap, this is the funniest movie ever made, and my number #3 favorite movie of all time (second to The Fellowship of the Ring and the Two Towers, of course).
As Mr. Igoe, Vernon Wells, a.k.a, The Campiest Villain Ever (as seen in Commando), manages to be genuinely chilling and scary for the second and last time in his career as a bad guy (the first was Mad Max 2), while Robert Picardo is painfully funny as the Cowboy; on an added note, his method of seducing women in nightclubs using an imaginary lasso does NOT work in real life.
I've just watched both the pilot and the second episode.
The second episode was better than the first, and the show definitely has potential to do better than it's currently doing.
Anyway, the script by Zacarias, David Lee Fein & F. Amos Powell really is as crazy & bizarre as it sounds, at least it shows a lot of imagination & it clearly has the intention of trying to fill every last second of screen time with some bizarre situation.
Seen almost entirely from the female perspective, Xu's second directed feature is a finely chiselled piece of work.
Overall, it's a nice movie for Xu as her second movie as both the director and the leading actress.
Try as she might, Woody Allen's second wife, Louise Lasser, understudy in the original Broadway production, could never quite match Elaine May when it came to sheer J.
So he hires loser-type Harry Berlin (Jack Lemmon) to become Ellen's second husband.
Lemmon's facial expression when he considers this alternative for a very long second is priceless, but sadly those moments are rare.
Rent buy or borrow (as I did from the Library) this visually and auditory treat...I loved every second.
One is a nurse, the second a girl scout, and the third his Phantom Brother.
What ever happened to the first stage (hippy) and second (sports and disasters) phases of his career?
In a world where the vast majority of "great entertainment" is hyped up bullsh*t and mediocrity, a passing fad at best that sours on your second taste if not turning bitterly toxic, George Carlin is a man who shows us what real, adult comedy should be: a mixture of cleverly constructed fun and intelligent material that makes you think about our comically tragic existence.
The second thing is that he changes the structure around one base topic, suicide, and one wonders if this will be for the entire length or if there will be a switch to another topic or not.
Native Americans lived in community groups and we lived more as individuals, which is why it's no surprise that a mythic individual played more of a role in relegating Native Americans to second class status, however inadvertent, than any collective group of Americans, at least in popular culture and entertainment: William F. Cody.
Certainly the second World War in 1940 gave the audiences some real interest.
He is the second member of a secret society (of which Alan Dinehart is the head) to die.
The only bad side is the second part with speculations about the future.
The second one was after I've studied cinema and writing scripts, that when I discovered how this show had it all, so every episode of the reruns was such a lesson about how to make a classic work and a great amount of entertainment too.
I'm just glad I had a second chance to appreciate what a brilliant and fun show this was.
it has no relation to lock stock,its far more left field than that watch this film its great.also the acting is superb charlot Coleman's last film before she tragically died saw a performance second to none.
The second that Adrien Brody ran past Bill Murray in slow motion running toward the train as The Kinks' "This Time Tomorrow" kicked in, my heart started racing at the idea that I was about to watch a new film by Wes, which I look at as something special that comes every few years.
Our seats were second row-center and those rows were very narrow!
the end message is excellent to all those who examine every second they exist: dont look inward at yourself; look outward at the world and enjoy its splender.
This is one of those rare movies that you can't wait to see a second time because you want to laugh at how bad it was.
(7) This is the second movie I have ever seen by James Toback and I found his style of filmmaking to be an acquired taste (much like that of Paul Thomas Anderson).
The second tells him not to trust the first because, if the priest kills himself, he will go to hell; suggesting- is an eternity of suffering in the afterlife worth sparing him a few minutes of agony in his current life?
The second movie totally ignored the end of the first one, and wrote out the entire human cast.
This series should have ended after the second movie, it did not bring any closure for me.
The second movie was... decent at least.
Compared to the second movie that is.
The second movie was about humans discovering the concept of vampirism and the third was about vampires on lose in Romania.
As their orchestrated Gothic horror music is quite simply second to none.
The woman Jason London was looking for in his cross country journey during this movie, and who was a part of the second movie "Elizabeth Blaine" played by actress Diane Neal.
I saw the second one..........I adored Stephen Billinton as Dracula.
But the second Dracula made no sense with the first one....so I didn't really like that one.
Rasen is supposedly closer to the second Ring novel, but 1999's Ringu 2 is seen as more or less the "official" Ringu sequel.
We finally unravel much of the mystery behind Sadako (although there are a lot of questions that could still be answered), and gain insight into some of the events and comments in the first two-thirds of the film, which otherwise can seem cryptic (it pays to rewatch the first hour after the film is over--I enjoyed it more the second time).
However, I returned to the Phoenix film festival for a second viewing of the film (with all my friends in tow) for an entirely different reason.
Once again, he doesn't disappoint; Priestly kept me laughing every second, often without saying a word.
The second is the scene with Piper and Jen at the beach.
Had this scene contained an assortment of people walking the beach, I wouldn't have given a second thought to a pair of legs blocking the camera for a second and in fact I probably would have heralded it as a stroke of brilliance on the part of the director for drawing me more deeply into the scene.
sorry, but i recommend to see forgetting Sarah Marshall a second or even a third time instead.
There is a sense of going through the motions with everything that happens in the second part of the narrative.
On a technical level the film is second to none, which makes it all the more of a let down that it contains no real ideas about anything.
Certainly one of the most original and offbeat horror films to come out in a long time, this one almost demands a second viewing just to appreciate the imaginative production design, and a third just to catch all the throwaway gags (a sign reads "Road To Nowhere" and, in smaller letters, "Don't Buckle Up.
Good cast, too, with Patric Bergin being perfectly enigmatic in the first half, perfectly imposing in the second.
The decide to follow through a secondary road, and while fueling their car in "Sam's Last Chance" gas station, they are advised by the owner and attendant Sam (Richard Farnsworth) to not sleep after the second tree in the road.
It is tricky to go through all the things that make this film great, every second was mind blowing and it is near impossible to put into words how good this film is.
Tom Wilson's harassed trainer, who expertly pits himself against the seemingly hopeless Keaton, supplies much of the comedy in the second half until the star unexpectedly turns the tables in a grand climax especially written for the film.
There is a brief vivid moment when Alfred, bewildered and worn out, turns his face aside into the arms of his second with such a hopeless little air that instead of a laugh, it raised a murmur of pity from the auditorium.
In that split second, you just knew that Johnny deserved whatever he got.
The second part has to do with the Callum gang (headed by Grant Â played by an amazingly sinister Dean Jagger) that tries to kill Michum on his wedding night at the old Rand ranch.
He never quite made it, but Harry Carey, Jr. in only his second film before he was 'introduced' in Three Godfathers, certainly has had one long and successful career.
The Rimmer actor was written out in the second episode: 'Stoke Me A Clipper', when Rimmer leaves to become Ace Rimmer.
**SPOILERS*** Hired assassin John Baron, Frank Sinatra, saw just how futile the "hit-Job", that he and his fellow hired killers who were paid up to $500,000.00 each, was to assassinate the President of the United States;"A second after he's shot he'll be replaced by someone else so what's the purpose of killing the President anyway"?
If two runners in a race were less than a second apart at the finish, the lesser wouldn't be considered crap, just not as good.
The detective came back to that house the second time, and went directly to the place where the box was stored.
How did the detective know about this box the second time, and if he already knew about it, why didn't he take it the first time?
It is only the second silent film that, not only brought tears to my eyes, but overfilled them, until almost bawling.
Second, Outlander is an action movie first and everything else second.
Additionally, some flashback scenes in the second half of the film that explore Kainan's "home" planet are very cool to behold.
The second wasn't nearly as good, with a less original plot and more attention spent on special effects (the aliens) than plot details.
After the second Zenon, I never planned on having to sit through another disappointing remake on an originally perky and fun theme.
second, this program shows how parenting has changed over the last decade or so.
Sinatra simply refused to be a villain (except once - more in a second).
On second thought, could MTV be featuring these screwed-up and nasty kids as a public service so the rest of us can avoid them?
Fortunately, we've also got the incomparable Vic Morrow on board hamming it up with his customary deliciously eye-rolling rip-snorting gusto as a crusty, macho, rough'n'tumble Robert Shawesque old sea salt fisherman sporting Vic's trademark furry mustache and a simply sidesplitting "won't fool you for a second" overripe Scottish accent ("I've been killin' sharks for most of my life!").
Worse, the film repeats a good many of its incidents and effects twice or more: the idiotic 'explosion' when the shark attacks from below; the heroine Â played by the director's own lovely daughter Â falling into the sea, where she's not so lucky the second time around; the dives by would-be expert shark-fighter Vic Morrow Â complete with heavy Irish brogue a' la Robert Shaw's Quint from the first JAWS Â to destroy the creature both fail miserably, the second time getting tangled up in ropes and being dragged Ahab-like by the shark; characters get bitten in halfÂto say nothing of the ultra-fake blue-eyed[!]
Antonio Margheriti's KILLER FISH (1979; which is one I'd also love to get a second opinion of after all these years).
During the second half, a bunch of brave (but very stupid) people try to destroy the shark themselves.
Hence the second viewing with the less obtrusive though inaccurate ones.
My second doesn't have to do with the movie, but the DVD.
Today I finished watching it for second time through.
***********Spoilers*********************  TOZ is the second only to 36th chamber when it comes to making a Buddhist monks look badass.
The surface story about a poor student skilled in the ways of tactical warfare, who helps a master swordswoman and her bodyguard overcome the shame and dishonor of her father's murder at the hands of corrupt officials, gives way to a spiritual journey of enlightenment, making this an adventure film of the best kind, where the violence is only second place to the inner journey of the protagonist.
I came upon this film by accident, I looked for it on video, someone offered me a second generation copy for US$80!
I intend to see this movie again in a near future and reevaluate it, trying to see if it becomes clearer after a second time.
The second switches tempo, with amazing martial arts action focusing on the fugitive Ku and her friends.
He is having a writer's block while writing his second.
In time, in his second novel, Lorenzo will have to face his child, named Luna after the full moon.
Elena's anonymous friend uses a lighthouse as his icon; like a lighthouse, he shows her how to change her course, they meet for the second time in front of the island's lighthouse.
And the end isn't just an end, it's a second chance, a resurrection, an "advantage".
I would be grateful if they came out with a second expansion.
I think that a filmmaker who decides to make a slasher flick has two choices : having a lot of faith on the screenplay and to trust that he found a new perspective for making that formula interesting or making a completely mercenary film which is full of clichÃ©s for finally making a cheap movie.The crappy film Steel Trap belongs to the second style.The slasher films became popular thanks to Halloween (1978) and Friday the 13th and,since of that,we have seen hundred of movies with similar structures,characters and story.The details change,so every slasher movie tries to be different by using a curious location or a new mask,just to mention two examples.I do not pretend to find a lot of originality on slasher films but what I pretend to find is even the minimum effort for giving the known formula a special element,making it interesting and entertaining.Steel Trap could have chosen that difficult point but,instead of risking,director and co-screenwriter Luis CÃ¡mara and co-screenwriter Gabrielle Galanter wasted that opportunity so Steel Trap is a tedious experience with an extremely weak screenplay,repulsive characters,a boring and generic killer without any personality and a forced and arbitrary ending.I usually do not like to criticize an independent film from my favourite genre but,even on some incompetent works (like Return to Sleepaway Camp),I appreciate some energy and enthusiasm which on some way compensate some fails of the movie.But Steel Trap does not even have that.Plus,to add more negative things,CÃ¡mara's direction is completely insipid.In other words,it seems nobody involved on this movie was really interested on it.The characters are so repulsive that I was glad when the killer started to kill them.Steel Trap is a very crappy film.This is one of that movies in which I feel I really lost the time with it and that's the worst sin a movie can make.If you wanna see a very good modern slasher flick,I recommend you the Norwegian movie Fritt Vilt.Skip Steel Trap,a very bad horror film.
anyone who doesn't get the real truth behind the portrayals here should take an honest second look and gauge the film outside of their own bitterness at the issues underlying it.
Her eventual slide into the monstrosity of the first and second Ring films is a sight to behold (and, hardcore fans will note, is echoed by a similar fall of Ando Mitsuo in the less popular Rasen).
Sanjay Leela Bhansali's best film to date is Black and I would say Saawariya is the second.
And lastly if the movie had a better ending or a more developed ending, I would say that this perhaps could have been the best Indian Movie i have ever seen...but still i think its second to SLB's Devdas!!!!
I would say he is the second CHow-YUN FAT.
I enjoyed every second of it.
The second purpose has not been discovered yet."
Plenty of other ways to highlight Tok's love for pop culture, the Metal Slug reference for example... All it was was a few second verbal reference and it had me smiling.
The second game was my least favourite, but brilliant.
Both are act without remorse or second thoughts, are highly effective and completely relentless.
An incidental visit by Tok to her video store, and a second job cleaning O's apartment begins a chain of events that puts her in the middle of these two professional killers rivalry.
There's always a second chance in Monkey Island (and in most LucasArts games!)
(Play the second and third one to see who he is!)
While younger viewers may not know of Vincent, or wonder why anyone cares about a "second rate actor", there was a time when many movie fans felt that Vincent could have been a major box office draw.
The second hilarious thing is the spider itself.
It was full of clichÃ©s and rubbish effects (the budget was so obviously spent half way through so the second half is more cardboard cut outs than CGI's) The square looking college journalist who's obsessed by UFO's can't get a break with her editor.
The DVD comes with a load of extra's that do this unsettling but beautiful film justice, including a second feature film by Giusseppe Andrews, "Jacuzzi Rooms", which is a daring as the main feature, but totally different in style.
With limited screen time in the second half of the picture, George Macready as the prosecuting attorney, and Barry Kelley as Judge Drake offer solid support to the courtroom drama, particularly Kelley who's called upon to rein in the opposing lawyers who viciously snipe each other.
The second is his masterful IN A LONELY PLACE, his second film with Humphrey Bogart--and in this one he *is* in the center stage, featuring probably the most complex and darkest role of his career.
Ray once said that during this film he "took the gun away from Bogart's hands," and by the time they re-teamed for the second and last time, their professional relationship had ripened to friendship.
What's worst here is that The Hulk plays second fiddle to the blind lawyer, not even appearing in the (overly silly) climax.
Giving herself to the second and third convicts to protect her girls, Sarah is raped and sodomized in the barn.
An underrated time dislocation episode about an aging stage actor (Brian Aherne) in an unhappy second marriage to a much younger floozey who finds himself extremely nostalgic about his past.
Now, if only Gatchaman II, the second series, were available subbed or dubbed...
The second is in Canada, where a porn star infection comes to a peaceful conclusion ... almost.
The second tale narrower in scope but is the most fascinating of the three.
In Canada, the second rate porn actor Denys (Shawn Ashmore) hides from his director and colleagues that he is HIV positive using the blood of his sick father for the tests required by the production.
In the first one, poverty associated to the ignorance and greed sentences the dwellers of a village; in the second, selfishness and need of money infects at least eight actors and actresses of the porn industry; in the last one, ignorance and lack of resources doom the poor people to the disease.
The second one is of a tremendous dark humor, and I do not know whether the intention of the director / writer Thom Fitzgerald is to criticize the earlier cash of life insurance.
This is the second time my wife and I have viewed this film and we think it's a perfect Christmas film.
I have seen this film twice and liked it even more the second time around.
A couple of porn stars, a few second class comedians, a rapper, a mediocre pop star, a tattooed hoodlum metal head and a bunch of questionable (and most probably insane ) personalities in the opposition, are just not enough to make a political statement about freedom of speech.
They try to f*** with Miss Manners, which didn't impress me at all, as she could have wiped the floor with any of the interviewers but was just too polite to tell them to go back to the second grade.
"The Drunkard" set-piece occupies a good deal of the second half: a hoary melodrama which the troupe performs with gusto - with Fields as the mustachioed and hissable villain of the piece who, at one point, reprises the immortal line from his short THE FATAL GLASS OF BEER (1933) "'T ain't a fit night out for man nor beast".
The first adjective may be apt; the second certainly is not.
I liked every second of this film.
Every second means each second.
That resolution could've been expressed much better way- but unfortunately the movie fumbled in the second half.
There are some moments where one or other actors does not feel awkward but this movie has wonderful drive and you will get bored even for one second.
- especially since I haven't watched these films for what seems like ages - but I won't be doing so immediately, given that a second set is actually coming in March; that said, of the 10 films included, only 1 will be a first-time viewing for me - THE DAWN PATROL (1938) - but it would still be great to have these childhood favorites readily available on the new medium (rather than in the worn, and often colorized, prints I've had to make do with up till now)!
But, beggars can't be choosers, and I like this second round of Boys Town almost as much as the first.
I think I started watching somewhere in the second season, but I think it's a pity I didn't see it before.
Bill Dwyer and Will Sasso fill the screen during their supporting acts as second fiddle characters, but ensure that they will forever be remembered with quality timing and happily making the film fun to watch and enjoy.
Traditionally the second best, or certainly most popular, pay-per-view in the professional wrestling calendar, the WWE's Royal Rumble is best loved for its 30 man, cross brand (15 wrestlers from each of RAW and Smackdown) main event.
WWE Championship Edge vs. John Cena 7/10: Good match, probably the second best match of the night, great to see John Cena win after making Edge tap out to the STFU to capture his WWE Championship back.
So once again wwe relies on shock value for the second pay per view running in order to be a success.
This film follows the well trodden path of an ageing hit-man (John J) sent on what may well be his last job in Argentina which also sets the backdrop for a second stand of the story: John J's love of Tango.
However, he has a second life, being a hit-man.
The second is the attraction of the beautiful and quite exotic Tango for Europeans and North Americans.
I was hoping that Zach would knock her upside the head with one of the paddles during the water challenge in the second to last episode.
But Dixie Lee only made a handful of films, as leads and second leads, and some of them have been lost.
(They don't even think for half a second that they may have misunderstood what they overheard; they just overreact and run away.
After all this time, I decided to give the film a second try mainly because it stars Jude Law, a great actor that usually does the kind of films I like, emotional dramas, often very character-driven, about relationships and the human nature.
"Breaking and Entering" is another great movie of Anthony Minghella that explores the theme of second chance in life through a dramatic triangle of love of the needy lead character and the maternal love of two mothers.
I look forward to this film coming to town again so I can see it a second time after post-production.
The second laugh is Johnny getting his son hopped up on red bull so he can use the same skill Evan uses for his business predictions.
Against any common sense, I decided to watch another family comedy starring Eddie Murphy.On my defense, I had two excuses to do that.The first one is that Imagine That is co-written by Ed Solomon and Chris Matheson, responsibles for Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure and its sequel.The second excuse is my continuous apology for Murphy, who I keep considering to be a great comedian, even though he keeps wasting his talent on atrocities like Norbit and Daddy Day Care.Well, unfortunately, Imagine That is another atrocity in his career.
The second but the most important thing which made me laugh but in two halves was the effects: its the 21st century and it made me feel sick to watch a computer generated crocodile super-imposed onto the screen so badly when movies in the 30's had better effects than this trash!
We both liked the first one, so of course we are going to watch the second.
It also brings sharply to mind that this young girl, Jill Kinmont's fate could so easily in a split second be our own, resulting from a sports injury, car accident, or whatever.
The second example is when the sheriff's son, the girl he likes, and the girl's 'boyfriend' find a crocodile's nest and (of course) the retarded boyfriend starts crushing eggs, making a bad joke like "I know what kind of egg this is.
Well Pirates of the Caribbean is first then Dark Prince The True Story of Dracula is the second.
And, while all this doesn't seem very original, remember that KING KONG was second--this was the first film of its type and so it deserves a lot of kudos and recognition for its place in film history.
Not only is "Phantasm IV: Oblivion" an unworthy sequel to the brilliant first, and cool second part, it is not even a worthy sequel to the, already poor, "Lord Of The Dead".
OK, mabe only second best behind a certain Speilberg movie, but the first real classic.
The first time I watched this I hated it, the second time I loved it, I don't know why, and now every time I watch it I love it, I guess the first time I just didn't like it.
L'Amore is divided into two parts, the first called "A Human Voice", and the second named "The Miracle".
The second episode, more cryptic and stronger, shows us a medieval Italian town with all its beliefs and supersticions.
The second part is a devastating fairy tale.
Lafe McKee probably should have been shot for his in some small Western, the name of which I can't remember, and Marlon Brando's, in "Viva Zapata" was the second worst.
We similarly understand that Ray is having second thoughts about getting married.
My second Chaney film!
It has a decadent atmosphere but it is the twisted second half of the oeuvre that gives to the film, if it is possible, more boldness, darkness and evil, not to mention that it is always a pleasure to check up again and again on this wonderful and terrible circus troupe, surely a collection of the most hideous, complicated and malicious people found in the whole silent world..  And now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must join such a strange and perverse circus troupe.
Gina Chiarelli shines in a stunning performance as Grace, a schizophrenic woman who believes the second coming of Christ is imminent.
I don't find his character or any of the other players here believable for one second.
Blinded by the partially self created rejection of his mate (the marriage's failure is entirely played out in one 30 second curbside scene and has as little credibility than Josh's subsequent "dates"), Josh meets nothing but sleazoids or those who have not yet "gotten their acts together."
"Dev" is Govind Nihalani's second commercial venture this time with superstar Amitach Bachchan.
It takes a little thinking and it's not a movie you can really understand immediately, so I will advise a second viewing if needed, it may make you appreciate the movie more.
A superficial influence that even in the form of a marriage or mad love, play a second role in the eyes of these modern men.
The one character I liked was Rakesh...the mixture of neither feeling he belongs in America fully, but at the same time knowing he cant go back, and dealing with both realizations is indeed something many expats go through (altho' I haven't heard the term second class citizen too many times these days).
The manner in which Dutt has addressed the feelings of immigrants, who see themselves as "second class Americans", is praiseworthy.
Right after that, we go to a charming funeral scene where a daughter slaps her father and that is hilarious, really the only entertaining second of the film.
I have foolishly viewed far too many of these "8 films to die for" DVD's, from both the first go-round & the second.
Easily one of the worst of the second crop of "8 films to die for" that I've seen thus far (I've seen 4 of them including this)   Eye Candy: Malea Richardson provides the T&A   My Grade: D-
The answer to the second is a bit more difficult and easy.
While okay to watch once, I was not that thrilled the second time around.
the second time for a first-degree murder.
Stumped Police Inspector Grumbach(Roger Rudel)questions Helen after a second murder of a local girl married to a teacher she knows, Leon(Mario Beccara),bleeds upon the head of a student after a field trip into a cavern looking at prehistoric paintings.
There's a disconnect emotionally that is left open, thus, going into the second half of the film, where finally we see what some of us would be waiting for: the serial killer plot.
It's a Lew Ayres movie in which James Cagney, (In only his second movie), is amongst the great supporting cast and based on this performance it was easy to see the star in the making.
Also, this was only the second film for Jimmy Cagney.
Though he drops a couple of notches in the screen credits from his first picture, "Sinners' Holiday", James Cagney still dazzles as a top mobster's second in command and hones the skills that will find him topping the bill for 1931's "The Public Enemy".
Hot Rod Horror - the second on the double bill - is the complete opposite.
All that aside, "Radio Days" is, second of all, a look at Allen's childhood memories weaved together by radio.
The second comment after about an hour was that this movie is scarier than any slasher flick that we've seen.
The first half of the movie didn't really contain a story, which can be OK (see "Dude where's my car"), but in the second half they suddenly tried to make a story, in which they failed big time.
I'd give the first half a 7, and the second half a 1, which leaves me with a 4.
All these political miscalculations by Kerry and the Democratic Party had GW Bush voted in for a second term by the majority of the American voters which in retrospect turned out to be against, for most of those who voted for him, their best interest!
That said, "Get Carter" is probably one of Stallone's better films of the last ten years (I think it's second to "Cop Land").
The second shows the memories of a police detective by means of a flashback that takes place within the confines of a footprint in the dirt.
Fritz Langs film work work particularly "M" (a film about a child molester and Serial Murderer) made a profound impression on the Work of Hitchcock .It would be a strange coincidence that in his Last American Film Friz Lang Would Pay Homage to him in "Beyond Reasonable Doubt" This film has all the trademarks of the latter Hitchcock s films and is greatly enhanced by the great use of film montage of German Expressionist Films to which Hitchcock learned his trade and made a point of his style This Film has been Remade four times as recently as 2009 and the second even starred Novello himself however there's is no comparison There are some who say Hitchcock was always a bit of a silent film director with his use of great lengthy scenes without dialogue, and if you watch this u can see why everything in the stories plot comes across clear as a bell its not a dodgy DW Griffith with too much montage to millions of Credit cards to Tell you whats happening, you can see exactly whats going on, you can tell when something horrible is going to happen to the sweet blond victim , and you are given that same 'suspend belief' that's in all the Great Hitchcock Films of his Golden Period .
Its a Silent film but as the voyeur you can still see everything that goes on you are looking through a crack in the floor of a second story apartment at a "Killer" Passing above your head waiting to strike,
Mention should also be made of Paula Cale as Dean's first wife, Bettya and to Kate Levering as Dean's second wife, Jeanne.
Matthau a close second: "Snap to, fly boys!"
The choice of Aulin, a Twiggy lookalike who can't act, was the filmmakers' first misstep--Henry's flimsily constructed script is the second.
Script and cast will always play second fiddle to the director's showmanship.
The second - directed by Sean Cunningham ("A Stranger is Watching" and "Friday the 13th") is a lame-ass "ghost story" set in Japan that makes no sense.
To preserve my dignity- and see if it really was an epileptic thing, I attended the second screening, and am happy to say I survived- didn't faint or feel feverish throughout all the five stories, and enjoyed it quite a bit.
This tale is as creepy as the second and marks some good work by special effects expert John Gaeta ("The Matrix") in a sound directing debut.
On second thoughts, the gangster boss here is NASTIER than anything in the Godfather.
What always impresses me about Zhang Yimou's *Shanghai Triad* is how the two settings of the film -- the Thirties-era, glitzy nightclub milieu of the gangsters in Shanghai and the pastoral scene in the second half -- are used as a counterpoint to the drama unfolding before us.
This is a good film, but I would have liked to see the plot move in a different direction in the second half.
The production design, costumes, lighting and camerawork are all quite remarkable - creating stunning images from the opulence of Shanghai's nightclubs and mansions to the simplicity of the rural island where the second half of the film takes place.
This was my third time viewing the film - the first as an extra on Image's DVD of the Silent version of THE CAT AND THE CANARY (1927) and the second on TCM, as part of a Harold Lloyd marathon in anticipation of the release of this same 7-Disc collection, when I was in Hollywood late last year; actually, I liked it better this time around, hence I upped the rating from **1/2 (besides, back then, I wasn't as familiar with the star's short films as I am now)!
Don't know why you've given so low score to this movie.... eventhough it's for tv only i think it's one of the most serious movies of the new generation it deals with the most scary subject of our ages "EASY MONEY" I've just loved it...... give to "Big shot" a second shot plz  c ya :D
I love this movie, makes me cry from the second I start watching.
He was going to get married, but Linda, his fiancÃ©', doesn't show up, and finally confronts him saying that she was having second thoughts.
Even the split second skits are hilarious.
The tentacles on the sprinkler impale one kid's chest, rip the shin off the second kid and tear open the head of the third kid.
Take the first, second, and third seasons of Family Guy, which are well-scripted and still very funny.
The quality of animation in some bits is inspiring, and the breadth of what they are spoofing is amazing, you know your truly geek if you can figure out most of even the most esoteric (look up word if you don't know what it means, because it actually is ) references  Season 2   There are some gems in season two, however due to the fact that the DVD is uncensored, it makes it a bit more harsh, especially because most of the time we know what they're saying the overuse of the word douche seems to be without a doubt lack of a thesaurus in scripting, yes as immature as it can be, it's still kind of a funny word , but not used as a crutch the way most of the fart jokes come across, which there seem to be more in the second season than in the first, even though I don't think there really are in season two.
And when the creators are brave enough to stop suckling on pop cultures nurturing teat for a few seconds, we often are left a 5 (or less) second clip of something so creatively dull and brain dead the only plausible reaction is that of total silence.
The first was "Street of Dreams" which she sang at the very beginning, and the second was "Don't Break My Heart" which Emmy sang at the end.
The first of the three was really good and really dark and dramatic, the second one was just as good but seemed more like a comedy than a drama, and the third one was just plain weird.
the second movie is good too, but theres a little too much darkness in it, with the evil boy at camp and everything.
Yesterday I saw "Mortal Thoughts" for the second time.
Even seeing this movie for the second time, it is very worthwhile and recommended.
a group of second graders could do a better job at acting.
However, if on the one level wecan see her rejecting the father figure, on the second level we can witness desire as the film maker is practically possessing the hero statue which she finds in a basement of a museum.
a group of second graders could do a better job at acting.
I loved every second of this movie; every awkward pause, every song,(especially the use of the phil collins song in the bar.. i don't even like phil collins.. just thought it was perfect) and every line of dialogue.
I've watched this film twice and even though the I knew what was going to happen, seeing it a second time was just as heart-wrenching and touching.
The second scene involves a character who's name I cannot remember (and an actor who should go back to waiting tables), so we'll just call him Annoying Fool from now on.
On the whole a movie you can watch once but might get bored in the second half.
However, the second half is where we see some originality, and ironically, the most original scenes are the most entertaining.
- Some very entertaining original parts, especially in the second half.
This is a movie for indie filmmakers first, and lovers of the 'artsy, ambitiously creative little budget movies' second.
Overall, a feeble attempt to squeeze money out of a concept which could have been a theatrical blockbuster if executed correctly but instead became a lackluster second rate action film, which this series pilot does nothing to improve upon...
Everyone deserves a second chance, but I deserve to die now.
Unfortunately, the second Miami Vice movie, Miami Vice II: The Prodigal Son (actually it was just a collection of the shows) which takes place in New York (and this second movie model the scenes for Glenn Frey's "You Belong to the City," which appears on the Miami Vice soundtrack and Frey made a few appearances as well).
"Tomorrow is Yesterday" is the second episode that deals with a time-travel premise.
On second thought maybe less a Second Amendment love song than a La Leche league membership drive.
Only major criticism other than to suspend belief for 97 minutes (or was 97 the number of bodies in the second warehouse scene)...a child in danger.
I heard from a friend of mine at the Chicago Tribune (she's female, and you'll see why that matters in a second) and she said, "It was so stupid!
There are several contrivances, and truthfully they were rewriting the script as it was being filmed due to Bale's demands, but all in all (and all things considered), this is an enjoyable film that not only is better on second viewing, but manages to ingratiate itself into the library of Terminator franchise films (or will when it's out on DVD in an unrated, extended director's cut edition, that is).
TERMINATER: SALVATION is truly an abomination to the franchise - and don't for one second suspect otherwise.
I suppose it was the rave comments of so many that drew me back for a second viewing.
and second, that which is subtle... underlying.
The second, a pregnant woman who's husband seems to be getting more and more spooked as the idea of a child coming into their home becomes closer to a reality.
Have a look and then a second; it's well worth the time.
I'm only on to the second season, but this show is now one of my favorite anime!
i've also ordered a second copy just in case i wear this one out.
I guess it was the second Huey helicopter crash with John Connor as both pilot and sole passenger that did it for me (it seems the U.S. army hasn't surplused any twin-engined Hueys yet, because Hollywood is still flying leftovers from "Apocalypse Now", even in the future).
The second part is the storming of the prison by the police.
Although it flows pretty well, the feel and sytle of the film seem to change in the second half.
But those are in all the films, even the second has some.
"Dallas" fans must have enjoyed the inside joke at the beginning of this second reunion movie for the popular CBS primetime soap: Bobby is shown in his famous Dream Season shower scene, turning around and saying hello -- but it's Sue Ellen he's greeting!
Julie Delpy makes an impressive first work as a director in 2 Days in Paris,a great movie.The best thing about this movie is,no doubt,the screenplay because it makes very intelligent commentaries about the modern relationships and it also has brilliant dialogs.I would say this movie is a twist between Annie Hall and Before Sunset,because it has the intelligent humor of the first one and the brilliant dialogs from the second one.Delpy makes a pretty good performance but Adam Goldberg really surprised me.This actor made a perfect performance and he does not seem to be acting at all and I think that's the greatest achievement of any actor.The only fail I found on this movie is that some scenes are a little bit pretentious.2 Days in Paris is a brilliant movie I truly enjoyed.I totally recommend it.
Lust for a Vampire is the second in a trilogy of Hammer films known throughout filmdom as the "Karnstein Trilogy."
Neil on the other hand remembers every second of what happened and has let that take control of his life.
'Lust for a vampire' is the second film in the Karnstein Trilogy based on the novels by Sheridan le Fanu.
The second season I am sure covered another topic, but I don't really remember.
I do hope they put out the second season just so I can complete my thoughts on the show.
A menagerie of persons converge at the Black Raven hotel, run by a man who makes a second living helping criminals escape over the US/Canadian border.
This done to death premise should have worked, even by PRC standards, but the second half of the film just consists of the characters running all over the hotel and basically by the film's end, the audience has to feel disinterested.
This is the second film loosely based on the story "Carmilla" and "The Vampire Lovers" was the first and "Twins of Evil" being the third.
"Lust for a Vampire" is the second in Hammer's Karnstein vampire trilogy.The other two were "The Vampire Lovers" and "Twins of Evil".Carmilla Karnstein is revived in a black magic ceremony and enrolls into an exclusive girls' school.Novelist Richard LeStrange is visiting the area in search of the truth behind the legends surrounding nearby Castle Karnstein and falls in love with Mircalla.
And, the second half improves over the first.
The second disappointing thing was the witty dialogue.
This is most definitely the single best movie that is available out there (however in a close second, check out Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Gene Wilder is astounding).
Once, when it was first released on TV in the late 50s or early 60s; and a second time, in the early 70s.
Its second theme Â and the one that ultimately trumps the first Â involves the rescue of a little black girl (and parallels, minus the cynicism, Billy Wilder's Ace in the Hole/The Big Carnival of the same year).
The English-dubbing is not too bad (even if the audio is, typically for this second Bava collection from Anchor Bay, regrettably low in spots), but I wish the option of listening to the original Italian soundtrack had been offered; at least, the latter is available on the Raro Video disc and, according to Bava authority Tim Lucas, that version actually includes several alternate takes (as well as an accompanying featurette) â and being currently discounted, I took the opportunity and picked up a copy for myself!
Never mind that it was the second of the three Best Picture winners produced by Irving G. Thalberg in a six-year span, "The Broadway Melody" (1929) and "Mutiny On the Bounty" (1935) being the other two.
To support them they included the best of their second string character actors such as Lewis Stone and Gene Hersholt to name but two.
Better the second time.
Not to ruin  things for other viewers, but the second time around you notice  subtle little things throughout that really ake the icing on the cake.
Alas, Dead Heist, while at least struggling to patch some back-story onto the main characters in the first half, totally abandons anything but pointless dialog in the second and forgets more or less what the heck is the point of a storyline anyway.
Others in the cast of this splendid film are Dorothy Malone giving an excellent performance as the singer and Chaney's first wife Cleva Creighton, Jane Greer as his second wife, Jim Backus as his press agent and Robert Evens as the boy wonder of the motion picture business Irving Thalberg.
Mired in cliches, this version is a couple of notches below the superior Judy Garland/James Mason 1954 remake and a couple of notches above the Barbra Streisand/Kris Kristofferson second remake (1976).
The second half has all of the comedic fireworks and is what makes the film memorable.
Now the second story begins to unfold.
My second time catching this and loving it even more.
One has a sledgehammer, the second has a pick ax, the third is equipped with a large chain, and the fourth is equipped with a jackhammer.
*Spoiler Alert*   While one of the ghouls yanks the person off their feet with the chain, the second and third then proceed to stab and smash with their sledgehammer and pick ax.
It also helps that there are two sets of villains, with the second, and possibly the most effective, not being very obvious until late in the film.
I was in my first or second grade, all the kids learned the tricks of cheating exams, well, not during the real exams, but to act like those kids in the movie.
But the second time we dared to make use of our teenage freedom, we went to this film.
"Mountain Patrol: Kekexili" is Chinese director Lu Chuan's second feature, set in the gorgeous titular Tibetan plateau where Tibetan antelopes were and are still being poached and mercilessly shot with their numbers dwindling from about a million to around 10,000 in the 1990s.
Apart from that, I don't have to add much to the other users' comments, but it can't be said often enough how much energy this film gains, first from the not-telling-but-showing technique of the portrayal of its characters; and second, from the way nature is depicted as it breaks the will even of these strong characters.
It starts out well but the second time he meets the aliens it just starts to get funny.
The second story which is kind of dull or more demanding depending on taste, follows a couple meeting up in many public locations.
The first has a clever climax; while the second deals with complex issues in a sombre way, leaving the third to close this dynamic in its own unique fashion.
The second, "The Benches of Paris," is the best.
The acting is great, especially Aurore Rauscher, the woman in the second section of the film.
Overall, this IS a very well done version, but if you have the patience for older TV miniseries, treat yourself to the 80s version, which is the most faithful to the book, especially by giving proper weight to the second half, which is where Bronte gets to sink her teeth into ethical and spiritual issues.
The second is the parting scene after the aborted wedding.
Stanwyck plays his crooked-nosed second wife, who eventually gets bombarded by clues that Bogey's first wife was poisoned and that he has the same in store for her.
"The Two Mrs. Carrolls" is the second screen pairing of Humphrey Bogart and Alexis Smith, and oddly, it's Smith's character who's the 'other woman' in both films.
It occurred the first time in 1945's "Conflict", but in that picture, it was Bogey's character who did the pursuing, while here, it's Cecily Latham (Smith) who intrudes on Geoffrey Carroll's marriage to the second Mrs. Carroll of the title.
The second little problem is with Bogart's character.
He's the centre of this story, a mentally disturbed and jealous painter who, it would appear, murdered his first wife (the first Mrs. Carroll) in order to marry the second, played very well by the beautiful Barbara Stanwyck.
The second Mrs Carroll gradually gets suspicious of his behaviour and eventually finds out what he did to his first wife and manages to call the police.
Easily one of the best films I've ever seen Shane Meadows and Paddy Considine team up for the second time and deliver one of the best movies of the decade, the scenery and gritty style of filming compliment each other perfectly.
He can go from calm and pleasant to truly menacing and back again in a second and it never seems hammy or over-egged.
Forget the critics and give Coneheads a second chance.
The first movie in the series what fantastic and the second was just horrible because they change the actors a little bit and now the 3rd movie in the series is just horrible.
The first movie in the series had a lot to tell about Bufford Pusser's life and the second in the series had just had few thing that really happened to Bufford but not enough to make it interesting and now the 3rd movie in the series is just horrible worst then the second one and this one doesn't tell anything real about Bufford life except for when he died at the end.
The second sequel is even worse; talky and drab, it exploits (in an almost cannibalistic way) the first movie by lifting and recreating the most famous sequences from it.
This last chapter is better built than the second and hence has a better rhythm.
I agree that certain elements of its narrative (particularly the pacing, as well as a few contrived interpersonal moments) felt tacked-on or inauthentic, and were perhaps invented to couch the story in a modern-day milieu that could appeal to audiences before "surprising" them with the political content of the film in its second half, as the mystery of the main character's history is unraveled.
Why does Mei-Ling accept him twice, the second time after he's humiliated her horribly*?
It's difficult to describe the movie without spoilers, and I do not want to spoil a single second of what is possibly the most powerful and emotionally wrenching film I have seen for a decade and more (made all the more powerful by the haunting music).
Maybe Hollywood film organizations and historians should take a second look.
I also recommend seeing it a second time.
JÃºlli's father, meanwhile, gets rich selling the nutritional supplement to U.S. soldiers based in Iceland and has a second rise to fame, representing Iceland in the Eurovision competition.... A Man Like Me is the precise kind of film that people attend independent screenings to see Â intelligent, funny, movie, and unknown to most people outside of Iceland, where it was a money-making hit....
Having re-watched it again over easter, I must say I was just bored and confused when we got to the second half of the movie.
This is the second greatest "run after freedom" movie i've ever seen.
Not only are the characters flat, uninteresting and virtually _all_ rip-offs of characters from The Office (including Leslie, who is a painfully unfunny Steve Carrell/Andy Gervais wannabe) - their second episode DIRECTLY STEALS from an episode of the TV show "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"!
I sat there thinking "I could have had more fun doing nothing at all....." So I thought maybe it was just one bad episode and gave it a second chance.
This show is something you need to Tivo to watch multiple times, as there are things that get funnier the second time around.
The second time I saw this movie I rolled laughing.
The second, and most important, is that I would rather live my life as happy and wonderful and comfortable with myself as I am and die at 50 than live until 108 always fighting to be someone I'm not.
The one thing that caught my eye about this film was the fact that she could be skinny one second and "fat" the next.
And even if (like me) you have to wait 9 years for a second viewing, I promise that its imagery will linger in your mind.
However, by the time I passed the second hour, I had had enough.
I decided to give Sherman's March a second try, and made it all the way through.
I saw that film when i studied films in england, i liked the director's techniques with his subjects.First of all he provokes them in order to get more informations from them, second he manages to become intimate to the viewer with his monologues that take the form of a confession.Many commented that his life is pathetic, maybe so, but it takes courage to expose to the public some very 'personal' moments.Many people might comment about the ethics of documentary, because sometimes he seems to abuse some of his subjects, or even mock them,i have a specific scene in my mind:When he interviews one of the so called patriots,inside a snack bar he pans his camera and while we listen to the 'patriotic credo' we watch another man dressed like a clown.I think this is a film that deserves to be seen because it is a prerequisite for people who enjoy BIG BROTHER and other similar assortments, that victimize their subjects sometimes to the extreme.Compared to those SHERMAN'S MARCH is very innocent much more entertaining though.8/10
Although I do not doubt for a second that elements of The Squid And The Whale are entirely fictional, the lesson to be learned here is that one need not create elaborate scenarios or effects in order to create compelling viewing.
And yes, they don't get the chemo formula right this time either, and thats for the second time (Someone needs to take these scientists out of the lab and fire them..
As a parenthesis, it's the second US movie I'm seeing tonight and in which the idea of the government covertly doing bad things is tacitly accepted in both of them.
Unfortunately can't say this for the second one.
Giuliano Carnimeo takes the directors chair and does a good of directing Fenech for the second time, after The Case of the Bloody Iris.
I watched it the first time and giggle a bit, I watched it the second time and laughed here and there, I watched it for the third time and laughed nearly all the way through!
The second reason, Sybil Danning who was Albert receptionist and was excellent at it.
She started off liking her second housekeeper Mrs Dimmick, even thought she would make a good companion as well as a good housekeeper, but soon found out that Mrs Dimmick was crossing her by trying to find out information about the former maid.
Also the very end with the wave sequences of both Julia and Julie shows the first as it really happened, and the second as she imagined it.
Exquisitely acted french film-noir with layers that increases at the second viewing ;-).
And even if it was him who chose the name: for him the girl might have been a second incarnation of his elder daughter.
For others it will seem endlessly mysterious and clever, even if requiring a kind of blindness to certain narrative conflicts (which may or may not be logically resolved by the end--I watched parts a second time to check).
The second half deals with their preparation for the auditions, and of course the climax.
This film owes a great deal of gratitude to the second collaboration between Francois Ozon and his leading lady, Charlotte Rampling.
It gets more complex in the second half and is quite difficult to understand the twists in the plot.
This is only my second taste of his work (the hilariously fabulous 'Sitcom' being the other), and if his backlog and future releases match the quality of the two films I've seen from him so far; he may well become one of cinema's all time greats.
The second has James Mason as a harsh ballet choreographer.
The second story, Mademoiselle, could have served as the inspiration for the Tom Hanks movie Big.
Vincente Minnelli did the second story, Gottfried Reinhardt directed the first and third.
In addition to that, I enjoyed: 1) the timing--the movie consists of three shorts and I appreciate the order in which the three are presented; 2) sense of humor--the second short is quite charming and I thought well written from a child's point of view--it avoids being an adult pretending to be a child; 3) long dance scenes--there must be several three minute scenes with no editing cuts (the music is so strong that whenever I hear a piece by Faure, if it's not the piece in this one scene it reminds me of it, that I must stop a few seconds because the memory is so alive); 4) the deep exploration of "what is right" --I not only appreciate the presentation of the two sides of every decision presented in all of the shorts, but also that a quick Hollywood solution is resisted; and finally 5) a young Kirk Douglas--which is the old fashioned manly-man.
The second is about as good and is a cute little fantasy involving a little boy who is magically transformed, temporarily, into an adult.
The second, with Leslie Caron, must rate at least a 7 for anyone who enjoys her, but her work in Lili outshines everything else she has done.
Yet on this second viewing I still felt it worth my time.
The delicacy of Shearer, Caron and Angeli with the differences in each of their coloring and bone structure, contrasts dramatically with their respective male leads, the forceful articulateness of Mason (given an incredibly weak script stilted and overwrought when compared to P & P's dialogue for Lermentov in "Red Shoes"), the boyish tenderness of Granger in the second segment, and the snappy personality of Douglas in the high wire segment.
The film's second half is better than its first, and I enjoyed the end quite a bit.
Well, it is obviously the second option.
The second one was the lead role given to Tiny Lister.
A second plot has the detective's step-son going to Vegas to get hitched and running afoul of the same vampire clan.
The best part about American Desi is that it is realistic and both first and second generation Indian-Americans can watch it and relate to it on a personal level.
The second half of the film was a bit of a letdown as the writer tried to resolve the issues in a quick fashion.
The first season ended with a huge mystery that they say will be explained when the second season opens.
The second jailhouse scene with the fruitcake lasts about 15 minutes, which is about 14 minutes too long.
The first I can understand, but who does he get to aid him in his second objective.
She is there for the embassy ball, and she even has a second night where she is in control of the trysting.
During the second third of the action, Gibson stages the incredible journey of hardship on foot that the villainous warriors and their captives take through the steaming jungle, across swollen rivers, and along sheer cliff sides to a faraway metropolitan Mayan city.
I spoke with many of my friends after seeing it the second time and told them about it.
life is too short to waste a second on this garbage.
how exactly is paying to keep people locked up, fed, clothed, and boarded for 31 years less of a burden on society than having a second kid?
Their crime: having a second child.
2017, a dystopian future, and US Army officer John Henry Brennick (Christopher Lambert) and his wife Karen S. Brennick (Loryn Locklin) are expecting a second child.
Strict one-child policies forbid any couples having a second child, but the Brennick's first child died at birth so they attempt to get away with a second pregnancy.
Marine Captain John Brennick & his wife, who is pregnant with her second child (the first died at birth), are caught at a checkpoint & sent to the Fortress, a secluded underground prison complex situated in the middle of a desert.
In the volitile political climate inside the US one can easily see how a regime could get out of hand and with the use of technology start mass imprisonments and keep inmates in line with thought control and torture, here for a second pregnancy.
Christophe Lambert portrays an ex-marine John Brennick who's wife Karen (played ably by Loryn Locklin) is expecting her second child.
John Brennick (a solid and engaging performance by Christopher Lambert) and his pregnant wife Karen (well played by the fetching Loryn Locklin) get arrested for trying to have a second child.
Getting sent to prison for having a second baby even though the first one died?
The second best thing was the background scenery.
I saw the uncut version on VHS and there are couple of over-the-top bloody shootings and two gory stomach explosions, of which the second is VERY gory.
The central characters are John and Karen Brennick - a couple sent to the Fortress after she becomes pregnant with a second child, thus breaking a futuristic population control law.
Don't you hate it when you search for a video of a band online and all you get is a twenty second clip taken from a cell phone video camera?
Tales From the Crypt's second feature is little more than a campy vampire tale.
I wondered whether there was a script or not for him, as he just kid of flows through the film with jokes in every second line..perhaps he adlibbed the whole thing.
"Bordello of Blood," the second "Tales From The Crypt" feature film, supplies the viewer with ample amounts of all of the above, leaving room for little else.
This is the second film from what it meant to be a trilogy.
If you rent a Tales From The Crypt movie, don't expect something very good... but I was a little dissapointed when I saw this, because I think Demon Knight is about one of the best horrors made, and I was surprised that their second film was far different than Demon Knight...
For instance: 1) the scene in the first part where Belldandy uses her magic - great timing and great music; 2) the scene in the second part where Urd appears (jumping out of the TV-set) - the change in colour is brilliant; 3) the scene in the fourth part where the ancient tree is shown - wonderful animation and fantastic church organ music piece; ...well, this list can be continued.
As I said, I'd like to make a reference to the taxi drivers: the first one, played splendidly by Winona Ryder is a compulsive smoker who looks and acts like a boy and cares about nothing else than her work and becoming a mechanic; the second one, played by a phenomenal Almin Mueller Stahl, is a man who is apparently driving a car for the first time; the others include Roberto Benigni (and I think with that you can imagine the character), a black driver played by Isaach De BankolÃ© and a driver named Mika played by Matti Pellonpaa.
Particularly in the second segment in New York, where there's the perfect divide between lightness and over-the-top- lightness being in Armin Mueller-Stahl's performance as Helmut (German ex-clown turned un-knowing cabbie) and Giancarlo Esposito's performance as Yo-yo.
It was for me, until I decided to watch it a second time.
In fact, after watching this a second time, I got to get the sense of what the film might be about- getting past that separation between a driver doing his job and a passenger with their own issues.
There's not a wasted second, a rarity in spot-gag cartoons such as this.
The movie himself exists in two version: one for TV in two parts and second for movies.
The first is the one in which our psychotic monster rips an unborn fetus out of the belly of a woman and starts to eat it, while the dying husband is watching and the second one is the ending when the killer is starting to eat his own intestines after being stabbed in the belly.
Most D'Amato sleaze isn't worth a second thought, but I found myself engulfed by Anthropophagus.
The second is the 3D projection.
Unfortunately the second half of the team turns out to be terrorist hijackers with no social conscience who slaughter most of the first half, leaving only two survivors to stop the ship from it's final destination.
I've seen it twice now, I like it even more the second time around.
This is actually the second time I've viewed this movie.
Consequently, while I watched this film for the second time it seemed like a new experience to me.
Most of the second half of the film concerns the two brothers getting ready for their "big night".
That should be rectified, since I consider myself a big fan of cinema, and I choose as my second enthusiastic recommendation Big Night.
In the conclusion; its a good movie, well, second thought: one of the best, I might say :)
Scenario:Good..The tie-in's are great,the evolution of characters are good,first the dream sequence which gives us emotions of characters to frp style evolution of their work style;first stealing math exam,second stealing their pre-test exams,then the final one..  Jean Claude Van-Damme:We see him talking french and being himself and B type movie style kick and steal sequences,what can we ask for more for this film?
And the last words...It's 9/10 and It's not 10/10 because of its ending...It gives real good advices to the life but when the film finishes you leave the theater with some questions in your mind but maybe there is coming a second film and I may change my mind to 10/10 after seeing the conclusion.
I watched this a second time after seeing it first some years ago.
I'm thinking pretty strongly after a second viewing that that's part of the point.
For his pains he died in virtual obscurity prior to the second World War he had foreseen.
I took each second the way it came, each surprising turn, each new wrinkle in an apparently plotless movie.
The latter group is, for example, the first two Prince of Persia games, and both this and the third game(where the focus still laid largely laid in the second of the two categories) of that series attempt for a mix... in the case of both, the result is that you can hack and slash away effortlessly and, more by chance than anything else, take out boss enemies and other players.
The second is FFA, Free For All, but with all the Force Powers in Holocrons(cubes you can pick up) in the level, and every player starts without any.
I do not believe BuÃ±uel for a second when he claims that he intended to use one actress, but she quit unexpectedly after shooting several critical scenes.
Skip it, do not think of it a second time, and do not watch unless you have a motion sickness tablet handy.
Wait a second.
The acting was horrific and I have seen second grade productions that had better acting in them.
This movie just sucked me in and didn't lose my interest for one second.
Albert comes in an extremely close second, he is very funny and he makes a terrific women in drag.
I think anyone who sees the film will have to, in fairness, see it a second time, maybe more.
These three individuals were partly responsible for the second American flag raising on that graced newspapers and magazine covers all over the world.
It is not difficult to follow, but you might need to watch it a second time to really appreciate it :o)
The martial arts performed by Jet Li and numerous others were second to none, just the best.
You can tell he's in control from the second he walks on to the scene without any lame phrases or quirky little acts that are fine for other actors, but not a master.
This was his second movie (after Tonight is Ours, also with March in it) and he does a fine job.
As our snivelling hubby deals with the tramping daughter, mumsy is off making out in a cave with Kala and preparing to round second base.
I was hoping against hope that perhaps Letterman's interview technique was second to none, but yet again I was disappointed: they are as vapid and un-illuminating as the rest of the show.
This movie started strong for me, maybe compared to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (minus the drugs) meets the second half of True Romance (they even throw in a hot blonde to sauce up the mix).
As for the second explosion that was just mad.
This is only the second movie I seen Fred MacMurray in (no my three sons here) besides Double Indemnity and his performance is very good here also,... just as Double Indemnity...
Still, I like to see Kurt Russell and so the film is sadly relegated to his second string.
It was dull it was pointless it was a rip off of alien for the first part then Aliens for the second.
Well duh, it's the second movie after the first movie.
Actually much in the second half isn't all that clear.
It's a film that deserves a second look, without a doubt - and thankfully the audio commentary with the director and writer explains so much, because without it you'll still be scratching your head and muttering "what the hell was that all about..." In particular, that strange, terrifying Eastern-block country Gideon finds himself in.
The second one was mostly a rehash of the first but pretty good.
The script and acting are second to none and the laughs are plentyful... don't be fooled by the fact it was straight to video because this movie is cinema at it's best!
It was the second attempt of director Vladimir Bortko to film Bulgakov's masterpiece.
I almost thought it was real(for a split second of course)and the fact that the year 2005 is Just around the corner, theirs still no manned space flight or a women president,But 2010 is right around the bend so maybe then.
But all in all this is a convincing production that merits a highish ranking among war films (say in the second quartile).
First, about the adventures of Devil and his company in the 1920-th Moscow; second, about Pontius Pilatus and Jesus in Jerusalem of the first century, and the third one, about the Master, the writer who wrote the second novel, and his eternal and true love, Margarita.
On a second viewing, (all the way through, this time), the Uncle Olie character is not so freaky, and the whole film is very nicely done, though the sound quality is a little off and the opening titles are still very trippy.
Put in a bunch of second rate John McClane style one-liners to try and give the hero some personality.
(1973); it's his second best-regarded effort after VAMPYRES itself and, in retrospect, a reputation that's fully deserved.
And the second time, doing nothing but watching the movie and understanding what was going on, I found the movie to be a lot better than I thought the first time.
If unoriginality is the first major flaw of Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon, the second major flaw is just as annoying.
ÂÂÂ SPOILERS ÂÂÂ PS: I hope Leslie will rise again from the death for a second part x_0 PPS: If you are disappointed by this film then go and rent Man Bites Dog... it's much more dark and cynical as I mentioned before.
In the second half of the movie, however, the team decide that they were not as dedicated to their film as they thought they would be, and they decide that they can't just stand by and allow the killings to happen.
It's a well done mockumentary, but may not be as good the second time around.
But somewhere along the way, the grad students realize that this is perhaps a little more than they bargained for and they have second thoughts about their complicity in Leslie's schemes.
The beginning of the movie sets up the second half.
The second half of the movie is when we get to see Leslie in action.
Because we have seen him as human in the first half, seeing him as a monster in the second isn't as scary as one might expect.
At times, Williams is playing the second or even third banana by the end of the movie.
I bought this film second hand for real cheap a couple of years ago...
The promise Jeremy Podeswa gave with his first film "Eclipse" is really fulfilled now in his second "Five Senses".
America's second animated feature - for whatever that title may be worth.
Filmed in Techi-color and just the second full-length animated feature, it rivalled many of the light musicals on the silverscreen in the 1930's.
While not one of the great animated features (it was only the second released in the United States, Disney's SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN Dwarfs in 1937 being the first) GULLIVER'S TRAVELS is an enjoyable film which should bring pleasure to uncritical viewers.
GULLIVER was their first foray into feature length animation (HOPPITY GOES TO TOWN would be their second in 1941), and eventually they would expend their energies again on the cartoon short subject, including the highly acclaimed SUPERMAN series which would commence in 1941.
The plot is like an early blueprint for the underrated second sequel to Return of the Living Dead, and it follows a toxic spill that brings a dead heiress back from the dead.
The idea of losing her friend a second time, and not being able to come to terms with the fact that Catherine is dead, I think Helene is the tragic character of the film.
The chemistry between John Ashton & Richard Tyson was amazing, it has to be one of the most underrated TV shows that people enjoyed that never got a second series or even more.
It's not realistic to wait for it's second airing I guess.
I attended the first day of shooting on location, but did not go for the second day - they came to get me, I suppose because they liked what they saw in the "dailies" - There was a third day of shooting, all of which were totally miserable for me - I had no aspirations to be a "movie-star" - I was an established drag-act with a large following and loved my work.
The Baylin character is actually quite funny and Flash has found his place as a hero who is comfortable with his ignorance and makes up for it with a second helping of courage, kind of like the O'Neill character in Stargate SG1.
If you haven't watched Flash Gordon lately, I encourage you to take a second look, the show has undergone a vast improvement!
I hope this one gets a second season.
I hope we see a second season.
All the charm and wit of the first (and to a lesser extent the second) film has vanished, taking the characters and goodwill with them: Paul Hogan is starting to look a leathery as the crocs themselves and the most interesting thing about Linda Kozlowski here is trying to pinpoint the plastic surgery through the soft focus filters she's often shot with and work out how much of her disengaged performance is down to boredom and how much to Botox.
Personally I prefer this one over the second movie which I thought came off too heavy, took itself too seriously.   
With that large Aussie sidekick who accompanied Dundee in the second half of the film (the name escapes me)playing off both Hogan and Rodriguez, you'd have a great combination!
The action sequence at the end of this one is far more comical than the second and doesn't take itself as serious.
Critics should not be comparing it to the first or even the second Dundee movies.
Commander Cain (Arthur Rosenberg) was even more loathsome; he was a man who was a politician first and a policeman second.
This is the second movie featuring Wilder and Pryor so be prepared for big laughs.
In the second of these match ups, Wilder and Pryor play a struggling playwright and actor in New York City.
I was hoping that Zach would knock her upside the head with one of the paddles during the water challenge in the second to last episode.
This is the second Poirot I've put back in the box before finishing.
The Amazing Racist and Money both make it to the second DVD.
I'm sorry to see I am only the second person to review this film on IMDb.
Their animation of the giant creature is of a very high order and is, of course, vastly superior to the work of a second special effects crew which was brought in to do the ferry boat sequence.
Behemoth fell into the second category, a genre started with the excellent Beast From 20,000 Fathoms, and elaborated upon with Godzilla and Them!
The first of the two Snake Plissken movies (The second is "Escape From L.A.") this is an interesting, but strange view of the future in 1997, which is now, ironically, the past.
Otto didn't reinvent himself with 7 Zwerge and its possible to see this in every second of this movie.
I must say that this movie reminded me a lot of the Australian "Mad Max"-movies, especially the second one.
He does adequately, yet watching this - Rhys' second cinema film - it becomes clear he's the star.
The truth is that his redemption and second shot at life might come at a price.
'Mr Denton on Doomsday' is a play in two distinct acts; the first act finds the drunk and pathetic Denton suddenly regaining his unrivalled ability with a shooting iron and the second act sees him face the consequences of being a renowned gunman.
And finally, following the showdown, he is revitalised and full of wisdom, a man given a second chance (second chances being another recurring theme in 'The Twilight Zone').
It is the second best movie on our list.
The second and third horror stories were more of comedies and the movie got less horrific after the initial 20 minutes.
She quickly went on to fame in Desperado and From Dusk Til Dawn, but this, Salma Hayek's second film role, shows her acting talent.
The second chapter follows Alma (Salma Hayek, the only recognizable name from the cast) as a lovely ghetto girl who is torn by the absence of her fiance who is in America and the desires, needs and temptations of being young, lovely, and inexperienced.
Salma Hayek was making her second appearance in front of the cameras.
The second is a "study version," which combines the remaining footage, new and original intertitles, advertising materials, posters and the original programme booklet in an attempt to reconstruct the complete narrative of the 1906 film.
I certainly do not agree with the reviewer's dismissal of the film as second rate.
A lot of ticker tape shenanigans go on in the second half of the film, all of which are so exaggerated, I ended up thinking public anxiety about the market was also being channeled here quite volubly, along with fear of the disabled and wretched poor.
The sequel was better (I picked them both up on the same day so felt obliged to watch the second one).
If the script were actually realistic, then we poor American citizens are in a world of trouble because the so-called national security is not even second rate, but probably fifth rate.
A flamboyant financier tries to land on this island with 12 kids (and low fuel) and is almost shotdown, but spared at the last second.
I really enjoyed this movie and even more so the second time.
There where some spots where the speaker was speaking so fast that the subtitles remained on screen for only a fraction of a second, not nearly long enough to read through.
This was my second run at Oriental horror films and unlike the first try (some movie about spirals) I actually enjoyed this one.
This movie is rotten from foundation to rafters, and suffers a series of huge gaps in logic and development, both of which are highly necessary to establish that any of the monstrous caricatures we're forced to watch are anything more than someone's paper-thin excuse for getting their kicks out at 24 frames a second.
I won't watch this a second time, but surely its art, though not the pleasant kind.
This type of thing makes up the majority if the second half of the film.
Come on Matt and trey make a second one !!
All its workings are on full display in every second, wriggling wretchedly.
Case in point: the second act builds heavily on Ham Egg being portrayed as a replacement fatherly figure and an all around good guy but all of a sudden, he turns on Astro Boy with no justification since his introduction.
As I watched a second and third time I began to notice hidden things within the film, which must have been placed within the film on purpose, and I did not notice them the first time I watched.
It was sad when they canceled it after the second season, but it could have been worse.
If I could find it on tape/DVD somewhere, I would buy it--no second thoughts.
I agree with the second part.
There was nothing worth watching the first time what on earth could have inspired the second go-round?
While Italian sex symbol Valeria Marini tries, she's hampered by her babyish voice - not to mention the exaggerated moans during the love-making and the fact that the couple's relationship never convinces for a second (if it's supposed to evoke "l'amour fou", it's a pathetic attempt)!
i love this film so much it has a great story line and the actors are amazing.it helped that the film had Zack Efron in because he is a talented actor who recently the lead in high school musical i gave this film 10/10 because it was amazing and i dint want 2 blink because i did not want 2 miss a second of it i also thought that the film was heart warming and it made me see a whole new side of Zack's acting skills i no that i cant wait to see him in his new film hairspray because if it is as good as this it will be at the top of the charts the only downside to this film is that Crystal Hunt who plays Jill Overton got 2 kiss Zack i was so Jealous if only i lived in America i would of auditioned for that part but i live in england for now

Tom is the second nicest to me, as he tries to do the right thing, but sometimes is a little sidetracked.
After a second Victim is found, Somerset realises that this is no open and shut case, and requests that he is relieved, in light of his impending retirement.
The movie has a wonderful performance from Lombard which I find her second best, the best being her performance in My Man Godfrey.
The young girl whom he had an affair with is the first, the second victim is the guy who works for a firm keeps a secret from his wife.
knocks her out without a second thought, of course.
Hoyt is a guy who usually plays a villain and usually has tiny roles, but here he gets what amounts to the second lead and he shines.
I came of age sexually in the second story, which takes place in the 1970's.
The second segment is also strong but not as well developed.
The second one takes place in 1974, and is about a teacher of French, gay not assumed aiming to be the principal of his school, and his best student, who is not secure of his sexual identity.
Even with some very slow bits in this film, I still have to say it is my second favorite film by Kurosawa (after Seven Samurai, of course).
In the scene where Murakami and Sato visit the scene of the second robbery, the sense of tragedy is brilliantly conveyed with a series of shots showing the house and garden empty, while we overhear neighbours whispering to each other about what has gone on.
Every single second of this film rings true.
I would consider this short the second best of the five, with Follow being the best.
Ang Lee's second short film was less than good with mediocre action scenes and a story that did not make much sense.
It was, I thought, quite funny and the second best.
The second was probably the most beautiful car chase ever filmed by Crouching Tiger and Ice Storm filmmaker Ang Lee.
He believes he has never saved anyone and his pictures do nothing more but "Sell a few more papers"  Without ruining any of the actions that take place in the second half of these 8 minutes, I assure you that in these 8 minutes you will feel more intensity, hatred, sadness, and fear than in any other 8 minutes of watching a film.
The legal cases give this film a second act, but as I have suggested before, there isn't a third.
It can't be denied that every second of the films matters in one way or another, either it is the feel of the environment, characters or even the state of mind.
Quel maledetto treno blindato (aka Inglorious Bastards) has risen from the ranks of the rest of the obscure Italian made, American acted cheapies first of all because of Quentin Tarantino's reverence for the film and the fact that he plans to a remake of sorts under the same title; second of all even though Tarantino's word is enough PR to get any obscure film to raise from the depths of the unknown into popular culture, it wouldn't work if the film wasn't any good.
When everything seems to be on schedule, the mission suffers a major set-back when a second train featuring a host of German soldiers arrives in the village where the first was supposed to stop, with many men dead after all is said and done.
While the action does admittedly slow a tad in the second act, the film never bogs down and is always enjoyable.
It looses some momentum in the second half, as the film slowly works its way to the conclusion you know is coming.
It lost me the second one of the character's said "Hello?
Preview: Summary: This one has a trained penguin  This is the twelfth Bulldog Drummond film, the third starring John Howard as Drummond, and the second based on Sapper's novel 'The Third Round' (the first version of which was the silent film of 1925 'Bulldog Drummond's Third Round' starring Jack Buchanan, of which one print is said to survive in an archive).
There is interesting second unit material of London.
A great point of interest is Zachary Scott, in his second screen role.
The second part starts when 20 years later Dane Corvin comes back to the area to visit his dying uncle (Hal Holbrook) whose last wish is to bring Dane and Hannah together again.
It is now Dane's turn to find in his heart and soul how to reconcile all the elements of his shattered life and so make forgiveness and love the main messages of the second part of the movie.
One other odd aspect of this series, which people find jarring to various degrees is that different actors fill major roles in the first and second series.
However, with 5 years between the first and the second series, much happened and the result was a number of actor/actress changes that make the second series confusing after seeing the first.
Major characters, such as Natalie Jastrow-Henry, played by Ali McGraw in the first, Jane Seymour in the second.
As Good As It Gets is my second favorite movie of all time, just behind Jerry Maguire.
That doesn't mean that it's the second BEST I've seen, but it certainly was the best film of the year, especially in a tough year.
When I first saw this movie I thought it was really boring and overrated, but I saw it again the second day and immediately loved it.
Jack Nicholson is one of those actors who impresses me the second (and I'm not overstating in the least bit) he appears on screen.
I've always had it in the back of my head that I would eventually get around to seeing this, and it was all because of an enduring three second image in my head that I remembered when they advertised this movie on TV.
In sheer numbers, this collection will be second only to the making of all of the Harry Potter movies which, if I may say, seems to be getting more and more like pulling teeth with each successive movie.
Although as a purist-at-heart I was slightly disappointed to see even a second of the precious work edited, overall I am amazed at how well they adapted the tale to fit into a neat little 2 hour time frame.
Watch for a scene in the second half when Fuzzy shoots one of Barton's bad guys, he repositions himself ever so slightly so he can continue to fall down a stairway - no time for do-overs.
The second part of the film focuses on The Kid, The Gold Rush, and City Lights.
But it always seems to be second fiddle to her leading man's intelligence whoever it was.
So the patron evens the score a second later.
A second movie that came to mind while watching "Three Secrets" was "The Big Carnival" with its media circus of cynical reporters covering and exploiting a disaster.
I was always disappointed that there was never an X File set at Loch Ness - it seemed such an obvious thing to do - but Quagmire is a very close second best.
This was her second movie with Gary Cooper since her appearance in William A. Wellman's superb, high adventure 'Beau Geste,' and her third with director Hathaway...  Richard Widmark proceeds his ways of gambling with a neat line in cynical cracks; Cameron Mitchell fails in his unwelcome sexual advances; Hugh Marlowe uses a variety of both conscious and unconscious processes to deal with his angry feelings; Victor Manuel Mendoza gets intensely angry after being hit; and Rita Moreno delights the environment with her sweet voice...  Hathaway was one of the great Hollywood veterans still in harness, a versatile director whose Westerns have been as variable in quality as his other films... Filmed on location in Mexico, his 'Garden of Evil' is a beautiful spectacle to behold...
Watching the movie a second time will help you absorb a lot more detail about the movie.
And under such obvious direction: "Smile when the light goes across", "Look up after a second", "React with surprise" and so on, making the actors seem like puppets sometimes.
This is the second and final collaboration between director Christopher Cain, cinematographer Juan Ruiz AnchÃ­a, and composer James Horner.
This is the story of a brother and sister orphaned by the second world war in Japan, who end up having to fend for themselves.
''Hotaru no Haka'' (Brazillian title : ''TÃºmulo dos Vagalumes'') is a very sad and moving film about the second war in Japan,focusing in the difficulties of a brother(Seita) and a sister(Setsuko).After their mother is killed in an air raid and their father was also killed working in Japan's navy army, Seita needs to be responsible for his little sister Setsuko,a very adorable and sweet little girl.
As another testament to the power of this movie, I decided to sponser a child through Compassion after watching it for the second time, 8 years later.
I preferred the first half of the series to the second half.
My only regret is that they did not make sequels out of the second and third Lavransdatter novels to complete the trilogy, since, indeed, the ending of the movie and of the first novel leave you hungering for more.
I finished the series for the second time yesterday, and it made an even bigger impression on me this time.
He really has too much screen time and during the second half you keep wishing for more of Pitts who effectively disappears from the second half of the film.
It concerns an ex-gangster teaming up with an eminent German scientist who has fallen into disrepute of late; together, they contrive to re-animate a series of dead bodies (apparently, their second life-expectancy is very short!)
CREATURE WITH THE ATOM BRAIN is actually the first Sam Katzman-produced horror film I've checked out Â and it's one of four that were recently packaged together in Columbia's ongoing "Icons Of Horror" series of genre Box Sets; a second, THE GIANT CLAW (1957), followed this straight awayÂand, even if I wasn't exactly enthused with either of them, I'd still like to catch up with the remaining two titles (namely THE WEREWOLF [1956] and ZOMBIES OF MORA TAU [1957]).
It is called "second order" because this theory has an environment in which subject and object have a space of liberty.
He really is why I watched the movie for the second time.
When we saw there was a second one, we were so excited.
None of the original cast was in the second one (no one can take Julia Stiles place in that movie) and just the fact that everything that Sara and Derek went through in the first one just to be together - "they" decided to take a break from each other and date other people.
The second one was a big let down.
If the second one would have been about someone else's life - it would have been a great movie - on it's own.
A sometimes painfully slow first half, partially due to Dietrich's role being stretched out to fit her top-billed status, is redeemed by an engrossing and exciting second half, including a rousing climax at Wayne and Carey's mine and a helluva great fist-fight between the Duke and Scott.
And, second billing went to Randolph Scott.
The second of three Marlene Dietrich/John Wayne teamings (and Duke is third-billed, behind Dietrich and Randolph Scott!
I was amazed seeing "Palace of the Parliament" the second large building after Pentagon, and other buildings.
The car chase in the second half looks just like the one in the first half.
Trivia fans may like to note that this is the second Western in which Delmonico's famous restaurant is mentioned in some Agar dialogue; Harry Carey jnr taunts him about eating there in "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon".
Diction aside, it was pretty good for an adaptation/prequel of the second Italian, western adaptation of Kurosawa's wonderful tip of the hat to the genre, "Yojimbo" (which, itself, was an adaptation of a noire novel).
I have only seen this and Audition, but Audition was boring and clichÃ© enough for me never to give him a second thought.
The rest of the cast are merely playing second fiddle to the well matched up leads, and outside of Gary Kemp becoming increasingly annoying as the film progresses, they all blend in well to create what is now a sadly undervalued picture.
the last second save of the enterprise was a tension filled scene.
Although I hated, hated, hated 'Cool World', the second Brad Pitt appeared I knew he was going to be a major, major star.
All I can say is brush up on your English Ms. Valette, because Hollywood is going to be pounding down your door any second now.
The only point which does affect is the length of the second half of this movie !
However, on second review, it just isn't very good.
The greatest movie adaptations are usually made from novels of the second or third rank, the adaptations of the greatest novels-The Brothers Karamazov, War and Peace, Ullysses, are not very good, while Dodsworth,and The Magnificent Ambersons are ranked among the classics.
Can't prevent laughing when, at the end, main character says to second something like 'your daughter plays no soccer and knows no cooking'.
Is the film about the psychological behaviour of the second character?, about its impact on the main character?, or just a sequence of events set in order to heat for the obvious ending?
The family were so cheesy, "Love you mum" "Love you even more honey" Then after they were broken into for the second time, 10 mins later, they were at it again, "Love you mum" big cheesy smiles etc... She phones her husband, and tells him not to bother coming home.
It's really sad when your second best actor behind Lugosi is a monkey from the Tarzan movies named "Cheeta".
Bela gets a top billing here, but in truth he merely plays second fiddle to a Martin and Lewis ripoff duo who are quite literally the two most annoying characters in all the movies ever made.
The second of director Jeff Lieberman's trilogy of perfect B thrillers, the others being Squirm (1976) and Just Before Dawn (1981), is a clever shocker given some interesting spins.
This is the second of three comedy movies I saw of Salman in 2000 with others being DHLJ (1st) and KPNHJ (3rd).
The average angle change is about 3x a second.
I never even gave it a second thought!
One moment he's fiddling with the window, and a second later he's standing on the floor next to the bed.
This is particularly apparent in the second half of this film when the heroine, after being jilted by one of her lesbian lovers (the oddly named Bee), takes up with the elderly Mario, a man who, despite his grey hair and advancing years, fancies himself both as a lover and as a thinker.
This brings us to the second way in which this movie can be enjoyed and appreciated, namely as John Ford's labour of love and guilty pleasure.
Even lousier than the dialog and Anderson's attention-deficit technique is the characters, who are not only a catalog of bland stereotypes (Family Man framed for a crime he didn't commit; Stuttering Nerd; Hardened Old Sage; and the token Hip-Hop Styled Badass), but utterly fail to convince us for a second that they're hardened killing machines deserving of their sentence.
this movie isn't my cup of tea.i couldn't watch it all,since i lost interest,but form what i saw,it just wasn't good.i just found it boring,with pretty bad acting,and a plot that is all over the place.it's a Russian made movie,the second i have seen now.the first one being Nightwatch.i didn't like that movie either.it also has a plot that doesn't make a lot of sense,at least in my opinion.anyway,Mirror Wars starts off promising enough,with some scenes of jet fighters doing maneuvers,which look pretty impressive.after that though,it's not so good.i wouldn't recommend it myself,but if you liked Nghtwatch,you might like this movie.for me,Mirror Wars is a 3/10
I think the director is the among the best fight action choreographers and photographers in the movie industry second only to matrix legend yuen woo ping and tied with Corey Yuen.
Of course this is a Hollywood 7 second treatment of an all day ritual but it was still a fun nod to Thai history.
He said the second day after the fall of the Taliban, they reopened a theater... and the people saw a Hindi movie, with dance and singing... and everyone in the theater danced and sang for the pleasure of it.
There is not a second of humor in her experiences.
A lot of the scenes had dark lighting and not a single second of musical score throughout the film added to the overall dark atmosphere of the film.
In a time when the world is so focused on the conflict unfolding in Iraq, the thing that is most clear to me after watching this movie is the old saying that after thousands of years of wars fought in the name of religion, we are not a second closer to peace than we ever were.
He does not use her in the second film.
However, in the second half of the movie, Angelopoulos moves closer on the main characters, and the movie takes a much firmer emotional grip of your heart.
Angelopoulos' imagery is second to none in modern cinema.
The film can skip ahead years in just a second, when the pace usually makes each second feel like years (in a good way!).
This was Whit Stillman's first of three similarly themed films; the second, "Barcelona," is subpar, but "The Last Days of Disco" closes the trilogy with a delicious return to form.
Also, this is Jack Pickford's second to last film.
Mary Pickford's younger brother, second billed Jack Pickford, plays the young thespian, Jimmy, very nicely in a rare appearance.
Moreover, the basic plot blatantly emulates the second "A Nightmare on Elm Street" movie, the pace really kicks into gear and rarely lets up after the rather leisurely opening third, the 80's clothes and hairstyles are hilariously hideous (Michael's silly blue pajamas are especially sidesplitting!
I saw this at the 2006 Palm Springs International Film Festival where it played for it's second year in a row.
The song when they go to the Ping Islands is a really good electronic song by Mark Mothersbough, and the second I heard it I knew I had to download it.
I was surprised to see Willie Best as the second cook attempting to pilfer a quail for himself early in the picture, while Andy Clyde worked his expressive face for maximum effect as hotel owner MacIvor.
The movie is in two parts, the first being about a quest for paradise and the second one being about the price of paradise.
And while the first one is good, it is the second one which makes this movie worth seeing.
He is okay as Richard, and in the second half of the movie he is even good, but he still lacks charisma.
As I said earlier, the second part of the movie is the best one.
But like all movie stars after one big film hit they get a funky haircut, put some glasses on and go shopping for clothes in the second hand store.
The film tends to deteriorate in the second half, with the plot becoming difficult to follow as Richard, alienated from his fellow-members of the group, starts to become mentally unstable.
The second part (which starts with the three Swedish bitten by a shark) only plays the role of fill-in and spoils all the movie.
A second viewing was a good idea.
The weak second act builds up to a conclusion that's as strong as the introduction.
Although a bit more contrived than season one, the second season of "24" follows the same formula as the first season with 24 virtual hours (16 viewer hours) jam packed with twisty-turny crisscrossing subplots, suspense, action, drama, and, of course, those countless looks askance.
The first half of the season was solid, but then the second half got predictable.
But Elisha Cuthbert was apparently too good-looking to be excluded from the second season, and as a result we have an uninteresting and unrelated sub-plot involving Kim Bauer getting chased by an abusive father and a mountain lion.
On second thought, let's just make the professionals as stupid as possible, so that we can insure more episodes and, thus, greater ad revenue.
He leads us into the second half of this picture, which has Mickey and Malory behind bars awaiting a big TV interview with Wayne Gale on Superbowl Sunday.
There wasn't anything remotely funny in this film; only what you saw in the trailer which the second time around got a smile from me.
That is the type of truth-is-stranger-than-fiction magic, that imbues every second of the early days of this nation.
Worth every second of its nine minutes.
When I first watched this film in 2005, I loved it, although at the time I was perhaps ready to agree that the second half of the film stumbles in a lot.
If it is, then the main topic is exactly the one that makes the film somewhat 'heavy' in its second part and which was one of the central topics in Kieslowski's film.
It is nevertheless the importance of the choice and its connection to various problems concerning family life that bring a kind of dullness into the second part of 'Torremolinos'.
In particular, this second part contains an easily-unnoticed topic of how much insult the male pride can take, and whether or not it is worth being guarded when love is at stake.
I think everyone is being a tad harsh on this film, there is no way they could have kept the pace of the first half of the film up it would have been exhausting.Seeing this film in a packed cinema @ cornerhouse certainly helped, seen Candela Pena in two films recently she shines in both.As for the second half of the film & the transition from comedy to drama the laughs didn't dry up they just were a bit more subtle i thought he bergman stuff especially carrying the sithe on the rollercoaster & playing chess on the pedolo was hilarious.
The second part is not as funny, but I almost wet myself while the aspiring director Bergman-wannabe shoots a number of scenes with his utterly talent-less wife, imitating every last cadre of a Bergman film!
Pablo Berger is the director and this is only his second film, but the work is of a mature creator, mastering the subject, with a deep understanding of the time the plot happens, with a strong hand in directing his actors, while leaving them enough space for creativity.
It's not the type of adventure game where you have to swordfight monsters every 2 seconds (although you do go through "swordfighting training" to learn some really funny insults) or listen while someone blabs on about how they're avenging the death of their great-grandfather's second cousin's sister's nephew's half-uncle once-removed, wasting your time with stories that don't have anything to do with the game.
Until now, I've only saw the second biggest monkey head yet.
I would also advise rewinding it, and viewing it again, as my second time through was just as delightful and revealing as the first.
I gave the movie a second chance recently and was impressed by this film.
In the second half, as the plot thickens and the parts of the puzzle begin to fit into a whole (i.e.
However, the director manages to hold the audience's attention long enough for the film to begin revealing itself in the second act.
Hopefully they'll keep it up, even as a second party.
I didn't get to see the movie again until my mother got for me for Christmas of 1990 on video back when it was put out by Thorne-EMI HBO Video and I was lucky enough to find the soundtrack at a second hand record store on the old RSO label.
I've just seen it for the second time.
Much of the lesbian content was never filmed, and most of the rest landed on the cutting room floor -- so much so that you know there are missing pieces as you watch; it's often obvious you're seeing the second part of something without a preceding scene to establish it.
The second cut scene is less brilliant and rather politically incorrect, but it's still a shame it was eliminated.
Based on an idea by actor/director Gregory Ratoff, who has a supporting role, the movie drags in the second half.
When it comes to the second shooting the sheriff is clever enough not to risk a fair duel.Right so!
It is 3 hours long, and some parts may seam overly long at first, but the second time you watch it it all seams perfect.
She'll be able to catch a glimpse of herself as the stupid clown she really is, and go backwards into room #47, her blind spot (the second half of an AK47, the first half of which is echoed backwards in the letters written on her fist).
No profitable comparison to Lynch's more linear films can be made, although, on a second viewing of IE I may wish to spend some time thinking about the connection between the exploitation themes in Elephant Man and this film.
When I was in 7th grade, (so many years ago) I saw Sid Caesar in a movie called "Tars and Spars" In it he did a sketch called "Wings over Bermerschnitzen" I stayed for a second show and came back the next night and memorized it.
Yes he drinks and womanizes too much, but he does show the young writer what is worthwhile about living, and he even blends in with Benjy's family (his mother Lainie Kazan and her second husband and Benjy's uncles and aunts).
After a rather fatal turn of events he gets a second chance at life and love.
The second one i would like to see all three brothers, one sister and their mom and dad to do a movie together.
She has a bust), but there is more to Riza than good looks or big boobs (unlike other game heroines *cough*TifaLockhart*cough*  My second favorite would be Surlent, the young blue haired sorcerer.
Hitch said this was his second mistake of his career when he falsely led the audience into thinking the flashback scene was real.
The second clue is the fact that the heroine fell out of love with the murderer and into love with the detective.
The second, a return to his standard narrative form after two noticeably experimental pictures, was an adaptation of the story "Man Running" by Selwyn Jepson.
Alfred Hitchcock made this highly enjoyable and under-rated divertissment in 1950 after a run of glum movies in the second half of the forties but before embarking on his richest period in the fifties.
Forget the shot in "Notorious" where the camera slowly descends from the second floor to Ingrid Bergman standing in the foyer and a tight closeup of the key in her hand.
shuts the door behind him, starts up the stairs, reaches the second landing, crosses to Charlotte's bedroom door and enters.
I only hope the producers decide to release a second series covering later books of the manga
on october,26 2006 schippers second movie will hit the screen - "Ein Freund von mir"
Challenging and disturbing, definitely a film that deserves (and requires) a second look.
This movie doesn't get on a soapbox, not even for a second--it just tells a real-life story that owns you before you know it.
Please, don't let the audience think for a second that the main character may have indeed been protecting his life and property which was being burgled every night.
Then I gave it a second try and fastforwarded it to 13 minutes from the beginning.
I remember watching this at the drive in movie, it was second on the bill and it was the first really "adult" movie I had ever seen, thus it stayed with me.
The second story line, in which awkward student, and `Tiger' McDrew protÃ©gÃ©, Ponce De Leon Harper (John David Carson) comes of age with the help of his teacher Miss Betty Smith (a GORGEOUS Angie Dickinson), is handled in a sweet and sensitive manner.
We watched it a second time recently and were surprised at how shocking it has become.
This is a second tier Ken Maynard movie but we treasure the limited hours of being with Ken as he portrays a real cowboy and a real man .
Not surprisingly, director Bill Bannerman, on his first turn being completely in charge (he has a lot of previous second unit experience), wasn't quite up to the task.
The second segment wasn't that good, but it was okay... the synopsis was you don't need to be a feminist to be a lesbian... we are all different, don't try to put us into categories... it won't work anyway!
The 1961 part was about two elderly ladies that were frustrated because they couldn't express then selves in any way, the second part I really liked a butch girl named Any and a feminist named Linda meet an fall in love and finally the last one was so funny, Ellen Degeneres stared as Kal so it was awesome, Anyway, Kal and Fran want to have a baby so the go to the sperm bank and well you'll see if you watch it!
Intriguing movie, especially the second part and most of all the performance from Chloe Sevigny, must be the depth of the story and what it brings out from the unknown, it makes it easy to understand that this lifestyle isn't easy at all.
The second film was a good example of the transitionary period when lesbians were removing themselves from the femme/butch sterotypes.
The first segment was almost unbearably sad; the second had you willing the central figure to defy the attitudes of her equally lesbian friends and keep dating the woman who was expressing her individuality a different way, which was anathema to the others because it had "male" characteristics; the third portrayed a loving partnership's efforts to get one of them pregnant, and their joy when they finally managed it, extremely well.
As for the rest, the first installment with Vanessa Redgrave contains more holes than a golf course; while the second with Chloe Sevingy and Michelle Williams feels too hip for its own good and sits uncomfortably with the other two parts.
The second story, set in 1972, deals with the relationship between a college co-ed (Michelle Williams) and a girl who likes dress in macho male attire (Chloe Sevigny).
The second part is less sad.
The second movie, set in 1972, depicts an accurate portrayal of what lesbians faced during the rise of the feminist movement where even sisters were divided over who should be allowed to participate and promote the feminist cause.
My second complaint is the fact that some of the voices do not sound like the actors at all.
But this movie was very different, as the hero uses his brain as much as his brawn, accepts help albeit a bit reluctantly, and has a second reason for his quest.
I must say, now at an age well thrice as old as the first time, I could take a second look and found it was really as bad as I remembered it.
I have just completed this game for the second time.
As such, the second half of the film takes place on a New York street in which one half is owned by Jewish shops and the other half is owned by Palestinian shops.
I couldn't believe that the introduction of an evil land-developer to the film occurred near the end of the second act.
Now his second film shows that it wasn't merely a flash in the pan, or a fluke.
However, in hindsight this movie deserves a second look, and seems to have received one, as indicated by the positive reviews I have read from virtually every amateur online reviewer, which would qualify this movie as a sleeper 20 years after its original release.
Ghosthouse is apparently the second sequel to a film called 'La Casa', which I've never heard of.
Moves at a pretty good pace, especially in the second half.
), if you appreciate B-Movies and don't criticize every second of them you will find that Ghoshouse is stunning.
After a 30 second of a sort of emotional goodbye.
It is a good thriller and it kept me second guessing myself throughout.
The second worst cop out in history - the first being 'he woke up and it was all a dream'.
And second cousin once removed.
The second scene is slightly less poignant, but also shows the unspoken understanding between good people.
I liked him much more the second time around.
To be honest, this film made me feel very uncomfortable, luckily I watched it alone, and i FFWD through the beginning a lot, since it is embarrassing to watch and every second you expect this guy to make even more of a fool of himself than he is doing.
"Keane" slowly develops a story out of this man's circumstances that brings him to one crucial moment of decision and a powerful resolution in the final second of the film.
The second is that he tells the story of a conflicted criminal trafficking in some mean streets and he does it without ripping off Scorsese for one second.
All the jokes fell flat and half way through its groundbreaking 75 minute running time I wanted to find a way to end my life so I wouldn't have to sit through another second of this horrid movie.
First, it was vulgar, second it lacked substance.
The cast is second to none.
Well choreographed, exciting fight scenes, a good storyline and deep characters played by good actors (not just Wincott and Hudson, but the co-stars too - most notably Richard Jaeckel as their father) In my opinion, this is Jeff Wincotts second best film after the amazingly good Mission of Justice.
On the other hand, Ming Ming's friend Ah Tu (Tony Yang) is also infatuated with her, and chances upon Nana (Zhou Xun in her second role), with whom he brings along in their escape from Brother Cat's thugs, and whom too is also in love with D. Confused?
It then immediately watched it a second time, and really enjoyed the plot, which made a lot more sense the second time around.
Unlike the second game, where the pedestrians talk with Spidey and comment him while you're swinging around the city, the third game is completely dead in this area.
And also, you could hear the wind blow past you as you swing faster in the second game.
It get's boring quickly, unlike the first and second games.
You Only Live Once is Director Fritz Lang's second American film after leaving Nazi Germany.
In Fritz Lang's second American movie, 1937's "You Only Live Once" (not twice), Sylvia Sidney, aka "the Face of the Depression," plays what must be the loyalist girlfriend/wife in screen history.
"You Only Live Once" is the second American movie of Fritz Lang and a tragic melodrama.
The second thesis contradicts historical facts.
Three mistakes: 1) The second time they aired it, they put in "lost scenes".
I first watched this around 5 years ago at 11pm with the lights off and a storm outside, Scary no?, Thus making me lose 2 nights sleep...The ways the Aliens were conveyed were okay, and the "powers" they had were a tad far-fetched but still a great movie to watch alone and in the dark, the bad thing though is if you watch it for a second time all the scary moments just aren't there leaving you to sell it or watch as your friends are scared by it just to play small jokes on them for a day or two(worked with my brother, so meh).
Now in 2007 i watched it a second time and before seeing it i saw people on the IMDb website saying words like it's superb or excellent and and thought to myself it must be as good as I remembered.
Predating the same mistake they made with Seinfeld's second season (specifically, the last four episodes) by 25 years, NBC aired the first episodes of Star Trek out of order (the approved pilot, Where No Man Has Gone Before, was broadcast as Episode 3).
The only other reviewer at the time of my posting states that the quality of his VHS transfer was excellent, while my 'remastered' DVD print is about as second rate as they come.
I missed the first advance screening of this film, so I was sure to be one of the first in line for the second one!
But after I saw it a second time (the full Black and White version), I fell in love with it and I now own it on DVD and have seen it quite a few more times.
But still, It aired again a little while later and even though it was my second time seeing it, it was still very funny.
A David McCallum fan for more years than I care to numerate, I can easily say that this is probably his best role (Colditz was his second best--check it out if you can).
The second aspect of the show that really makes it unique to me is both the creativity of the individual cases and the amazing nature of the story arcs.
It stars Mark Harmon as the head of the team special Agent Leroy Jethero Gibbs.He comes across well as the head of the team.The rest of the team consist of David McCallum as Dr Donald "Ducky" Mallard Gibbs best friend and the teams medical examiner who is both wise and a little eccentric,Michael Weatherly as Agent Tony Dinozzo Gibbs second in command who has a fantastic sense of humour and who cannot help teasing Kate,Sasha Alexander as Agent Kate Todd formally a secret service agent assigned to the presidential protection detail she may be new but she soon learns the ropes and what tragically happens to her in the episode Twilight leaves the team heartbroken,Sean Murray as Agent Timothy MGee Tony's apprentice who is only been an NCIS agent for a couple of years but soon becomes a valued member of the team,Cote DePablo as Mossad officer Ziva who replaces Kate she's a very strong character who has some very funny lines,Pauley Perrette as forensic officer Abby Sciuto a goth with a great sense of humour who is a vital team member and Lauren Holly as Director Jenny Shepard a former girlfriend of Gibbs.
The team is formed by: Leroy Jethro Gibbs (the second B stays for Bastard) (Mark Harmon), the moody, intuitive head investigator; he likes his coffee very strong, his women with red hair, and his investigations thorough.
Tim McGee (Sean Murray), who joined the team in the second season after making various guest-appearances throughout the first season.
Moreover, the basic plot blatantly emulates the second "A Nightmare on Elm Street" movie, the pace really kicks into gear and rarely lets up after the rather leisurely opening third, the 80's clothes and hairstyles are hilariously hideous (Michael's silly blue pajamas are especially sidesplitting!
Chances are high you'll love every second of it.
In the middle of the movie,some totally new characters show up and it's pretty obvious they're only there to get killed by the demons.But then again,what other purposes can characters in a horror movie have anyway?This second movie in the "Evil Dead"-series is kinda different actually,it gets more surreal here,mainly because Ash has really lost it here in the first half,and the demons appear to be even more over-the-top and more evil.However,they both grab themselves together near the end for their final showdown.Ash is accompanied by a bunch of idiots but as they're idiots,they don't help much and get killed in some rather original ways.I'm not sure when this movie is situated,but I'm guessing this movie acts like the first one never existed.Not that it completely retells the story,it merely summarises it.And as I took this walk on gross-out lane,I found myself very entertained,somehow shocked but I don't have a clue by what exactly and I did laugh along with Ash and the deer head I must say.That scene really puts a spell on you.Almost as great as the first one
There has always been a huge debate whether Evil Dead II is a sequel or a remake, since the second film contradicts the story that occurred in Evil Dead.
That's where the story begins in the second film.
The second half introduces new characters or - in other words Â fresh new victims to dissect.
Raimi and company (armed with a bigger budget and over the top special effects) bring us the second installment of the Evil Dead series.
I laughed, I got scared, I enjoyed every little second passing by the screen.
Like the locomotives one sees so often steaming through the glorious landscapes of this story, this movie starts chugging slowly at first - although never boring -- and barrels full steam ahead during the second half.
Background music is the second intense thing after Hrithik's acting, that keeps you engrossed.
The second half of the film leads in something of an odd direction, becoming an intense action thriller that is at times jaw-droppingly similar to Spielberg's own "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom."
Then, after a further series of adventurs, the love interest is made the subject of a second sacrifice, and the heroes must rescue her and destory the temple.
Only in the second half the film becomes more lively.
Milady's son was by her marriage to her second husband Lord de Winter and his name was John de Winter aka Mordaunt and a "worthy" descendant of Milady de Winter he was an assassin and spy also and had his mother's appetite for revenge especially against his Uncle,his mother's executioner and the 4 Musketeers for depriving him of a mother.For more on Mordaunt read the novel and sequel The Twenty Years After and try to get a decent movie version of the novel.French and Russian versions of the Twenty Years After are the best and so is the BBC version.Richard Lester gave the Mordaunt character a sex change in his version and the Italian version is very loosely based.D'Artagnan was the shortest of the Musketeers and was olive skinned read the very first chapter of the novel and he was eighteen years old Aramis and Porthos were in their 20's and Athos in his early thirties.
Such love is definitely unwordly and beautiful- second to none as well.
According to his obituary in the New York Times, "Mr. Seres complained that the success of "Gloomy Sunday" actually increased his unhappiness, because he knew he would never be able to write a second hit."
But, at second sight, it is a warm homage to Mitteleuropa, the gorgeous Kakania's spirit.
Janssen is absolutely gorgeous, and to boot she's the second best actor in the movie.
For one, it asks us to be stupid and go along with the second half of the film.
The second half of the film doesn't add up, nor does it make us say, "I should have seen that coming," as films such as "Sixth Sense" and "The Others" did.
Okey, now to the second hour...Why?
The writers had so many ways to go, why did they do the second personality ending?
All in all I liked stranded and if I come across it in the TV listings or on DVD I will certainly give it a second viewing.
Then there's Lynn Hamilton as the second madame Ross encounters.
Ms. Ross was the second (or third since Cicely Tyson was also nominated that year for Sounder) African-American to be nominated an Oscar for Best Actress after Dorothy Dandridge's previous nod some 18 years before.
McKay was Billie's second or possibly third husband.
This was the second of the series of re-released, long missing films shown on Wednesday, April 2, 2007 on Turner Classic films.
I saw this on TCM a couple of nights ago, and stayed up late to see it a second time when it was screened again later in the evening.
Even in the most disjointed of marriages (such as the second of my two marriages) there is generally some sort of attachment between the two even though they may both be in the divorce court!
(SPOILERS) This is the story of a man (Delon) who commits a mistake (a bank robbery) and, although being an excellent person, is never given a second chance by so-called justice.
Formidable film built on an original scenario, Two men in the city is a load against the death penalty and a dark report on the incapacity of the Republic to grant one second chance to that which made an error.
I actually attempted to watch it twice just to give it a second chance to make sense, but I got about 30 minutes into it the second time and started feeling sick.
In Paris where the World Championship was held, she was second after school figures, but the difference in score between her and VrzanovÃ¡ was rather small, so she still had good chances to win.
In 1947 when my mother probably already was the best European skater and at least the second best in the world, Austrian skaters were not admitted to the European and the World competitions.
And saying the second part, with his mouth closed.
The film links the idea of lies (characters concealing truths, making realities out of lies), with art (painting - Jacques revels in panoramas and trompes d'oeil; the second murder is 'composed' like a painting).
It was entertaining enough as a horror film though and the bloody-as-hell ultra-violence on display in the second half of the film makes up for the deficiencies of the rest of this thing, in my opinion.
The second thing to remember is that Jack Benny did all of his scenes with Percy Kilbride (later known as Pa Kettle) on days in which he had gotten no sleep the night before.
Well, I must say that I really enjoyed the film for reasons I'll get to later Â which makes its absence on DVD more than a little baffling; incidentally, it was the tenth of Power's eleven collaborations with director King (the following effort, THE SUN ALSO RISES [1957], is perhaps the one I'd love to watch most of the star's remaining titles) as well as the second and last in which Power is co-starred with Susan Hayward (after the excellent suspense Western RAWHIDE [1951]).
The second half of the film is a road movie as Esperanza sets out to bring Blanca home.
Hot Bubblegum is the third entry in the Isreali Lemon Popsicle series.There are nine films in the entire series.I have seen the first three because they are on youtube.Part of the fourth film is on youtube and the whole film should be up soon.Anyway Hot Bubblegum is not as good as Lemon Popsicle 1 or 2(which was the best one), but it is still a funny 1980's teen sex comedy with a good mix of drama and romance in it.My only problem with this film is Bobby and Benji are always friends even after the events of the first and second film.In those, they always fight and never become friends again, yet in the next sequel, they are best friends as if nothing has happened.Also Nicki from the first film(played by a different actress) returns.Benji and her date and talk as if none of the events of the first film happened.Also in the first film, she seemed like a nice girl, yet in this one she's a b**ch!
The second, that with other then the name of bouncing boy being really lame, it's not really about the legion but a shameless hero worship and let's all relay on superman/teen or whatever.
And I love every second of it!
From the look of especially the second episode, plots are going to be quite adventurous compared to the usually Earth-bound shows of the other series.
There's a noticeable amount of cheap "bouncing cut-outs" in the first episode (I'm guessing Ep1 is partly cobbled from recycled in-house promotional materials) -- but the second episode is a knock-out.
The second episode demonstrates that, while red ink won't be overflowing the bathtubs, the series will be capable of creepy and mysterious scripts that'll definitely have little tykes freaked and cartoon-buff adults glued.
Suffice to say on second viewing, I was able to appreciate the quality of the stage-born dialogue, and the precision with which its delivered by both Shaw and Plummer in their unique portrayals of demi-gods by any other name.
My initial viewing was such; fortunately, I watched it a second time.
Tonally the film (purposefully) wanders wildly from darkness to light; the acts are very clearly defined; first the Kingdom is established and flourishes; which leads to betray and the emergence of evil in the second, then in a blistering third act there is a muted sense of forgiveness and resolution.
The first act is very entertaining and full of familiar stories (the Sword in the Stone & the Knights of the Round Table) the second act where Lancelot and Guinevere get their rocks off is all about the melodrama and the third act is a searing blend of startling imagery, fierce battles, sorcery and redemption that really does mark out Excalibur as an extraordinary piece of cinema.
There have been quite a number of comments here which either praise this movie to the heights (making it sound like the second coming of "Citizen Kane"), or note that it really, really sucks (making it the resurrected corpse of "Howard the Duck").
I watched this experiment shortly after watching the second episode of Doctor Who.
The second he pushes up his sword, it's already over.
A lot of things are found out in the second part.
Also, quite a few side-quests, and they could get vital to the second part also.
There is a great deal of story compression especially in the second half as the plot does not zip along as much as it jumps.
Even if writer/director Billy Wilder doesn't manage to keep our sympathies with the right character for most of the movie he produces some scenes in the second half that give Holden's character a twisted redemption and reason to finally make a completely clean breast of things and an escape route from Norma.
On my first viewing, I wasn't particularly impressed with this movie but I liked it a lot more on the second and by the third - when it's magnificently transferred on DVD - I was fan, too.
Even more so when, after intermission, the second act began with her character giving a Q&A session at the local Rotary Club.
Although the screenplay is consistently witty from start to finish, it is mainly in the second half of the film that it is also extremely moving.
And Faramir gets a ten second cameo, only 'cause he's Eowyn's boyfriend.
It was awful beneath description from beginning to end, appearing to be a shameless attempt to cash in on the hopes of frustrated fans who'd wanted the second animated movie made.
When it became apparent, though, that the second Bakshi Ring movie would never come to pass, that made it possible for the folks at Rankin/Bass to seize a golden opportunity.
Once again, we see that the Rankin/Bass team were second to none in their constant efforts to share with their audiences adventures unlike anything they had previously experienced.
She won the Oscar for "It Happened One Night," and also scored this second huge hit, which artistically speaking is hardly chopped liver.
However it is full of laugh out loud moments, especially What is Sodomy and the second last sketch, and stand out performances from Woody Allen, Mia Farrow, Gene Wilder and John Carradine.
Taking Dr. David Reuben's book, a pop culture phenomenon of the late 1960s, Woody uses it only as a starting point for indulging in his second greatest passion, film-making.
is second rate sitcom: Middle-aged man is caught trying on dresses while visiting his daughter's new in-laws.
THE NEGATIVE: The second segment entitled 'Why some Women can't have orgasms' is a misfire.
The second has Gene Wilder as a doctor falling in love with a sheep!
And there's a second line of the story (that is a bit difficult for people outside the Balkans to understand - which is the reason for the words on the screen at the end of the film) - all the main characters are from different ex-Yugoslavian countries, but they are no different as people.
Despite all problems and absurdities of soldier life on brink of war their sense of humor remained second to none.
I wont lie to you Disney, in the past has done some terrible second takes on films, ruining the reputation of the original.
I love Disney animation (I also enjoy drawing drawing it to), but usually second takes to the films animation is terrible.
All in all this was a one of a kind in Disney second movie films!
This show, his second TV series, is very enjoyable to watch and the characters are funny to the bone.
Sorry, I don't see how the first half and second halves of this film tied together.
Everyone was a "slacker" at the start and the solders were driven in the second.
If you like nature it is far more preferable to go out of your house and enjoy it than to watch this extremely boring film where nothing is really happening and the second part is just pathetically dragging on and on.
While in the first half of the film he seems to know exactly who/what he wants - in the second half of the film he is lost & confused, frightened by his Desire.
The first half takes place mainly in the city and the second half is mainly jungle.
Now this may be a problem on my behalf, but I'm not really sure I completely understood the link between first half and the second half of the film.
This is an unusual film, as the first part is treated naturally, the second, with its own credits, is a haunting fantasy.
This second - and, for me, slightly less interesting - half of the film is a largely wordless journey into the filmmakers' own heart of darkness.
This second half of the film, of course calls into question our understanding of Keng and Tong's prior relationship (if Tong ever existed at all.).
While part one, is reminiscent of a modern quirky love story like "Chungking Express", the second half is like Terrance Mallick shooting a remake of "Predator".
All sense of time and space, is swallowed by the jungle, and implicit politics of the first half are turned inside out in the second half; it is literally cat and mouse, with the possibility that the cat may want to be eaten by the mouse, or vice versa.
The second half is also marked by the inclusion of tribal art and cave paintings, depicting the story of the shaman and the soldier, with sub-titles accompanying them.
It is very slow moving though, the first hour will give you no hint of the second half (other than a few visual ones, look at the various statues in the backgrounds, etc), but for the bold and the patient, there is lush hypnotic reward to be had.
In the second part, the country boy becomes the incarnation of a shape-shifting shaman and follows the soldier in the shape of an extraordinary tiger, as to mirror his forceful appeal and the soldier's wild desire: what was a polite, romantic and almost naive love story becomes a supernatural tale where all schemes and disguises are erased and all that's left is pure instinct.
There are so many memorable moments (the theater sequence, the descent into the temple) but everything that happens in the second half speaks to you on a totally different level.
And how is it that an experienced actor Robert Patrick have to play second fiddle?
This made for TV movie would be ok if you left out the second half of the film.
By contrasting one "section" of the movie, daily life in Nazareth, with the second section, the checkpoint between Ramallah and Israel, the director subtly blames this dreariness on Israel, but never provides any direct evidence as to why such blame can be properly argued.
August Diehl has never looked so lost on the big screen as in the second half of Tattoo (probably he noticed what he was into it - and it was too late to get out).
A Crack in the Floor definitely fell into the second category.
is it possible the movie-makers really think a cop wouldn't even stop for a second to think about it and make himself an own impression?
And after he almost loose the race because of the engine trouble he suddenly got the machine together and wins the race in the last second.
Make no mistake, if you rent/buy this and are in a haste, only watch the second segment!
The second story is by italian horrordirector Argento and it's at least twice as good, but still not good enough.
Then to make an ALLEGORY of the second half, we have the concentration camp square.
The second part was better but I could not get past how unrealistic this movie was.
In the second half, nothing plays true.
It's particularly embarrassing that all the American flag waving, done ad nauseam in the second episode, was created by Canadians.
even though the two sequels were even cheesier they were watchable movies and the second one is way underrated in my opinion.
Pointless, juvenile, absolutely worthless(..unless you just have an urge to see stars from the original returning to reprise their roles)sequel to the original Sleepaway Camp(..the second and third films featuring Pamela Springsteen in the "prominant" role of Angela are completely disregarded, which is probably a good thing, I guess)has a psycho-killer, in black hoody, targeting those who victimize and mistreat extremely repellent frog-devoted Allan(Michael Gibney), always the center of negative attention in regards to practically everyone, in constant disagreements, arguments, and skirmishes with the teenagers/adults in camp.
I liked both the more straight-forward, gritty slasher feel of the original film, as well as the comic splatter of the second and third films.
In the second and third, we had Molly and Marcia as heroines, and they were both nice gals.
The plot often seems to come second or third.
After a crappy opener for Season 3, the second episode proves to be just as crappy and annoying.
While there was a romantic side to the story, it fell second nature to the growing hip-hop scene.
It was a dance film first, developed character story second.
For "comedy", I cannot count David's friend who smashes pies into the faces of girls who won't give him a second date.
Dave is over Rafi the second he hits the dance floor.
The second and final "critisism" is this question: why was a (proper) sequel never made???
Of especial note is the second youngest as he sports a haircut that is so abysmally misguided it makes Billy Ray Cyrus's mullet look tasteful.
No, on second thought, leave this movie alone and watch a re-run of "Providence" instead.
Yet, what followed was just a parade of new board rooms, with Yella playing second fiddle.
Don't even give it a second glance.
While here characters were elegantly and ingeniously crafted (Billy Pretty, both in tyhe pages and on the screen by Newfie Gordon Pinsent being the best of the bunch), and here sparse descriptions of the Newfoundland landscape befitting the sparse and bare Western Shore (although there are some mighty fine towns along that same coast), here characterization of Newfoundlanders is very 'look-down-your-nose' - they are all rustic, and seem never to have seen any modern convieniences, and are second kin to the McCoys of the American Ozarks.
If it's so great, would you ever sit through a second time?
The music is awful and so are the action scenes, if you want to see Rutger's action film i recommend seeing rather split second or arctic blue.
This is how they put the first bomb in WTC and carried through their second assault.
Terry could have come to his senses about his paranoia toward the end of the second act.
Take my word for it, the movie is not worth watching for more than one second and is not worth paying one cent for.
Maybe it was because of how confusing the movie got afterwards or my mind just doesn't choose to remember it at all, or maybe even both but I can't remember too much of what happens in the second half right until the predictable climax.
However, since every second of the film was even more tortuous than the depravities depicted on the screen, I believe no amount of focus groups or editing could save this film.
- apparently they fell madly in love in some 30 second scene earlier in the film - some real in-depth character development going on here.)
First of all it rips off other primal thrillers such as "Fatal Attraction" and "Cape Fear", second of all THE ACTING IS TERRIBLE!!!!!
They thought it would be clever that the antagonist knows every movement of the protagonist at every second.
The first part of it was boring as hell, then the second half was just plain God damn depressing.
I'll say only one scene in the entire film got my attention for a split second.
A wimp is not what is needed in the second half of this film and wimps do not belong in film noir.
Madonna, in her second starring role, had about enough acting talent at this point as a doll.
She gets fed up of playing second fiddle to her married boyfriend.
This is the second worst film of the year.
Some of the deleted scenes reinforce this point as we're subjected to a scene that shows the alarm going off, the characters laying in bed, struggling to wake up, and then a 30 second shot slowly closing in on the ceiling fan.
managed to make a very full film second by second, image by image, word by word.
And that's the singing Irene I like the best AWFUL TRUTH (SHOW BOAT, is a close second!
The second time was to give it a second chance, and TCM did run a better print, but the story, script and acting don't mix.
Boytown comes a close second for worst movie ever, let alone worst Australian film.
I in fact walked out of this after 40 minutes to catch a second screening of Children of Men in the cinema besides, the only thing keeping me from feeling ripped off.
The second half of that series was kill by the young prince vampire and lack up finish development of the past history and love story.
There goes his second opportunity!
second, why does it say in the plot summary that the teenagers are hunted by a twisted killer with an ax?
The second most hilarious thing: Something goes wrong with all 5 of their cell phones, I think most didn't have service and the others phones died or something.
The second is about Deadwood's attempt to become a part of South Deadwood and with outside interests wanting to take over people's gold claims from under them.
The second is the main character Bullock and the actor who plays him.
The second death, guy gets stabbed.
"The Battle of Shaker Heights" is the second offering released and made from the successful HBO reality series "Project Green light" which chronicles the search for a screenplay and director in which Ben Affleck and Matt Damon will produce for one million dollars.
I decided to watch the second season of "Project Greenlight" and yet again it was the search for a screenplay to finance and a director.
For the second season there was the same self-indulgent ranting from Affleck and Damon, and some showing off of J.Lo from Affleck but nonetheless I watched amateur screenwriter Erica Beeney win, and a two director team Efram Potelle, and Kyle Rankin get the chance to show off their chops.
If you want to see a good story of Tunnel warfare in Nam, Watch the second episode of Tour of Duty titled "Notes from the Underground".
The second turn-off is overly emotional displays meant to endear the viewer to the character.
First, melodrama is an utterly underrated way of telling stories, second, it was very much a sign of the times, as most films during that times tended to be overly melodramatic by themselves, and as a whole.
David Butler, later to be a major director of musical comedies, has the second lead and Miss Moore never looked lovelier.
The second thing that was highly suspect was the fact that there was only ONE spontaneous group dance number (during a computer class).
Bad acting, unbelievably implausible plot lines, and second rate dialogue are only accentuated by cookie cutter characterizations.
This is also just one of the many countless incidents contained in the movie that bare absolutely no relevance whatsoever on the plot, including a scene where Anne is cleaning up a trail of blood off the kitchen floor and an inane second story-line involving a prior occupant of the house who committed suicide after claiming the house was 'possessing' him!
I saw it at our local second run theatre for a more expensive price than usual as it was not a main film there.
Gold the first time, old the second.
For example when Wil Wheaton's character views the Orb on the second night.
In this third and (thank Christ) final installment in the trilogy-the action picks up directly after the events of the equally stupid second film-with Duane spending some time in a rubber-room after trying to sew him and his deformed Siamese twin brother Belial back together.
It picks up where the second movie left off with Duane and Belial being separated once again and hitting the road on their freak-bus, along with all of the other non-normals, to the house of a doctor who is going to assist in the 'birthing' of Belial's pregnant girlfriend.
Who's to believe that a handsome high school senior, disillusioned by the party life, would ever take a second glance at a gawky sophomore?
However, after seeing the movie a second time, I grew to appreciate the crazy antics of Ernest and he instantly became one of my favorite movie characters.
In fact, I watched it a second time, thinking that maybe I missed something as far as the ending was concerned.
This was the worst stinking movie I have ever seen (Redneck Zombies a very close second).
The pacing is terrible, nothing happens without 10 second close-up shots, 30 second establishment shots, ten different shots of the encased brains and every single one is stock footage.
Not one second of this 96 minute torture device was funny, and the 'writers' seemed to know it (you have to use the term 'writer' loosely here, for it insinuates that the movie was written before filmed).
On second thought, it might be worth watching for young teenage boys who can't afford to rent porn and really feel the need to see naked women - no, I think they would even be disappointed.
Within minutes Frank (Edwin Owens) has become the tarantulas first victim, shortly after Gloria (Penelope Windust) has become the second & Dr. Hodgins (Pat Hingle) soon realises what's happening.
I am quite disappointed Souri Fumihiro's second attempt turned out to be such a failure.
Amber then rejects the possibility of an abortion, portraying herself as a caring, nurturing person, but is now ready to deliver a second illegitimate child (after the first, whose father was improperly identified for years).
( By the way , the movie is about a contraceptive gone wrong ) The first half had some light watchable and listenable moments , but the second half was Ufff .... TOO MUCH SHREIKING for my pleasure .
The first slasher half is rather exciting, with a couple of truly nasty murder sequences and the most laughably inept police investigation ever, but the second half is painfully tedious and derivative of much better films.
How is it that Defoe was beaten by Liotta the first time, but the second time Dafoe suddenly gets fighting skills and beats Liotta to a pulp?
(they stop by the house because it is the first right not the second, huh?)
But I didn't realize they would stray so far from the story by having Clotilde murder Verity in such a violent fashion and eliminating Clotilde murdering the second girl to pass off as Verity's body.
The second, is just personal to me, but I've always had my attention stolen from any news of anyone hanging dead.
"Why" asked the second Producer.
), he's also chained up for a good part of the second half, as if Naschy was as yet unsure how to use his 'creation'.
I think "Bertram's Hotel" is the one that disappointed me most since it was my favorite book, with "Nemesis" as second.
It's something that he'd like to try again, although he admits that he has neither the time nor the cash flow to direct a second feature.
I will say though this movie is obviously set up as a comedic fun-ride and not to be taken seriously for a second, the underling messages of homophobia and violence against kids still is very disturbing.
If this had been a movie about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, they would have him gunning down racists by the second reel.
I only watched this one because I have owned it for so long now when I quit watching the second series of Afterdark films.
Actually, for a good portion of the film, it's quite intense and suspenseful because there seems like such little hope for these kids, without a head once he's removed(..the kind of leader who was quite smart with goal of starting over, competent in his abilities, whose weakness was trust which leaves him vulnerable)against such amoral brutes with a nasty visage and even nastier weaponry..they resemble extras from the second Mad Max film, THE ROAD WARRIOR.
Director Ilkka Jarvi-Laturi was trying to present this as a lighthearted romantic comedy and international thriller, but it was marginal on the first count and a disaster on the second.
ADDENDUM; Went back too this film today (04/08/09) on TCM too see if a second look would alter our opinion.
I don't know if it improved in the second half as it got deleted after an hour..
My kids all want to see the movie again and the movie is definitely good enough to see a second time.
The second was a waste of money and talent.
We do not learn from the documentary too much about the sources of their music, we do not understand why despite the success of their second career and despite of them writing music for their individual careers there was and there is no new album since they reunited.
Wini Shaw made 19 films, this was to be her second to last.
You can tell every second they had very little money to spend, however, if a movie is to be expected that bad, one should simply not even start making the movie to begin with.
Therefore, Kathleen can utter ridiculous lines some "ice please" after she's just been belted by her husband and, without losing her pasted-on smile for a second, can make chirpy little jokes about her husband's disgustingly ugly drunken behavior at the party that she has spent most of the film (and perhaps most of her life) planning.
The second season was a huge let down.
For example, Henry was 40 when he met Anne Boleyn (20 at the time) and pressed to produce a male heir to secure the continuation of the young Tudor line (he was only the second Tudor on the throne.)
The second one just plain blows.
While the first one was about a search for one's self, the second one was about money.
After A second viewing I take it back completly!!!
It seems to me at second look that this film is a realistic look of how a lonley individual with serious past issues can slowly become completly insane and end up murdering people.
A second look at this film reveals a seriously under rated study of insanity.
The writer hasn't stop for a second to think of his writing, basically writing the movie and perhaps reading a book on how to write movies at the same time.
So Lady of the Tropics became Lamarr's second film and her only pairing with that other screen beauty Robert Taylor.
Of course the romantic sparks start the second that Lamarr and Taylor catch sight of each other in that Saigon cafÃ©.
Instead, watch "Jeepers Creepers" (the first or the second), which is a far better, far creepier horror movie.
With only a passing reference to Tim, the main character in the first Boogeyman, this film should not be classified as a sequel because when a second (or third) film in a series is made, there should be something there to make a positive connection.
The Saw guy... Who's the second doctor?
The film has one of the... no... it has THE most sickly, honeyed endings in the history of cinema, followed by a second ending, just as ridiculous as the first one.
Caine also appears in the second most grating thriller mystery ever filmed: DeathTrap.
I'm sure it worked quite well as a stage play but in the cinematic day and age of Fight Club, The Sixth Sense, and The Others, it's old and musty and easy to figure out, (does anyone not know that's Michael Caine as the Inspector Doppler in the second act???)
and if it does fool you, it's only for a second and not to very great effect.
In an attempt to pull in profit though they are given "ample" of screen time, a factor which encouraged a second viewing on video.
The second film of the "Mr.Wong" series is a technically primitive, unimaginably dull and talky mystery.
That's the first half, the second half deals with a group of monks who find a half dead Robinson who wandered to their door and they nurse him back to health.
The second episode is the last really notable one; Sonic infiltrates a military base and rescues Cream from the clutches of the government, who find the concept of an anthropomorphic rabbit girl to be ludicrously intriguing.
I lost track of the amount of scenes we have to endure where characters introduce themselves to other characters after a few episodes (in the second episode alone, Chris introduces himself to Sonic, then the next day introduces himself to Tails and Cream, who introduce themselves to Chris, who introduces them to his grandfather), and the lack of action the setting forces upon us (Sonic and company moves into Chris' household, and have to hide from everyone else for a few more episodes, then get the attention of the outside world after that) forces the writers to hammer out awkward "Komedy" (like the excruciating seventh episode, where Cream spends most of the time hiding from the household while a party is being hosted and generally gets into all sorts of wacky hijinks) to try and make the complete lack of action more tolerable, but are really just making the show even less dignified than the fourth Home Alone movie (you know, the made for TV one with French Stewart as Marv).
Brian DePalma, not anywhere to be found on my favorite director's list, really did a top-notch job with the first movie...if people complained that the first movie was too hard to understand, they will be pleased to know that the second movie throws not only logic out the window, but also any sense of adventure, suspense or fun...it's a big disappointment...i can't think of anything else to say because i am still dumbfounded by how LAME this movie is.
I liked the first and third but the second was awful.
John Woo is not a director he is a second unit director that got lucky.
The second part, however, turned into a supernatural slasher and I was actually quite thrilled, because the first part of the film had been really bad.
For anyone with or without a sense of religion, the amount of comments made in this regard would start to effect anyone with a sense of morals into having second thoughts about finishing watching the movie.
But their second film outing, "Orgazmo," has to be their weakest effort.
I watched the second half in fast forward, so i didn't had to stand this annoying moose.
Maybe the second after learning Lance Henrikson was the only 'name' actor.
This is the second pathetic movie I have seen in my life.
Finally, if you're looking to find a good performance out of Lance Henricksen, don't think for a second you're going to get one here.
The notions of regret, second chances and fear of the unknown were skillfully put forward, especially the philosophy that a physical manifestation of an object or being, no matter how accurate, isn't necessarily the object it represents.
The idea of regret and second chance in a science fiction film (the deepest and most thought provoking genre) seems dangerously trivial in comparison to values in Bladerunner, 2001, Invasion of the Bodysnatchers among others.
The other tag-line is "How far will you go for a second chance?"
Mengele, interrupting Mundt's "second honeymoon" dance with his stunningly ugly hag wife, throttling him to the ground on top of the hors d'oeuvres, and Frau Mundt's asking for a doctor only to have Mengele growl 'I AM a doctor, you stupid bitch', puts one in mind of some of the more classic moments from the Three Stooges.
Definitely not worth a second glance.
This one's a 2* presentation; the second "*" because it does have some mild "fascination."
Perhaps those will be included on the second volume?
Kevin McDonald was part of the second greatest sketch comedy show, the Kids in the Hall(second only to the state).
THE HORROR OF FRANKENSTEIN   Aspect ratio: 1.85:1  Sound format: Mono  Jimmy Sangster's feeble hybrid is a misguided attempt to fulfil two ambitions: First to remake THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN (1957) - the film which launched Hammer Studios to worldwide fame - with half the budget and twice the irony; and second, to promote Ralph Bates as their new 'youth-oriented' star.
Benny Perkins, the man who won a truck before and comes back to try the contest a second time, is a genuine cowboy genius.
The fact that the townsfolk are eventually revealed as 'slaves' of the giant ant community Â after having dissed their existence when reported by the vacationers who fell foul of them on a proposed island resort Â links the film with INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (1956) which, incidentally, was about to be remade (the second of four versions, so far!)
The second half makes absolutely no sense and is full of plot holes.
I was channel surfing in the USA and I came across some footage that made me nauseous ,courtesy of SHARK..that showed the wild horse races in the USA!.Disgusting,barbaric, ,appalling and abhorrent.I also note the AHA investigation as stated on SHARK also came up with,like Lord of the Rings..more injured and dead horses..it all sounds all too familiar..problems on set being covered up and not exposed properly thereby letting the self centered film industry get away with it again...-the second time in three years...and again the media covering it up..the bad behavior of the movie industry..I work on films...there is no need for any one or animal be harmed in the making of a movie.Large or small.We have been doing it for a while..we know what health and safety is.We are not all this bad.Kids this ain't no joke.This is not funny.If you have pets..do you let harm come to them in your house and under your care?.This is no different...on TV I saw mid west thugs doing cruel stuff to horses....unnecessarily......thugs with little in the way of common sense or decency treating animals badly ..and I presume there wives.
In the second episode we are treated to a candid camera-like take of a cross/eyed shepherd milking the flock and making cheese while feeding his pig.
I'm amazed he's working with the director again, but perhaps the second time is the charm.
"Meet the Parents", John Hamburg's second effort as a writer is much funnier and much better, so don't count him out as a comedic force in the future, but BLEECH!
In fact, the second visit would even grant her a touch of lesbian romance.
Just wait a second, the rescue will appear.
The second disappointment is the lousiness of the scene setting, especially the castles.
It's probably the second film I've ever saw where the special effects outdistanced the character portrayal and I didn't care at all.
How about the film's disappointing false second act.
The entire second act does absolutely nothing to further the plot movement.
If you expect to see a slasher kind of film under its second title, CLASS REUNION MASSACRE, well, you'll be disappointed by it as well.
I really regret every second of watching this mess.
Without second thoughts, I bought a ticket, went in and sat down in the middle-back of the theater without any expectations whatsoever.
The second mind boggling thing about this movie is how they managed to stick Christopher Walken in this film as the villain, Feng.
While the first mini-series was fantastic, the second one was just awful.
The genre declined in importance in the second half of the decade, largely because the broadcasting authorities were becoming more permissive about violence provided it was shown late at night, and in the eighties the industry, freed of its addiction to horror exploitation movies and silly sex comedies, underwent a revival when it returned to making intelligent and watchable films.
Lou Gossett, Jr. plays Augusta's wacky assistant who's into everything from drugs to mysticism, with a personality that can change in a second.
And of course its view of teen-aged life in the second Eisenhower administration bears not the slightest resemblance to any reality Â then or now.
The second half finally diverges from old Cromartie material but will probably end up confusing people more.
I think my main problem is with the Emilia Fox as the second Mrs. de Winter.
Occasionally the chemistry between Fox and Dance was good, especially the marriage bed scenes, but overall the direction and performance created a second Mrs. de Winter that made little sense to me.
Totally miscast - Emilia Fox is too confident, beautiful and elegant to play the plain, awkward, painfully shy second Mrs De Winter.
Had she been given a second chance in Hollywood, Louise Brooks might not have been so quickly dismissed into forgettable B-pictures that were the only thing she made after returning from Europe.
This got me through the second half-hour in about five minutes.
Nia Long who played as Jordan Armstrong acted the part as though she lived it every second.
First, he introduces a sympathetic Japanese character, Major Yamaguchi (Ken Takakura) in the second half of the film.
As the film begins, he's obviously a coward, but steps into the role of leader far too easily in the second half.
(its clearly the second worst film ever made!)
Holly's BAD at delivering her lines - it reminds me of second grade and how we'd read the parts of a play out loud in class.
You may want to give that quote a second readingÂ The daughter is also brilliant in this picture.
Check out Herschell's normal, 2-hour Horror epic, A Taste Of blood, on second thought, just take my word for it.
The second worst thing about the film is the direction--it shows no imagination or style whatsoever.
IF i had the unfortunate karma to view this (expletive deleted) in a theater, i would've walked out of this horrendously bad film...it is the second worst film that i have ever seen, beating out the venerable Zabriskie Point by Antonioni (which i walked out on the first time i saw it) which is now the third worst film i've ever seen....but i must admit that there is some pretty horrible (expletive deleted) out there which have forced me to appreciate Zabriskie Point more now...
!....total WASTE of sound producing instruments and the efforts of those who were reproducing the notes...i thanked my Atheist gods for every second of silence from the chatter-clatter of the music....  And i can't see why ANYONE would've gone to see this piece of (expletive deleted) except the reviews told me that Viggo's wife in the film had something to do with the band X ...oh well...then it was clearly word of mouth that brought drugged fans into the theater....
This is the second feature length film from noted short film director and writer Roystan Tan and I think this may have worked better as a short film rather than being dragged out into a 90 minute film.
What had me chuckling most, were many inserted reaction shots of certain actors, just standing there looking for a second, not saying anything, or just giving a short stupid reply.
Taye Diggs makes a second dazzling preformance.
On the second point, Bruce Banner was exposed to Gamma Rays by way of an explosion, not by some lab experiment or any other way.
The whole of the story had already been told in the 30 second trailer and there was nothing added to it.
Instead, the wretched script is awash with bad dialogue and, in the second half, silly corporate intrigue scenes involving Lee Majors slinking about the ad agency at night, trying to get to the bottom of boss Robert Mitchum's nefarious political machinations.
In fact, the entire second generation of characters in the film are as far removed from the context of the characters in the novel as possible.
"Pure Luck" is an American remake of the second one, made ten years later.
The second worst element though is the plot.
What I am talking about here is that in the second half of this comedy(?
By the second scene I knew I was in for a great film.
Ice Cube plays a kind of for-hire protector of the good-old United States of America as XXX in this second in the series which started with Vin Diesel in the starring role.
This Movie is the second part of the Foreigner, but the foreigner was bad, and now makes Seagal a second part of this bad movie.
Still, the second time I watched it I rewound the last 5 minutes and finally figured out that this is a fairy tale right from the opening scene, where a hustler lets us know that money can't buy him.
In Al's world things are black and white and never apologizes for a second for living his life by a strict code of morals of his own making.
I found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish.
On one of the second season episodes, they even had Max sleeping and dreaming - where the first season stated she biologically couldn't sleep.
Using top professional actors like Forrest Tucker and J. Carrol Naish as bad guys, obviously helps the piece, as does having the genre legend that is Randolph Scott as your ebullient good guy, tho Scott fans who haven't seen the picture should be advised he isn't introduced into proceedings till the second quarter.
and the funny thing is, in the second half in the movie, they FORGOT to put in the sound effects.
The second problem is one of the scientists was doing some experiments involving the nuclear reactor and no one can shut the darn thing down.
One can review the remake from the perspective of seeing it first or seeing it second.
The second short, "Confessions from the Original Nannies: The Authors of the Bestselling Book", is marginally more interesting as the book's co-authors Kraus and McLaughlin discuss their own experiences as nannies and the book-to-movie transformation.
With this, I've only 3 more extant Hitchcock Silents left to watch - THE PLEASURE GARDEN (1925), DOWNHILL (1927) and CHAMPAGNE (1928); his second film, THE MOUNTAIN EAGLE (1926), is believed lost.
The second time, I found it absolutely hilarious.
This is basically the story of a man who's made it in life the hard way without even a high school diploma but decides to follow in his kid's footsteps and tries to attend college himself to help his boy's attitude after he hands divorce papers to his second wife.
I do have to agree with Don that this movie was bad but since I'm a firm believer of the second coming Christ and have been a born again Christian all my life you'd think I'd really love this movie guess what NOPE I DIDN"T IT FREAKING SUCKED COW BALLS!!!
The first has some creepy moments (although they have little to do with the show's '60s incarnation), but the second quickly deteriorates into a simple-minded impending-disaster-on-a-train scenario that just left me cold and probably belonged in another movie.
The reality was that the only hint of a tie-in was the presence of David Vincent for what amounted to a cameo appearance in the first and second part.
The second kind of experiment involves no sex but lots of particularly idiotic violence.
Funny scene #2: The second hilarious scene begins when Helmut discovers, just as he is about to have sex, that he has no balls.
There is also a scene where she is running through a cabin, note: a cabin she has never been to in her whole life yet she runs through the house as though it is her very own home Â blindness can mean second sight with senses perhaps, but not the way this movie does it; it just looks silly, as I said, its poorly written.
This one's a 2* presentation; the second "*" because it does have some mild "fascination."
Their facial expression has too many changes in one second it's not natural.
Written & directed by Michael Almereyda I hated just about every second of this supposed film.
The second half of the movie is a bit more exciting.
Whoops - this inundation of characters is too much for the audience in the second movie as well.
It lacked the feel of a movie, and earned the second 1997 award of a "film that I almost walked out of in the first fifteen minutes."
Inevitably he wasn't going to do a second.
so just pass this turkey by in the video store and rent the first "Mortal Kombat" its Way better than the second one.. i DONT recommend this trashy movie at all ...
Another opponent, with 4 arms, supposed to be the third toughest, has a 2 second role and dies by a falling object!
So it stands to also reason that MKA would be about the second game, the one most fans widely regard to be the best.
The second Raiden was a wuss and every time we saw him he was going through a wall.
Like his earlier Bowling for Columbine the film is very much a set up, especially in the second half where Moore's antics or at least his camera crew and presence result in some staged scenes-the whole Cuba thing.
To have made this said reconstruction possible the two trains would have needed to be timed to the second, an event I find extremely implausible.
Garth is dreadful, even more so second time around.
Well, on second thought, I will check the "spoilers" box so I can state that it would have been nice to see a "Rosemary's "Baby"-like avatar of Satan play hide-the-salami with Karen Black.
On second thought, keep both eyes out.
That was my first mistake, after the pilot I hoped it would get better, that was my second mistake.
This is a very amusing piece of trash by Andrea Bianchi, probably best known for his ultra-gory zombie flick BURIAL GROUND(1981) and the casting of Orson Welles in his second film TREASURE ISLAND(1972), but he also made this entertaining little Giallo, the only one he made, to my knowledge.
The second worrying sign is when we realise that OJ has a speaking part.
The animation varies from very detailed to what seems like four frames per second.
David Goyer did, Blade 3 being his second time directing Snipes and he himself admits difficulties but the talent of Snipes won him over.
The title role is best cast, with the role of Wagner as a good second.
What about his second encounter with the Scarletts?

After the abundant comic relief, the second adjective to come to my mind was "unfortunate".
The worst part, for me, was the second musical number in the saloon; sung by Johnnie Fern as Diamond Dolly.
In fact, to see how to show expression in one's second language, one need look no further than Sergio Castellitto's performance in the French language.
The second lead is more physically attractive but her attraction to the two men in her life is mystifying and her past is despicable (as is her desire to continue the to keep the ill-gotten gains from that past).
He's supposed to be the second bad guy, along with the evil younger Queen that the King married(sure, seventy year old decrepit guy, she married you because she loves you!
Then someone noticed that they still had three days left on their equipment rentals, so they decided to film a second movie.
At the end of the second series just before the arrival of the Cylons on New Caprica there was a feeling as if everyone more or less hated living there.
When everything important happens at the last possible second, literally, then it's too contrived.
Right from the very start to the very last second we are hammered with the leaden narration of the lead character, nothing is left for us to see.
In The Bat, top-billed Vincent Price brings his silky, sinister elegance to the second remake of the hoary "old dark house" stage play.
In the first scene, Cameron Smith has a red-hot metal rod pressed against his bare chest while he's tied between two posts, and in the second, Brian O'Connor -- tied between two trees -- has strips of barb-wire tightened around his naked torso.
plus that "she knows the hospital" stuff... and then it takes her "one second" to figure it out?
Most of the great moments that fans will look forward to in the half-hour Tommy medley are simply missed or glossed over: In Christmas, they didn't show Daltry's screams after the line "Tommy doesn't know what day it is...", they showed almost *no* Townsend guitar shots in Pinball Wizard, there were excess crowd shots during the best moments of Go to the Mirror, and worst of all, in the second half of We're Not Gonna Take It (Listening to You), they robbed us of almost every shot of Pete's blazing guitar chords.
Perhaps Hooper thought he could capture lightning in a bottle for a second time, like he did with "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" a couple years earlier (even going so far as to bring back Marilyn Burns to play the part of a victim once more).
Being huge TCM fans we went for Death Trap, after all, Tobe Hoopers second film has to be worth watching right?
As his second film, he had the extremely difficult task of making an exceptionally well received German film into a palatable form for American audiences.
When we find out after the first group of murders who has been kept alive and how they are connected to the second story line (Clay's search for his sister), I had spent so much time being repulsed by the group of friends that I really had no emotional stake (re: I couldn't even remember the character's name) in whether the girl lived or died.
My second complaint lies with I expect that there will be the obtuse sex, drinking, and drugs in any "campy" horror film like this, but these first 30 minutes were so packed with inane boobs and weed shots that I was ready to consider this a comedy, not a horror film.
By the time we're midway through the second story line (I contend that this movie should have been called: "Friday the 13th: A Bunch of Douche Bags Go Camping, and Jason Voorhees Is Somewhat Involved") there have been so many crappy people on-screen, and they have been killed by Jason in typical Jason style, he just isn't that scary anymore.
Essentially, the new "Friday the 13th" synthesizes Sean S. Cunningham's above-average original along with Steve Minor's first and second gratuitous sequels to deliver the maximum amount of mayhem.
Mind you, Jason didn't don the hockey mask that provided him with more personality than any other slasher stalker until the second sequel, "Friday the 13th in 3-D (1982) and by that time his immortality was taken for granted.
Many key elements were there, but only for a second or two.
Though a little gothy (as opposed to Gothic) for my tastes, I was willing to appreciate the story of a second London existing below and alongside the proper one, and the intrigue that happens there.
one involving a second London under London utilizing the underground tunnels, could work impeccably, but not when it is weighted down with boring light filters, ugly art design, grating actors, uninspired direction, appalling dialogue, and bad production.
By the end of the second episode I was hugely disappointed.
I would put this one in the second category, though it is a bit duller than some of the cheesy old horror films from the 1950s.
The second largest flaw is that Aaron Eckhart is woefully miscast, leaving a character floundering in a story where he no longer makes any sense.
What should have been the gimmick for a 30 second restaurant commercial (in which the cooks are conjoined twins) is instead two hours of pure hell.
I am barely through the second tape of the series (there are three tapes in the set).
The second looks like it will be even worse than the first.
second, would a woman really not tell anyone for 40 years that she was raped, simply because the father told her to keep it secret?
In this case I felt like it was more of a good thing instead of "more of the same", sort of like getting a second helping of something great.
The result is still a second rate sequel with poor animation, and worse music.
On a second viewing, I liked much and fined exquisite and pleasing his HAMLET.
It was pretty bad, but I got to see myself on TV for a fraction of a second.
The second half, while more coherent and linearly plotted, lacks Peter Sellers - and - really - just isn't very funny.
The absence of Peter Sellers is palpable in the second half of the film, and although the film clearly attempts to remain light-hearted and Pantheresque, this absence lends a sadness to Trail of the Pink Panther which makes it a much more successful eulogy than comedy.
There are many potential characters: Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Herbert Lom, twitching again), the head of the French Mafia (Robert Loggia) - still struggling from their defeat by Clousseau in 1978, and even Sir Charles and now Lady Lytton (David Niven and Capuchine, reunited for this second film).
This second half of the film mixes Lumley's interviews with Clouseau's contemporaries with heavy doses of flashback footage (from earlier Panthers), all of it so much better that the new stuff.
For one, the film's audience must accept that adopting a child or inseminating a young wife are less harmonious actions to a newlywed's continued happy home life than the notion of pushing a husband (who truly does not desire to remarry) to marry an additional wife for breeding purposes with the resulting children being emotionally commandeered by the first wife while the biological mother (second wife) still lives on in the home with no deep attachment to either children or husband.
These bizarre occurrences are never explained but seem to serve as a plot device to gave a setting for discussing the personalities of potential second wives as each spousal candidate is interviewed.

This was apparently only the second movie he directed, so maybe he will learn and make really good stuff in the future.
And if you're sitting there (in the future) reading this wondering if the now famous directors second movie is worth a watch.
Again, unless they come out in the last 15 minutes, you see one in a 5 second flash sequence and the other for about .2 seconds.
and Kirsty is second billed in the credits, is in two scenes and about seven flashbacks.
The second is to show the underbelly of the liberal mindset and the seemingly rampant dysfunctional state of the family unit among the L.A. social elite.
Let me tackle the problematic second part first.
Repeatingly telling the kids to "SHUT UP," Michael A. Goorjian has the second best scene in the movie, given the tree-house flying lesson Gibson gives Wood (but, learn how to use your wing flaps and rudder pedals properly, before trying to fly a real plane).
7/10   Jake 'The Snake' Roberts v Bad News Brown - Bigbossman as special referee: Absolutely horrendous match as Bad News Brown gets disqualified for hitting Jake a second time in the stomach with a chair.
The Hulkamania thing became stale from here as we enter another 'clash of the titans' type match featuring the typical Hogan can't slam big guy the first time but does the second time type thing.
This is arguably the second worst movie I've ever seen as I rarely give movies a "1."
From the first second to the last the movie was a continued and foolish cut and paste of scenes that always seemed disconnected among them.
But then, only a second later when Scott stops the wagon, the guy is splayed out--dead as a doornail!!
Things which seemed odd the first time round becoming obvious the second.
There are two prologues,the second one placed after the epilogue,so if you want a book to read on the beach keep on with Dan Brown.
Don't think for a second that adds to its credit, though.
Granted, this is The Drews' second major project.
They could have written something hilariously funny into the second one about the Hanson Brothers going home to Minnesota.
For the second assertion the movie surprises with a disconcerting lack of proof.
And last, but by far not the least Marylin Burns PHENOMENAL performance is the only in cinematic history (a close second by that of Shelly Duvall in The Shining) that evokes such a nature of desperate and primal fear.
After the night in Brighton, the couples simply race home again, making the second half of the film just as unfunny and boring as the first half.
He probably found a second hand Batman suit laying around, and thought he'd show everyone his awful take on Batman.
He is a master escape artist and second to none in self defense.
We're talking about a man who saw his parents killed right in front of him as a boy; got hell from all his trainers as he prepared to become Batman; saw a close friend's double personality destroy him; after failing save a girl from drowning, got addicted to a steroid pill for which he had to lock himself in the cave for a month to recover from it(hence the unbelievability of the heroin addiction part); had his second Robin brutally murdered; had another sidekick (Barbara Gordon) paralyzed at the hands of the Joker; saw his other best friend, Gordon, stripped naked, tortured, and tormented with pictures of his daughter, also stripped, just after she had been shot and paralyzed; after going a week with less than a day's sleep rounding up all of Arkhum's inmates after they had escaped, got his back busted by steroid-laced madman; saw his beloved city have its own Black Death from the "Clench" virus, then further carnage when it got leveled by a 7 point earthquake.
The big part of the story is told in flash back Â in two episodes, each in first and second half.
Before I start I did watch this movie twice, i didn't like it at all when I saw for the first first then watched it watched it second, i did find it bit more funny then before.
That the film is so unrelentingly dark and so unbelievably sadistic in its second half, and yet fascinates even as it traumatises, is a definite testimony to the skill of its director.
The show was almost playing second fiddle to Jerry Springer.
The second tier of episodes has to do with unruly little teen girls who want to either get back at their mothers by sleeping with everybody in the world or want to have a baby.
the story contains plot holes you could run a tunnel through - and i'll generally overlook holes in a plot if the overall thing does it for me; and i just experienced an incredible letdown the second time i saw it.
Not sure if this movie was meant to be the second part of a drive-in movie double-bill, or (based on the quality and running time) if this might have actually been shot as a potential pilot for a TV series...Bronson looks fantastic here...he is young, fit, handsome, and would have made an excellent TV star had he been given the opportunity.
Then, of course, she has to go into a comedy routine the second time around, with the same results.
And a second, more important, lesson: when you do watch this, keep your expectations as low as humanly possible.
the raptors look terrible, especially when shot at, apparently the effects are similar to the video game DOOM where the blood splats occur for a second and disappear.
This is an awful,wretched,painful,terrible film, ranking second only to the excremental smear that is "September Dawn" on the list of inept cinematic portrayals of LDS history.
The casting is this movie's first major problem, and the writing is the second.
The story is very human, particularly the interaction between Clemons and his second in command, Ohashi.
Actually, that scene is the film's main highlight as it did almost change my look of disbelief to a weak smile for a second or two.
Don Michael Paul's second film as a director starts out surprisingly stylish with elegant camera-work and a patient drawing of characters and settings.
The film starts out with Mr. Bill Tyler (Charlton Heston) meeting up with old friend Henry Frapp (Brian Keith) by way of Frapp knocking Tyler down into the water along with his horses...HAHAHAHA...oh ok sorry I lost it for a second there.
The script is just a confusion of parts and after watching it again, Bogart seems to be playing second fiddle to Lee J. Cobb.
The film however has only one saving grace and that is the appearance of Chris Walken as the second in charge of a mob family.
so if there was any film with a cast like that you would definitely give it a second look.
I never saw a worse movie than this one (or perhaps if I count in I'll always know what you did last summer, this would come in second place)!!
How Clowes went from creating such a lovely screenplay as Ghostworld to churning out this desperate schlock is beyond me, but it's clear that something went terribly wrong in this, his second collaboration with director Terry Zwigoff.
The first 1/3 is a comedy with dramatic elements, the second third is a drama with comedic elements, and the final third is a bizarre dark fantasy that ends in a way I can only describe as "suddenly I am run over by a truck".
However, the second half of the movie just didn't quite work for me.
The second detail that disturbs me was mentioned in another user comment and I agree.
I saw this movie on TNT a few months ago, for only about the second or third time in my life.
She is never quite happy with her second life either.
Then, "Cactus Jack" and Morgan Fairchild, who met for the first time a scant thirty second ago, kiss, because we all know in movies like this, nearly everyone must be coupled off with SOMEONE by the end of the film.
I hope as he has matured he will be offered rolls as a mature romantic lead or second banana.
I guessed both of them well in advance & anyone who has seen The Sixth Sense will guess at least one of them it's so obvious & the second twist has no impact anyway.
Please, never fly with "Columbia Airlines", it is the second time, that they get a hole in the cockpit and a hero must climb through the hole in order to land the plane.
A true, true instance of a great bad movie, it's come a very close second to Shark Attack 3, which is of course THE BEST bad shark movie EVER.
Puffinstuff" was the most psychedelic, drug-fueled kids' show of all-time (and of that period), I would say it comes in a close second to "L.L."!
.... On second thoughts don`t bother because this is ape sh*t .
I liked the second part better than the first.
The cast struggle gamely with the subpar material: Kelly just about manages to retain his dignity throughout, the lovely and personable Irene Tsu adds some spark and spunk as feisty lady cop Pam, Geoffrey Binney is okay as the hip Joe Chicago, and Brown ain't half bad in a second role as the fetching and duplicitous femme fatale Leslie.
Robert McKimson's 'A Peck O' Trouble' is a second attempt to break in the character of Dodsworth, a fat, lazy cat who debuted in McKimson's frankly dreadful 'Kiddin' the Kitten' (a cartoon every bit as terrible as its title).
John Matthew Mathan debutted with SARFAROSH(1999) and people clapped and were amazed at how in his first film he did such a good job  Now he returns with SHIKHAR(2005)  We always say a second film is a judgement day for the director and John Matthew fails in it  The main problem is actually the storytelling, direction  The film has a decent plot but it's ruined  Ajay's role takes off well but his plan of making a city looks feeble also the film lacks the intensity because in between suddenly they throw in songs and other commercial ingredients  The comedy by Sushant Singh is poor  The film goes on and on endlessly in the second half and the climax spoils it further  Direction by John Matthew Mathan is bad Music is okay  Amongst actors Ajay does a cakewalk in a negative role but his role could be far more intense, the director wanted it to be on a lighter side mostly and even says he had cast Govinda for it before LOL Shahid too excels in his role especially in the second half Bipasha is okay, Amrita too is okay Javed Sheikh does well Sushant Singh irritates
It was so bad that it made me feel sorry for Alan Alda, who I don't think rises to the acting ability of a second grader in a Christmas pagent.
This is a bad movie but somewhat exciting a second or two with Gary Busey, excellent as always, in one role but this does not save this silly movie.
The second part of the first act has a family killed at gunshot by a gang led by a man named Kevin (Jeremy Northam), who murders these people because they withhold a computer disk containing information that could put every member in prison.
I just saw this for the second time* and I wasn't going to watch because it scared me the first time.
The second things that interests me in horror films is who the real villain is.
GS:U continues that second theme.
The second worst thing about it is the absurdly improbable web of relationships between the characters, which grows more and more laughable as the movie progresses.
After seeing this for the second time all (most) the way through I am beginning to warm to it.
You turn your head for just a second and she's gone.
Then everything switches gears, with the entire second half of the film focusing on Raymond Lemorne, the kidnapper.
So avoid this like the plague, don't give distributors any excuse to produce anymore copies of this rubbish and don't waste another second of your life actually watching it.
The second is laughably, horribly bad starring a VERY unattractive actress as a cop who wants to get kinky with a guy she never met before.
Greg Kinnear and X are the second "middle-aged" couple.
There has to be something wrong, when you start to sympathise with the second leads instead of the two leads, which is the main problem with Griffin Dunne's mildly amusing, nasty, mean and cruel romantic comedy about obsessed and crazy ex-lovers Matthew Broderick and Meg Ryan combining their powers to separate their past lovers Kelly Preston and Tcheky Karyo from one another by playing tricks on them.
The acting is second rate by a well known cast.
This was the third movie of him that i have seen(the first and second being GWH and DD) and its probably the last one of his movies that i am gonna see.
In fact, the remote sadness I felt was for the 2 second car crash, which was so understated, that you really had no chance to develop even a tear.
As I understand from popular opinion, this is one film that was fine the first time round, and not well received on the second go.
I think this movie was mostly just slapped together hurriedly with a second rate script and mediocre actors.
good Canadian movies are a hard jem to find ( as is any Canadian one) but this one is somewhat easier to find  after watching the first one i immediately needed to view the second and i isn't a letdown in any way to its predecessor.
i thought this show was awful cause new york didn't win and she was the one who went back for flavor the second time when she could of had someone else her mom was right she was the only one who really loved flavor not that dumb face ugly girl he chose gross what a fat hag gross new york is way hotter and sexier she is way more than the other girl flavor you made a bad choice you just better hope new yorks mom don't come after you but i hope she does just playing but why didn't you pick new york she is all you need telling you the truth she really loved you and you made her go home again after again sad but i guess thats you and whats up with the grills at the end i think its cute but i still think new york should of been wearing them
The usual flashback way of telling the story is slightly changed here: one character tells us what happened, the second one confirms the situations, but puts them in different context, giving them different meaning, and some crucial moments are told completely opposite.
But, the thing that amazed me the most was the fact that whoever made this movie thought for a second that it sounded like a good idea.
The second season of Masters is going downhill quick.
This 1 hour episode starts out OK, but falls off in the second half.
Finally, the second sequel...
second thing is i just can't believe what they did when they handled this flick in the post production: at some points, the scenes are completely out of order so again the story lacks!
Right after I saw the second one I got confused.
I just think the movie would have been better if they continued the end of the second one.
I would have had the girl from the first one and the girl from the second come back.
The second addition "Urban Legend: Final Cut" was nowhere near up to the standards of the first, but it was entertaining enough and a decent sequel.
The second flaw would have to be, yep, you guessed it, the terrific acting.
And then there are a bunch of seemingly important characters introduced during the first half of the film only to be forgotten during the second half, as if they never existed.
Brigitte seem to be haunted by her dead sister, who a was werewolf too and she will become too but she then takes a deadly second dose of monkshood, which would stop her of changing into werewolf.
I'll have to second the other reviewers' acrimonious bashing of this film, and offer the following additions:  Fans of horror movies quickly become inured to bad movies, since bad movie makers all too often start out in this genre.
From the characters who appear and disappear at random, to the "Hey man, you've always wanted to act" casting, to the horrible camera work and lighting, this isn't even on par with second unit material from a porn shoot.
Okay, first of all, notice how all of the other reviewers who gave this movie a good rating are either: A) From Canada (where the movie was made) or B) Helped work on this movie or the second one ?
Steve Guttenberg is surprisingly good as the son of a doctor who can't get into an American medical school, or even a first or second grade foreign one.
The second half is dull and disjointed; Xaviera has to seduce a stereo-typed Middle Eastern character and everything falls apart--they either ran out of money or everyone was zonked on drugs by the time they wrapped shooting.
I didn't pay to watch this film, which i am glad i didn't and when i can get the directors second film 'curse of the wolf' for free i will watch that too, out of pure curiosity as the director mentions that it is a much better film which shows that he has advanced as a film maker.
The editing is appalling, in one scene two people are fighting in broad daylight one second and the next its pitch black.
Anyway back to the movie proper, I got distracted for a second there.
It definitely do not deserve to be in the "Thriller" category, there is nothing thrilling about it at all(the first 48 minutes anyway, doubt the second half gets any better..).
I'm not buying it for a second.
They aren't paying attention to Rover, they're just randomly taking 30 second pauses after each statement.
From the second she enters the town set, she makes it abundantly clear that she has seen one too many Sergio Leone films and thought "I can do that".
This second sequel, made back to back with the third, attempts to cash in on the profitability of the original movie.
There are two main formulaic werewolf plots ... the first involves our hero changing into a werewolf, which will eventually lead either to finding a cure or to their death (as in the first movie), and the second is about a group of characters being stalked by a werewolf, and for an added twist perhaps the werewolf is one of them.
After seeing From Dusk Till Dawn, I was looking forward to seeing the second film, I knew it had a crummy rating, but I figured to give it a shot.
Worth watching the second half for a laugh, but don't try and take it seriously.
Also, I noticed that his second in command had 82nd Airborne patches, while his superior had 101st Airborne patches.
On second thought, keep both eyes out.
This surprisingly primitive 'streamliner' comedy from the Roach Studios -- with the collapse of the comedy short subject market in the mid-thirties, Hal Roach decided to go into feature production, first with films like the TOPPER series and later with second features that timed in at less than an hour -- contains all the standard cheap comedy motifs, including a Murphy Bed -- and runs through them in a rather mechanical fashion as made-it-from-scratch taxi fleet owners William Bendix and Joe Sawyer get tangled up with a girl who tries to kill herself and declares herself their responsibility.
When you see this film version, any musical whether the West End in London or Broadway in New York City will always be second rate to this cast.
During the second half of this movie the only thought in my head was "please don't let this be the twist, please tell me that writers are more imaginative than that, please don't let me have to watch the second half of this movie only to find it was what I guessed after the first 20 minutes".
He overdoes Fester so horribly, that I actually cringed every single second he was on screen.
This one's not the usual gore-fest, there's a cool scene when someone messily melts into ice cream but why did the previous two victims not melt in this way especially the first one who one moment is standing there & the very next he's melted to nothing within a split second?
I have only seen two episodes of the second season of this series and hope a third season isn't in the works.
Securing director Tom Holland for the second season of "Masters of Horror" seemed like a horror fan's dream-come-true.
One of my friends also said that I have to see "Bride" and "Seed" for the Chucky series, but I didn't want to see those without understanding maybe a few things I missed in the third or second Child's Play.
I notice that because he didn't explain nothing at all about it he changed everything the main characters from the 1st one should have been in the second one.
But all you got was a badly directed and acted film with a creepy villain trying to be a second rate Freddy Krueger (i.e.
But worst of all is the late Sandy Dennis in her second to last role.
In the second half of the film, there's a bit of gore and witty one-liners, but it's too late to improve the overall quality.
In fact, had the film not improved in the second half, I probably wouldn't have finished watching.
First, I never heard ANYTHING of them leaving earth and second, wasn't Ramirez killed in part 1???!!!???
There really is little good that can be said about this second Highlander film.
The second truely awful thing about this film is the acting.
on second thoughts i'd rather come and clean your toilet and i don't like clieaning toilets and don't know you.
It hardly needs saying but the problem for anyone scripting a Highlander II is that Highlander I concluded business comprehensively with no outlet for a second episode.
To fully appreciate how awful an idea this is you need only imagine a Star Wars sequel in which the action is suddenly set in present day Earth for reasons of plot convenience or a second instalment of Titanic in which it's revealed that Jack and Rose are actually time-travellers and are thus able to prevent the disaster and save all their friends.
They say that history repeats itself, for the first time as a tragedy, for the second time as a farce.
Well, I would say that in Cabaret every event repeats itself for the first time as a human drama in life and for the second time as a farce on the stage, but it would not be exactly true.
There are lots of details in the movie - brightly exposed to us by an excellent cameraman - which create a second, historical storyline which you start to understand only after you watch the movie for a while.
my sister and i had all four movies in the "House" series and decided to have a "House" marathon.we had just watched the first one,and had somehow made it to the end.but it wasn't easy.it was not a good film, at all.so, we suffered through the second one in.we managed to make it through 40 minutes of this dog, before we finally had to put it to sleep.this movie made the first one seem like Shakespeare in comparison.
And that's only because the cgi effects are so corny that they made me smile for a second or two.
Aside from some poor special effects (well good in a high school class project sort of way) the second story involving three troublemakers looking to profit from the murder of a native man, fails to really grab the viewer.
The second tale involves three career criminals who rob a Native American spiritualist, smoke his peace pipe, and are tormented by legions of computer animations created by first-year graphic arts majors from a community college.
I mean, the background of a full moon in the second story didn't even look real at all.
The second story has horrendous computer effects during the hallucination sequences.
The second story is about some mean teens killing an Indian for no reason at all and stealing his peace pipe and getting high off of it.
The second story sucks.
A lot like the second story in Creepshow 2.
I saw better acting at my brother's second grade Christmas pageant.
Aside from some poor special effects (well good in a high school class project sort of way) the second story involving three troublemakers looking to profit from the murder of a native man, fails to really grab the viewer.
The second one is so stupid and never frightening and even doesn't contain blood.
I need say no more, as my IQ score drops in a negative exponential curve each second I think about this story.
Hitting her at .0000000000000000000000000000000001 attometers per mega second!
For futuristic, it didn't look much like it, scenery was second class and nothing spectacular about it.
At Least Riget actually exists in real life (the Hospital in Copenhagen is Nicknamed "Riget" which Means "Kingdom", Due to it's Extreme size) And to round it all off, maybe Stephen could have continued the series instead of remaking it, since two actors died after making the second one (hence why there isn't gonna be a third).
I felt like I was watching ER second season after ingesting some cough medicine bottles.
But this...I would rather bathe in the waste product of all of New York then stand for this mini-series a second more.
Well here you go I'm typing some more text and I should repeat that Andromeda was fun in the first couple of episodes, and there seemed to be some sort of interesting back story to the whole thing but beginning in the second season, it lost touch with all of that possible storyline and became a senseless gunfight occurring over and over again and again.
The second category is nihilistic despairing romance.
Second the animators are not the same, the director is not the same, actually quite a lot isn't the same as the first one, which is a bad thing, since this second fritz movie doesn't have a proper story line, or a good script, actually it doesn't have anything of the things that made the first movie so wonderful.
Afterwards you could try the second, but don't get your hopes up.
The satisfying conclusion of the film finds Sinbad second to the Sultan, his allies, female descendants of the forty thieves, as the Sultan's new bodyguards and Amir and Sinbad II united in matrimony.
Instead, the first half of the film is wasted watching a despicable bunch of losers do nothing but take drugs and talk about sex; the second half is spent watching them stumble around an old building in the dark before being killed.
This was the second Wallander film I've seen.
After catching the first two episodes of this show and then taking a gander at this site's message board, it's pretty apparent that it is the teenage girls, and sadly a handful of grown women who are attracted to the so-called "Hotti-Gotti" boys as they've been dubbed who continue to watch with regularity and keep this pitiful and wretched excuse for entertainment (which can be likened to a type of mental Novocaine if you ask me) afloat just enough to cause A&E to run a second season or so I've been told anyway.
Also, as in many sequels they took a part of something that worked, and then overdid it the second time.
This is almost to be expected from the second story, which is basically just an hour of filler - but even the first tale doesn't adhere to any kind of logic (except maybe Jean Rollin's!).
We then move into the second part, which follows the vampire queen; played by a skinhead who looks a bit like Grace Jones.
With several of the principals either dead or turned into vampires at the end of "Rape," we now enter the second segment "The Queen of the Vampires."
This second and much longer portion also seems more rushed and less stylish than the first.
The first segment almost seemed to hit the right note, but the second didn't even come close.
It's a bland exercise in no-budget film making with a lot of bad acting, a barely glimpsed werewolf the size of a pony and sets made out of cardboard that you expect to blow down at any second.
the second half is so slow that "i wanted to rip my arm off, just so i could have something to throw(at the screen)" (yes, it's joey's line)  I was surprised to find that Mr. Bacchan, and Hema Malini could actually act so badly (hema-ji, has little or no role anyways) .... and Rani Mukherji and AB Sr. have none of the magic one has come to expect after "Black."
in the second half the cast and crew tried it's best to put the audience to sleep, (and a few did in fact doze off) but i kept up with caffeine and bore the film (as it bored me) so i could warn others about this heinous crime against film making!)
First of all, they seemed to just rush the love story, deciding that it wasn't really all that important, as Salman wouldn't even be in the second half of the movie.
The second half of the movie proved to be one of the most predictable and boring scripts ever.
When he tells his teammates at the beginning of the second half `forget what I said earlier' it's no problem for the audience since we didn't hear this kid make any speech.
For some inexplicable reason the `fake' refs stop making unfair calls in the second half and the hero's team starts to catch up.
Of course since the Code just came in it is abundantly clear this will be platonic and annulled the nano- second after Romero's capture.
I know that this is an movie made by one person, but to think that he could make 97 minutes worth of crap, maybe he could at least make 1 second worth of funny.
The second, star-wise, is interesting because it features Christian Slater (about to be hot), Steve Buscemi (had a long way to go before becoming hot) and Julianne Moore (had a long LONG way to go before becoming hot).
The second story was even worse...
I know that this is an movie made by one person, but to think that he could make 97 minutes worth of crap, maybe he could at least make 1 second worth of funny.
If the viewer, unlike me, is somehow able to remain seated throughout this whole production, there is little doubt they will ever sit through it a second time.
The second part of the "Ginger Snaps" trilogy picks up after the first one.
I loved the 1st movie and I found the second one to be a worthwhile sequel.
There is a twist at the end of this movie that I was not expecting, but on my second viewing of it.
She also played a great game in her second season.
The second was when the film inspired my friend to say "He literally **bleeped** Dostoevsky in the face".
Both stories run low on creativity and they're extremely repetitiveÂYou'd be better of watching `The Hitcher' instead of the first story and `The Beast With 5 Fingers' instead of the second one.
I enjoyed the stephen king tale, i thought it did a good job from adapting from the book and it was creative, but the second story, was the most god awful thing ive ever seen on film, it was just horrible, i was in pain watching this, do your self a favor turn this movie off right after the first story, the second one is so bad.
Spend the first 1/2 of the movie bored to tears and the second 1/2 wanting it to hurry up and end.
Forget his movies for a second if you can - and something tells me that LN is easy to forget (or at least advisable).
This movie was very disappointing and a major let down compared to the first and second Santa Clause films.
Seeing as the second one wasn't THAT bad, I figured this one would be okay.
I went to see this movie like I did the second one because I am a very nostalgic person and I wanted to relieve happier parts of my childhood by watching this film in which it's predecessor or The first one was a great delight in my young years.
They spend nearly hour just in the toy shop in this film and never show Tim Allan as Santa interacting with kids on the level he did in the first or for that matter the way he did in the second one either.
Then the second one came out eight years later and I loved that one too.
I liked the first film, loved the second one, but was highly disappointed with the 3rd film.
The second one was good too, but this one was just not that great.
During the second half of this movie the only thought in my head was "please don't let this be the twist, please tell me that writers are more imaginative than that, please don't let me have to watch the second half of this movie only to find it was what I guessed after the first 20 minutes".
He is legally married to Pam but because the state of Texas believes firmly in monogamy, he has had to resort to private ceremonies to 'marry' his second wife, Kathy.
BLISSFULLY YOURS is the director's second feature, and it all takes place in a single day.
I didn't believe it for a single second.
The second joke is that Victorian women were mostly at heart prostitutes; the saintly Lady Josephine's endeavours to save women from a life of degradation are constantly thwarted by the fact that they do not want to be saved and would much prefer to continue to prostitute themselves.
As for the second joke, that is surely rooted in some very strange and distorted attitudes towards women.
and a second later J.
I gave this movie one star because they rely on the old, stand-by suspense scene where the vehicle refuses to crank until the last second.
The first casualty--Ritch Petroski (Brody Harms of "Adam & Evil")occurs about 20 minutes into the action, and the shook-up survivors tear off in their Jeep and then have second thoughts about leaving their poor mauled friend behind.
- to look for water for their overheated vehicle engine (2) with one guy already killed by the bear, a second guy goes wacky inside the car and causes the driver to go over an embankment!
The movie instead plays the older part in the first segment, as one full flashback that tries to cram way too many events into one bit, whereas they should have simply tried to organize their own way of telling, and the more recent events in the second half.
You will throw your VCR out the window in a split second.
I cringed in terror during each and every single second of this crapola film.
The second half hour loses the mood but keeps near the plot.
This film was a programmer, slotted in as a second or even third feature on a single bill.
Despite her second billing, Teresa Wright is hardly in the movie at all.
(A quick check of the IMDB showed me that Pat and Jack were in the first movie but not in the second.
James Craig was the second loser she picked for a husband.)
The first half is stupid, and the second half doesn't make any sense.
The second one is about a group of persons, including the two morons, trapped in a bar, surrounded by the legion of the dead leaded by Togaio.
The second serious mistake was placing the disaster so near in the future (1982-83).
The fourth serious mistake was not hiring a skilled second unit director versed in English.
The second half of the film detours to the only place that can hide from the germs - Antartica, where all the countries representatives have convened and set up house.
WHO HIRES CHARO TO PLAY ANY ROLE.on second thought, she might have been one of the only good actor on the movie.
Now I was waiting and watching a second time just to get the music and well, I have it as a film snippet but don't know anything else about it.
And do it all every single second.
Philip is mentally ill, which could make him an interesting subject for a film, but all the film does with his illness is show him enter and leave a mental hospital, and fail to write a decent second book.
But she decided to give it a second try, thinking maybe there was something admirable about it that she missed the first time.
No such luck; it was just as boring the second time.
Seeing as the first one is impossible to integrate here and the second is just not directed with any understanding of detail what we are left is an approximately 40 minutes of slow-motion that does it's job in extending "Bad Boys" into a near two hours length.
Things don't improve with the second half.
It's beating around the bush for the first hour, and doesn't deliver much during the second.
He's dead (immediately pull sheet over head LOL)  I'm still cringing as I write this, if second graders presented this as a home movie I would expect better acting (and sets :) )  Please, let me write this comment without having to make up ten lines about a film that doesn't even deserve one!!!!!
This movie is totally out of tune with the first and second ones, which respectively were fantastic and good.
From the brutal approach to movie action of the former ones (thanks to Bruckheimer), this one has scratched most of this off (no more social realism of the first and no more really bad guys of the second) and replaced it with superficial layer of humor and Murphy's funny faces, which really aren't funny when you've seen them before in his stand up comedy shows or The Nutty Professor.
The fact that the film was location first, plot second points at everything that's wrong with Beverley Hills Cop III.
I have only been on this website for a few short days, and this is only the second review I have done.
The second film was more entertaining than funny - but it was still good and the characters were strong.
As incredible as it seems, the only one of the "Beverly Hills Cop" trilogy I'd seen before the other night was the second one which I've seen more times than I'd care to admit.
Remember how Foley tackled heavily armed and highly professional bank robbers in the second film?
Some of the twists are kind of fun and surprising, but many exist only to provide a split second shock.
Did you know that Tifa knows blindingly fast Kung Fu techniques that magically cause the camera angle to shift every second?
Unfortunately this shoddy scriptwriting cripples our interest in the second half of the film, with one 'outrageous' revelation after another resulting in a forced tragic ending.
My second grouse with Saathiya is the story.
Kims second and even more painful funeral poem/speech.
For my part, I found any ethnic connection being carried over into the story very unconvincing in both the book and this film, both of which come off as second rate.
Unfortunately, Orson Bean's performance demonstrates all the skills of an earnest teenager placing second in a high school audition.
But, even that is just a split second of viewing, to leave it rather questionable, as to if it was just a paint can.
I should also point out - As people have done on this page - that Peter Cushing doesn`t appear untill well into the second half
a boring story line that only starts from the second hour.
The pre-release hype was huge, the soundtrack became the second best-selling soundtrack of 2002, and to add, it had names such as AR Rehman (music director), Gulzar (lyricst), and two actors with a huge fan following, Rani Mukherjee and Vivek Oberoi.
Hopefully, it won't make it past the second show.
One minute you see a love scene begin and a second later someone is running their bicycle into a car.
They had two attempts at blowing up the train on successive nights and managed to break one of our home windows in the second attempt which happened at 1am with no warnings!
So one has to give France AND the second unit its props.
I think I made it about 85% through the movie, there was about 15-30 minutes left of it, and if the end redeemed it...well...I wasn't willing to waste a second more watching to see.
I saw Saathiya on December 20 at Naz8 Cinemas and again on December 25 at the same venue.I liked it even more the second time and intend to see it many more times on the big screen before I finally own the original DVD of the movie.
The second direct-to-video sequel featuring Pinhead to be released in 2005 is HELLRAISER: HELLWORLD, a film so lackluster that makes all the other direct-to-video Hellraiser sequels look like cinematic gold.
There were only two things that stopped it from being PG-13; one was the presence of a few vividly sexual scenes and the second was insufficient death to be a teenage slasher.
I cannot yet comment on the replayability of this film as I have only seen it once, but it is almost a surity that the movie would be as good on the second watch.
Gotta love the blonde doctors with killer bodies - the second blond chick was a particular great actress - SARCASM if that wasn't clear yet.
The second segment is a Monkey's Paw twist.
As this is taking place after the battle of Endor, how can there be another Death star that is completely built up like the first one, when the second one was no where near completion?
The second story was about a mother and her son, her son drowns, but the guilt of not being there drives her mad and she resurrects him from the dead.
No, she goes for it a second time!
The second story involves a woman who tries to bring her son back from the dead and apparently succeeds.
I'm hard pressed to come up with a second, so I doubt I can come up with a third.
I really thought he was wrapping it up somewhere near the second hour.
The second plot line is where this train wreck gets truly sad.
First, it could be because he's been having too much sex, or second, it could be because he's making ten thousand dollars at a time doing it.
There's a second act, so-to-speak, that tells the father's story that is interesting and better than the first and third acts.
I liked the way it was shot and the scenes, which I can appreciate more the second time around.
The acting is hokey, even for a low-budget horror film--I did not, for a second, believe these were college theater students.
In all the aforementioned cases the second item of each couple is considered "the good one".
Well, in my opinion, if the first halves of these couples suck marginally worse, the second halves are also all bad.
Now let's just think about that for a second shall we?
It may not be the worst film ever made, but it's certainly the worst British romantic comedy ever made, beating the hateful Love Actually into a distant second place - which I guess is some kind of achievement.
With his extreme closeups and quick cuts, Boyle can't even pull off a 20 second fight in a corridor without losing the audience.
*Spoiler*  A group of ethnically diverse astronauts are in the final leg of the second and last mission to chuck a cosmic paint can into the sun in an attempt to "restart" it.
This movie was directed only for money and you see it in every second of it: Throw in some gore, some metal music and some sex and those stupid horror-fans will like it.
John Jaspers (the ever-mugging Mark Frost) is given a second chance at life by the demonic M (Andrew Divoff- who should be doing better movies) as a razor-clawed assassin.
And it could be fixed where the first story could move into the second smoothly.
Perhaps his second stint in prison made him soft?
It might actually be that people who clap themselves are educationally subnormal rather than believers in one country socialist democide   The second point about being a philosopher is being able to state the painfully obvious , as in " the more coke you drink the more thirsty you feel therefore the more coke you will drink the thirstier you will become " To be fair to Zizek he does point out out that there is decaffeinated coke but no one spends a great deal of time and money drinking decaf , we drink coke because caffeine is an addictive drink and thirst has nothing to do with it .
the very tired male genitalia jokes , the farting & pooping (some body get this guy some of the pink liquid) , and all around cheesy lines; the only people who would enjoy this movie would be a group of sixth grade boys.The movie isn't a knock- off of Snow Dogs .I thought Snow Dogs was a really good movie.It's much worse.I would recommend renting this movie only if your video store has Rent one,Get one free specials.Maybe use it as your free rental ... hmm on second thought maybe not.
Nielsen plays a secondary role, and his character is definitely second rate.
Eminem, even at his worst, is brilliantly lucid, he is witty, clever, he makes jokes, splendid turns of phrase, and by his second album, was pushing buttons to push buttons, and the only people that got mad were people that missed the joke.
DARWAZA BANDH RAKHO is Chakravarthi's 2nd directional film after the flop DURGA and a small story in DBR  The film is a comedy fitted in 1 house which is novel but sadly the film falters as it progresses  The film starts off well but several comedy scenes are dragged and too chaostic  Yet there are several interesting scenes but the romance could be done without The film gets engrossing in the second half where lot of game plans are revealed but the climax is a bad joke  Direction by Chakravarthi is decent Camera-work is good  Aftab Shivdasani is in good form and acts his part very well though he doesn't get much scope to display histrionics Isha Sherwani annoys at places otherwise she is good Chunky Pandey is relegated to the backseat, Manisha Koirala is okay Snehal Dabbi is adequate Zakir is superb in his role Ishrat Ali is the scene stealer, he excels in his comic act He mostly is seen as a loud politician in action films but here he is superb Smita Jaikar and others are good
In the second half of the movie, she basically sits at home all the time being pregnant and waiting for her lover (the killer) to return.
The things that are discussed in the second part are also interesting and important but they are presented with too much contrast with the more lively first half.
The second one is very close to Dario Argento's style but serves not any other purpose than itself, unlike the great usage of similar effect in Argento's Tenebre (1982) for example.
Well, on second thought, not him.
i think the second Die Hard was strong also, but when the wife's character disappeared, a lot of the heart was lost.
I fall into the second category.
The murder of a lawyer's wife takes second place in importance to the impact of gossip on members of the small town.
Also there are more and more inconsistencies in the power of Peter Petrelli (replicating other's power) which is automatic when needed by the script (regeneration, be invisible, becoming radioactive etc..) and inoperative when really useful (replicating Sylar's powers at first, second or even third encounter, time travel from Hiro and so on) and not to mention that he never uses the ones he really need when he needs them (unlike Sylar), why did it take him the last episode to listen to anyone's mind (aside from the accidental encounter with Parkman), and why does he need his brother to fly him and play the firework while he can fly all by himself (his first ever duplicated power).
The cheap fight against Sylar, and the first few images of the teaser of the second season don't reassure me with the potential disappearance of Sylar's body in the sewage (how the Hell could anyone let him move even an inch) or Hiro in Medieval ClichÃ© type Japan....  Watch it when you really don't have anything better to do and watch Battlestar Galactica instead if you look for the best TV series ever (who said I'm subjective)
The second season put a damper on the mood.
When John comes to see his wife, Holly, at her office building during the company Christmas party, he asks if he can be given a second chance, but that gets slightly interrupted when terrorists enter the building.
When she shows promise, Lund starts saying that Lime might become second in command.
First, there is that unforgettable and visually-dazzling massive explosion made by McClane with a 'bomb chair' and, second, that epic roof bombing, which can be visible from the far other side of the city.
With a modicum of witty repartee, some excellent carnival locations, and an unusual villain (a master spy whose cover is playing a sideshow mechanical man), this one might have ascended from third to second rate, were it not for Morris's acting (mostly a matter of flashing a grin that looks too wide for his face) and his hat (its too-small brim accentuates his big square face and makes him look stupid amongst all the elegant, wide-brimmed hats worn by everybody else, even the weaselly villains).
The second movie Dr. Dolittle is now a rather rich doctor.
First people in the booth never look up and second you don't even go to them for tokens, you get a metro-card from the machine.
1988 and the undisputed number one action star was that Austrian body builder with the funny name with that monosylabic guy from ROCKY in second place .
This one is no exception, and the second, supporting female character is just as bad.
This second chapter is less repulsive than the original, but still contains more than enough sequences to make your stomach turn.
The second thing in the film, which is more of a goof... when Sandra Bullock had to go and rescue Nicole Kidman, the aunts were going to take the kids to the Solstic Celebrations.
David Yallop's "Let him have it" was riddled with inaccuracies and half - truths,consequently I approached "Chicago Joe" with some trepidation only to find that here he has got most of the facts right only for the entire movie to fall victim to the 1990's fad for faux 1940's retro,failing to grasp the most elementary fact that people during the second world war neither looked,spoke nor behaved anything like they would half a century in the future.Mr K.Sutherland is,brutally,nothing like a G.I deserter,rather he is a time - traveller visiting the past and trying to fit in to avoid discovery.Miss E.Lloyd, given the crutch of an accent to assume,does rather better as his moll/muse.
Many of them were engaged in the second oldest profession with the sideline of rolling drunks and the less- hazardous "badger game" and the presence of an obvious psycho in their midst would have been bad for business.
first of all there are no teachers at the schools, second all the schools are constantly trying to conquer the other, and lastly every single kid is an expert fighter, oh and on that note this show is so unoriginal that they actually decided to call the kid's "destined" to fight "Fighters".
O speaking of matches this show's second half degrades itself into a tournament anime show (you know?
"Die Hard" is lean, mean, and doesn't contain a single second of wasted screen time.
Was the first one Captain Kidd's and the second one some other treasure?
I think Tokyo Fist was his best, but this is a strong second.
Meanwhile, the governor and his essentially second in command have been working with pirates for a while now and are willing to team up with Blackbeard so as to get their share of his prizes.
He must have felt his career was going backwards as the production values here are second rate even by the marginal standards of his earlier films.
At the half of the film I left it, which occurred only second time in my life.
Put simply, viewing this movie just once is the very definition of an endurance exercise and most viewers accepting the challenge are going to feel the pain every second.
The "Making of" featurette (excuse me, I had to chuckle there for a second) is more entertaining than the feature itself, generally because it allows the viewer to see that the movie was a joke to the cast and crew, but the joke was on us.
One minute you see a love scene begin and a second later someone is running their bicycle into a car.
The whole beginning of the affair between Johnson's and Kerr's characters is too facile to believe for a second.
Casting isn't great, either, as Australian Richard Roxburgh makes the second worst Holmes in recent memory - the top "honours" there go to Matt Frewer for his snide, spastic sleuth in those awful Hallmark TV films.
I am not sure what is was but I will say this is a movie I probably would not watch a second time.
(The second plot should have been about him).
The second problem is that the characters are not interesting.
The movie was also very poorly written and badly acted, every second word the main female protagonist said was a curse word and the male character didn't was mute or something.
In a society that defines its heroes by the number of touchdowns or home runs they score, it becomes second nature to endow that appellation on people actually doing something worthwhile, like battling for their lives (despite the fact that that's tangential to heroism).
Pitt is a bad actor in this & still is a terrible actor now...The problem with this film is the acting, plot, setting, music etc.... Somewhere there was some potential for a campy/scary film , but unfortunately it seems to be more intune with an amateur gore hound & friends running amok with a second rate video camera.
The first is it's one of Chaplin's first films where he plays a relatively straight role throughout the film, and the second reason is it contains perhaps his first real attempt at pathos in his films: He draws a smiley face on the bar room floor of the girl who left him.
This is the second Chaplin film I've seen where restoration has failed by changing the editing, like this, or reversing the images.
The pilot holds little to draw an audience back for even a second look, let alone an entire season.
It was directed by Hitchcock himself, and like his excellent 'One More Mile to Go' (1957) with David Wayne and Steve Brodie from the second season, depends a lot on silence and trademark Hitchcock cutting and POV shots.
My Grade: D  DVD Extras: blooper reel; 3 stills galleries (dedicated to each of the 3 scream queens in various states of undress); Director & producer commentary;  a second commentary (this time with Brink Stevens, Michelle Bauer, and Richard Gabai)
"Breakdown" (Season 1, Episode 7) was the second episode of "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" to be personally directed by the host, and, tellingly, it's also the best of the series so far.
The second person he tries to save, is the most crotchety and annoying stupid old man you've ever encountered.
This is because of the second major problem with this movie: consistency.
Or told about their dear father's second secret family that you never knew about?
In slow-motion with the sound turned off, the camera pans outside where we only see blasts of light every second and a half.
And the second family was such a non-factor.
The second major set-piece is the final showdown between IrÃ¨ne and Pound.
The anticipation builds every second after that because of what the director has shown us what happens to those who have been given the potion, and we fear for Dr. Allen.
I don't comment much here, actually this maybe my second time, and it's often said there are much worst movies out there, but this is the worst I've ever personally experienced!
Was a big question in my mind now even Rishi Kapoor feels the same in AALC which is very bad  I mean please the superficial way of showing America puts people off and in today's overseas audiences dominating times this isn't good  The first half moves in different lanes and the love triangle is done to death  and the second half gets better a bit Akshaye's realization is well handled and then the film ends well but the sudden change of the other son is too much  They are many problems in the film like the first half which moves in different lanes and not proper treatment is given to most of it  Rishi Kapoor directs some dramatic scenes well but he needs to improve his storytelling, overall a decent debut by one of the finest actors as a director Music is okay  Akshaye Khanna shines in his role, He was always a good actor but signed bad films those days Barring his receding hairstyle he leaves a huge impact as an actor Aishwarya is plastic as ever Rajesh Khanna is okay Kader Khan and Jaspal Bhati are good Satish Kaushik is funny Paresh Rawal is good
Third, sometimes they repeated the subtitles, sometimes they put on a long subtitle for .1 of a second.
Unfortunately, the second half of the movie is nearly dedicated to the white family.
As a straight man, I'm not very fond of 90% of men (most of them haven't got the heart, openness, and sensibility that I can easily find in many female friends), but the guy in this movie was extremely disgusting and is shown as a typical 1960s smug, self-opinionated alpha male who doesn't ask a woman once he has made up his mind, and who isn't interested in her thoughts, doubts or feelings (this being another ugly stereotype in this movie: a man doesn't have second thoughts, doubts or too much feelings, while women are so despicably weak that they consist of nothing else).
Firstly, this is only the second review I've ever posted on IMDb so am unsure as to what constitutes a spoiler to you guys so have checked the box just to cover myself.
The second part really got interesting, but then gave way to a simply pathetic ending.
But this film was poorly made, and the more recent actual discover of the broken Titanic wipes out any second chance for turning this fine novel into a movie again.
The first season was good and so was the second.
It was wicked lame; the sniper guy shoots the president from the second floor of a building across the street.
The ending was annoying, first with her cutting only one of the straps on the tunnel and it expanding and then when she made the last second phone call.
The second tells of how she was seduced and became pregnant.
The heart of the film is in the second story.
More or less the entirety of the second half of the film could have been cut (from the young couple parting outside the Eiffel Tower straight to the finding of the ring), and only to its improvement.
Actually, on second thought, let's not.
The second had the mom from a family of religious fanatics, and a son wearing a "Promise ring," swapping households with a gal in a self-styled "ultra liberal" family with a son and daughter, each proclaiming himself/herself, respectively, a "stud" and "wild child."
The second one was likely to keep some of those girls off the street for at least two hours.
Yasmin I did not believe for a second she was Spanish everything she said in Spanish was common words my dog knows!
Bing Crosby stars in his second big screen version of the Cole Porter Broadway smash, although this plot has been modified slightly and brought up to date 50' style..it therefore tells a completely different story to Crosby's first version twenty years earlier.
I like the graphics of this odd new dimension or reality (that the Traveler takes them on the second burst of speed).
And, watching it a second time I knew the movie, which for some reason made it more entertaining.
L'Annulaire is the second feature film from director Diane Bertrand, who also wrote the screenplay for this adaptation of Yoko Ogawa's novel.
The white actors are second rate at best.
On second and further viewings, it struck me that seen as an extremely dark comedy, it's hilarious.
The director builds some good suspense towards the end, but the film is almost destroyed by the killer's utterly LAME puns ("I'd get a second opinion if I were you") that make you wonder if the screenwriter was a seven-year-old.
I'm not saying this movie totally blows, there are some cool scenes, but it's so incredibly redundant it can vanish into thin air every second.
The plot is nonsense, the central character smug, the acting second rate,and the setting totally unrealistic.
The second explosion you do see something, but it's off-centre and it lasts all of a second.
In a very contrived twist, the two men who love Knapp have to work together to save her life--she's on a train bound for a bridge that has just washed out and there isn't a second to lose!!!
Neither of it should give second thoughts to any of those who believe that kids are still kids, despite what modern society tries to make them to be or make us believe they are.
This is the second Poirot I've put back in the box before finishing.
I felt it warranted this second watching and my daughter also approved of it.
And the second thing that bothers me even more is that at least 10 (!)
  I used to be a hugh fan of the original Harry Enfield show on english television, but after seeing the apalling excuse for a movie of "Kevin and Perry" last night, I'm definitely having second thoughts.
The erection jokes weren't funny the second time, and got decidedly boring after the 20th attempt.
While I loved the first one due to its excellent writing despite its low budget, the other Bancroft films have been mediocre at best--mostly because the writing was, at best, second rate.
I saw it for a second time last night and to be honest it`s not much cop .
It`s just another predictable story of a newly wed couple getting lost and spending the night at a creepy mansion that`s owned by a woman with a west country accent and being a horror story it`s always bad news to spend a night at a mansion owned by someone with a west country accent   Two things I noticed about watching it for the second time : First up is the very poor budget .
Secondly watching it a second time you can`t fail to notice how predictably it all plays out .
The only "cyborg" here is a second line woman who actually does not behave as a cyborg at all.
If you can stand some blood and some guy in a sea monster suit pretending to hump a lifeless naked female for a second, then this is your film.
Some of the editing is very bad, for example, Keitel standing on a elevated road, and a second later getting on a tram down at ground level with no explanation as to how he got down there (that part's probably on the cutting room floor.)
"Necronomicon" is an analogy of three short stories:1)"The Drowned"(Christophe Gans)2)"Cold"(Shusuke Kaneko)and 3)"Whispers"(Brian Yuzna).In my opinion,the first one is the best one maybe because it's highly atmospheric and a little bit creepy.It has also very appealing cast(Bruce Payne,Richard Lynch or wonderful Belinda Bauer).The second one is very weak:boring and full of uninteresting characters.I didn't enjoy it.The third one is too bizarre and also very ridiculous.It has some nice gore effects and nothing more.I suggest you to watch only the first story-"The Drowned".Don't bother with rest.My evaluation:4/10 perhaps 5/10.
Some memorable images, but an unmemorable film unworthy of a second viewing.
Most of Skiffy's creature-feature programs are undeniably bad science fiction, and not worth a second look or thought, but succeed nonetheless as entertainment, which is something that they share with undeniably good science fiction like "Babylon 5".
The second time listening to the commentary from the producer and the director.
I sat through it once because I lived in that era, but it is not worth a second showing.
First night of the Bloody apes, second Curse of the Doll people & then Cemetery of Terror.
Head over to Grave Robbers for the second film review of this flipper disk from BCI Eclipse
He dies when he falls out of a second story window.
I thought for a second that finally someone would talk about the extent of this aspect of child abuse in Africa, where there are so many unscrupulous thugs who supply children with weapons, and let them kill (and be killed) at will.
I became 100% convinced that I would hate this film the second some supposedly "British" guy opens his mouth and starts talking with an accent reminiscent of Dick van Dyke's performance in Mary Poppins.
One certainly doesn't believe for a fraction of a second he is "in love" with the fag hag who he is supposed to have fallen for.
I can only imagine that the director was a real big fan of Steven Spielberg's Jaws as this is his second shark flick where sharks are not the main focus, and by rights don't actual have a real part to play in the story.
Strangely enough the second time around I found much to like.
The second half begins after El Topo is shot dead.
Watching this film because of John Lennon's endorsement and a short synopsis I had read, I found myself very upset about what I saw and disappointed with the story as a whole (particularly the second half = the acting and plot went downhill very quickly).
But the second time, it doesn't fit at all.
When the movie begins - and I mean the second it starts - shout out, "Rushmore."
No, on second thought, even if those two conditions are met, there are still better things to do.
Very early on, for those looking for her, she is seen in 1/8th profile for less than a second and then holding on for dear life as an open ended wagon bounces along the dirt road with her and her daughter in the back.
Thank God this movie only lasted 84 minutes, because it was pure torture, the first half was just your average bad teen movie (what I expected) but in the second half it turned into a real nightmare, It make Police Academy films look good.
The weird thing is the horror moments come across as something of a second thought.
The odd second half is when the 4th July parade starts and exploitation comes to boot with the killer being resurrected and knocking off victims who disrespected the American way of life and not supporting the troops.
The second rate direction by Lustig is rather tosh in patches and kind of restrained.
There wasn't even a second of plausibility in this picture.
The second segment, "The Ledge", is a pretty drastic drop in quality.
The second should be used for insomniacs or King completists only.
I will give it a second chance when I find it because as far as I know, it isn't available on DVD.
The stuff with April's family is just painful to watch and rings false from the first second to the last.
The producer(s) must take out a second mortgage or something else dire, and then roll the dice and hope that enough schmucks will shell out their hard earned cash to gobble up their vile stew.
No sequel should work where one needs to see the first to understand the second; the work of the director is to allow first time viewers to understand their goals, missions, and tones of the film without forcing more money out of their hard earned pockets.
I was all excited to get to watch the second one and it ended up being the worst show I've seen in a while.
You'll also notice what a terrible choice they made by casting Robin Dunne as Valmont... Then in the second scene, you meet the two best things in this movie, Amy Adams and Mimi Rogers as Kathryn and her mother.
If you've read a review that says that 'If you likes the first one, you'll like the second one' the only reason that is is because IT IS THE EXACT SAME MOVIE!
I'm sorry to say that I watched all of it - but I was in continual hope that there was going to be something better happen any second.
What was shown was simply Bob Saget reenacting his job as host of America's Funniest Home Videos when he used to provide voiceovers to the five second clips in order to make them only slightly more amusing.
Though this one has the same director as the second this time there's a new writer which is a very good thing.
The action is okay and the setting is okay the special effects are more believable than the second and much more effective.
With so much competition,it is so difficult,but Paul Danan,desperate enough to star in both series,is the nominal winner;so amazingly smug and irritating that even a prostitute he's just paid Â£1,000,000 would think twice about associating with him,but he's closely followed by Abi Titmuss (notorious for her lascivious public image,but curiously reticent here,maybe because of pound signs in her eyes),Alicia Douvall(grubby groupie),Calum Best(tenth-rate playboy and a poor imitation of his late father George,but minus the peerless footballing talent),and Sophie Anderton.Yes,the ex-cokey model blubbed,scowled,sneered and caterwauled all her way out of our hearts,though she may have been the reason why TV bosses concluded that even this awful spectacle went below the lowest common denominator.By the second series,even the "C" word was dropped as the producers were reduced to persuading the stepsons and stepdaughters of actors and footballers to non-entertain us all.As for who won,well who cares?
(She no doubt looked leggy and good from a second balcony, but on screen--gah!)
I loathed every second of it.
A bland, derivative, tasteless film about power, sex and wealth, that fails so miserably that its failure becomes a medium of expression and gives the film an unintended second narrative level.
They are meant to be the reason for the film earning a second star.
As the second cinematic presentation of the 1789 mutiny aboard the BountyÂthe first was also made in Australia in 1916Âthis film is required viewing for anyone interested in that historical chapter.
This second half of the dual narrative strategy is vastly more successful than the first and gives IN THE WAKE OF THE BOUNTY its timeless quality.
The second half, with only one very brief coda of another flashback of Christian and another mutineer on the island, becomes a time capsule of an apparent paradise lost; today the island has fewer than 50 inhabitants.
I watched this with a dim knowledge of what went on at Bletchley in the second world war.
The way it is just doesn't work and shouldn't have been financed or released onto an unsuspecting public...I'll take a second look at anything Woody Harrelson is in from now on and won't spend my oney on anything Penn's in charge of...How does Jr. say it??
In the second part, Nukie gets to know some talking monkeys, humorous tribesmen and their cute kids, a nun, a drunk, and Steve Railsback (probably also drunk).
I pass this as a warning...every second of this movie is unwatchable.
i don't know what to comment about,there's nothing in the movie to comment about the first half was a teen-movie the second half was worse(the cave scene was okay) burrow scene was pointless(actually i found the entire movie pointless) there was no emotion in the end scene and the dumbledore's death scene(i was happy dumbledore was dead and the torcher movie was over) ginny weasley is given way too much importance(she hides the HBP's book and not harry) and i cannot imagine lavender blabbering about ron in front of the teachers let alone the headmaster dumbledore asks harry about his feelings for hermione there is plenty of these idiotic scenes,i don't understand how so many gave it 10/10 this might be the worst movie i have ever seen,shame IMDb doesn't have a 0/10 rating
Overall, this movie just continues the downward spiral these movies have been in since at least the second or third film, and is easily the worst yet.
First let's see what we had in the book - two amazing and breath-taking battles - one around the Ron's house and the second at the end of Hogwarts.
The second battle is more interesting, because it's just MISSING.
The second half of this episode is a genuinely frightening horror tale with no letup till the memorable ending, which leaves our heroes M & S still basically in the dark, only able to guess at what just happened.
The second scene is that of Jim Asbury handcuffed in the basement crying as the python slowly crawls down the stairs to kill him.
Olivier Dahan tries to build on the success of the first 'Rivieres pourpres' and brings back Jean Reno in a second series which has little in common with the first film, unfortunately.
It starts with the great Vincent "Dobermann" Cassel not being in the second part anymore, but he wouldn't save that stupid story anyway.
This was only a sequel to the second of the "Sometimes They Come Back" films, by way of the demonic characters wandering about in it.
The urge of pressing the FF button every second scene was so enormous that I had to give in.
It also has very little to completely nothing to do with the original Stephen King short story (this film was released as a second sequel to SOMETIMES THEY COME BACK, so go figure...).
Her second husband (Steven Lang), not the boy's father, is a little more lenient in his views, and this causes conflict.
I was going to wait until a second viewing of CASINO ROYALE before writing a comment for it since my opinion on a film occasionally does change the second time around, but I am absolutely stunned at the positive rating of the picture so I feel I must get my two cents out while my grips are fresh in my mind.
Still, let's give them a second chance, here comes the long-awaited opening credits.
A second movie IS NOT necessary at ALL.
if you want to watch an idiotic attempt at an interesting second world war story, with no thought at all towards realism then this is the film for you.
This film had me second guessing the FCC and the sanity of the people at Dreamworks, who as of the last few years have really allowed a lot of innuendo's and straight forward adult oriented remarks into their kids films.In this film towards the end the sexuality of the film takes one gigantic leap where two title characters roll around on the ground in a make out session.
On the American market, two basic trends can be observed nowadays: First the sustained lack of availability of monumental German as well as general European films, second the flooding with cheap editions of even cheaper film elaborates for which even the plastic of the DVD is wasted.
"Jess" Francos work belongs to the second category.
The writing is so terrible I wonder sometimes if maybe it is actually non-existent and maybe George Stromboflofoapoplfous (I won't even waste one second of my life trying to figure out how to spell that name!)
Now that the second season is concluding, I want to say that I HATE this show, which gives off a bad vibe spreading like a plague.
Nevertheless, the Japanese are portrayed as vicious, omniscient antagonists with the Nazis running a close second in this tale about pr-Pearl Harbor espionage.
In a plot seldom coherent, Theresa Russell, billed second, is cast as Alex Canis, A.K.A.
This is definitely a sequel that you MUST see the first one to understand the second one and this is a sequel u DON'T NEED TO SEE.
The aging "second generation" cast members look awkward, particularly Spanky McFarland, who is really too old to portray a kid.
He understands that he has given a second chance, but someone still has to die, so he must choose between his life, Peter's or Clair's.
One could say that salvation could be obtained just by watching half a second of this movie.
Friend:"5 cents a second."
I am second guessing myself over my "1" rating because I usually reserve 1 for extremely bad movies but I couldn't give this higher than a 1.5.
I'm actually surprised that they decided to even give it a second chance as a TV show.
3/10 ..Years later we got a second installment .Well just as before I had to see it.Groan..I didn't expect the "sequel" to be any different (but wait what a difference time makes ) low and behold my current favorite TV serial was born.
The second time, he is the protagonist himself and tries to prevent Peter's death, but unfortunately causing the exact same event to happen.
Example: The wooden sword that Arn just happens to hold in his hand for a second as his mother is submitted to the monastery (so simplistic, and totally out of line with his character's development in the book).
Towards the second half of the movie I was at least hoping for well-done battles in the holy land.
for those easily shocked and reluctant to give a second thought about anything.
And to a lesser extent, MEMENTO, which is fun on the first watch, but bored me on the second, since no new clues are revealed.
I'd be keen to see the short version and give 'Movie Crazy' a second chance.
The direction was the second worst part of the movie (the first being the actors), i guess some people have no artistic vision.
The time allotted to Africa is a distant second and focuses on Kenya, with a much smaller Tanzanian component.
It's based off of the second Harry Potter film, which was good.
Then 2004. came out second Starship Troopers... and I thought to myself " This is some lame try to make more money on the fame of first movie."
Avoid second Starship Trooper and the third.
i don't know who's idea it was to make a third movie after the fantastic flop of the second, what did that sell?
This movie is possibly the worst movie i have EVER seen, as the first one is one of my favorite sci-fi films of all time i have been bitterly disappointed twice so far !please save yourself the same heart ache and just watch the first Starship Troopers again while imagining in your own mind the endless possibilities they could of embraced to build open, then if you really must, watch the second and third films and see how it was completely and utterly screwed up.
However this movie...  1) This is the second time they released a movie with Starship Troopers title that is ABSOLUTELY rubbish.
The second they tried to put religion into it, it seemed like it was some Christian fan-bot movie.
Haven't seen the second installment in the series, but the first one, the original based on Heinlein's novel, is really good.
On second thought, find it, watch it, and be on the cutting edge when it becomes popular.
On second thought, find it, watch it, and be on the cutting edge when it becomes popular.
This is only the second film from Tonino Ricci I've watched, but I can already safely say he's one of Italy's worst horror/exploitation directors!
I have seen this program advertised, but had never watched even a second of it until today.
The second type of people are common humans, are most of us, maybe they know their abilities, so they don't try to, or they just don't eager to explain it.
The rest of the early scenes were pretty banal, John Carpenter's version of character building, leading up to the second half of the movie where it was basically a action slasher.
Then how come she was alive and kicking in the second Half???!!
But in his second movie you can see, that there is no substance in his art and talent.
This was the second Bollywood film I saw, and it remains at the top.
I'm not sure why fans like this show and keep asking for it to come back, if it were for me i wouldn't watch a second season of this show, and I'm glad there isn't another season, because it really sucked !
The second soon meets the same fate.
Could he have been the second gunman at the Sheraton?
The second half is filled with emotion though the Aamir-Preity affair has been stretched a lot thus making the film a bit lengthy.
Marsh wisecracks about "triple bourbons for lunch," gleefully brings a second full pitcher of beer to his table, and always has a bottle handy.
One would think that CC would have realised all this prior to the second film - but no.
Dishonored is the third of three films that the director/player team of Josef Von Sternberg and Marlene Dietrich and the second for Paramount when they were imported from Weimar Germany.
"krish" is the second part of Hrithik's film "Koi Mil Gia" which got some good ideas and made good business.
In the first half,I mistook Krishh to be a kid movie,meant for kids below 10 years of age.In the second half i realized its not even a kids movie..its just a bizarre dumb movie that has more holes in its script than most adults can count.
This is really the second time I have watched MST3K and fully understood it.
The second plot has the singers getting in a fight and one of them going into the forest and getting killed by Trumpy's fellow creature so they take her to a house and then they decide to go to the rangers house and tell them stuff I guess.
It doesn't look like a film with very many second takes or screenplay rewrites, and the poor actors (who come off as European community theater players at best) are left to struggle with the script as best they can.
The second was practically a copy cat.
The second time this movie played here, it was the replacement for some sailing-contest, so I thought there was no hope on getting the name of the movie, since they don't show the name of the replacement-movies in the newspaper.
These one- dimensional characters are plain senseless and seem to forget too often that there are killer ants around, after battling them just a second ago and they don't seem to know ants can climb!
Apart from that the second part of adventures this way isn't amusing Kevin as first, mainly thanks to darker climat.
The bulk of the second half of the movie is just showing Roth drunk and making a fool of herself.
Right now this is the second worse HK movie i had ever saw behind the New Option.
When I heard Daniel Stern speak at Lewis and Clark College in September, 2004, he explained that in the case of "Home Alone", everything was pretty ridiculous, but at least they only did it once; he affirmed that with the second one, they just repeated everything.
this piece of sh*t is well just that a piece of sh*t. it has loads of glitches popup graphics handling of the cars is not as good as the first one it is too sensitive on the second one compared to the original.
i have the first one and will probably have the third one but i will not ever have the second one.
I enjoyed the first film, but the second one was kinda sad.
I watched both the first and second pilots on youtube (go to youtube.com and type in Red Dwarf pilot).
Now on the other hand, the second pilot looked much better.
But,the second pilot I'll be nice and give a 4, if not just for Holly and The Cat.
second, He also felt that American audiences wouldn't feel comfortable with a creature evolved from cats so was there a way to write the Cats part as human, and lastly, Does it HAVE to be set in space?"
i am interested to find out where the second version of the Cat played by Terry Farrell (A Woman???
In unbilled bits that last a second or two are such luminaries as Burgess Meredith, John Garfield, Marsha Hunt, Everett Sloane and, I'm told, Henry Fonda and Marlene Dietrich.
because it won't work for a good while when it is in the water, second of all where in the name of god did they get the guns?
Horrible actress although for a second I thought it was Priyanka Chopra only 2 seconds later to have my dreams crushed.
And it is so very bad acted, that I actually felt in every second of that scene "he is acting!
Fonda and Kristofferson's first meeting isn't much of an icebreaker, yet the two are bedding down together by their second or third encounter.
The second choice is that the directors must create a film which explains everything to everyone and be completely inclusive, they must lay the construct of their world bare on the table and let people try and come to comprehend their universe; and unfortunately they did a little of both, to no great success.
Dialogue is flat and perfunctory (don't expect to be dazzled by repartee); the story lacks the beauty of the first Star Wars film and the tension of the second ... and then there's the magical `character development' everyone complains about.
Oh, and the pod race with those ridiculous alien characters meant to recall the great chariot race in the second "Ben Hur"?
Which brings me to my second fault:  2.
The print is relatively nice looking, but there are a couple of moments, when the screen goes black for a second, where the original 35mm print is clearly damaged or faulty.
This movie thinks it is HIGHLANDER material, and for the second time in a week I get to fault a horror movie from the late 80s/early 90s for not being sleazy enough.
"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York" is young Macaulay Culkin's second greatest hour in the series as Kevin McCallister, who has to learn to be a man again on the mean streets of the Big Apple after being separated from his family once more.
I don't think I could sit through it a second time though.
For the first part of the movie this story is well told and interesting, but in the second half it becomes obvious and clichÃ© and the good beginnings are ruined.
And any film with Joyce Compton as the second lead (however madcap she is ) you know is not going to be a grade A production.
Watch as Zucco takes the dead girl's pulse, lets go of her hand, and it hangs there for a second before dropping to the floor.
Somewhere after what may, or may not be, the second act, there is a 20 minute motorbike, "chase", that simply serves no purpose, other than to show off some "special effects" and explosions, and even they are so cheap, it is embarrassing to watch.
Now, XTRO 3 is slightly better than the second one only because it actually has a bit of a plot.
Maybe the first could be an acceptable Starsky, but the second made a very stupid Hutch.
It's amazing how often the words 'god-awful' appear in the reviews of this movie - er - on second thoughts, no it isn't.
The soundtrack is a masterpiece of incoherence ranging from tinny renditions of what sounded suspiciously like Morricone's 'The Good The Bad and The Ugly' theme played on a Stylophone to mellow Spanish guitar music, to 10 second loops of synthesised rock - ALL IN THE SAME SCENE!
The first season was good and so was the second.
The second time I watched the show was again out of disbelief because I still thought it was an animated short whipped up by the network during a commercial break.
The show gets the viewer to empathize with Tom so strongly, that in the second season, when several stories see Tom accidentally kill and maim much of Jefferton, it became truly cathartic and hilarious, partly because Tom is the last guy on earth who'd hurt a fly, yet he truly deserves to eviscerate every last Jeffertonian.
And as for that little sister, let me tell you what *she* does: she looks forlorn, cuts herself, starves herself, looks forlorn and hungry, acts like an angel on the altar in the middle of church, passes out during said performance, dot dot dot, and finally jumps out her psych ward window to her death (and if you think I'm being callous then that's because you didn't see the film's eleven second treatment of her death).
They needed a demon and found it in a benign plant that could avoid being regulated and taxed and was pervasive among second class (Blacks and Latinos) citizens who were already being institutionally abused of their rights.
But I'd spend my movie renting dollars on something else if I had a second chance.
I thought of this as I watched this flick - the second of a double-feature which our PBS station has, featuring older movies, each Saturday evening.
Now, this was my second time viewing the movie.
The second hilarious scene was scene with the lost little boy and the chase by the policeman on horseback in Central Park.
This second film together, made 15 years after the more well remembered drama, is an obscure action comedy which didn't get enough attention to even rank a nice ad in the New York Times.
When she calls back a second time, the cat is eating her son-in-law's breakfast with the guy sitting right there paying no attention, and the daughter has to rush off.
This is a voice of a person, who just finished watching the second season of Rome, almost at one go, and grabbed the opportunity to see "what happened next" - this film conveniently takes off where Rome ends.
The second is when the prop gun spends an entire scene floating in water next to the actors.
In this second attempt at capturing not only one of Canada's greatest stories, but one of the world's greatest stories on film, CTV rushed out a made for TV abomination.
so, on we go to round three of the "House" series.we(my sister and i)had watched the first entry all the way through and were underwhelmed,to say the least.the second one lowered the bar for crappiness even further.how bad could number 3 be?it starts off promising enough.after all,it had Lance Henricksen (he should've passed) in it and it looked like it had a bigger budget.however,it soon became apparent that this movie was also a dud.another ridiculous plot,bad acting,bad everything.i think this one made it 40 minutes tops.any longer and my head would have exploded.again,no horror,and no comedy.i must be missing something.i wish i knew what it was.
On a second viewing it might be laughable, but there's so much to deal with that the first time around was just a painful exercise in masochism.
Flailing and jumping around on the set, Mr. Sutherland is mercifully gagged and tied up during the second half.
Two of the actresses have made more than a few porn flicks... Lars Von Triers Idiots had hardcore porn in it too, for at split second - but that does not mean that there is any viable excuse to put it in - there is nothing in the way of motivation or storytelling that suggests that hardcore scenes could have a defining impact on a movie - it's put there as shock value only, which in this day and age is just daft.
This is the second movie I have seen from Thailand and so far, it has been a mixed picture.
  Rating - 4 stars (out of 5)  Too many reviewers have tried to compare Emma-Kate Croghan's second feature with her first, Love and Other Catastrophes.
Fans of Australian film cannot possibly ignore Emma-Kate Croghan's triumphant second feature.
It didn't sync up with the action, it seemed to be off by about a half second, so you see people keep talking after their lips have stopped moving.
Android of Notre Dame is third Guinea Pig movie, the first is Devil's Experiment and second is Flowers of Flesh and Blood, and these first two are the sickest in the series.
The acting is again non existent and the film was pretty hard to sit through for the second time, even though the film runs only slightly over one hour.
The first half of the film is basically setting up the romance and the war, and then in the second half you mostly see Steve Reeves running for what seems like 15 minutes, and then a huge naval battle with some interesting underwater photography.
I guess I just hope they don't make a second one.
The central theme of the original novel is developed through the contrast between the first part and the second, titled The Happy Man.
This second part has been obliterated in the film, and so has the novel's dialogue, its portraiture of characters and most of the plot, thus entirely robbing the story of its meaning.
I loved the characters (you know someone like each one of them), the acting, the silliness, the randomness, the way the humor hits you in so many different ways, I LOVED THE ENDING (which I won't ruin), but the thing I loved most about this film (and this is very important in my opinion) is that it was funnier the second time I saw it!
But my favourite part is where the android cop takes on a trio of tough men, the first being a drunk who gets swept aside easily, the second being a karate expert who is outmatched by the robot, before leading to a real tough man being walked on by the robot.
The story was actually kind of interesting; a detective who's life was taken away is given a second chance due to a symbiotic parasite, but in exchange, must feed off human bodies to maintain both himself and the parasite.
This is only his second film after "Everybody Loves Sunshine", starring David Bowie.
In the second half of the movie, which focusses on Jack Merrick (Henry Fonda), whom Donnell has always loved, she achieves peaks of self-sacrifice that will send you staggering to the bathroom to throw up.
I watched it twice, and caught a bunch of stuff for the first time the second time around.
second of all, i thought this was a slasher, since when do slashers not have any blood/gore?
I remember the first movie was okay so i decided to see the second one ONLY BECAUSE the trailer made it seem like she was in the same setting as the resident evil 2 video game.
Lionel Atwill is billed second, but he has so little screen-time you'll forget he's even in the film.
This film is mostly concerned with Church, played a bit too cocksure by Patrick Knowles, and his relationship with Kit, a one time girlfriend who becomes his wife in the second scene she appears.
It's actually better on a second or third viewing, but I wouldn't recommend watching it very often.
Though billed second, Lionel Atwill is barely in the movie at all until the final reel.
The lab falling apart in second chapter was indeed an old thriller type of stunt.
All the major changes came in the second part, the first part was played almost exactly like the original.
In the second part, we get some cursory mention of the two survivors and some theorizing as to why they may still be alive... but then they're simply forgotten and don't even figure in the overall plot.
The second was the song, Soccer Ball, written by the director.
The second half of the first season and the second season were going somewhere prior to this stall.
The second half of the movie picks up a bit as the monster chases the girl around the woods.
It never piqued my interest for one second.
this is without a doubt the second greatest movie ever right after frank Capra's Mr. smith goes to Washington its the best highly recommended if you have not seen it buy it great movie awesome scary awesome adventurous cool love this movie great acting great plot great movie buy this movie for real got to buy dis movie for real it is cool love it is awesome highly recommended a don cascara classic everything you want in a movie is right here a horror classics better than all Hitchcock movies better than everything (except Mr. smith goes to Washington)it is a great movie cant explain until you see it a must see great movie
I am a huge fan of the first and second Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, they were both fun films that even the oldest adult could still have fun too, I grew up with the cartoon and movies, so I just loved them from minute one.
Please, stick to the first and the second Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, those are really the worthy and fun movies for the classic cartoon and story.
The third film removed any sense of seriousness left over from the first film and amplified the campiness of the second film.
Paige Turco returns for a second run as April O'Neil, though she seems to be hamming it up a bit more this time and comes off as irritating more often than not.
The second film, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze (1991) was a bad movie, but entertaining in its stupidity.
Well after the amazing first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film and the second not quite amazing but still good Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2:The secret of the Ooze the turtles return to the big screen for the unlucky third time where in the first 2 films they had a great opening sequence like in the first we had never seen the turtles on the big screen and really alive before so they kept that suspense going for about a awesome 10 Min's we finally see them all together right after there about to jump at the main titles and in the second one the turtles all jump up and the main title goes right there it was pure awesome and everyone couldn't wait for them to come up.....but in the third there is no thought no imagination its just the turtles dancing witch couldn't even succeed at being funny and brings me to splinter witch if you think splinter was an undeveloped character in the second...wait until you see him in the third splinter is supposed to be a main character that teaches the turtles but in this movie he just stands in his under ground house and at least the first two films he looks really cool but in this film he looked like a puppet behind a wall and only appeared in a few scenes witch was pointless so lets get to the plot April buys a some sort of time warp thing and warps the turtles in time and this movie would have been good story and have something that fans wanted such as shredders return and the debut a krang if thats what you are hoping to get......your wrong...instead you get 2 weird stupid undeveloped characters that nobody cared for why?
because we didn't know these characters from the cartoon show and they don't look cool there just siting on a horse shooting guns and ones the gos guy and other is the bad guy and the Michaelangelo gets kidnapped witch keep the turtles back April as well gets set back in time where her and mike and prisoners and the turtles costumes just look so awful it isn't funny and there is only a couple fight scenes not involving all the turtles until the end at least the previous films had more then one for scene with all the turtles more then once so as you can see they pretty much went wrong where ever this is buy far the worst tmnt film as well as it being one of the worst films and let downs ever and goes to show that most three's in a sequel flop the first,second and fourth tmnt films are all great so lets just pretend the fourth is the third and leave this horrible film as a past and killed off memory.
The second film wasn't that well received.
This film is crappy when compared to the first (which was a masterpiece) and the second (which was OK) combined.
And, embarrassingly enough, I was sort of a fan of the second one.
Anyway the point is that all of the comedy in this movie is confined to the first half and the second is an overwrought drama, which beats its message home.
I saw this in 1975 when it played a double-bill with "The Other Side Of The Mountain"; it came on second and proceeded to empty out the theater.
In fact, most people agreed that this film was great for the first half, horrible in the second and was filled with too many clichÃ©s that ruined a movie which good have been a good one.
This is second feature film of editor turned director Chandan Arora.
The pacing is bizarre with a ton of plot simply explained through voice-over (the hanging verdict in particular seems unlikely as shown) in the first half the second half with Karloff stalking the elderly drags.
This is a film that absolutely demands a second and third viewing....which is what I am about to do right now.
He finds the certain key on his second try!
Come to think of it, so was the second one.
Not only is it highly unlikely that the father would even be much affected in the second story of such a big house - he would CERTAINLY not wake up from the smell!
Another annoying thing about the movie is its crappy audio that makes the movie look like it was 50% dubbed.There's nothing quite like the refreshingly annoying and destructing movie with dubbed audio that makes you second guess every actors voice.
OK, I can't think of a third good film struggling to get out - but what we are left with is a rather dreary flick that struggles to get out of second gear.
Basically, the local public TV 30 second promos had the entire film in them.
Granted, ONJ is a singer first and an actress second, but even Judi Dench would be hard-pressed to make this role work as written.
The name on the placard was spelled wrong, Sara's dance was mediocre at best, and the event of a "second chance" at a major audition is something that simply would not happen.
even the grooving judges was stolen wholesale from the end of break-dance, and it would have been unlikely that the audition judges would have given Sarah a second chance to do her contemporary dance for a place like Juliard.
From the film's opening credit sequence, a completely farcical series of events, you get that sinking feeling and realize that anything resembling cheese and slapstick in the second film was directly the influence of Lester.
The second recalled a city on a sound stage with only the vaguest sense of a distorted reality.
And second where is everyone?
Later, we get the audition scene that the first film has made a classic but the second film poorly imitated.
And maybe if they put a better person to play her part, the movie might have got a second star.
In fact I'll stop typing this right now, because that movie is still occupying my time, and not another second...
There are 3 second pauses in between lines, and they're not for effect.
The second best scene occurs when Al dreams about being a guest on a macho male talk show segment where tough guys ridicule his sensitive man routine.
Well, I bought myself this movie as it seemed to have an interesting content.But how I was disappointed, poor acting, a very poor story (sometimes getting real grotesque too) and even the making of the film looks sad.My advice for the director: Much shouting and beating doesnÂ´t make a second ROMPER STOMPER, which is, a classic of modern films..at least thatÂ´s my opinion.So maybe more concentration on the story and better actors will do it.
In the second he follows one.
Angela Lansbury, Elizabeth Taylor, Kim Novak, Rock Hudson, Tony Curtis and Edward Fox, the latter giving a VERY fine performance, maybe even "saving" the film for me in the second half.
You're suppose to presume that had Andy completed her year there she would have set herself permanently on the path to crazed careerism which led to Miranda's second divorce.
The extra "behind the voices" featurette on the second disc is better because it's REAL (why the hell did Miramax see fit to give this sad movie a deluxe set boggles the mind, by the way).
The only actor who salvages their credibility from this mess is the ever-likable Anna Paquin, and it is not surprising that her character offers the biggest hint at a second dimension.
4 - Next, a looong 15 second pause in conversation  5 - Then this REALLY subtle line - "I'll be right back.
The second season, while having some good episodes, had some of the worst plot episodes invented.
Unless you want to see a version of the Plague that puts Oran in South America in 199..., changes the Rambert character to a woman who fingers herself in a cafe while checking for Buboes, changes Tarrou and Grand into giggling novelties, and replaces the enlightening separation theme from the second part of the novel and changes it so that the characters and merely horny, than this is for you.
The second one is when the female judge finds out that someone destroyed her office, but you don't know who did it, nor why he or she did it.
in fact,it's basically the same movie.and they couldn't even get the time line of events correct.maybe that was intentional due to laziness or not caring.either way,this thing is a real woofer.it doesn't even deserved to be called a movie.i viewed this as a so called second feature on the disc containing the original The Boogeyman.i thought my head would explode,and i urge you to run as far in the opposite direction of this thing,if you should be cursed with the misfortune of combing across it's path.it should come with a warning label like:Warning-may cause your i.q to drop several points if you are within it's vicinity.for me,there's no doubt this thing is a 0/10
Episode 3 from season 2 this Tales from the Darkside story originally aired in the US during October 1985, the second of three Tales from the Darkside episodes to be directed by Theodore Gershuny I have to say I personally thought Ring Around the Redhead was total crap.
In fact, the first half of the movie is completely different than the second half.
It serves as a framing device for the endless clips from the first (and possibly second) movies.
Then we have Olympus, not only home of the Gods but also home of the big evil city traffic, you can hear cars driving by and honking every second.
During the half time of any college game, it is the band's responsibility to keep the fans entertained and want to stick around for the second half (no matter how bad the football team may--or may not-- be doing).
This was director Oliver Blackburn's first feature film; I can only hope for the sake of his career that his second will be a huge improvement on his first.
One of the greatest casts ever assembled help this, otherwise turgid, melodrama to chug along for over two and a half hours, (three, if you are unlucky enough to catch the US video version), but they still can't manage to lift it above the level of a second rate television movie.
award , but the bull run comes a close second.
Ben's making him have second thoughts about throwing the fight.
This was her second film, she was in another science fiction travesty, Mesa of Lost Women first.
The characters deliver lines and then wait a second or two.
At one point while watching the gorilla being zombiefied the spies watch it happening behind them over their shoulders and when Ivan comes to take it out of the room there is is this amazing nothing ten second shot of three people standing in a line looking over their shoulders at a blank wall.
Were there any second takes?
On second thought, save your money for video.
Never mind that it happens in second.
Don't give this movie a second of your time.
But I went back and watched the rest, and the second half, with Tyler Labine's Croker, was quite a bit better.
the premise of hunting humans is good.the mind and thoughts of a serial killer and whats happens when the serial killer is suddenly threatened and challenged by a second serial killer.the internal dialogue of our star killer is hilarious(in a sick sick way).the plot is pretty original.but the acting,camera work,and sound are a lil high schoolish ,and the end gets corny beyond belief.
Of course they succeed in stopping the missile, just 1 second before it would be launched.
It wasn't until the second death of a stillborn son that Henry had had enough.
My second criticism is that I thought this was going to be a bit more light hearted .
The creature must be stopped lest it ruin the local tourism business, and Dr. Loomis gets really intense, sits around glowering like a madman while knocking back the native booze & gabbering about the past, and finally lures the panther to go mano-a-mano with his wits, slamming the doors at the last second ... and then skarkers.
It only serves the purpose of bringing about the solitary plot twist in the narrative (namely, the second lover), which seems like a desperate attempt to save the movie out of nowhere.
On second thought, don't see it.
I couldn't stand his over-the-top accent, and I didn't believe for one second that he was the kind of guy who would be living at his parents's house into his thirties.
Jill Clayburgh the second coming of Buster Keaton???
Yet I was more hopeful for the second installment.
This stems from the fact that the entire second half of "Saturn 3" is a simple monster movie: Hero saves passive woman from monster.
However, i did have some expectations for the second series yet unfortunately, the second series failed to meet these expectations.
The third diary shifts back to the second, and a zombie bites John and they chow down on Elizabeth.
When these press in, Christopher starts having second thoughts.
Don't waste a second on this mess.It's unwatchable.I gave it a 1 and I really wish this website would add some negative numbers to the ratings scale.
What should conjure feelings of isolation in the audience only makes us lose interest before the second act has even arrived.
When blonde daughter (Priscilla L.) falls for Garfield, Mama convinces Papa that the only decent thing for him to do is: First, send boyfriend Garfield packing; and second, abandon his family again.
Then you hear that second gunshot, then another, and another...And another....And yet another.
In fact, the "Ancient Warriors" is a 7 second scene of six Sardinian young men wearing garb with spears in hand, they step out from the wall from which they were previously superimposed, rocks falls killing Richard Lynch's character, then then back step into the cave wall again & disappear... Don't believe me?
The direction never letting you forget for one single second that this is a PLAY darlings.
The second one: the fact that the repressed (or maybe just hesitant) gay temporary teacher Mr Irwin, OF COURSE, succumbs to the offer of Dakin, the most disgusting jerk in the film, degrading himself just in order to satisfy some desire he could satisfy with any given (and probably much more honest) prostitute.
were ever second rate?
The second half is pretty dumb, once you get a full view of the monster.
Actually, my nomination for "This movie's so bad, I'm not even going to try" award goes to Chester Morris, formerly known as Boston Blackie, with Ron Randell's "where am I" cop a close second.
Morris's range of expressions is ridiculously small, reduced to a permanent frown, and, on second thoughts, perhaps some wry humour and flamboyance would have lifted the film, if even been out of character.
Thus as I watched the rest of the film develop, I kept thinking in the back of my mind, 'does the Police Health & Welfare Plan rule out second opinions?'
I bet this movie won't make it through a second week of showing in the theaters, and the DVD will go directly to the 50%-off section.
This one succeeded in the first but only because it failed in the second.
If you can call 46 cuts in a 60 second scene action.
There were some parts where I thought were stupid, like giving the ankle bracelets 10 second fuses, allowing someone to pull the pin on an adversary and kill him/her ten seconds later.
This film is a dreadful piece of work, hardly worth a second thought except for one reason - it illustrates the use of entertainment media for propaganda purposes.
I was somewhat insulted, but when the film began settled for enchantment which was sufficiently strong to keep me around when the second installment (I think there were only two, but this was 20-odd years ago) came along next night, when I also learned that the picture would be replayed throughout the promo which allowed me to make a tape of it.
And in the courtroom, one second, he is fooling everyone with his acting, then the next, he becomes a complete dimwit w/o the ability to improvise through anything.
The second half of this 7 hour - film cure for insomnia - is slightly more interesting than the first half.
But the second half has some potent quotes from some key Nazis themselves.
A second ago there was a bloody hole in his shirtÂ At mid way or so, the dumb blonde talks the owner of the ship into getting into the hot tub with her.
Especially so is the hot little blue number Eleniak wears through most of the second half.
Luckily, you only see him for about 2/3 of a second.
But now that all the clichÃ©s have been run into the ground, it's not worth a second look.
But one thing is for sure: by the time (SPOILER WARNING) Kitano gets hit by the 15th bullet or something and still doesn't fall down, it was clear that my second experiment with his films (after the equally awful "Brother") will probably be the last.
There are only two scenes, of which one is typical for Lucio (eyes scratched out by a cat)but second one - tearing man apart - really satisfied me.
For the first half of the movie I thought McLish wouldn't talk, for the second half I wished she hadn't.
I'm not even watching the second DVD.
The film's second act begins when Kit's father loses his car dealership (it's interesting that he was still able to have a thriving business as late as 1934!).
But that all changes for Wayne the second his Mongol made up eyes set sight of red headed Tartar princess Susan Hayward.
This was just the second film Powell directed (the first was Split Second, a 1953 noir film also for RKO that starred Stephen McNally and Jan Sterling), and it showed.
the first highlander film was great the second and third were not bad but now its just completely lost its way.
This one like the second Hilander movie is not worth owning.
I will stick to watching the original series and just be glad that I can get videos of the series at second hand stores for $1.95.
First it was the main protagonist that really got into the role of the highlander, second it was the fact it it had very good swordplay and martial arts action and third it was those well done flashbacks into history, that showed many different time-lines and presented conflicts that lasted for centuries...
It didn't sync up with the action, it seemed to be off by about a half second, so you see people keep talking after their lips have stopped moving.
This one is justlike a coffee , brewed up a second or third time, and it tastes bad.....i prefer to watch the original versus 100 times than this crap.
the whole movie bored the hell out of me, while versus was so great and crazy, loaded with anticipation for whats to come in the next second all the way through, this is just lame....sorry, i cant tell you to go see this in the cinema or even rent the DVD, i really cant.
Sure it provides adequate entertainment the first time you watch it, but this movie is not the kind you pick up to watch again a second time.
She is pregnant with her second child which she got from her own father who repeatedly raped her.
It goes on like that, spices everything up with her father dying and her finding out he was HIV positive right when she is trying to turn her life around with her second child and her learning progressing in a new school.
The worst crime perpetrated by '33 1/3' is a retro 50's number where rock legends Fats Domino, Little Richard, and Jerry Lee Lewis play second fiddle TO The Monkees.
Not for a second.
This was a forced film in my opinion with a dreadful script, but maybe I should give a second chance.
The second exception depends on how old you are.
This "movie" is an 18 second clip shown in Nickelodeons across the country in 1896.
While his murders do make headlines he is sharing them with a second serial killer known as the Skidrow Slasher.
I take it that it found it's audience, as Steckler would later do a second film with Agostino (playing the same role - hey didn't he die in this first picture - only playing it in Las Vegas).
Besides which, most of it simply becomes irrelevant by the second half of the movie, when everything hinges around a straightforward martial-arts-school showdown.
The second positive point is that it appears to have been reasonably well-researched in terms of the "operating procedures" of both the IRA and the British intelligence apparatus.
Not one minute, not one second, not one millisecond of this is remotely funny.
Roger Ebert is one of my favorite film critics, a guy who does not normally hold all films against the requirements for excellence, but after I finished viewing the recent low-IQ comedy "Old School" for the second time in a row, I was disappointed that Ebert hated it so much.
At no point do you for one second believe that Freddie Prinze is cool or a good pool player, two things we are supposed to buy in this film.
There are many, many pratfalls and headbangs in this lame lump of inept crud, and none of it, not one solitary second, is funny.
how can they even make a second movie based on the second book.
The story is rushed quickly jumping from one thing to the next without any plot development so the viewer is left constantly wondering what is going on, one second our main character is a naive farmer, the next he is suddenly a fully experienced warrior with absolutely no evidence showing exactly where he gained this experience from.
Many verses end with identical expletives, and the reliance on the gangsta image makes the censored version solely suitable for those who can appreciate the inherent humour in missing every second word.
Egomaniacs, corrupt bureaucrats, a wise black man, a mother as a second in command who is totally obsessed with her sick kid, a riffle guy as a commander, a lonely girl without a mom raised by here tech dad with secrets to be kept....
Two - a very complex storyline, based on a very long book with a difficult plot and many subplots... that wasn't a good idea for a cartoon, which gets lost Three - some good second level jokes and some good first level jokes.
He was one of the era's great "second bananas."
All I saw was a bunch of second rate actors dressed up as clowns, pokin fun at the backward hillbillies of Tennessee.
Most of the reason I disliked this movie was that it seemed like every second was being created by someone with ADD,...perhaps even ADD as well as crack!
Jack Carson, an underrated actor, was perfect as her second husband Harold Pierson.
This monstrosity of a film was cheekily re released again to look as though it was a new Uma film, I have seen it floating around on DVD in second hand shops and car boot sales on numerous occasions - and now I know why.
Louise's first failed marriage, her daughter who suffered infantile paralysis and her introduction to her future second husband (Jack Carson) - in a fish pond while dressed up for a costume party linger in the memory.
The second movie in the saga is by an extremely wide margin the very worst of them - it is actually completely awful in itself, let alone as a sequel to the great first APE movie.
This is all utterly pointless because in the second half, the alien plot is in and Chicken loses his reputation again.
So now that Chicken's reputation is back the second time, his movie is changed to a Sci-fi Trek flick.
It looks like a bunch of French guys got together and decided to put on make up and pretend to be cannibals... wait a second!
I remember buying American Ninja 2/3 on the same DVD and I heard bad reviews about 3 so I looked at the box and decided for a second.
Never in my life have I just for one second think, seeing such crap is possible.
Why... that's my only question, why this horrible soundtrack of a garage band with no talent , this cast ( i'm sure in some scenes reading off cards ).... why all the clichees ever seen are all in this flick ALL of them, can you one second fall for any of these caracters or actually believe in this cheezy romance.
As bad as this was there's no chance in hell of a second movie.
The first half of the movie should of been back story and the second half should of been a worldwide tournament.
Plus his appearance is horribly short both times, which is worse the second time around.
"Irina Palm" stops being a deadpan comedy and asks its audience to take a second look at what Maggie is doing.
He understand the first and is wholly incompetent in the second.
But by the time the second season rolled around there wasn't a character who hadn't been beaten up/stabbed/shot/deported/abused by her father/duped by a transsexual.....
I rented this movie not knowing that Pauly Shore directed it, if I knew he did I might have not seen it, then again I think he deserves a second chance.
The sequence at sea in the second half is the last momentarily interesting section, but it's quickly jettisoned like so much flotsam.
SPOILERS AHOY If the ship was unable to reach landfall the first time, how come everyone assumes they will easily be rescued on the second attempt?
I will be watching the second half tonight, but my expectations are low.
While the first DEATHSTALKER movie played it with a straight face (making it a much easier movie to poke fun at), this second installment in the series is tongue-in-cheek all the way.
This ancient black & white film was only the second Mickey Mouse cartoon released with synchronized sound.
This is when Mickey Mouse debuted in the cartoon PLANE CRAZY and just a short time later, Mickey scored one of his biggest hits in his second film, STEAMBOAT WILLIE, as it was the first cartoon with a soundtrack (with sound effects and music).
The conflict is introduced in the beginning of the second act, instead of at the start the picture.
Go rent this 'cause it's the second best Batman movie.
Fox made a very wise decision to limit its damage and not air a second episode.
Occasionally, the second feature ("Torch Song," "Female on the Beach," "The Story of Esther Costello") featured an actress named Joan Crawford, whose gargoyle face was scarier to me than any horror film we saw.
It does reach a certain level of hysteria in the second half particularly when the 50-something Dunaway/Crawford replaces her ill 20-something daughter on a soap opera.
One second people are one thing, the next moment another, for no reason.
The execution, however, drowned the story in a sea of amateurish and obvious mistakes that kids in their second month of film school are warned against.
I've seen better plots in a 30 second Ad.
So now comes the awful second half.
second part, the 'crime': really stupid and boring, it made me compare the good with the bad, and this seemed to be the ugly.
On second thought, given the quality of the writing, missing half of what is being said may not be such a bad thing after all.
The second thing i've noticed is that while some films used a lot of day for night shots where they attempt to convince you that it's nighttime when it's obviously daylight, and that's pretty stupid.
Well, that on-set experience must have been a good one for them to agree to a second outing.
And with that said and told, I don't believe for one single second that Micheal Moore hates America so much as the producer of this movie wants him to.
Let's just think for a second about what Moore's possible response options might have been.
Those words come right out of some second rate teen magazine photo love story.
Director Bill Forsyth, who also wrote the script, populates this, his second feature, with characters we can relate to so easily that watching them trip over their hormones makes us care and feel embarrassed for them.
It is by leaps and bounds the most interesting thing that the movie has going for it, and it is literally on screen for less than one second.
I think this was deliberately portrayed as a sequel too (mainly based off of the title, the main character's name coming second).
I loved the first movie so I thought the second one would be even better.
If you're thrilled by amusing one liners and nonstop special effects of all kinds of weird creatures, then you're sure to enjoy this second Mummy picture.
Jolson had scored well with his second film The Singing Fool and his singing of Sonny Boy to four year old Davey Lee was the big hit.
The first half was pretty good and promised an intriguing finale, but the second part descended into a confused and unconvincing mess where the crew weren't the only ones to wonder what was going on.
the acting too was pretty pathetic except sanjay dutt who did a decent job(although he got irritating in the second half).
It's fun to see how comic setups and situations from Gregory's Girl come back in Forsyth's Local Hero ("everyone's second favourite film", as Mark Kermode put it), deeper and more fully developed.
It made me laugh to see all these second rate actors who never play anything else but generals and presidential advisors shout out stupid words that no one would ever say in such a ridiculous situation, until I realized that this would go on for two more hours.
I liked the premise, but felt the film could have started about half way through and concentrated on this second half.
As it was, the second half just lost me as it groped around aimlessly in some sort of forced ra-ra mode.
Once upon a time,back during the second Middle East conflict,the Israelis had a plane in the air 24/7 carrying a nuclear bomb.If they looked like losing(how's that for bad sportsmanship)they would bomb the crap out of Egypt.Sort of like picking up their toys and stomping off home.This plane - or one of a number of planes so equipped - I'm a bit confused on this point - is shot down and lies hidden in the desert for 29 years until it is discovered by Arabs,and a South African(taken over from the Brits in the International Villain stakes) buys it for $400 dollars,selling it on to a unregenerate nazi for $50 million.Said unregenerate nazi (Mr Alan Bates - a chain smoker just to add to his general bastardness) uses it to blow up a football stadium in Baltimore thus plunging the world into the nuclear abyss.Go figure.
The Queen masquerades the second time as an Asian woman and gives Snow White a deadly comb.
(Of course, if I had seen what they did to Galactic Gigolo in post prior to filming this, I would have never made a second film for Band.)
Mildly interesting is the fact that THE KILLER NUN is book-ended by two confessional scenes (the second of which abruptly terminates the film without a proper resolution!)
And the second one is even worse, you see almost no emotion in the leading role called george, it's like he studied the first movie (John Travolta), and is trying to act like John Travolta, almost like a robot, because i totally mis the emotion in his words and face.
Nearly every second Cook was in the film I hated him and wanted his character to die.
At the beginning this bike does a flip and on 1 shot he faces the wrong way but in the second shot the bike amazingly turns the right way.
Bonaduce is in a number of scenes at the beginning of the movie, but although he is in the same section as the rest of the passengers on the plane, he is not seen anymore during the second half of the film.
It manages to be the second worst camera work I've ever seen in my life (the worst being in "Venni, vidi e m'arrapaho", a film that I believe to be from the screwiest corners of hell itself).
Kid meets kid, second kid has some problems too and a way of making things better.
The protagonist is never shown to have a single redeeming quality, except possibly in the end, when he tells his girlfriend "I love you too" and kisses her hand, and this is supposed to make up for the fact that she has always come in a strong second to his addiction.
First was the two leads and second, the filming location.
You can't tell me for one second that you ever thought that Zeta-Jones could outsmart a stump of wood, let alone Connery.
Fortunately, the second half picks up, and it gets bad enough to provide a few laughs.
This sequel is much worse and was pretty hard to sit through when I watched it for the second time.
The film although directed by the person from the first was nothing like the first, whereas the first film used suspense and dark atmosphere with only very minor gore effects, The second film skips the suspense and atmosphere and goes straight for the gore, It seems like the director wanted to go in a different direction with this film in order to make it more action-packed, it really doesn't work.
Dan Rowan and Dick Martin, famous TV cut-ups from the then-current hit show "Laugh-In", go a curiously different route for their second theatrical film as a team (the first was "Once Upon a Horse" from 1958).
Even if you've got five million hours left to live, don't waste one second on this piece of junk.
But pure logic for this movie basically went out the window from about the very second the opening credits flashed on the screen.
I never believed for a second that this shallow college boy would care a cockroach's butt for this pathetic derelict, but 'Harvard' gets what he deserves when the stinky bum assaults him with a lead pipe, throws part of the kid's thesis into a furnace, helps himself to other people's closets for clothes, puts his dirty socks in the oven, disrupts a class in session, murders another student's pet, and asks to be driven across the state-line to visit his son who wants nothing to do with him, causing the student to miss the deadline for turning in his thesis.
If the panel members..... oops, I mean stars, would stop being so all over the place, and be a little more respectable, they might make the second season...
Hell, I'd even love a second What's My Line there too.
Kris Marshall is particularly unconvincing and looks uncomfortable in the role, even though this is the second series.
Unfortunately after a strong start the film has a very saggy middle, turning into a second rate Raiders of the Lost Ark wannabe.
Apparently, Space Children was his personal favourite amongst his SF movies and the one on which he lavished most care, but it definitely falls in to that second category.
For example, there is apparently a second alien arrival, but we only see one alien.
Nonetheless, I am glad I finally have it on DVD to complete my Jack Arnold collection (even if it is a soft, second or third generation copy).
A second problem is that the gags vary from funny to silly, as is usual with Brooks, but there aren't enough of either kind.
As it is Dracula: Dead and Loving It is a comedy first & horror a very distant second while I think it would have been much better the other way around with it being a horror first & comedy second like The Evil Dead (1982) or Dog Soldiers (2002), I mean you can't really add horror to comedy yet I would say you could add a comedic element to horror.
Now watching it the second time I hope I can forget it just as easily as I had the first time.
The aspect that I found most interesting in the second half of the movie, was the exploration of the Midwestern "Family Values" of the Heartland versus the evil New York/New Jersey devils represented by the Silvanos.
When the wallet is lost a second time, while DeHavilland and Forsythe are at a nightclub, the comedy is supposed to be conveyed by the two actors yukking it up with stage laughter.
The other comment on here is not correct, the tongue in cheek vignettes only came in during the second season, this thing was supposed to be taken seriously!
After successfully bring Karl back to life it's no great surprise that killer Dobbs takes over much to everyones annoyance, Frank realises what he has done & feels compelled to right his mistake...  Also known as Boltneck & Teen Monster this was directed by Mitch Marcus & I have to admit that I loathed every second of this horrible teen horror comedy that I am struggling to find one positive thing about, nope I can't think of anything at all.
Allen actually shot the film twice, replacing several cast members for the second version.
The second half of the movie is pretty good.
When the camera remains more than one second on the killer's face we can clearly see the haphazard makeup effects.
Mary, the second oldest, a basketball star in high school, but goes onto "evil deeds" later on, the rebel of the family.
There's a bunch of extremely unexciting actor wannabes with the average age of somewhere around 55, who in real life would probably have hard times climbing the stairs to second floor, let alone flee from the living slime which at one point is supposed to be so sticky that the slightest drop glues the female to the floor, and which a minute later pours over the protagonists like a sea of mud (which it is) with no visible effect.
After all the delay this film suffered I finally got around to seeing Lucky McKee's second movie.
When the second Blue's Brothers came out the Spice Girl's movie was also in theaters.
Then standard romantic part with a twist in second part, the main character is obviously the chosen one, because some force says so and of course we have a baddie from the army and the stupid leader who just wants money too.
If this movie had for one second taken itself even a little bit seriously, it would have been unwatchable.
In the second?
Okay first i want to say even if i'm a Turk i don't like these type of movies but still i wanted to say a few things.The first movie 'DÃ¼nyayÄ± Kurtaran Adam' was a total disaster everyone in Turkey makes fun of it because it was made seriously as a sci-fi movie and they stole many things from Star Wars.But the second movie is a comedy.Now the MOST important thing in a world class comedy film is to make EVERYONE on the planet laugh,but it doesn't mean that you have to make everyone laugh to make an ordinary comedy movie,i read that one commenter said that its not even close to funny,now i'm from turkey and believe me there are MANY European and American movies people from here don't laugh at and there are many movies you people don't laugh at,this films aim is Turkish population because Turkish sense of humor isn't same with the others,actually EVERY countries sense of humor is different with other countries so MY OPINION is that it doesn't make sense to say 'not even close to funny' to a 'comedy' movie that isn't in your country because it may not suit your sense of humor but people here liked it not very much but still they liked it,so please make your comments on comedy movies according to these things..i'm sorry if my English was bad..
That movie was the second worst thing happened to Turkish image after 'Midnight Express'.
Fortunately the director improves with his second movie The Woods.
The show wasn't nearly as amusing the second time around, both because the shock of hearing uncensored bigotry on cable was gone and because of something my friend noted at the end of the first viewing: Lampanelli says that it's fun for us all to make fun of ourselves... but you'll notice she really only makes fun of minorities.
The second third of the film suffers from this predictability.
Although the technocobblers did get dulled down the second half it was still rife with it.
Height, a glamour model in her second movie, is particularly energetic in her roles.
The script is a mishmash of every "successful" gimmic over the past five years, the acting is second rate, the special effects look straight out of 1994 and the editing leaves you scratching your head.
The second twist, which acts not only as plot but supposedly as a thematic comparison to the first, is what left me wanting my money back.
This film is poor and predictable, and certainly not worth a second look.
On initial viewing I kept waiting for the actors and action to hit stride, on second viewing, the film took on an altogether student film quality.
In some situations he is shown as extreme--using an alcohol wipe to open his own medicine cabinet door, for example--but then the next second he is touching people and objects willy-nilly and not appearing to be bothered at all.
I was thinking to myself while watching it, why am I putting myself through a second viewing.
This movie in my opinion was trying to go for the music, not he plot, while in the first one, it had a plot but the music wasn't as good as the second one.
She is given a massive second chance which she doesn't deserve, but she says the "real bad guy" (who is arrested thanks to a planted wallet) doesn't deserve one and actually has the the gall have him charged for burglarising her house!
(9) A violent child snatcher is released only because the movie needs him to snatch the child a second time later in the movie.
The closest thing they come to anything pretty violent is one fist fight, where they speed the film up for a second.
In the second half, still things don't get into action, I waited, waited but it never came.
In the second half, besides the car chase, there is one more afoot chase and that's all.
Bourne Supremacy, some people don't like it owing to the shaky camera, but my second favorite of all time.
I was hoping the second movie of Death Note would be better than the first one.
1st watched 7/5/2009, 4 out of 10 (Dir-Shisuke Kaneko): Complicated, slow and overly dramatic second episode to the Deathnote series based on a popular manga.
In this one the main character, Light, is given a second person who carries his godlike ability to make people die with a 2nd Death Note book.
The second holder of a book is a TV star named Misa who worships Light.
One star is the lowest I can give this film, but it deserves a second star simply because it got made and turned out to be a whole movie.
Alan Arkin is memorable as the deaf mute and Sondra Locke, in her first screen role, also shines as the second lead.
From the combined ministries of Jack and Rexella Van Impe and John Hagee comes Revelation, the second in a trilogy of films about somebody's conception of the end times.
I was hoping against hope that perhaps Letterman's interview technique was second to none, but yet again I was disappointed: they are as vapid and un-illuminating as the rest of the show.
Off the screen, comedian Larry Semon was an excellent amateur golfer, even introducing Oliver Hardy (his second banana in this film) to the sport.
As a matter of fact, while the film has a couple of choice moments in its second half, any good intentions are done in by some serious miscasting: an overage Artful Dodger (Sonny Ray) and Nancy (Doris Lloyd) and, worst of all, an unsympathetic Oliver (Dickie Moore).
It will be interesting to see what their second production is like.
Lockwood beating up William Shatner with his mind in the second pilot of Star Trek is more convincing.
In one scene a police officer swears not to tell the authorities that the he had an accident with the Kellys in which he was wounded, he was pretty happy and swearers not to tell, 1 second into the next scene Ma Kelly is standing for trial.
The dialogue is clichÃ©d and stilted and the storyline is so convoluted and outlandish that you'll think you've been teleported into a different movie sometime during the second half.
If you think it is the second answer you are absolutely right.
We didn't do anything' surely the second most used line in films after 'Let's get outa here...'
Dharmesh Darshan after melodramatic messes like BEWAFAA returns with AAP KE KHATIR a remake of A WEDDING DATE  The film also reminds of PYAAR TO HONA HI THA(FRENCH KISS remake) which was tad better  This film tries hard to look like a modern love story but falls flat The first half focuses on comedy scenes which are too in your face, the scenes between Akshaye and Priyanka too are awful especially their sudden love angle  The director suddenly forces the drama in second half and Punjabi stuff which is bad and the sudden Dino-Amisha angle is forced  Direction is bad Music is saving grace  Akshaye Khanna looks bored and though better then the rest yet he got typecast in such roles Priyanka overacts badly initially but is good towards the end Dino is okay, Suneil is horrible Amisha is bad Anupam and Lilette irritate and so the guju family
I am a huge fan of anime and manga, and my second fav genre is Chinese martial arts films.
The second is a retelling of Little Red Riding Hood, really strange and boring.
My second horror anthology film in as many days.
The second has Red Riding Hood becoming a fitness fanatic who is desperate to lose her virginity with her boyfriend while being pursued by The Big Bad Wolf (who just wants his medication back..) Lastly, in the best of the trilogy, Goldilocks is transformed into a homicidal maniac with psychic powers who has just escaped from a loony bin along with 'The Three Bears' and is on the run from the police.
The second story is based on a guy that gets his pharmaceutical prescription screwed up with another patent's.
The second tale is about a werewolf and is only saved by the unintentionally hilarious lines from the old woman, such as when the man demands she open the door, to which she replies "I will not!"
The stories told were not very good---the first was lame, the second goofy, and the third..interesting--but a little weak in the ending(it was the best of the three I think).
And the songs were amusingly bad--especially the performance by the singer of the second one.  
Let's start with the worst news first: the second story is really stupid and a complete waste of Donald Pleasance's horror talent.
The second story is about a modern day vampire hiding out from modern day vampire hunters.
The second and third stories are forgettable and therefore the overall affect of the movie is a negative one.
The first and second stories are merely satirical, and in a very silly way.
The second story, a slapstick vampire story which is actually a film in the film, is the worst of the three, very simple and even more silly, even though it is this one which stars both Donald Pleasence and Britt Ekland.
In the second, a vampire dad foils a vampire killer with... "a stake-proof vest!"
The movie like I already wrote starts from the first second on when you hit the play button as a damn good quality thriller!
Did I miss something in the movie; do I need to give it a second view?
second, I think the comparisons to Lynch are dangerous, especially when Lynch has already made a movie about a guy who feels disconnected with his wife and the love they used to have, about a guy who finds himself down a bloody path, about a guy who finds himself in a really bad dream, indistinguishable from his reality...
The dialog COULD have been striking, but s**t, you got Jack Black playing a mental defect, and Laura Kitelinger on screen for like a second and a half, and you cast the movie with these forced dialog suckers?
First half was good it really made me laugh & cry but in the second half when Vidia Balan came then got quite boring for some reason maybe because she spoiled it even Shah Rukh Khan's special appearance couldn't save it.
The second half has some good scenes by Akshay kumar but not worthy enough to be called as "Saving grace".
She may be credited second only to Sandler, but she gets such a tiny amount of screen time that you wonder why the filmmakers even bothered getting a name actor, and not just some random good looking extra.
The first half is the Sandler brand of immature fart jokes, while the second half is a tragedy that seems perfect for date movies.
Plus, you could tell in the second half of the movie that the writers tried desperately to throw in funny parts during the really dramatic scenes to remind the viewers that this was a comedy.
From "Faust" to "It's A Wonderful Life" The what if, the second chance, the realization and all the rest.
As only the second film in which he is not in, Cairo can even appeal to non-Allen fans.
not just for defamation of character, but also for being associated with such a second rate piece of hackwork.
every second of this film strikes a false note.
The Purple Rose of Cairo is, if I'm not mistaken, the second time in his career he'd stayed behind the camera (the previous one was Interiors), and much like he would again in the 90's with Everyone Says I Love You and Sweet & Lowdown, Woody has taken the opportunity to examine film and entertainment from a different angle, and not use the kind of sly dialog and dry humor that usually character his starring roles.
Two flashbacks tell the story, the second being set earlier in time than the first.
I am still wondering why the husband left so abruptly, and then why Priscilla didn't give it a second shot.
A second grader could probably come up with something better.
What did the second monster have to do with anything?
The first time I watched this movie I thought it was hilarious but the second time it just really rubbed me the wrong way...
In a sense this equivalence is apropos, since Wenders and Ray are both, at best, second tier filmic talents.
In constructing the story, the filmmakers try too hard to make some of it, but not enough of it known (at least sequentially), and for me at least, it turned out to be a difficult mess to sort through (again, until they make it obvious through at least half of the second act).
Because I watched it the second time with my little cousin, a toddler.
On this occasion, the film looks more like a badly rendered PC screensaver produced by a second rate company for an equally second rate computer, and that's at the best of times.
You have one story which is this sort of sideways-ish story about a comic trying to rediscover his love of his work and a second story which is this cartoonish sidebar about a Green Bay Drug-lord.
Feels like the whole thing was shot by the second unit.
Kristin Scott Thomas plays a subdued second female lead and, like Henshall, comes away with some credit   One has to assume it's not the actors fault as the director, Philip Haas, surely got what he asked for.
I'm sorry... the first predator dies instantly to an alien... the 2nd puts about about a 20 second fight before dying to another alien... then after that awe inspiring 21 seconds of alien vs predator action, it goes back to the humans being lost and stupid again for an additional 20 minutes... then you are rewarded with another 20 seconds, where it shows the remaining predator kill an alien... but its not the uber fight you think its going to be... it takes all of .5 seconds for him to slice through the head with ninja like reflexes... im glad at least one of the predators wasn't a total weakling right?????
I was intrigued about how the first time a Predator blew itself up on top of the Pyramid it did not damage the construction at all.... Of course, the second time that another Predator did that, the whole thing fell apart.
Firstly the gore is gone in Great Britain this is the first "Alien" or "Predator" film not to be an 18, this shows as there is nothing worth even flinching at in the film.The second is that the film tampers with alien biology it actualty hurts.
2) Sydney bristow - if agent Bristow is really the bleeding hard she is portrayed as why doesn't she have the heart to give Sloane a second chance in spite of his transgressions(the mind boggles).
I would understand this if the story was about Algerian immigrants or second generation Algerians in Europe, but that is not the case.
A second hired hand is convicted of the murders (this isn't a spoiler because it's stated at the beginning of the film).
I don't understand why if Brooke Shields, at the age of 16, wasn't allowed to bare her breasts or rear end in the first one, why Milla was allowed to, at 16 also, bare hers in the second film.
Through out the film in scenes of dialog (and for a horror film there are a LOT of scenes of dialog), the character in screen is recorded loud and clear and the off screen, second voice is inaudible.
Well, even though it was relatively early in his career, he had plenty of charisma and star status that it just didn't make sense having him play second to Edward Arnold--who played an annoying and ridiculous version of the life of Jim Fisk.
I was eleven years old when this second Power Rangers movie came out.
My thoughts: I really don't like this movie, first off, it's not a movie, it's more like a 90 minute episode of the TV show, as a matter of fact, that's what the movie should have been, a 3 part season premiere, second problem: the title, why is it called Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie and not just Power Rangers: Turbo just like the show, also, why isn't this a sequel to the first film?, I mean, come on, can't you just at least make a more proper sequel, I know this was after most of the original cast left, but dang, also, the special effects were worser than the effects in the first one, they look like something a nerd would do on After Effects, the Justin kid was so annoying, he's not even worthy of being the Blue Ranger, the Lerigot character angered me, he looks like a cross between an Ewok and a troll baby doll, the villains are dumb, however, I did like the soundtrack, and there a few decent action scenes, but that's it.
Of the 2 power ranger movies, this one comes in second.
So I watched the second one and I have to say it was as terrible as a sequel can get.
It's left unclear whether she'll give birth to the next Messiah or the second Buddha.
Over-directed (pointless virtuosic touches that add nothing to what's happening on screen with the plot or characters), over-scored (save me from the freakin' metal Irish jig and the Stones, both heard twice in this thing), over-edited (the movie is awkward: scenes flow neither internally or into each other) and over-acted by Jack Nicholson (so far beyond the point of self-parody that it ceases to be funny), this horrid, horrid film is filled with two dimensional characters (except for Madolyn, the worst psychiatrist who never lived, who lacks even a second dimension) and more profanity and violence than you can shake a stick at.
It is also quite possibly, one of the most intelligent films I have ever seen (second to Memento).
d. The fact that the cast says F*** every other second makes the movie cheap and crude instead of realistic.
But the second time he used the pinhole effect in TD, I realize that Scorsese has ran out of ideas.
The writer was correct in stating that open discussions are the second best part of art.
Viewing of the second episode ultimately left the same impression as the first.
This is only the second movie I have ever walked out on in my life.
Joel Edgerton plays the hapless promoter as a dim-witted surfer with a tendency to fall over or get beaten up in every second scene.
Directed by Brent Maddock this was the second sequel to the excellent & likable 90's monster flick Tremors (1990) which is generally considered a bit of a classic, the sequels however thus far are a long way from classic status & while Tremors II: Aftershocks (1996) was decent enough Tremors 3: Back to Perfection continues the downward spiral of diminishing returns.
The first half is a painful experience, while the second half is simply not good.
Okay, i'm a guy so i had to like all the toplessness in the first Room, the second room was quite annoying, 3rd room was humorous, gotta love the children, the little boy is from desperado.
Hopefully someone who's sat through the whole thing will come along and write the second one, which might be more helpful than mine.
The acting is so bad that you'll cringe, and the undercurrent of this film is more serious that the second one that had to be respected for charting its own course.
I haven't seen the second one, nor do I plan to since I watched the trailer for it since it was in the "Extras" section for SPM 1.
If everyone would watch this movie, take a second to think about what they feel, and then take out of it the message that rings true to them, this movie will have had the effect a journalistic piece should have, even though I doubt that is the effect it was aiming at.
I believe that Grisham could handle this with a bit of credibility--but the film approaches the matters as King approaches material: It doesn't make much sense to begin with, and really withers away in the second half.
Thank you, Jaco - also for your second feature "Eight Day".
The second half of Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam is loosely inspired by the 1983 Naseeruddin- Padmini- Anil Kapoor film "Woh 7 Din" which itself was a remake of a South Indian Film.
"The Avengers", which, at best, is a second rate version of the original "Batman" has all the features of your top blockbuster: A Big name or two, a plethora of explosions, and enough special-effects to put "Godzilla" to shame.
Thurman has shown herself to be a fine actress in movies such as Pulp Fiction but she just looks out of her depth here (I never believed in her as a top-level scientist for a second) and her English accent doesn't sound natural.
They didn't keep a dark enough tone like they did in the first and second.
Also, please, enough already with the huge overblown "UNRATED" DVD versions, so you added a 5 second scene and now the film is sooo much better than the crap fest that we saw in the theaters, all I can say is NO.
Salman's comedy films like HELLO BROTHER, MAINE PYAAR KYUN KIYAA are terrible But this film is even worse A remake of BRUCE ALMIGHTY, but a bad one It's boring and keeps getting worse First few reels between Salman- Priyanka and Salman- Anupam are as boring as ever and Salman's shouting worsens And if this isn't worse Enters Sohail Khan trying to do a Akshay in MSK and the film gets even worse, unbearable their scenes together are so bad, that you will surely get a headache the twist in the tale too seems illogical and the second half gets even more childish The lie detector is okay but the way the film ends it's even more stupid  Rumi Jaffrey seems inspired by his mentor David Dhawan and follows his Style too much but sadly fails in handling the film Music is outdated SFX too is bad  Performances are mediocre Salman is unbearable in first half, he shouts too much and his dial delivery is also bad, in second half he is better but sadly nothing even good enough Sohail is even worse, he is bad Priyanka Chopra doesn't have anything to do Dalip Tahil, Anupam Kher are average Amitabh seems to have walked out of a Rein and Taylor ad and just moves around with a know it all smile but his presence does uplift some scenes
I don't know what Gena Gershon's problem is, but oh my god it royally annoyed me during every second of this terrible movie.
Just watching the 'african-american boy from hard times trying to make it in the white man's world while being pressured to become a hoodlum" or the "he's a deadly sniper who'll kill you in a second but he's got a family and a split personality that includes a heart of gold" was enough to make me want to vomit and laugh at the same time, sort of a yuk-yak (back of Kojak, this one's mine too).
Her second language is English.
This 52-minute low-budget college musical can be wincingly second rate, but it has its moments.
The book had some scenes that would have made wonderful cinema such as the interogation of a murder suspect who gleefully confesses to the committing the crime but claims to have used a rifle instead of a knife, the surprise reception for Chee at his first session as a healer, the discovery of the true identity of the shotgun artist, Leaphorn's rescue of Chee that unintentionally delivers him into the hands of the real murderer, and the ironic circumstances that rescue Chee for the second time.
And "Maniac Cop" wasn't good enough to warrant the second installment, so you know it's even worse.
Crash just consists of a bunch of random sex scenes between two characters we don't even know in the first third, then consists of sex scenes between two characters we don't even give a damn about in the second third before trying to end up as some sort of tragic, poetic love story about two people who have now discovered what really sexually turns them on.
And the second male lead, Richard Hench, who doesn't enter the film until it's half over, seems to be reading his lines from cue cards offscreen.
As a result, the second plot line enters and we see him and Mia Farrow sharing a love scene together.
In reality, there is nothing the slightest bit amusing about an avalanche, but while watching this movie, you can't for a second take it seriously.
The second half of season two deals with a prisoner receiving a gunshot wound: operating on her in a hut full of flies, with just a pair of sugar-tongs to remove the bullet, is absolutely gripping.
The movement controls/logic, however, were so extremely bad I didn't play the game further than the second map - it is the second game ever I threw away.
Well, I was right about the first thing, but horribly, horribly wrong about the second.
The second movie, Mimic 2: Hardshell was ok too.
This was the second worst.
This is Craig Gillespie's second directorial effort.
My second problem with the plot?
I was really fed up watching the first half itself not to mention about the second half.
The second was that the Chicago Sun Times and Roger Ebert went totally overboard in praising it.
The second (nighttime) sequence is at Legion Ascot, and its 20,000 seats look to be pretty full, which, even when they weren't shooting a feature film, were pretty full even in the nadir of the Great Depression.
My second complaint is in the dialogue and the execution of the dialogue.
The second - well, as we all know, we don't have John Belushi with us anymore, which is one strike right there.
For those of you who saw the first Dragonheart, which was a WONDERFUL MOVIE and I suggest you see it, you should know the second one makes VERY LITTLE SENSE.
"Imperium Nero" is the second movie of the series of six productions named "Imperium".
This second TV movie produced and broadcast last weekend by the Italian state owned network has the same defects.
I couldnt blame them, if this wasn't a true story there had been absolutely no need for the second half of the picture.
But I'll watch the real Beales of East Hampton a dozen times again before I sit through this travesty a second time.
Shouldn't the director have done a second take?
The first one Wiseguys vs zombies was as cheap as they come and somehow got chosen to be on this set with another bad offering Meat For satans Icebox, the second half of the feature.
And also, a psychic ability should have some sort of introduction (but don't worry, its only a 3 second thing that has no follow through, so no plot spoiler here)!
When the second red knight uses the sword, you clearly see it's fake and not a real sword.
55 character was run of the mill of any other you'd see in this genre, I challenge you --respectfully-- to give it a second chance, only this time, read between the lines and watch the film take on real life.
This film fails on the first part, and passes barely only thanks to Paul Bennany and David Thewlis on the second.
Having seen it I would urge you to look beyond that and go and see this second offering from British director Paul McGuigan.
What amazes me most is that this being his first film, Moretti was allowed to make a second one.
Problem is, it's not good enough in other aspects to warrant a second viewing by someone just to get everything straight.
Actually rent it for the first half, but be prepared to dislike the second.
No, on second thought, fifty times better than this.
The first in a poliziottesco trilogy featuring Maurizio Merli as Commissioner Betti; the first and last entries were directed by Girolami under the alias of Franco Martinelli and the second by Umberto Lenzi.
The second half, however, is quite interesting: Merli quits the force after shooting a hood (John Steiner) in 'cold-blood' - apparently, it little matters to his superiors that the latter had done the same to undercover cop and Merli protÃ©gÃ© Ray Lovelock, who remains paralyzed for life!
While first such case is somewhat understandable the second one is beyond dumb.
It stars Timothy Dalton in his second and final performance.
However I was only there to kill time so I sat through every last painful second.
Yes, that's right, a 6 year old girl refused to sit through this movie a second time.
I don't normally ever watch network TV, and i'm not really big on reality shows at all, but i have been watching this because i thought it would be somewhat interesting.. turns out to be a poorly executed show that'll probably never recover from it's first season without some major changes (although it has already been renewed for a second season in '07).
this was changed after the first few episodes into an "approve or disapprove" system where the judges vote afterwards on a winner, and a majority vote from the American public decides a second winner for the round.
At the end of the second season there is a blues/reggae singer, a young American Idolish singer (though not of the same caliber), a ventriloquist/impressionist whose act is 99% singing, and a beat boxing singer.
When you look up cinematic incompetence in the dictionary, you'll find this second only to BACKWOODS.
It is a fine first effort, or a mediocre second effort, or horrific life's work.
I look forward to the second film in the series.
I won't go into details, but realize that it's set in a morgue (just go with that image for a second), involves really icky mental disorders, hookers, bored twenty-somethings and a serial killer.
for a brief second.
I assume that a second or third write was never thought of before filming and that nobody thought to expand on the story a bit.
I was positively sure as to who was committing the murders by the second to third dead victim.
I absolutely despise when somebody reviews a movie that they did not even watch through, but *I* could not finish this movie.. for only the third time ever ( the first, being the pitiful remake of Rollerball, and second being that miserable piece of rancid feces, Freddy Got Fingered).
But nonetheless it's a family drama with light touches of horror, where the awkward love sub-plot seems to make the ghost story play second fiddle to it.
The second half of the film is a violent "tour de force", and as bodies are piling up during the action-packed climax, this film also becomes one of the goriest Hongkong films aside the great "The Untold Story" and the viciously funny "The Ebola Syndrome".
The second star was without a doubt Vinod Khanna.
The second son, Anthony (Amitabh Bachchan) is adopted by a Christian priest and becomes a hoodlum on the streets, while the youngest, Akbar (Rishi Kapoor) is adopted by a Muslim tailor and becomes a Qawwali singer.
The first segment is about a swine nephew who kills his uncle in order to inherit his fortune; the second segment is about a blind woman who gets an eye transplant; and the third segment is about a former Nazi who is trying to escape his past, but a Holocaust survivor denies him of that.
My favorite was, of course, the second segment.
The second tale, "Eyes"(..directed by Steven Spielberg)stars Joan Crawford as an acid-tongued, rich, blind woman, Claudia(who has built her own apartment complex in New York and lives as it's only tenant), who blackmails a surgeon, Dr. Frank Heatherton(Barry Sullivan)into performing a dangerous and unorthodox grafting procedure transplanting the central optic nerves of an obsessive gambler's eyes, Sidney(Tom Bosley of "Happy Days" fame) needing 9 grand to pay off a debt from a bookie threatening his life.
In the second segment, Joan Crawford plays a blind woman who receives her sight back briefly when she pays a debtor to donate his eyes to her.
The second story is also the second best.
The second story features star Joan Crawford and was the one directed by Spielberg.
The first segment is appropriately spooky; the second ingenious and unconventional (for TV); and the third, even though it is the weakest, a worthy capper on this film.
Any film fan knows that this is where Steven Spielberg got his start, directing the second vignette "Eyes".
The second stars Richard Kiel as a WWII concentration camp captain hiding in some South American city, where he becomes strangely fixated with an idyllic painting of a man fishing in a mountain lake.
Indeed, this delectably dreadful dreck was paired with the equally atrocious, yet somehow oddly endearing dippy hippie terror trip-out "The Curse of the Headless Horseman" on a twice-the-tacky-terror twin feature offering that must have caused anyone who saw them together to either make an immediate beeline for the exit door 15-odd minutes into the first film or slump into their seats in a comatose stupor after the ending credits of the second picture finished rolling.
Action comes in truckloads in the second half.
some of the shots happened so quick i wish i had seen it on dvd so I could rewind and take a second look.
The whole thing resembles a half breed- Altmans "Short Cuts" and Quentins "Pulp Fiction" We wish there would be a chance for a second or a third EisbÃ¤r Movie...
Having just watched this movie for a second time, some years after my initial viewing, my feelings remain unchanged.
The problems was not that the movie was awful (apart from the typically wooden performance by Freddy Prinze, Jr. -- and why the heck has Matthew Lillard, who can actually ACT -- see "SLC Punk if you don't believe me -- spent so much of his career playing second banana to that meat-head?
The fractured way that the story unfolds isn't satisfying either since we only have two versions and the second is the one that we know to be true.
My second favorite part is when we finally see the Kilrathi for the first time.
Marian lives only for her children, and when Cliff tries to talk to her about his loneliness and hurt at always taking second place to the kids, she makes light of his feelings with some condescending and witless comments that made me want to choke her.
Despite its baffling ultra-rarity, the film is peopled by an interesting pool of talent both in front and behind the camera: Lancaster is in his third adventure flick; Gilbert Roland is his usual laid-back, womanizing Latino self; John Dehner the proverbial rotten apple in the group; George Tobias (perhaps thankfully) sacrifices himself early on; Nick Dennis and Mike Mazurki are among the rowdiest of the 'Ten'; Gerald Mohr adequately provides the required villainy; this was the second product from Norma Productions (which first partnered Lancaster with producer Harold Hecht); writer Roland Kibbee would much later go on to share directorial credit with Lancaster on THE MIDNIGHT MAN (1974; which I will be revisiting presently); associate producer Robert Aldrich would later direct Lancaster in four movies Â including TWILIGHT'S LAST GLEAMING (1977; which I'll be viewing for the first time during this ongoing Burt Lancaster tribute); and, most interestingly perhaps, this was multi-talented Willis Goldbeck's most notable directorial effort but, at least two of his screen writing credits are highly impressive indeed: Tod Browning's FREAKS (1932) and John Ford's THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE (1962; Goldbeck's last film work)!
This like it's going to be a good slasher at the beginning, when in the second scene, Bigman defeats another bikie in a jousting match with chains, then soon after another of his gang punches a nun to death, but it goes very quiet after that and never picks up.
The second flaw is that the transitions between different parts of the film can be rather confusing.
Maybe the fact that she looks to be aware of being possessed and enjoys it every second.
The second character that I deeply enjoyed was Gotz Otto.
Others in the cast include Robert Fiske as Savini, Craven's nervous second in command, Joseph W. Ross as Inspector Girard and Herbert Evans as the butler Henderson who may not be what he appears to be.
Therefore, I hope that the second season of Reaper helps to show that the characters have an encounter with God and Jesus Christ.
All around I would say that this is my favorite show on TV now with Smallville running second.
But the Devil is what will take the series to a successful and better second season.
I will watch the second season.
The second and final season shows what great potential the show had.
Especially the second season has a serious touch.
It has comedy throughout, action, drama, and could have some cool special effects down the line (if it gets picked up for a second season and has a bigger budget).
The second era shows Matt as the drunk, and Jack as the straight-laced lifeguard.
There's a reason it's known as Hollywood's second golden age.
Of course, after the second tape, he moves forward with disastrous results, but Charlotte exposes her secret to Lionel and it is just the thing to shut him up.
It was in the second half, though, that the film really hit its stride.
This is my second favorite Christmas Carol.
Probably not suitable for younger children, as some of the images are a little terrifying (the children under the robe of the second spirit send chills up my spine every time I see it).
Tommy tries to go easy on the over-the-hill ex-champ but catches him with a solid left-hook in the second round that not only knocks Johnny out but ends up killing him.
Out the second egg comes a very good violin playing owl chick, whom his parents also adore.
No one's mentioned it in prior postings, but in the movie's second half, as Harrigan (Harry Ritz) makes his way from room to room in the huge Stevens mansion, he's followed by the "gorilla" who quite obviously changes from a crouching walk to an upright position between rooms.
There is, in fact a "real" gorilla on the loose (played by Art Miles - the makeup, while not great, wasn't as bad as some that I've seen), who can't be the murderer (because first, gorillas can't write notes and, second, he hasn't been on the loose long enough to have committed the murders) but still he provides plenty of comic relief in his scenes with the Ritz Brothers.
The second is a very early talkie starring the vaudeville comic Joe Frisco.
You'd evict her in a second.
and I was right...  the second part made me totally emotional, I even had to cry a little.
Interestingly James is third in the opening credits while Murphy & Nolte come first & second although unlike the first film Murphy is now credited first & Nolte second which says something all on it's own.
The second time it looks kinda out of place.).
Her and William Powell made a pretty good on-screen couple in this their second and final film together.
Both these movies we're made with much bigger budgets, but The Tiger Blade is more enjoyable and a second viewing will not be a problem.
Sure I spent a good hour hating the film but in its second half it pulls together for a bit before its overly anti climactic ending and there are some good moments.
While he does not as much look the part, his Marc Antony provides a sturdy center for this second filming of the Shakespeare tragedy.
vanquished Pompeyo and terminates in battle of Filipos where the second triumvirate(Marco Antonio, Lepido and Octavius Augustus: Richard Chamberlain) vanquish Brutus and Cassio.
On a cold winter's night Clare (Rachel McAdams) confesses to her husband Henry (Eric Bana), "I wouldn't change a second of our life together."
The sentimentality and picturesque cinematography makes every second thoroughly enjoyable.
John Gielgud in his second Julius Caesar film role, this time as Caesar himself, is studied and brilliant.
I can only imagine the discipline it must have taken to wait for the sun to peep out from the clouds and then roll film hoping that the cast can pull off the shot before the light changed and a second take became a long wait.
Upon realization that a video game is "dumbed down" for the players to be able to concentrate, however, I opted for a second viewing and came to realize that this was not the waste of time I first believed.
With the release of the second installment and all the advertisement and hype Apocalypse received, it drew the mainstream fans a bit harder; the casual fans were less casual; and the fanboys were still disappointed, but resigned to the fact that this was just how it was going to be; take it or leave it.
Not that the second half is all bad, most of the action takes place during this time and the final fight is rather good too.
Just needs a bit more development during the second half and this film would have been super success.
Both Grant and Hudson are motivated by the desire to let the second wife down easily.
For example, no town, no matter HOW corrupt, would have crooked judges who issue release orders (writs of habeas corpus) the second the crime is committed or before the person is even charged--especially when it appears they will be up on murder charges!!
The second half degenerates into staginess and cheap looking sets, perhaps showing the downside of its theatrical origins.
It is now Mega Man's duty to defeat Wily for a second time and destroy his new eight robotic minions.
Some jokes fall flat but there are about one joke each second, meaning that you'll laugh through the whole movie.
NO SEQUEL"...I can see that it's stuck to it's word, seeing as they did change that after the second one was released.
I would rank this second out of the series, just under the first one.
The second Scary Movie, also from the brothers Wayan, riffed on The Exorcist, The Legend of Hell House, Poltergeist, Little Shop of Horrors, A Nightmare on Elm Street, The Shining, and Hannibal.
It is hard to understand who is making the comments, sometimes they come in the first person, sometimes in second, and several times they are referring to things that are totally out of the time of the Roman Empire - like the comment that the gladiators were sold as it happens to the football players, or the quotes from Suetonius.
I was never bored for a second.
Far too often, the momentum, the intensity was lost, if only for a second or two.
One speaker is clearly an omniscient voice who helps put the story of the gladiators into historical perspective, providing facts and details to enlighten the modern viewer; the second narrator is one of the gladiators, Verus, who tells the viewer whatever is on his mind as it relates to his story.
And though the plot (or I should say, the second portion of the movie) isn't the most original (SEE: Tales from the Crypt Presents Demon Knight) it's still entertaining and recommended for horror buffs.
The second part of the DVD picks up a little bit, but it still didn't draw me into it as much as I wished it had - Peter Coyote just appears that little bit too obvious and over-the-top in his role of the manipulating killer, and the whole connection between him and Jay Smith (Robert Loggia) never really got clear to me - yes, they were working together, but why did Loggia only have a few screen minutes if he's so essential to the plot?
Nevermind - Cindy Pickett was definitely good in this one, and I would even say she was the best of all the cast as far as on-screen performance is concerned (with Boyle coming a very close second).
The second reason I don't watch anymore is how conservative this show is.
Ignited by Kirk Douglas's terrifically brutal performance as Shields, the film is incessantly watchable - similar in structure and perspective to Orson Welles's "Citizen Kane" - as the story tracks his rise to the top and fall from grace through three primary relationships - the first with Fred Amiel, a director with whom Shields partners early in their careers, the second with Georgia Lorrison, an alcoholic bit player and daughter of a Hollywood legend whom Shields grooms to become a big star, and the third with James Lee Bartlow, a writer whom Shields tries to make a screenwriter in spite of the constant interruptions by Bartlow's southern belle wife Rosemary.
The Bad and the Beautiful was the first and Two Weeks In Another Town was the second.
Much of Minelli's tricks in this picture end up in the second...Two Weeks, including scenes from Bad and scoring from Bad.
As Tygra said in the second episode, he missed those important growing up years where a person matures into adulthood.
Big, bronzed Steve Reeves is Hercules, Greek stupor hero who burns 50 brain cells per second.
This is the second and hopefully, I think, last sequel to the Hercules series.
Time apparently really does play tricks with your memory; I recalled this picture as having much more action in it than it really did, but other than Reeves' fight with Primo Carnera, pretty much nothing happens in the first half of the film, and the action that does occur in the second half is mostly perfunctory and, as noted, not very well done.
This was probably Vittorio DeSica's last excellent film before his death in 1974 and it took me about 20 years to view it a second time.
the second is Jennifer Connelly's absolutely stunning and perfectly proportioned body.
One second the people are alive..the next...their head is on the ground.
Impossible to recommend as most sane people will hate every demented second of it, but I'm not most people am I?
That air is bathing in Count Basian atmosphere, like the LADY BE GOOD rendition of the same line-up - with Buddy Rich for added entertainment.And in his second (and last) full-length movie,SECOND CHORUS, Artie Shaw lined up his Concerto For Clarinet, a masterpiece largely shown, not for just two minutes, like SING, SING, SING, in HH.
The first and second books were the best: The Face on the Milk Carton and Whatever Happened to Janie?.
Fortunately, I gave it a second chance, and thought: Hey, it was actually not bad at all.
I have watched this movie about 3 times in the past 2 years, the first time was while I was in Iraq for my second time.
There is a gray area as to whether this is a military or civilian matter, and the father (Tommy Lee Jones) finds himself stuck between an incompetent civilian police force and an edgy and defensive military police force, neither of whom really gives a toss about the truth, the first because truth is too demanding, the second because it's too embarrassing.
I'd say this movie was more along the lines of "Deer Hunter" or "Jarhead" Â where what you see in war plays second fiddle to how you deal with what you see in war.
His second major directorial outing, "In the Valley of Elah," avoids both of the "mistakes" (although I'd hardly call them that, seeing as he won Best Picture for what he did with "Crash") that he made last time around.
While it is his second comedy, this is no Mr. & Mrs. Smith.
The war is finished, the second world war and the Korean war, and even McCarthy is dead and buried, politically I mean.
We can un-bury it, and then bury it again, and eventually un-bury it a second time, but why not re-bury that poor past in order to finally get it out once more and discover it was not so bad and it was nothing but some kind of sad heart disease, a disease of the heart, a weak heart crushed by passions, love passion, dreams that me made into nightmares, and maybe some anger.
And it is then that it is all revealed that human beings are as dumb as my thumb and instead of having thought and thought again and pondered, they jumped to conclusions without even thinking one second.
Also keep your eye out for Hitch's cameo, which goes by much quicker than usual, you can miss it in a split second.
The second number "Take Me To Broadway" featured Van as a human pogo stick, bouncing his way all over town, greeting people and interacting with people and places in town, but he never stops hopping.
"If These Walls Could Talk" is a disturbing and yet emotionally powerful film that's set in the same house on the same street over three different decades (the first segment takes place in the early 1950's, the second is set in the mid-1970's and the third in the mid-1990's...all tumultuous eras in which issues affecting females and their bodies have been brought to the forefront).
The second is the relationship between Navy Junior Grade Lieutenant Douglas North (Gregg Henry in his most memorable performance) and his family, headed by his Navy Commander father (Richard Anderson, who plays about the only officer in the film whose head stays on straight throughout), along with a local Japanese news writer with whom Doug went to school in Oahu, Holly Nagata (Tiana Alexandra, who if I read her IMDb biography right, was all of 16 when this film was made).
The film gets some details wrong - when Nagumo gets word that the first wave has sunk numerous US ships, he orders the launching of the second wave; in fact the second wave took off an hour before the first wave made contact with their targets.
The film also gets wrong the exact time the first wave broke off its attack and also shows torpedo planes in the second wave, when only the first wave had such.
but now u have just ruined it for me with the second one.
First off u forgot some characters Eddies sister, and Page's older brothers, Pages best friend, second, you casted not one person that was in the first one in the second one, I loved that movie u just ruined it with the second one, Some of the characters i had no idea what the hell they were doing or who the hell they were.
While the first movie was in my opinion great and I still watch it sometimes, the second one is a disaster!
I didn't like the second Paige and I compared her with the amazing Julia Stiles.
Paige was just that really cool girl that we all wanted to know, who had a life of her own and hobbies of her own and did not really NEED the prince, but in the second film she is portrayed as some dumb blonde bimbo.
um yeah, not mentioned once in the second movie.
i couldn't see an ounce of the old Paige in the second movie.
A movie as wonderfully and beautifully written and done as The Prince and Me, I felt like the second could have been much better.
The producers obviously made more money than they thought with the first movie, and decided to make a second but came out with such a lousy result, that I think its a pity now that my image of the first movie is seconded with this sequel one!
So if you loved the first, resist the temptation to spoil your memory with this second one!
I just don't see what is the point of bringing out a second one when 1. the ending of he firsts one was fine like is or try more harder to make a sequel when you can get actually find the time to get the original people back and make it done right.
I enjoyed PRINCE AND ME 1 so much more than the second one.
The actors in the first movie were great, but in this second movie the girl who play Paige SUCK!!
While, the second Prince and Me started off fairly like a sweet movie, it turned from a teen audience into a little girl's fantasy world.
Had this second movie been done on its own and not as a sequel, it would have happily landed on its feet as a funny farce.
The second deals with a teenager (Victor Rasuk) with a disturbing home life who can only relate to the world through a camera lens.
The second feeling mutual to the characters (besides loneliness) is guilt.
Dull, predictable lifeless story about a widower who gets a second chance at love with an old college flame after a chance meeting.
However, the second I popped in the DVD, I realized that this movie was different.
This is her second role with a bisexual theme having appeared in the heavy handed 'Personal Best' where she was an athlete who alternated between sleeping with her male coach and a female teammate.
UPDATE: I just watched it again after almost 2 months and enjoyed it as much the second time.
I'm assuming that this is a tale well known in Korea where this is from since this is at least the second version of the story and there is a note at the end about further outcome.
In terms of animation quality, it is second to none.
The John Dye character was married , blessed with two children and yet gets a second chance at happiness.
I watched it as the first part of a double feature (the second film being Mildred Pierce), and I hardly remember a thing about it.
(The original title, La Kermesse hÃ©roÃ¯que, literally The Heroic FÃªte, operates in much the same way as Milos Forman's early satirical masterpiece, The Fireman's Ball, 1967, and the parallels are numerous; no doubt Forman had taken a second look at Feyder's Kermesse during his studies.)
training but don't quote me on that  The second dummy sequence is the bad guy's death (not that that can count as a spoiler since it was clearly going to happen, this is the 'Nature of Die Hard' for crying out loud!).
I would not be opposed to a second game as well, especially if the three flaws I stated are fixed.
The second part - the largest segment - is devoted to USA Crossword Championships held in each in Stamford, Conn. We see the top players profiled and then are witness to the 200- tournament with it's dramatic 3-person playoff finals.
I think I enjoyed the earlier part of the film more than the second half that focused on the tournament.
The second category presents glimpses of various views of a subject and alters these viewpoints as it moves toward illuminating the topic.
The second part is a series of interviews with six or seven celebrity crossword enthusiasts, and with a number of competitors in the annual tournament.
I mean, any single adult who enters into an ongoing sexual relationship with a married person and doesn't for a second think "what happens if we get discovered?"
Fox's annoying hubris is a shame, because if she could have just shut up about her own stupid life for a second, she might've had a good idea for a documentaryÂand it would have been a hell of a lot shorter than a tedious six hours.
You can watch this movie straight through without missing a second and still feel as though you walked away from it several times for 5 minutes.
Not recommended, unless a director's cut comes out in which case this might deserve a second look, maybe.
This is due mainly to the second part of the film.
The whole gun storyline did not strike me as even necessary and I guess I felt, honestly, that the themes explored here-insanity, rape, codependency,child neglect-were way to serious to make into a black comedy which starts happening in the second half of the movie.
Although the second part of the film may be a slight let down after the strong first part, this movie is a definite treat for those who are sick of standard Hollywood fare and for the fans of Sean and Robin Penn and Travolta.
Give us five or so great performances, from the two Penns in love in the first half to John Travolta in the sunny (and shorter) second half, and you have something that really gets under your skin.
A less talented actor would have been forgettable in what could have been a boring part, but he makes the most of every second of his screen time.
In fact, I could not take my eyes off this for a second.
This has a great pace, and is not boring for a second.
Here with this, in terms of fun arguably the second best film of the four after At The Earths Core, Connor and screenplay writer Brian Hayles send McClure, Peter Gilmore and a few rough neck sailor types under the ocean, to where the lost cities of Atlantis be.
Directed by Kevin Connor this was the fourth & final 'lost world' film he & star Doug McClure made together, the first being The Land that Time Forgot (1974), the second was At the Earth's Core (1976), after that came The People that Time Forgot (1977) & Warlords of Atlantis rounded of the loose series of films which is probably my favourite overall.
You have to see it to experience how rubbish it is, watch this film but don't pay anything more than a dollar, or pound or a euro... try and see if you can last till the movie ends...I couldn't the first time and missed the ending the second time, it now sits proudly with the rest of my DVD collection as it should with everyone, so you can say, I own the worst film eva made
The acting was second rate at best by all involved.
This movie was even better the second and third time around.
Christoph Stark's second film comes not so long after that trendy, popular flick 'Run Lola Run' by Tom Twyker.
): the violence in one scene (culminating in the bathroom): we see it all second hand on video (mostly hear it), was pretty extreme by my standards.
The material is too second rate and the actor's are too third rate to carry this anywhere but the nearest lowest price blockbuster bargain bin.
Here, the cult's religion is not intriguing enough to merit any second thoughts as to whether their predictions about an imminent doomsday might actually be true and grounded in hard evidence.
The Quanta Group's second in command, who appears at the start in the TV interview, and whose name eludes me, is also superb.
The second half of the film has lots of plot twists that make for great after-viewing discussion.
I remember that Doris Day (a great animal lover) introduced this second showing, saying that the first had been "a happening."
This movie has a good bit of cursing but overall the movie was phenomenal and I loved every second of it.
Having said that, the film drags on lifelessly for the whole second half, so the best that can possibly be said is that it's bearable.
This is her second try behind the camera.
In this her second venture as a director, Ms. Gavras has done her old man proud.
Robert DeNiro plays the second person this movie examines, the most powerful mobster in the city of New York, Paul Vitti.
"The Brothers Bloom" is as ambitious as second films get -- it's about everything and nothing, with a plot that takes its characters trotting across Europe in an era that could be 2010 but which at times seems more like 1810, as they contemplate the meaning of life and art.
However, after a second viewing I found that the plot does make sense, if you pay attention; and if you'll let it get into your head, there are rewarding depths of profundity and meaning in the tiniest details.
The Brothers Bloom is the second feature from writer/director Rian Johnson.
The Walsh parents showed up at the very last second to remark how James Eckhouse lost his hair and to bellow how everyone grew up (like they didn't already know it since half the cast is still bumming around in showbiz).
First we are shown the man's skill with the bow, then we see how the girl's spatial knowledge of the boat and archery skills can serve as a second layer of defense.
A bad element is that some romantic moments can be remarked as a little bit artificial, but we must not forget the environment, the circumstances of those years (between first and second word war)with a snobbery society.
He does get his daughter Louisa married to Josiah Bounderby (the second villain), an ironmonger and "self-made man", who won't hear of coddling the workers (the Stephen Blackpools, if you will) of the world - he keeps using a ridiculous metaphor of the workers wanting to drink turtle soup out of silver tureens.
Almost like a James Bond movie for kids, The Flyboys devotes itself to action first, realism and morals second.
Once while attending the Garden State Film Festival and a second time in my home town in the Connecticut Film Festival.
Big thumbs UP to the first detail, and a big thumbs DOWN to the second.
In the second half the film becomes a roller coaster ride of red herrings, plot twists and other surprises, which makes it decisively superior to Amadio's earlier effort.
Is has no gore outside of some dripping blood and has a flash of breasts for less than second in a non sexual content.
The second victim turns up, something like Wilma Weinstein from Weber.
The film's second half fails to convince, largely because of its clichÃ©d plot contrivances.
But it falters in the second half, owing to fictional plot points that dilute the underlying real-life premise.
As she is steadily driving herself crazy with trying to second guess the irrational mind, her finance Capt.
Overall a great final, The second season opener "Little Green Men" was just as good
With the second appearance in the series of the voice of Danny, Mulder gets an address from him for Zeus Storage.
And this movie (the second by Faunteroy, director of the equally fragmented Today You Die) has plenty of action (to make up for the lack of logic, perhaps?)
This Arubian, American & South African co-production was directed by Don E. FauntLeRoy who is also credited as cinematographer Mercenary for Justice was the second of three awful straight-to-video/DVD action flicks he made with Seagal (the other's being Today You Die (2005) & Urban Justice (2007) which are just as bad) & at this stage I seriously doubt whether Seagal will ever make a decent action film again, entertaining action fare such as Hard to Kill (1990), Marked for Death (1990), Out for Justice (1991) & the two Under Siege (1992, 1995) films seem a distant memory from a very long time ago.
According to the IMDb this had a budget of about $15,000,000 which I don't believe for a second, there is no way this cheap looking film cost that much.
The story makes no sense whatsoever from beginning to end, and Seagal's ego-feeding is in full-force here (he is introduced as "the most decorated soldier in Gulf War I" - apparently he wouldn't even settle for "second most decorated" - and, of course, nobody can land a single tiny hit on him in a fight, despite the fact that these days he has to send his stunt double to climb over a 10-foot wall).
Dresham signals for a policeman's attention, policeman walks over, Seeger somehow manages to master the art of teleportation, and mysteriously ends up in a van that happens to drive by when Dresham jumps out of the vehicle the split second Seeger disappears.
I would rather get injection into the base of my finger nails then watch one second of this "film" which is in true poor taste and form.
I would rather get injection into the base of my finger nails then watch one second of this "film" which is in true poor taste and form.
Working as a second shift engineer at a PBS station has it's compensations... and the WNET production of Thornton Wilder's OUR TOWN is one of them!
Sceenwriter Alejandro Hernandez says the story is "about second chances and hope... hard times are only the prelude to something better."
Also, note that it will only go out to a few screens at first and those who don't go on opening weekends will miss the chance to see it the second weekend.
I enjoy the Frank Capra film, but he gets preachy in the second half (which has nothing to do with Kaufman/Hart), and it is an entirely different animal.
The second time the man with the staff broke down Shaft's door, I was in tears.
My favorite time in my life was when I was the second male in a triad, a very rich and satisfying life.)
But the wit of the script (written by Hecht but, as always with Lubitsch, carefully supervised and contributed to by the director himself) and the appeal of the performers (more about them later) pull the film through the occasional rough spots, and the second half of the movie is just about perfect.
Jerry Jameson, the director, should have taken a second of his time to realize that he should have opted out of butchering the sequel to such a great movie and quit his dead-end job at the prestigious USA Film studios, if not only to spare his future audiences from torture that could possibly be used to extract valuable information from the inmates at Guantanamo bay.
The story of the relationship between the 10-year old child and the fox is even less convincing the second time around, when you know where it's headed.
The final horror film from the celebrated British studio was the second adaptation of a Dennis Wheatley novel to reach the screen, after "The Devil Rides Out" in the late 60's.
The movie coupled with the fantastic soundtrack,meant that in years gone by it was always first amongst the movies on video night.Two movies which l feel a similar and most definitely be appreciated by fans of The Wraith, are two Australian films made slightly prior to The Wraith.The obvious movie being Mad Max,however the second less obvious is the movie "Running on Empty",similar plots lines,identifiable characters and outback,desert type settings are all evident.
In summary a truly enjoyable movie,where you strap yourself along for the ride.Win the race,Win the Girls heart and get the second chance everyone so desperately wishes for.
Why does he get a second chance & no one else?
This is my second favorite movie behind maximum overdrive!
It only got better the second time around.
The intrigue is generated towards the start mainly because of the fact that the film is so difficult to follow, but once the film enters it's more satisfying second half, these problems are somewhat resolved.
Sure Gamera looks like he was constructed at the last second out of an old shopping bag; and, Monster X looks like something that you pulled out of a Salvation Army drop-box.
Mind you, anyone with looks like Sean Bean can't exactly be desperate... Did you know he was voted second sexiest man in Britain?....sexiest man in the world, more like...Sorry, am I diverting?
It's just disappointing when the worst performance in an unambitious action movie comes from a supposedly competent big name, and the best from a martial artist for whom English is a second (or third, for all I know) language.
Helmed by Robert Radler, TNT fails miserably as a generic stupid actioner, the movie is mercilessly boring for it's first half only to be undeniably hilarious it's second half.
But then, in the second half, things get a little confusing.
I don't know if I just missed the point of the second half, but it definitely left me scratching my head.
My second favorite episode yet.
And let's not forget that this was his first real movie and that it took him from nothing to Hollywood in like a second, now thats impressive.
The dialogue itself is the second major flaw in this movie.
From Star Wars debates (did the destruction of the second Death Star in "Jedi" cost innocent contractors their lives?)
I even forgot the name of it and had to hit info a second time.
It's good for all of us second besters.
Thank you for putting yourself second, which puts you in 1st.
who among us hasn't suffered from feeling second best.
if you have ever felt second best, you will enjoy the film.
But when the chips are down, it's Elliot who comes through as a real mensch, a good guy in the most important ways, and the film leaves you with the sense that in every important respect Elliot is not "second best" at all.
On second and subsequent viewings Lelouch's famous blast through Paris throws up more questions than even the reviewers here have come up with.
English romance always seems to fall under the second, and sometimes numbingly depressing, idea.
English romance always seems to fall under the second, and sometimes numbingly depressing, idea.
I didn't realize it was a British movie(otherwise I might have given it a second look at the video store) and caught it on cable.
The first time I saw it I was incredulous, and the second time, even more so.
In my opinion, he is the second best by far of the James Bonds.
Moore is brought in to thwart them, and plays a tense psychological games with his adversaries, constantly provoking them and second guessing their actions whilst trying to ascertain the most effective way to attack them aboard their vessel.
This is the second film by cult, independent film-maker Kevin Smith.
Overall Mallrats is an acceptable second offering from Smith that he would later better with Chasing Amy.
Kevin Smith's second feature is actually very similar to his first.
This is the second film in the "New Jersey" series by Kevin Smith.
The second was the Dr. Demento puppet show where Frank Zappa finds out how crazy Wild Man really is and breaks it off.
The twists in the second half of the film, though motivated and logical, were too redolent of Twin Peaks for me, so much that it detracted from my experience of Lake Mungo.
MOUSE WRECKERS (1948) is my second favorite Warner Brothers cartoon (after the delightful FEED THE KITTY).
The script by Robert Sabaroff was based on the novel 'The Seventh' by Donald E. Westlake can be divided into three chunks, the first third of the film revolves around the recruiting of the team with some fun set-pieces to make sure each member is up to the task, the second third of the film is my favourite when they carry out the heist & there's that feeling that you root for them & you want to get away with it & all the close calls they have & watching the plan unfold is pretty fun, then the final third of the film is perhaps the weakest as several random events come together & tear the thieves apart & it becomes a rather dull runaround after the money which goes missing through no fault of their own but does obviously cause problems as they don't know who to trust.
The second thing was Prohibition.
In this second screen version of W. Somerset Maugham's morality tale, "Rain", Joan Crawford gives a performance that knocks the rest of the cast off the screen.
This is where the writer/director weaves two fundamental issues together: first, there is the male angst about whether his wife still loves him - which generates the bizarre dream set in Paris (while they are both on holiday in China) and second, there is the deeper philosophical issue about reality itself.
Here's a an idea Â let's round-up a bunch of Hollywood has-beens, second rate TV actors, and a bunch of no-names and put them all on board a cross Atlantic flight.
With a film like "The Attic Expeditions", more chances are taken Â the risks are higher, and the final product is worth a second viewing.
I don't mind calling this film cheap because it entertained me mentally, and I will go back to rewatch to see if a second viewing would un-muddle the questions looming in my mind.
It means that someone will take a small budget, second rate actors and a horribly written script and make a movie that is a miasma of looks and scenes that confuse you.
Further evidence that they awaken in parallel realities is that the residents and principals of the "House of Love" introduce themselves to Trevor the second times he awakens, whereas Trevor already knows them.
But about that nudity: the second time I saw this was from a DVD rented from Blockbuster.
On second watching I could see the loose ends that were tied, so I was pretty happy overall.
For the record, this movie is second to Dead Man's Walk and a tad above Lonesome Dove.
Let's just say that this is just the pilot, and it seems a little time passed before the shot the second episode because it has a completely different feel that will become the norm for the rest of the series.
Caught it on TV last night, and forced myself to "give it a second chance".
Worth every second to watch.
When early on one of the original four members of the expedition (Kip Niven) dies it's acknowledged in about 15 seconds; when a second crew member (Paul Winfield) gets eaten by giant scorpions (which look more like beetles) it isn't mentioned at all!
Unfortunately the plot utterly falls flat during the second hour but the marvellous finale hopefully restores our interest .
The second story focuses on the young fledgling crime fighter Bruce Wayne and how close he came to quitting in order to have a normal life with his love interest, Andrea Belmont.
This is in my humble opinion the second best "Batman" movie next to "Begins" which is number one for me while "Batman (1989)" is number 3, this is one of the best animated movies of all time and truly captures the dark essence of the character from his DC comics roots.
The best part of that music is around the 12 second mark she plays this wondering choir and brass right before the operatic choir kicks in.
The second I pressed the stop button on my DVD I almost totally forgot about the movie, a good film is one can't get out of your head for a week after watching it, and most Coen Brother films do that.
The first time I watched this movie I thought it was hilarious but the second time it just really rubbed me the wrong way...
I didn't feel the second half was too strong, as they spent too much time trying to wrap the plot up, not enough time on humor, but all in all it was still pretty funny.
This was a second series attempt from musician Roderick Taylor a year after Otherworld for CBS.
I've not seen the second movie, nor do I plan to.
Thankfully, the grit was brought back in this second sequel - Cindy has to do so much in this film to get the Prince to remember her (such as overcome exile, kidnapping, and defeat a human version of the diabolical cat Lucifer) that we really see her turn from a worthy girl benefiting from Karma into a determined heroine.
The second Cinderella was cute, but lacked originality and seemed lacklustre in quality.
It was a huge improvement over the second in all departments.
On the whole though, it is an above average and perfectly watchable movie, almost as good as the original, and a vast improvement over the second.
Thus the first segment of II, starting right after Cinderella's honeymoon, has already happened in the beginning of Twist, but time is then rewound; the third segment with Anastasia and the Baker happens entirely after Twist; and the second segment, which was the stupid little story about the mice, is completely irrelevant.
So in Twist, they have built on the second one instead of ignoring it, as I had expected them to do.
OK, the one thing that angered me about Twist was the one character I really liked from the second one, the one I thought saved it and made it any good.
She had basically no purpose and was nowhere near as cool as in the second one.
I can only say it was neat to see her in the castle before the time of the second movie.
The plot was decent and the animation, while nothing can compare to the original, is decent and colorful as well.I'm sad to say that the second movie actually had better music than this one.
Cher comes in as a close second.
Nevertheless, the film becomes more gripping in the second half, aided by a superb performance from Meryl Streep in the leading role, one of a series of great parts that made her probably the best film actress of the eighties.
In the second photo, she leans into him a little bit.
The music is also excellent (who can forget the chilling voices in the second, final section of Norfair?).
The bulling become more harsh as the gags got weak, which was about half was thought the second series.
I watched it first without the subtitles and was so taken by the movie, I watched it a second time with the titles and realized I had missed very little.
The film did make viewing on Channel 10 several years ago courtesy of movie host Bill Collins, and I was fortunate to dub a second copy.I have not seen it since.
You know, the kind where after they've come and gone you must back em up for a second take.
I am keeping my fingers crossed for a great second season.
The acting is TERRIBLE and there is NO humor in any episode at any minute at any second.
In Holland the second season is now on TV.
But the second season is so good!!!!
The small-town atmosphere is brilliantly captured on a studio set (marred only by some corny elements in the script intended to accentuate the local color, such as the over-use of Margo's castanets - to the point where they even become a motif - or the birthday song delivered to the second victim of the titular creature&#8230;but, especially, the infuriatingly stupid mother of the little girl - who bullies her innocent and fearful daughter to an early grave!
In the other, the mother of the second victim is seen carrying a black cat in her arms.
On the second viewing, I lost interest halfway through and stopped it.
If only the second half had kept that early momentum up.
The second involves a young girl who has gone to the graveyard to put flowers on her mother's grave, and also to meet with her lover.
First for the compelling and brilliant 'I Walked With a Zombie', and second for this film; The Leopard Man.
One is that they're equally intrigued as I was and the second reason is that it sounds like really good masturbation fuel .
If you're watching for the second reason you'll be bitterly disappointed since there's very little on screen sex but if you're watching for the sensible reason you'll still be as disappointed as the voyeurs .
Most of the second half of the film is dynamite as everyone tries to figure out whats going on and how to survive.
Kinda stays this way throughout the second half of the movie, really), but I don't think it was nearly as bad as people say.
Unfortunately the pacing slows down a bit during the second half of the film and the dialogs begin to sound repetitive.
And the second segment, "Nonfiction", has one of the creepiest characters ever in the young kid in the family.
The second story "non-fiction" is not as painful but still is a joke.
Storytelling is worth seeing for the great acting (in both "Fiction" and "Nonfiction") and the excellent second section, but you can clip your toenails or stare out the window for the most part during the first half hour.
The second, Fact, revolves around a boy named Scooby and his "struggles".
The second story is where all the meat is and the first was pretty good too.
I got a great kick out of those English Lit class discussions, with all those hypocritical, cowardly, unimaginative, brainwashed college girls listening to the second essay, but pretending awkwardly not to know what or whom it's really about.
Quite a gimmickÂ The second part - well, it's just a masterpiece.
The second story is much longer and as a result has characters that are much more well developed.
Our second well...with the same subjects just this time with non-fiction in place of fiction.
The second half of the film deals with a documentary filmmaker who is basically supposed to represent Solondz himself.
If Solandz would have just pulled one character from the first story and show a glimpse of them in the second, I would have found the movie a lot smoother around the edges.
Since he did not do this, I am forced to evaluate the second part of the film more due to the time spent on it as well as plot development.
Format aside, I loved the second part of storytelling.
The second part is the story of a documentaire filmmaker who tries to make a film about teens in suburbia.
He doesn't follow the normal structure of a hollywood film, a protagonist with an dramatic purpose, an antagonsist with an invert purpose, ... Like the bad guy in part one tells us, the second story is way better, this one has at least a begin, a middle and an end.
The second part Nonfiction is also highly self-aware.
The second PPV title match for these two, the first with Austin defending.
Being his second film since the short animation that got Gil Kenan his career, and being such a step up from that, I am hugely excited to see what this fledgling director will be coming out with next.
She's one of the better young actress out there and shines this bright light at us that we fall in love with her the first second we laid eyes on her.
In this episode, Bugs Bunny begins to play Lizst's second Hungarian Rhapsody, when a mouse, who lives in the piano, interrupts Bugs Bunny and the rabbit begins to play various other tunes (not all classical), all very well.
The second movie is unabashed marketing for tourism in Mexico - the last shot is of a tourist poster that melts into a plane flying to or from our neighbor to the south.
Steeped in the historically and culturally turbulent period of the second Sino-Japanese War, one must applaud Ang Lee for the dizzying array of minutiae he oversaw as director.
Because of the nature of the film's protagonist Wang Jiazhi (played by a newcomer named Tang Wei - not shabby for your first feature) as an agent working under a second identity to ensnare a dangerous collaborationist (Tony Leung), all the scenes where Wang masquerades as the bourgeois Ms. Mai are fraught with a psychological tension, doubling with the political agenda at stake as well as her womanhood.
Though she got set up to get involved with this role by Lee, the result shows that her efforts worth every second.
The second stanza is the best one, a family move into an old house and start to see strange visions.
The second segment highlights a young couple who move into a new house, where the wife begins having visions of a murder that may have happened there.
I think the scariest story is the second one about the couple moving into the old house.
The second story was about fairy's that protect this old ladies house and it was pretty dang good.
All three short films have a kind of twilight zone type feeling to them, the grainy 80's backdrop for me made it more eerie than the typical horror you see these days, of all the short films it was the second one 'Dreamhouse' that got me...a woman seeing horrific images of people being slaughtered before her eyes in her new home, even going as far as calling in a medium, her husband thinks shes crazy and it has a very intense bloody climax that had me grossed out as a 14 year old but not so much as a 30 year old!
The beast is a complex being who has a second chance for rebirth and reconciliation.
This was one of the few movies I happily paid to see twice in the cinema, and sitting in a sparsely-populated Friday night audience (I was living in Barbados at the time, and it was hardly the most artistic place on Earth... it was a crying shame that there was hardly anyone there while "Home Alone 2" went through the roof) the second time, the magic remained.
this film gets better on second viewing.
Paul came up with the idea to make a TV show around the Beatles recording and rehearsing new material from scratch at Twickenham with a second show that would see the group performing at the Roundhouse, London.All this completed in January 1969.
The film is a good look at the Beatles second to last studio sessions but as a documentary goes there is so much tampering with what you see (its very badly synched up even when the performance does "match" the visual) that it loses marks in my opinion .
The second item to remember is that the director was not taping a concert, thus explaining why the video jumps around quite a bit and there are very few songs shown being performed from beginning to end.
In short, "Let It Be" is really worth it for the second half of the film.
Following the disaster of the 'Magical Mystery Tour' film, it's no wonder the Beatles didn't take part in Yellow Submarine (which turned out to be a great film, second to A Hard Day's Night) I've read in various Beatle Biographies that Paul McCartney came up with the idea of having camera's installed in the studio.
The second part takes place in the basement studios at their Apple Records building,as they jam on some of the oldies that they loved in their youth.
I watched this Beatles documentary for the first time when it was released for the second time in the Spanish theaters in 1980.
(though I enjoyed seeing John Savage from 'Hair' ...ect)  The second half I guess there were a couple giggles.
It is a funny movie though, as long as you are keeping in mind that this is only the director's second film and everyone has to start somewhere.
Bram is the author of one successful book, being hounded by his publisher to produce a second.
I can hardly wait for the second movie, "By the Light of the Silvery Bay" (1953) to come on!
It contains some very good second unit material shot in Mexico, so there must have been a large budget for that, as it must have taken at least two or three weeks on location.
However, that wears thin, and the second half is a drag.
The first meant doing whatever the studio said, and the second meant that what the studio told him was to play the racketeer personality that had sold "Public Enemy" in film after film.
One highlight was a striptease dance and song done by Elaine Stritch towards the end of the second act, where she is a reporter talking about interviewing Gypsy Rose Lee.
and, in testing it, merges himself with a fly that, unbeknown to him, zips about his second telepod.
Then when he points the gun to his head and begs for death I suddenly realised the second time watching it the true pain both Physically and mentally he went through.
With both these thoughts in mind, I suspect that "The Fly" could well be the second best horror film of all time (behind Kubrick's "The Shining", which, I admit, got to first place by completely different criteria.
I don't like musicals Â the idea of a group of people bursting into spontaneous communal song never appealed to me, but the combination of scenario (a post second world war era where the war is now fought as much in the halls of Whitehall as on the battlefield Â and Britain is losing) and music (British 50's) just hit the right note with me (pun intended).
Just watched this, the second of Boris Karloff's collaborations with producer Val Lewton, on YouTube.
"Isle of the Dead" was the second of three films that Boris Karloff made for famed producer Val Lewton in 1945-46.
I can not imagine this girl getting down from the second floor by the stairs with all this stuff.......whahhhhhhhhhhh
The second was the Great Depression, and how it impacted the traditional notion of the "American dream."
:)  The first part of the story reminded me of Harry Potter and the second of Lord of the Rings, however it solid on it's own and has enough unique features, so you wouldn't be bored.
As a 40 year-old man, childrens fantasy films usually aren't my first (or even second) choice of movies.
As for style,plenty of video-effects simply make the film like serial of music clips with no serious contents, or some kind of parody of gangster films.If one wants to show drama,tell some story,then he must select only minimum needed effects which will not irritate viewers.The first half of the film is especially bad,the second half is better(less effects), but even this fact is only an another evidence of inconsistency.
His first dinner could be for his friends, the second could be at his Grandma's.
By the second time I got through this carousel of events, my mind, now pleasantly anesthetized, stopped trying to find out what's going on and just started enjoying and craving more from each situation.
Even when you watching this film a second time you still might get lost in figuring out all these details.
On a second viewing the themes become more apparent, and this is a movie you'll want to see (at least) twice.
Linda was probably a gold-digger who bailed the second Andy lost the belt, but fathers were very rarely awarded custody back then unless the mother was as an unfit a parent as Andy is!
Her plot for The Champ earned her the second of her two Oscars.
This is a delightful romance even when you watch it for the second time, My vote is nine.
The second trivium is that "When You're in Love" is the only film ever directed by screenwriter Robert Riskin.
The second character (Azzam) was a shoe polisher in the old days & turned to be a very rich man who has Car agencies & huge stores in Egypt & is searching for another wife to marry for fulfilling his sexual interest but with marriage he thinks that he is on the right track according to religion but when the story goes on it shows us how cruel he was with his new beautiful wife (Somaya El Khashab) & on the other hand he entered the Egyptian assembly with his relations with some government officials.
Now I'm thinking to take the rest of my friends to it so i can be able to watch it second time.
Hopefully, more movies of that genre will be made in the future because every second of that movie was entertaining in every aspect and i was enjoying it until the very last second, and i even didn't want it to finish.this movie is just BEAUTIFUL!!
He takes a penniless young widow with a young son, Soad (Somaya el Khashab), as a second wife and forces her to have an abortion.
I love her second only to Joni Mitchell.
I was on holiday this year when she appeared at a nearby venue-it broke my heart-I have yet to see her live-but this concert is a wonderful second best!
What I can say though is that it can decelerate from 110mph to 20mph in half a second (ha!
Film4 have just shown it for the second time to my knowledge.
In this respect, Niven may be regarded as 'the second of the few'.
The government are according to all CT's cynical mass-murders, who kills people without second thought.
And yet Dylan Avery was allowed to live and make his "documentaries" that could bring down the whole government-system, and he has also been allowed to make a second and now even a third version of his film (he keeps updating them, because he has to replace his exposed his old lies and disproved facts with new lies and facts).
I think the funniest (and perhaps pathetic) moment of loose change is when it shows footage of the second plane hitting the second tower.
The Light At The Edge of the World marks Kirk Douglas's second filming of a Jules Verne novel.
That question helps drive the second half of the film.
Seemed to really push the envelope for that time period in terms of gay and trans-gender undertones - what with the pirate captain's attachment to his butler and to his androgynous second in command (the character who paraded around in a dress and feathers and appeared much more interested in Will than in Arabella).
I think the second worst aspect, after the terrible story line, was Lange's acting.
Fox is a second string professional bowler who's got a TV producer he's involved with, Nancy Travis.
The second incident that brings Emil back to reality has to do with his getting into a fight with fellow student Stanley Dumbowski, Rudy Wissle.
The problem with the English translation, while subtle, surfaced more in the second half, as one can tell they are not done by the same person(s).
Well...i rented this movie only because i needed a second movie to rent at the video store and this one promised a dollar back if returned the next day...now i know why..they knew no one would want to keep this poor excuse of a movie in their house for more then a day.
Unfortunately near the end of the second season, the series veered completely away from the last sense of reality.
