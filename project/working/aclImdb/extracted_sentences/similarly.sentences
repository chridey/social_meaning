Madrid film I've watched was the similarly dispiriting THE HORRIBLE SEXY VAMPIRE (1970)!
A movie done similarly could be The Ring, or One Missed Call.
Where Easy Rider was similarly plot less and freewheeling, at least it had interesting characters and situations, and charismatic performers.
This demands the proper mix of compassion and dispassion, which for Buscemi, as for others similarly gifted, leads to an almost inseparable mix of comedy and pathos: up is down, down is up.
and the humor is similarly fast paced and, at times, absurd.
The rogue was a good actor, but his part was similarly inane and the character completely unlikable.
The artform of the mime is one that, understandably perhaps, hasn't been treated much on the silver screen (in this way, it elicits comparison with the classic ballet-oriented THE RED SHOES [1948] Â which, similarly, adopted a stylized look throughout mixed with an adroit sense of the macabre); the most famous example is, of course, Jean-Louis Barrault's unforgettable Baptiste in Marcel Carne's LES ENFANTS DU PARADIS (1945) and Marcel Marceau (who has died fairly recently) can be said to be the only mime artist that is renowned worldwide.
Forget the throwaway title, this documentary about the wayward, moneyed Brigid Berlin is the equal of Terry Zwigoff's Crumb; a similarly troubling yet funny biography.
What really turns him into a determined type is his meeting with another patient (also similarly crippled) named Jill Matthews (Nanette Newman).
Mr. De Marney is similarly impressive as the sinister, titular character.
The music is similarly disparate, ranging from techno-psychedelia that's something like Pink Floyd's "Time" to pensive contemporary-sounding themes, or the hilariously amateurish performance at the Paris Ball.
I don't rate it as highly as the Leone's similarly themed DUCK YOU SUCKER (1971), but it's well worth watching all the same.
The jail house rape of Yvette is very graphic and I doubt if any other movie will show such a powerful scene unless you see "Two Women" again where the Italian Star is similarly abused.Perhaps the scenes showing Jones in a gun battle with the local police was not too realistic as it might have been but overall I believe the story rang fairly true to life and regret that it had to be placed in the area that presented the law as having such men who would take advantage of a good looking blond woman in distress.
While nothing terribly original, "Adam & Evil" takes the classic elements of the woodland horror tale and crafts a fine picture, better than many of its similarly obscure peers.
Hoskins in fact often makes this most unpleasant of characters sympathetic (with some witty one-liners part of his repertoire) in the midst of similarly unsavoury individuals.His grotesque arrogance and megalomania however get the better of him when he somehow thinks he can take on the even more ferocious and brutal elements within the IRA.He is warned of the risks by one of his closest associates,fresh-faced Jeff (who is killed by Harold in a savage outburst) but to no avail.The irony of course,is that Harold himself did not instigate this chaos;it the aforementioned Jeff and one of his most trusted friends and associates,Colin,a homosexual,who fell prey to the dual temptations of sex and money while in Belfast (doing an errand without Shand's knowledge or approval),placing Harold's business plans in dire jeopardy.
Earlier on during this Halloween Horror challenge, I had watched HOUSE OF HORRORS (1946) which was basically a precursor to this one Â similarly dealing with a hulking criminal with a penchant for back-breaking dubbed "The Creeper" (actually first seen in the Sherlock Holmes mystery THE PEARL OF DEATH [1944]!).
Zwigoff's film shows Crumb in every way available and tries to express his art similarly.
Surrounding Craig's scientifically-minded character are similarly well-read arty north Londoners all either completely oblivious to Joe's distress or the cause of it, preferring a rather British 'take no notice' view of Jed's stalking, which I found entirely believable.
Much of the inner drama of Joe and Claire's relationship breakdown is similarly lost in translation.
And I think the strongest point of his comedy is his completely stonefaced response to all adversity--but he lets you see just a little his plight in his eyes and it's just enough to know that he is frightened, but that the rest of him doesn't react similarly creates such an amusing dissociation that it goes from bizarre to funny.
Just one year later in 'Follow the Fleet (1936)' Â after 'Top Hat (1935)' had made box-office gold of Fred and Ginger Â Scott is similarly relegated to a romantic supporting role, having to settle for Ginger's nondescript sister (Harriet Hilliard).
Morris paints himself as a detective, similarly to the way he did in "The Thin Blue Line", attempting to bring those truly responsible to justice.
Watch Belly, State Property, Get Rich or Die Trying, or any of the hordes of other similarly themed films and you won't have to torture yourself with this debacle.
If you liked this, and you should for what it was (Ebert could lighten up but then again he probably can't be PC and give this movie anything more than zero stars), check out Tomcats - similarly funny and original.
He has no savant skills (Hollywood's usual obsession with the disorder), think Rain Man; similarly there is no 'miracle cure' offered.
That is to say, any audience of its day, since it's now a fascinating freak of unspeakably wretched period cinema, way more fun and thought-provoking for what it gets wrong, than what the same year's highly regarded, and similarly set, "The Hospital" once seemed to get right.
A spoiled feline who pushes his butler, Meadows, too far and then finds himself with no-one to look after him, Pussy makes the most of his short time in the spotlight (he was usurped by the similarly jittery Claude Cat) by having one of the all time great mental collapses in cartoon history.
No doubt the animators in 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988)' used Red as a template for the similarly alluring Jessica Rabbit.
-and similarly,  there seems to be a lot of homages to the movies from the 20's, but many of  them likely don't work if you haven't seen those old movies.
Legal procedure is similarly ignored in court scenes.
Rather than repeating the same review three times, all three segments of this film can be summarized similarly: These three tales are all masterfully produced, seamlessly cast, and flawlessly produced.
Why is it that we have so few similarly idiosyncratic actresses around today?
You also get Mr. Kibbee, providing seasoned counterpoint for the upper-crusted Mr. Smith, and similarly dignified Henry Stephenson (as Havisham).
The acting is uneven, even for the several experienced actors involved, and all in all it is a wasted opportunity that ends up being similarly a complete waste of time.
Non-native women, similarly displayed, would be considered pornographic.
Woody Harrelson, the rival FBI agent, puts in a similarly enjoyable performance, and his inept bumblings around the island create some unexpected comic situations between the cop and the thief.
A metaphor for something similarly stupid and irrelevant?
Doc Hollywood has a similarly talented cast with great dialog and excellent direction.
With its harrowing scenes of sexual abuse and violent death and torture, it is easy to understand why this movie might be considered more shocking than other similarly themed flicks from the same era; but is delivering a rawer and nastier (but still very exploitative) movie any more distasteful or disrespectful than making light of the subject matter?
Why is it that we have so few similarly idiosyncratic actresses around today?
The other characters are similarly situated and nicely contribute to the flow of the story (the subplot with Okazaki and Kanae is particularly ingenious.)
And during a party scene, he argues for the comparison of Gandhi and Hitler--unaware that Gandhi similarly used women to test his own purity, and that the latter's sadistic, eruptive violence would soon adhere to him.
The bulk of the "atmospheric" or "creepy" material arrives in this last half hour to forty minutes, such as the videotape of another young girl suddenly changing, her head bizarrely, violently shaking similarly to an effect first made popular in Jacob's Ladder (1990).
Treeves' struggles are similarly reduced.
If you're a fan of visceral OTT slapstick horrorÂparticularly Sam Raimi's Evil Dead trilogy (which this film is obviously heavily influenced by) or the early work of Peter Jackson (whose similarly daft Bad Taste came out the same year)Âthen Rabid Grannies should be right up your alley.
A similar scene occurred in 1957's "The Desperate Hours" with Bogey at the helm in charge of similarly inept henchmen.
With any luck, the newly restored DVD (which looks amazing) will inspire some up-and-coming directors to kick their careers off with a similarly personal and interesting feature debut.
being placed in a similar situation to the characters in the movie it is easy to see how quick it would be to pre-judge somebody without knowing all the facts.this film first appeared in 1988 (ian Barry), be careful there are similarly named movies out there.....
While watching Assassination Tango -- Robert Duvall's follow-up to his directorial debut, The Apostle --, I was vaguely reminded of this year's similarly themed The Dancer Upstairs (which was also directed by a veteran actor-turned-director -- John Malkovich), in that they both deal with a man-on-a-mission who falls for a dancing instructor.
Clarke is remembered for her more famous movies, like "The Public Enemy," "Waterloo Bridge," and "Frankenstein," and Carroll and Dvorak do have some similarly memorable films.
We similarly understand that Ray is having second thoughts about getting married.
So, for me, living abroad, in a continental-sized country the size of the US, with a similarly monolingual culture, the true test of its success is whether the audiences here "got" the film, and whether it made them laugh or moan in the right places.
Rather than portray Saladin as the ruthless yet often merciful Muslim military mind, Keith and the film portray Saladin very similarly to a European crusader.
is pretty contrived; similarly, the fact that Young is contended in the terms laid down by Saladin for the truce with the Christian world is pure Hollywood.
The young country lad Shuisheng is similarly tainted.
And then she fills it with two things, this translucent actress and a similarly translucent open landscape.
It's sad that while Calhern was given an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, Ann Harding was not similarly honored.
Oddly it reminds me a little of "King of Queens" - entirely different setting but similarly human and not unkind.
Speaking of great casting choices, Ludivine Sagnier is similarly brilliant as Rampling's sexy co-star.
Apparently "Touch of her Flesh" was a huge success in the so-called Grindhouse circuit and almost promptly Â within just one year Â spawned two similarly titled sequels.
The fact that the cities Jarmusch chose are iconic world places and that the director 'knows the night' of every one of them and shoots them brilliantly and similarly and trying to tour them all is a remarkable fact, but still I don't feel the necessity of mentioning the cities in this review.
My in-laws are similarly musicians of a dispossessed people (Pontians, Greek orthodox who once lived in Turkey), so I could relate well to the scenario in the film.
In it's early years, Big Brother was fresh, original and fascinating, but I wonder how many watch it now for reasons other than duty, habit and so they don't feel left out at work, similarly, I wonder how many housemates appear because they aren't hopeless attention-seekers.
Since then,there has been an explosion of similar publications,perhaps not quite as cringingly oily to the so-called famous as the aforementioned terrible twins,but if anything even less intelligent and brainless,with similarly garishly coloured photos thrown in for good measure.I am sure there are still plenty of talented writers,actors,singers,comedians,dancers,etc.
Preston Tucker had it all: a joie de vivre that made everyone around him want to sing for joy, a similarly eccentric loving family with hearts as big as Texas, the imagination of a precocious child, and the hard driving intelligence of a man who wills himself to be the best.
From the plot of an elite military unit sent into a jungle under the guise of locating a similarly elite team that lost contact, right down to the stoic Native American soldier copy of Predator's Billy, it can only be assumed the creators of this monstrosity were hoping the viewers had never seen "Predator."
The only other contemporary singer I can imagine doing a similarly credible job is Melissa Etheridge.
By the way, director Cahn later made the similarly cheapskate IT!
George Brent, as Fred Gilbert, is similarly untested in this film (as in most of his films) but is in the additionally unfortunate position of providing the comedy in the romance, initially through his health regime obsession and then his superficial attraction to Maizie (Dorothea Kent), (the latter also being the means by which an essentially simple story is sufficiently prolonged to allow a feature length gap between the boy meets girl beginning and the inevitable - this is 1930's romantic comedy - boy gets girl ending).
While ArmendÃ¡riz is charismatic, and even slightly sympathetic, in his role of the antagonist, Henry Fonda largely looks awkward in the lead role (though you could argue that this uneasiness is integral to his character), and most of the other players Â perhaps due to a language barrier Â are similarly stilted.
This was Whit Stillman's first of three similarly themed films; the second, "Barcelona," is subpar, but "The Last Days of Disco" closes the trilogy with a delicious return to form.
Compare with the treachery of another Eve, in the similarly comic and 'lightweight' 'North by Northwest', and the sheer toothlessness of this film's emotional unravelling becomes apparent.
They're a crew, brothers, and they display a love only truly understood by those similarly rejected by society at large.
There's a couple of other misses; the euro-style sex short is one (it's good in idea, but poor in execution) and similarly the game show; "What's my perversion" is surreal, and again kind of funny; but it never really goes for the money shot (another bad pun, I'm sorry) and that makes it unsatisfying on the whole.
The character dynamics change similarly, to the point where it's so inconsistent that the show just can't build tension.
Breakfast Club similarly toyed with audience expectations and broke rules concerning the handling of subject matters like sex, drugs and society in high-school; it ended up being a very honest, poignant film that made you laugh your ass off.... it's no Citizen Kane, but Breakfast Club = good flick.
Other invectives and exclamations similarly invoked the deity, or were inspired by classical literature, the Bible, and popular song, and are now incomprehensible to us.
They're are pretty much empty vessels, which I guess is the point, but the film just comes off as a bland retread of similarly narcissistic vacant slice-of-(decedent)life fare.
Dennis Haysbert's character is forced (by the script) into similarly disingenuous behavior.
The dialogue is similarly clunky.
And, similarly, I could get the same predictable level of mystery of watching this movie from playing the Clue board gameÂalone.
One of the disadvantages of films no longer having all the credits at the beginning is that you now have to wait till the end for clues that the film in question may suck - the appalling film of "The Saint" a few years ago had Leslie Charteris' name nowhere in sight, and similarly "I Still Know What You Did Last Summer" credits neither Kevin Williamson (writer of the first film) nor Lois Duncan (author of the book that it was based on), although they could both lay claim to having originated certain characters.
The "Wild" commentary track is similarly hard to hear and pretty poor.
I was struck by one interesting little tidbit: This film was released by MGM about the same time the studio distributed Dan Curtis's House of Dark Shadows, which has a bit of a Hammer feel to it; and the lovely blonde actress featured in Horror of Frankenstein (Veronica Carlson as Elizabeth) bears a striking resemblance to Nancy Barrett, similarly featured in HODS as sexy vampire Carolyn Stoddard.
He doesn't really have the charisma of an Arnold, and somehow doesn't have star power, he seems to much of a nice guy, everyman, while similarly he didn't get by on his looks either.
This is, of course, a continuing attempt to capitalize on the James Bond-type spy thriller, going all the way back to such female Bonds as "Modesty Blaise" and the similarly no-budget "Girl From S.I.N."
I think somebody has to win a van contest or something similarly morbid.
Well, I certainly don't see guys getting excited about this story, except if they're similarly goofy misfits like most of the rugby-playing protagonists here.
I can only assume people enjoyed this film because it gave them some kind of emotional response and it offers the illusion of depth and complexity where none exists, but "Chuck & Buck" is the kind of film that's more or less throttled independent cinema in its crib and paved the way for similarly dire work.
And the plot is similarly ridiculous.
They were similarly ensnared in well-planned traps and could do little to help, however, not sitting on their hands protesting their sobriety in the shade of pleasant riverbank trees, let alone to each other: they were not together.))
Between this CBS Made-for-TV movie and the similarly titled SciFi Original "Locusts: the 8th Plague," 2005 was one whopper of a year for killer locusts.
I have read some other reviews that speak highly of the comedy in this film while do speak similarly of the lacking story, but for me everything was broken.
This isn't a rolling-in-the-aisles slapstick comedy and isn't intended as one, but the bureaucrats' combination of ruthlessness and obsessive yet oddly endearing personal dedication to their task, balanced by the businesspeople's often intricate and similarly humorous schemes to hang onto their property in the onslaught, is the exaggerated core conflict that pulls you into the plot and makes the film irresistibly charming.
With echoes to House of 1000 Corpses, Funhouse and other similarly set films this is the sort of thing that we've all seen before, assuming we've been watching horror films for an period of time.
They go through history for no apparent reason, and meet similarly insipid, one-dimensional characters disguised as historic personalities, which we are expected to find hilarious, God only knows why.
Between this CBS Made-for-TV movie and the similarly titled SciFi Original "Locusts: the 8th Plague," 2005 was one whopper of a year for killer locusts.
The narrative clunkiness is swiftly apparent from the somewhat obvious symbolism of the structural cracks and fissures which fracture the sisters' home at the beginning of the movie, and the stateliness of the family's surroundings is matched by similarly ossified pacing; Dylan Thomas' occasionally poetically barbed and witty insights notwithstanding.
Cinematographer Floyd Crosby is the father of the similarly surnamed member of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young.
is notable, as are the Swinging London settings; incidentally, the hero is a Spanish actor appearing under the name of Vic Winner â similarly, his character is hilariously named Laurence Redgrave, while that of the Scotland Yard Inspector is Hawkins who has an assistant that goes by the name of Basehart!
Lance Henriksen and Doug Bradley bring little to the film and are capable of much finer performances, the ideas are not new and have been done before similarly in The CLubHouse.
It's only fair to have a few similarly implausible numbers where women (albeit fahbulously foxy ones) score (i.e.
is notable, as are the Swinging London settings; incidentally, the hero is a Spanish actor appearing under the name of Vic Winner â similarly, his character is hilariously named Laurence Redgrave, while that of the Scotland Yard Inspector is Hawkins who has an assistant that goes by the name of Basehart!
I'm pretty sure that other people like me, people who had never heard of Z-channel before, were similarly bored or confused.
Movies like 'Less Than Zero' (more so in Bret Easton Ellis' novel than the movie, though) and 'Bonfire of the Vanities' and other similarly themed movies presents one class of people, wealthy apathetic socialites who exist in a state of perpetual uselessness.
This film was shown in a double-bill with Buster Keaton's "Three Ages", a film shot in the same year and similarly using camera trickery (what must be one of the earliest animated cartoon sequences featuring a live actor).
When I reviewed In The City of Sylvia, similarly a beautiful movie with an isolated character, I said that the filmmaker should either have won the Golden Lion at Venice or have been brutally murdered; I've similar feelings here.
Why the pilots would think fire in an area that's just been bombed back to the Stone Age unusual in any way is similarly ignored.
Although similarly born of Agatha Christie's pen, both characters and village were much more believable in the previous Joan Hickson series, and in which the direction was much more knowing.
The production values are similarly good for the small budget: beautiful filming, a good musical score and songs that worked just right for the tone.
Causes of poverty such as war and ethnic victimization are similarly overlooked.
Either way, Naschy is a werewolf and he gets to wrestle around in the snow with a yeti (who just happens to wear a similarly looking werewolf costume, just like the one Naschy's wearing).
In too many other scenes points are similarly missed, the tone is misjudged and the pace is plodding.
Reminds me a bit of THREE KINGS, which similarly trivializes a genuine cause for concern.
When i went to see the original Hellboy i did not have very high expectations and was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be extremely enjoyable, i was therefore looking forward to a similarly enjoyable experience when viewing this film.
Fairbanks meets similarly situated Bette Davis and the three of them move in together for economy sake only.
I have watched all "24" episodes to date and have enjoyed them, however that being said let me continue with the reasons this show has overstayed is appeal and gone the route of The X-Files and similarly "thrown together for ad revenue" shows.
Of the various low-budget exploitationers of the 1930s, I was only familiar with the similarly drug-related TELL YOUR CHILDREN (1938), better-known by its alternate title REEFER MADNESS Â actually produced by Dwain Esper, the co-director of this one and a film-maker whose notorious reputation (for lack of talent) rivals that of Ed Wood himself!
If you even begin to compare these similarly themed films Guerin's piece begins to look very clumsy indeed.
Hudson, who played her husband, was similarly worn-looking with very bad make-up.
Watts is similarly unimpressive, and fails to add an ounce of character to her role.
Omar Sharif's commentary on the DVD is similarly inane.
The collection of similarly abused women at the finale is just gross ("Class of '85!"
The bulk of the film consists primarily of utterly pointless dialogue, both between the main characters and two similarly useless secondary characters who serve no purpose aside fromÂ..noÂ..waitÂ..they serve no purpose full stop.
I've heard it compared to the similarly disastrous Speed 2.
A similarly tacky piece of directing occurs when the elves appear - the soft focus lens is deployed with 'celtic' singing.
This movie may have given cinema an iconic character in its visualisation of Count Dracula Â every kid ever to do a vampire impression has used Bela Lugosi's accent Â and the film is undeniably influential, but, like Boris Karloff's creature in the same year's similarly overrated 'Frankenstein', Lugosi has very little to do besides stand still and stare a lot while someone shines a torch in his eyes.
Sadly a good actor cannot salvage an obvious story line (which owes a lot other work, such as the similarly named Ghostship) which meant it all became a little predictable, and towards the end just plain silly.
Some of this seems fairly reminiscent of that similarly awful Rodman movie named "Double Team," which co-starred Jean-Claude Van Damme (ha!)
The entire film is similarly flawed, leaving it to the actors, themselves, to convey the comedy.
They start an underground newspaper, which is nothing more than a note that says the King sucks or something similarly simple.
Recommend it to your friends who may have steered you to a similarly stupid flick or some friends that you would like to hear less from.
Hauer is similarly wasted as the hero Â he wears a cool leather jacket and lives in a pretty mean bachelor pad, but that's about as deep and meaningful as the character gets!
This is the worst, but there are many others scenes which are similarly absurd and ludicrous: the first scene of Rochester galloping in slow motion through the mist before he falls into a brook, Grace Poole coming out of the lunatic's room to sniff at Mason's wounds like a wild beast, Rochester sitting on the top of an archway of Thornfield as if he were the court jester and Mason jumping on horseback over the church fence to prevent a marriage of which he has heard only heavens knows how.
Beverly Farley (Susan Sarandon) is similarly sad as her tale unfolds.
Put another way: if this film was set in Africa and contained similarly juvenile mockery of the populace, there'd doubtless be uproar.
Juvenile fantasy/adventure with an impressive cast of old reliables (Sean Connery, Peter Cushing, Trevor Howard, Lila Kedrova, Douglas Wilmer and Wilfrid Brambell) all operating below-par alongside the resistible - indeed wooden - presence of would-be star Miles O'Keefe (fresh from two similarly low-brow Ator films).
But schlock like this paved the way for similarly bloated, stupid movies like Pirates of the Caribbean.
Shrooms also has to make do with the self-same camera tricks to replicate the audio-visual apparitions, and to similarly lackluster effect, while its monotonous over-reliance on sudden, deafening chords pastes over the lack of genuine shocks.
It's rare that a film leaves such a long impression on me, and for all those out there who also were touched by this film, I'd recommend it in a double billing with Martin Rosen's *Watership Down*, a similarly lovely and chilling animation.
Finally, the casting of Fitzgerald, Marjorie Riordan and Joan Lorring (who looks like a young Irene Selznick) is curious: all three young women have prominent noses, darkly painted lips and very dark, shoulder-length hair which is styled similarly.
His relationship with his father and his father's alcoholism suffers similarly, it's mentioned but not dwelled on and ultimately is swept aside.
Freud thought similarly that all sexual love was ultimately a form of masochism--identification with a partner whom one has caused to suffer.
Much like Louis Malle's similarly themed film from 1987 AU REVOIR, LES ENFANTS, Vittorio daSica's THE GARDEN OF THE FINZI-CONTINI's is a meditative piece on the relatively safe haven of a group of people -- in this case, an entire family of wealthy Jews who enjoy a life of privilege as the horrors of World War II and anti-Semitism rages on.
There is a scene in the movie where a woman is bludgeoned with a large ceramic statue of a penis, and at the end, I felt as if I'd been similarly beat.
The ship on the front cover, and a detail of the scorpion on the back cover are similarly raised.
I found myself constantly hoping that she might get eaten by a bear, drown in the river, or something similarly terrible.
In both, then, the luscious Calderoni plays two roles: here, she is a traffic-accident victim and a succubus-like temptress from a previous era; similarly, the male protagonist alternates between a strapping doctor and a decadent, slightly mad aristocrat.
Whistle Down the Wind comes to mind as a similarly enjoyable essay on quirky childhood experiences.
I just read the prior similarly titled review and disagree with that opinion.
I feel that just about any other similarly talented actor could have pulled off this role more effectively.
As I was watching this film, I realized how similarly structured this film was to 'Traffic': the jumps in time that seem startling, yet turn out to be very smooth transitions, uniting many beautiful histories into one legendary story.
Fortunately LOGO is showing That Certain Summer, and other similarly good films.
