All in all the film wasn't the greatest thing since sliced bread, but I wasn't expecting that.
We return to the cops, who may as well be named Good Cop and Bad Cop, since it doesn't matter.
But to also find her an accomplished actress of the melodrama is quite astonishing, since Day is often known as the fluffy powder puff of feather weight musical tripe, or, the squeaky clean, yet strangely asexual appendage of Rock Hudson.
The director did'nt even want his name on it but put it on it since the crew asked him to.
Not since Bette Davis and Joan Crawford in "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"
I saw this film when i was about 9, since then i have been hooked on it!
The dialog, for the most part, is the best in any American serious comedy since Billy Wilder.
Perhaps some people won't like it as much as I did, but I had great fun with this film, since there is a very funny gags mixture, where there is something outlandish and nonsensical every 30 seconds, typical of Fesser's movies.
It's been 30 years since I saw this film, and most of what I recall about it is that I loved it, as a 10-year-old watching at 4 a.m.
The Man With Nine Lives establishes the experiment as "frozen therapy", cryogenic science as a method for benefiting mankind, with Karloff's Dr. Leon Kravaal, found in a chamber frozen in ice in his abandoned secret laboratory by Dr. Tim Mason(Roger Pryor) and his nurse/fiancÃ© Judith(Jo Ann Sayers)as they were hoping to uncover notes of his research since he's known as the father of this type of growing medical practice many consider the future for helping the sick and dying.
Kravaal has been missing since 1930 and Mason resolves to find him.
However I never got around to buying the add-on since I was disappointed in the way Rome Total War worked on a strategic level.
They are girl go bots so I resume that they can reproduce since they have souls of men and brains.
I used to hate the go-bots but have come to love them since seeing this.
I also like the Go Bot Characters, Leader 1, Sparky, Small Foot, Pathfinder, Scooter, Fitor and Cop-Tur, though it's been a while since I saw the movie and I can't remember if some of those characters were in it, alas.
When I first saw this movie(Vampire) on TV some years ago, and have looked for it ever since, I was enthralled with Richard Lynch, his portrayal is 'right on' in this role..............now some of you may not agree with me, but I also put Rutger Hauer in a similar category, delightful to watch, downright scary in some of his roles,(Nighthawks) but the ultimate romantic, if given half a chance...........of course, my all-time favorite love story movie is Ladyhawke, so I admit to being a tad prejudiced.......I have seen Richard Lynch in a number of TV movies, series, etc, but have lost track of him over the recent years......  there are also websites for Rutger Hauer where his fans can go to keep up with his movie roles, etc........He also is the founder of an organization that helps AIDS victims, mostly children, i believe.....called STARFISH.
It's been close to 30 years since I watched this movie with Richard Lynch as the blonde vampire, and who played the part to perfection.
Not since "Clockwork Orange" have I hated a film so intensely and I admit that Clockwork had redeeming values, art-wise & social commentary-wise.
Ive kept a top ten list since the 60's.
'Gone With the Wind' has been on top of that list since I first saw it, in 1949.
I, myself am a  Catholic so I found this film of special interest since it is about a  Jesuit Priest.
One touch of Dutch cinema that I've always liked since I have become acquainted with it through Verhoeven's work is that there isn't always a happy ending.
Whenever I watch Blackadder I simply do not stop laughing throughout the whole thirty minutes, the jokes come thick and fast, in fact they probably come a little too fast since quite often you'll find yourself in stitches at one joke and be laughing for so long you'll miss the next one.
Ever since then I have been 'hooked'.
Ever since, it has been a military bete-noir of history.
I also had the strange thought while watching of how great it would have been to have Johnny and June Carter Cash playing the leads, since this film was made in their heyday.
I would have a hard time classifying El Orfanto as a horror film or a fantasy film since it brings in the best of both the worlds.
I like this movie more than Alucarda and that's saying a lot since Alucarda's pure Kult Ov the Kult of my video collectiones.
It has been a long time since I have seen a good film in this genre.
It's important to find him soon since the boy needs medication.
It has been a long while since I've attended a film that made the entire audience jump.
I had very little idea of what I was getting into and this film ended up being the best atmospheric horror I have seen since Alejandro AmenÃ¡bar's The Others, (I don't count Del Toro's own El Laberinto del fauno because that was more fantasy than anything else).
You are right there with Rueda's character as she slowly uncovers the secrets hidden behind the years that have past since she last lived in the orphanage.
I've been on the IMDb since 2001 and have written very few reviews, but this movie was so bad that I feel compelled to warn everyone I can.
is not only the most entertaining film Korea has produced during it's recent industry boom, but one of the most fun, tongue in cheek, genre-aware action/comedies from anywhere since heck knows when.
Its been a while since I've commented on IMDb, the only excuse I have for that is that no film in the past year or two has moved me, or even made me want to comment at all on here.
It's all about entertainment and since the world's population is so diverse, we all like different types of movies.
This has spawned an ongoing series of about fifty short TV episodes that have been continuing ever since.
This movie is misguiding, since this is not your brainless action flick Lorenzo "I have a father and a mother too" Lamas is associated with.
Maybe it was that I'd never seen that kind of delicacy and sweetness in performance before--and rarely since--nothing "thrilling," nothing forced, nothing fey, nothing indulgent--just careful observations and filled moments.
While I prefer her work in 1933's "Baby Face" on Volume One, no one shined more than Stanwyck in these pre-code films since her non-nonsense manner was a perfect fit for the era's candor and directness.
They're picked up by road-racers Smitty (Bruce Dern) and Simp (Larry Hankin) who threatens them with a switchblade; later they hitch a lift from an embittered woman (Joyce Van Patten) who has hated hippies since her daughter ran away to become one; another time Chay finds herself being ogled by a middle-aged trucker (Mike Conrad); and in their final "thumb trip", they find themselves travelling with dysfunctional husband-and-wife alcoholics (Mariana Hill and Burke Burns).
Rarely out of frame for more than an instant here, she delivers the type of performance Â both subtle and sensuous Â that has been her stock in trade since she started enchanting movie audiences worldwide back in the '60s, her mysterious beauty undiminished (if anything, augmented more like) by the passing years.
The rhythms of their married life have long since been grooved.
Marie's actions can be seen as a way for her to examine her new emotions and social surroundings since the loss of Jean.
The total lack of blood, sleaze and gruesome make-up effects is acceptable, since it's a made-for-TV horror film, but what about that totally ridiculous and pathetic ending?!?
I haven't seen a performance like that since Dustin Hoffman played Charlie Babbit in Rain Man.
This film highlights what was probably going on after 9/11 but less so nowadays since people have had time to get their head back on straight.
The abuses endured by these characters are atrocious shouldn't the people involved have been looking for real terrorist since it was obvious these people were most likely innocent people caught up in the post 9/11 paranoia.
(But let's face it, Lumet hasn't made a truly great film since 1976's "Network" (1976), and not even a good film since 1988's "Running On Empty.")
I didn't want to review this movie based on its bad political message, but since this movie was made solely to make a political statement and not for any entertainment value, I have been forced to criticize it based mainly on its politics.
i thought since the movie was made 15 years ago it might not be that good but dont let time distract u for seeing it.
This unnerves the others since Billy is always the calmest and is able to access the enemy and give his team the advantage.
It's drive to be the ultimate warrior is it's undoing since it affords Dutch the opportunity to lead it to a trap.
The movie is a about a former soldier/mercenary named Dutch (Arnie) who has been involved in a lot of conflict and has since decided to settle down and be the leader of a rescue team.
The scene when the team attacks the rebel camp is, without a doubt one of the best in cinema, since it shows each team member providing something in the attack, and it's not just one guy who acts like a one-man army and destroys everything in his path all by himself.
But I guess comic relief has to come from somewhere, and since complexity is not a requisite for movies like this, I can't really expect a lot of thought being put into the comedic content either.
I've seen Predator many many times since i first watched it back in 1989 and i love it each and every time.
I caught a little snippet of a behind the scenes feature on AMC or Bravo, and ever since I've been anticipating its inclusion on a new DVD (WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG?!??!)
Cassie, a startlingly unpopular girl at an English (either college or Prep School) has had some very strange dreams since she discovered a little piece of pottery hidden away in her room.
And since Hex has no title character it is possible to remove any character if the storyline demands it.
Rather, I found that it made the story more real and interesting in some ways, especially since the majority of the characters are higher class snobs with the attitudes and personalities to match.
Ever since "Follow That Bird", "Elmo in Grouchland" is a way more colorful version for kids, and there's more fun to it.
It is a brutal scene; I have experienced nothing like it in the cinematic vein since "Sophie's Choice."
Of course it also turns out that this picture has revived (and unfortunate) significance today--since 9/11.
As an overall aesthetic choice, it does bring more immersiveness to the environment, but since 50% of the action takes place while you chop off the heads off random creatures, the metal beat of WW just felt more adequate (imo).
Bosses liven things up a bit, since most of them are a bit more dynamic, but the bosses are so few and far between it didn't really feel like the trade-off of 5 hours of repetitive gameplay to get me to one dynamic part was worth it.
next is the prince himself he was sissified since the second game now he is stupid and who ever voices him should burn inf *bleeping* hell!
It also happens to be HBO's first animated series since Spawn.
It is a bit difficult to follow the plot, since there are so many different ages edited together, but as the very first sequence shows us, this is only Cinema.
I haven't laughed out loud this much since arrested development (R.I.P.)
Duane has really aged since the original that was made 8 years prior to this sequel and because the film is supposed to be set immediately after the events of the original, the way he looked just felt wrong.
The only problem is that, since so many years have passed since the original, the actors have obviously aged quite a bit so the idea that this is the actually occurring the very same night is a bit over the top but since the film is a comedy it really does not matter.
Duane wants to ditch these guys, and take Ruth's granddaughter with him, and Belial is cool with hanging out there, especially since he, too has found someone.
But director Frank Henenlotter obviously had learned since and gained more experience.
But since the house was looking very nice, even a tourist would have been able to get a nice movie of this house with his cheap camera.
He has a nineteen year old son Hache (Juan Diego Botta) - Hache is the Spanish pronunciation for the alphabet letter 'J' and since the son's name is Martin J. he elects to be called J or Hache - who is a restless, foundationless teenager who refuses to go to school preferring to simply play his electric guitar and run with the drug crowd.
I am wondering when it was last aired since its initial release.
"A Catered Affair" is another Davis film that has not received a lot of air time but I know this has been re- released since its debut.
OK, so not much has changed in the world since the 60's, eh?
I saw this movie when it was released and have been looking for a copy of it on DVD since then!
The title aside, which may turn many people off the idea of watching the movie, the music is brilliant and after two months since I saw it I still cannot get one of the songs outta my head...Country Plant it's called.
Following the lives of several teens over the course of 2 months at a theater arts summer camp, the movie tracks , between very impressive musical numbers, the sex lives, personal battles, and identity crisis in a real manner without being preachy(which I hate) Watch for The Ladies Who Lunch number, also the Turkey Lurkey number, they are show stoppers.My boyfriend thought since it's a musical, it must be a kid movie, but it is quite the opposite, very entertaining.
Neither has had major success before or since (Warner had a lengthy run in Family Law) and, to be perfectly frank, this movie gives a good idea why - they have little charisma, and no chemistry despite the fact that they supposedly fall in love during the film The story demands lead players who don't come across as insipid, but it doesn't get them.
This is real evidence for all those who have doubts about Goldie Hawn's talents, since she is delightful from start to finish and once again proves that she was and still is one of the greatest comediennes Hollywood ever produced.
I have loved this movie since I saw it in the early 80s when I was in Junior High.
Dana Carvey is an extremely talented comedian,which makes it a shame that his efforts since his Saturday Night Live days have fallen,at least for the most part,miserably flat.The latest effort,The Master of Disguise,is no exception.This film is horrid from top to bottom.It is a poor execution of what was a poor story idea to begin with.Executive Producer Adam Sandler's ideas about comedy may work when Sandler himself is in the film,but he has yet to produce a good effort when solely behind the camera.Carvey's efforts to make this a good film are indeed valiant,but he can't do it alone.Even the character names (Pistachio Disguisey?)
Enter Uncle Charlie, who has suspicions of his own ever since the Africa trip.
This is just a movie that was made in 1992, and wasn't good enough to show in the states, but now since Jackie is famous, and has done good in his other films, they snuck this one in.
Given that it has a 1987 release date, the movie holds up well, since there is little in the Arkansas outback, other than the Bronco, to indicate a 20 year old production.
All right, Hunter's Blood may not be all that original, utilising the standard 'backwoods' plot line that has served so many films well in the past (and since).
None are overly challenging or intelligent, and in fact the AI can't do much more than move around or take random cover, but it wouldn't matter anyway, since you can't die.
Truth is, it has now been about a year, since I last saw it!
(since the brother John Ma can't fight).
Me and my friends have had proper Darkplace tourrettes since we first saw this show, and it never gets old.
I haven't been this excited or entertaining since Evil Dead.
Holness, Berry and Ayaode remain in character for every single one and the result is the funniest DVD commentary since Spinal Tap.
This is the best comedy since the office.
The only thing I have to say is that it is so SAD that Chris Penn Died who played Willerd in the movie when I found that out I almost cried because he was found some were in Hollywood and it was i heart attack and he did gained a lot of weight since the movie footloose it you got to his name on this site you will get all the info about his death.
But the big mystery is Lori Singer hasn't done anything since about 1995 and really nothing much since this movie.
I have wanted to see this film since i went on a sixth grade field trip to see a play based on this film.
As a matter a fact, her performance is the only thing that redeems this movie, since all the other characters are caught up in full Woody Allen film mimicry mode, some perhaps unintentionally.
Annie is a real estate agent who is showing Tommy apartments, since he's got to find a new place to live.
Although she has dated no one since her stinging divorce, she begins a brief affair with Tommy.
We know a lot of the people that inhabit this movie since, at one time, or another, we have known people just like these.
looking for a new pad since his girlfriend kicked him out.
Although seven years has elapsed since "Shuang Long Hui" opened, with VHS copies of it available under a number of titles, Dimension Films not only dusted off "Twin Dragons" but also has plastered it on screens across America.
It was wonderful of Fran Drescher to open up her spectacular Malibu home to hold a reunion for the much loved,and never forgotten characters of the hit sitcom The Nanny.Although Fran still has that somewhat annoying,thick Queens accent,her appearance has dramatically changed since the Nanny.However,with long straight black hair,and style still in tact,Fran Drescher makes the 40's look fabulous,and was the gracious host for 'A Nosh to Remember' A must-see for all fans of the Nanny.
"Get Real" is the story about a 16-year old gay teenager named Steven Carter (played by the boyishly adorable Ben Silverstone) who has known about himself since he was 11-years old and is perfectly fine with it.
Not necessarily a household name for today's generation, McGovern represented the idealism of American politics and it's fair to say we haven't seen anyone like him since.
But through it all Senator McGovern had hope and gave the working people hope, the poor and isolated people hope where none had existed since the days of President Kennedy, Robert Kennedy and Rev.
I do remember stories of people being buried alive, especially since I'm old enough to have seen the original Vincent Price movies when first released & am familiar with the Poe fears and stories.
This is a pretty fair "neo-noir" presentation, which I'd missed hearing about during the nine years since its release - but found in my paper's local-edition weekly t.v.
It's a creature that's adverse to water, but no matter since the desert doesn't have very much water to begin with.
The first half is still remotely amusing, since the inept dialogs and cheesy massacres supply the film with a handful of chuckles, but then the whole thing gets too stupid to even smile at.
Which is interesting since it sometimes has that long feeling of an Altman shot here and there, or one that is held for longer than one might expect in a TV show; one crucial shot being when Jack Tanner (Michael Murphy) is shot unawares by a camera looking through a glass coffee table as he gives a passionate monologue to his campaign team after a bad day.
I can't help but love this movie, its just so entertaining.Lindsey Lohan is so cute, and fun in this movie.Even Tyra Banks is good in this as Eve the doll that magically came back to life.Also this film is so sweet and somewhat depressing at times, in a sweet way.Also since its very entertaining at times and you can't help but like it.However I will say that it was cheesy at times, and at other times it was a little predictable, or at least to out there, in a way you almost can't take it to literal.Overall this film is good, its by all means no masterpiece but its very entertaining and good.
Since I missed the first few moments I was a little confused by what was going on since the scenes jumped from the jail cell to the church to the past.
The corrupted side of politics which exists since it was born.
This film can also be seen as a tract against capital punishment since Neel is basically a good man who made a bad mistake.
Originally, I am from Kerala India and I really enjoyed watching Kallari because I haven't seen any films with Kallari since I have moved to Alaska.
Personally, I can't call this a buddy film since they were not buddies in any sense of the word.
I'm not complaining, since my favourite song of the film has this incredible dance sequence between King Khan and Kareena (choreographed by Farah Khan) beautifully filmed against some surreal, haunting backdrops.
Performances-  Shah Rukh Khan is really good, Asoka is perhaps his best performance since Mohabbatein and Hey Ram.
But it is Kareena Kapoor whoes performance suprises the most from the entire cast, this is her best attempt at acting since her dabute.
Maybe this is simply a trait of Bollywood actors and actresses across the board-understandable, since they make so many movies, it would be quite difficult to really learn each character and portray it believably.
since this one is VERY well done, I think this time the audience will include Europe (it was a great success in England) and USA (Shahrukh Khan himself came to NY).
Prince Asoka,after leaving his kingdom by his mother's wishes (since he is being hunted by his own brothers), falls in love with the beautiful princess Kaurwaki.
Kaurwaki doesn't know he is a prince, but eventually falls in love with him too, spite of the efforts of the general to let her safe from everybody, since she and her brother are being hunted by the Kallinga traitors.
When he returns to Kaurwaki, he does not find her, since she was attacked by traitors of Kalinga and was hidden in the house of a loyal vassal.
From other Bolywood movies, I am sure that the songs are very important, since they always tell something about the feelings of the characters in that moment.
Well, these two things are explained rather quickly for us before details are revealed that start to make the whole thing more intriguing, complex and a little bit different from the gamut of British crime movies that we've seen since the turn of the century.
There are only two movies since, say 1999, that I have had to seriously battle the urge to walk out of, and this was one of them.
Considering the slur's used against the Japanese that I have heard since I can remember, was one used in the movie.
We never really get to know how Scott's last mission turned out since the movie ends before it even begins.
What is also said a lot is the the movie is (too) complex, indeed you have to think and pay attention to get everything, but since when is that not a good point.
It had English subtitles and it was in PAL, but since I own several PAL movies, I now own a portable DVD player that plays all regions.
just finished watching "The Man"with Samuel.L Jackson and Eugene Levy.not a bad offering.it's sort of in the vein of "48 hours".now i'm not equating the 2 movies with each other,though i do seem to recall being less than impressed with "48 hours.i did however find "the Man" entertaining from beginning to end,from both a dramatic viewpoint and a comedic one.the 2 stars are both very gifted actors,so it was good to see them in action.admittedly,the film was kind of light in tone(it could have had been a bit more substantial) and very short in its running time.however,for what it was,it worked very well.i do have one small complaint dough and that is that the movie did seem a bit mean spirited in the beginning.not sure why that would bother me,since i would usually not complain about something like that.
When the opportunity arose to do that, I decided to seize it since I had a couple of hours that I could waste.
I can't compare it to the first in the series, but as a Dungeons and Dragons player since the 80s and a great fan of fantasy, I can analyse it on its own merits.
After watching the First D&D movie in 2000, I thought I might give this one a view, on DVD since it never hit the big screen down here.
For players, it will be a pretty cool experience, and not just a bit o fluff (One character gets killed by a Frost Dragon, another gets her arm teleported into a wall) I have a mixed feeling about the end, since the Hero doesn't "Get midievel" on Damodar, but I like that refreshing break from the clichÃ©d final face offs that Hollywood demands to insert into every movie.
Understandable given the budget, but a bit of a distraction, especially since the climax uses a lot of it.
Giving this an 8 out of 10 since I'm grading on a scale (this movie was much superior to most direct-to-video or SciFi "original" movies).
If you never played D&D but you are a general fantasy fan, get this movie because it's the most fantasymovie you have seen since Lord of the Rings.
Also, Johnny's character of Bruce has lived in the United States since childhood, having immersed himself in American culture for many years, yet he comes-off as a confused tourist who is in the states for the first time?
Man, that is about as UNBELIEVABLE as Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita) speaking in broken-English, after having lived in the United States (since his teens) for over 50-years!
I may not be objective since I'm a Hungarian and a patriot, and especially after the very sad 50th anniversary, this was some kind of relief for me.
Unfortunately, this is Levy's first starring role since he became a household name with his role in the "American Pie" films.
Arctic climes didn't do Sean Connery's initially troubled post-Bond career any favours, although his top billing in The Red Tent is highly misleading, since his supporting role is not much more than a cameo.
Some good acting from Eastwood and Bujold elevate this one above mediocrity, but some interest still remains especially since the serial killer plot angle offers some good ideas.
Maybe he thought since he had to wait so long, he should make a long film.
I had decided sight would be the one to live without since music has the power to make me weep (often).
You'd think mixing a comic actor with a dramatic one would be a proved formula since it worked for Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte in "48 HRS" which pretty much launched the subgenre of cops and comedy 20 odd years ago.
By the same token, it would be almost impossible to see it in your house on DVD, since there are so many possible distractions that would make you want to stop the film.
You want laughs, and one of the most outrageous cop pairings since Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan, see this movie.
Naked women in a cartoon and action and humor, amazing, I bet the heavy metal 2 sucked since it wasn't like the first one.
(have since given up dope, but u don't need to be a stoner to watch this) so get it post haste.
They should have at least avoided the skyline completely since it doesn't match Detroit at all, even with the Skydome and CN Tower removed.
Now it's true that buddy cop movies have been copied since 48 hours, but this one uses the formula they all use and cuts out all the cheesy special effects and awkward dialogue that the "bad boys" films had.
It's been 15 years since I viewed CRUMB, so I cannot remember if Robert lists PAGE MISS GLORY as an influence.
In one way, it makes sense, since she's bringing everything she's learned to this role.
It's been a long time since I've seen this movie, but I do remember how bad it was.
I haven't seen his movie since the early eighties when I rented it.
"Evil Under the Sun" is also enjoyable, since its strong second half more than compensates for the overlong exposition.
"Evil Under the Sun" is also enjoyable, since its strong second half more than compensates for the overlong exposition.
I am only giving it ONE out of TEN since there is no zero or a negative number.
The movie is basically a formulaic chase one, since Walsh and Mardukas are being followed by the FBI, led by Agent Alonzo Mosley, in a great performance by Yaphet Kotto, the mob, led by Jimmy Serrano, in a scary/funny turn by Dennis Farina, and another bounty-hunter named Marvin Dorfler, played by the much under-appreciated John Ashton.
I haven't been moved by any of his comic turns since... indeed upon reflection, could it not be suggested that Raging Bull was in essence, high class comedy?
The main drawback back in '85, was that everyone had high expectations for this movie since it was directed by the same guy that gave us "The China Syndrome".
In Urban Cowboy it worked since there was a legitimate reason for all the people to dress that way.
Aykroyd is in virtually every scene, but since the writers didn't bother coming up with anything funny for him, he becomes tiresome after about fifteen minutes.
This process has been around since the 1920s and has been exploited by oil starved nations such as Germany and Japan during the second world war, and by South Africa during Apartheid and after.
It has a fun typical 1930's genre story and the movie can be seen as a screwball comedy, though its not the best genre example of it, since the movie besides its screwball elements also feature many other, more subtle, comedy styles.
The film itself most certainly suffers for it (since the plot twists don't often make sense), but the performances are absolute classics.
Nominated for six Academy Awards (including Best Picture and Best Screenplay) and a huge box office hit when originally released, THE AWFUL TRUTH is a screamingly hysterical marital comedy that hasn't lost one iota of its punch in the seven decades since it's release.
Suddenly, they find out the police station is gonna shut down since there are no criminals around.
It's been a while since their last adventure.
It has been several years since I read it, but I very distinctly remember how much I enjoyed it as well as the plot and the substantial twist.
In "When Harry..." it's an outside-the-narrative device, placing the two central characters in the context of a larger world; in the French film, it's an INSIDE-the-narrative device, letting us know that the central characters have since reflected on the past.
This technique is especially useful when dealing with the visual problem foreign movies have grappled with but American movies have avoided since "Klute" (especially "Pretty Woman"): how to show when sex changes with feelings.
This comes as little surprise, since director Pete Travis and Bourne series director Paul Greengrass have worked together in the past.
Not since The Bourne Ultimatum have I seen such a convincing, engrossing action thriller.
intending to be creepy (or as creepy as it actually wound up being, since the movie DID bill itself as a "grim fairy tale").
Unfortunately, the print quality left much to be desired: it seemed like a tenth-generation VHS copy, with the detail all soft and fuzzy and the picture excessively dark to boot; being a Paramount film, one hopes that Legend Films Â or, better still, Criterion Â will eventually get the opportunity to give this bizarre gem a decent release and, consequently, the exposure it greatly deservesÂsince Paramount themselves seem unwilling to do anything with it!
That isn't a bad thing since they were witty enough for it to almost always work, but unfortunately a large number of the fans come away from the show NOT remembering the lack of context, NOT noticing the tremendous edits, and worst of all, NOT coming away with the LOVE for these movies that it's pretty obvious most of the people working on the show shared.
IMDb doesn't allow the posting of URLs in reviews, but if you go to the Internet Archive's Prelinger Archive, they have a whole selection of Harvey's industrial/educational shorts, as well as Carnival of Souls, available for download (since they are all in the public domain).
Anyway the discussion leads to another discussion about shop with the basketball coach, who states that shop never helped him, yet it did since he now has a ready made hobby of building giant recipe card boxes.
I almost passed on this movie since it appeared too quirky for my tastes, a romantic comedy about a class of South Korean students and its Australian English teacher.
The subplot is touching: Moon-su is trying to learn English so he can translate conversations between his mother and his sister, Victoria, who has lived in the United States since she was given up for adoption.
And, it's not that Goldie Hawn is equally inept either; her work has been consistently good, if not great, ever since I first saw her in TV's Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In of the 1960s.
It's been a while since I've seen the 1970 original and I can't remember if I really liked it or not.
This and Bringing Down the House are the best Steve Martin films I have seen since Planes, Trains, and Automobiles.
Apart from that, I'd suggest staying away from this movie, since it's by far the weakest Species movie so far, it makes Species II seem like a masterpiece.
Her "uncle" Tom Hollander (Chariots of Fire's Ben Cross) tells her the truth he has kept from her since birth, she is a half human, half alien creature, created from alien DNA to create a hybrid.
She has been injected with human hormones to stop the alien inside her coming out since birth, but it is obvious they are not working as well as they used to.
Overall I give it an 8 out of 10 because it was the best since the original and it is a great thriller.
But since the good outweighs the bad exponentially, I highly recommend "Kung Fu Hustle" to just about anyone because of both its action and comedic elements.
my friendly neighbourhood video store manager recommended this film to me and so i rented it, since he's never steered me wrong before.
Five minutes later, a nuclear strike warning in my town couldn't have torn me away from the screen, and it's been watched a dozen times since.
I haven't enjoyed myself this much since Pulp Fiction.
i have been waiting to see this DVD since November 04. i heard 50 and G unit's side of the story....now it was Game's turn.
This is one of the best documentaries I've seen since Farenheit 9/11, Game exposes the truth about this lousy piece of garbage name G-Unit, game delivers one of his best performances as he exposes the lies, the deceptions and the evil surrounds this horrible group and pop rap group Pistol Pete from Terror Squad also delivers here as the person who exposed tony yayo as a coward, you know people always say you should listen to music like G-Unit, because it's good for hip hop's soul, it's not good, it is hateful, disgraceful, shameful and truly unbelievably tasteless, I Bet these stupid stans don't even know what real hip hop is, all they listen to is garbage like this, it's a shame that tupac and biggie & big pun turning on their graves and probably laughing at how pathetic the mainstream hip hop has become and especially for someone like fifty cent that is ruining it.
Kicked it out of the DVD at 1:00am, reminded myself to find out who the star was and see what else he had been in since I do not remember him from anything.
I recorded this from Public Broadcasting (PBS) over 16 years ago, and have no record that I've watched the tape since.
When the Russians hear about it they are furious and want the gold back since it should be shared by all the allies, General Patton, old "Blood & Guts" a well known anti-communist takes it his job to retrieve every single bullion to show off to the Soviets.
Ever since I was 6 years old (now i'm 15) I loved Viggo Mortensen as an actor, poetry writer, etc..... and i still do love him.
It's been a year since Reno has seen Turner, and he never knew Turner well to begin with, so he's not completely sure that York is Turner.
Another asked if we really needed ANOTHER homage to Hitchcock since De Palma's been doing it for years; however, one look at De Palma's films and THIS film and the difference is night and day: De Palma's films, which could be considered almost a Hyper-Hitchcock, are almost TOO jokey and slavish to its directors flights of fancy, while Benton's film exhibits the cool reserve, almost detachment, of its sophisticated New York settings.
The accident happened during the worst February we had had since I could remember, and I was born and raised there.
I wish that those who produce lesser know classics for DVD restoration might see this "foreign" movie; it is obviously available somewhere since there have been other reviewers.
He did not need to ask too many questions, since Andre dominates the first half of the dinner conversation, hardly allowing Wally in.
But Andre seems to be a recovering psychotic, since he can describe his experiences lucidly.
I will warn you that the rest of the review contains spoilers, but that shouldn't prevent you from enjoying the film since it really has no plot twists or turns.
Wally and Andre meet for dinner, and Andre recounts his experiences since leaving the theatre.
I saw it for the first time at the Philadelphia Film Festival in February 2005, and have seen it about five times since then.
Needless to say the slide turned quite successful since he now earns over three million a year.
Die Fetten Jahre sind vorbei (The Edukators) is the first German film in competition at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival since Wim Wender's In weiter Ferne, so nah!
These directors have never let me down: I was addicted to their work when they did Thirtysomething some 15 years ago and since then have always been amazed by their subtle touch.
Michelle Pfeiffer wasn't nominated for this movie, and that's a crying shame, because this is easily the best work she's done since "Baker Boys".
I am Sam is the best movie since "The Other Sister".
Alas, a bratty little boy (Dale Belding) is hanging around the tracks this stormy night and witnesses some of this; since Russell doesn't know how much, he tries but fails to silence the kid with a crowbar.
I haven't been a fan of Sean Penn's since Fast Times at Ridgemont High.
In fact, I nearly didn't watch this film since he was in it.
I won't go into the story line since that's been reviewed a lot by others.
It has long since disappeared into obscurity and deserves a cable-TV or VHS revival and restoral.
It's too bad since it is an unusual and tidy little mystery of the late 1940's.
I'm somewhat prejudiced, since I'm in the film, as the piano player with the Cale Band, but even allowing for that, I still think it's magnificent.
I have been playing with Cale off and on since 1957 and the JJ Cale I know is the one you'll see in this film.
The DVD has now been released in the USA, on 13 June, 2006 and has been available as a region two DVD in England, Germany and Australia since late 2005.
In reviewing African-Americans on film in chronological order for Black History Month, we're now at 1936 with the first all-black production for a major studio since Hallelujah!
I've since bought the tape and watch it every now-and-then when I want to smile and feel good.
We later learn that, like Hugo's Jean Valjean, he stole only to feed his starving family, later escaped from confinement, and has been persecuted ever since.
The matches are great and I think are better than WWE because since TNA is obviously a smaller company but a growing company then the wrestlers are going to go that extra mile for the fans and for their company.
The murder and denouement is just lame and it is surprising this episode came so early since it bears all the hallmarks of the type of episode you get when the series is going down the drain and a desperate attempt is made to liven the pattern up with a new location.
I thought Freddy only has power in the dream world, but since when he's able to possess human body in the real world?
This is my first real Bollywood film and since there are no musical numbers or dancing or romance I am under the impression that the film isn't typical.
I recently saw this film for the first time since seeing it many years ago.
A shame too, since the story idea is a good one, albeit one straight out of Time Travel 101.
I have enjoyed this movie ever since I first saw it in 1980.
Ever since I was a youngster, I wondered what would happen if you could transport a battleship or aircraft carrier back to say, the Revolutionary War era.
I guess the framing storyline qualifies as padding, on second thought, since it does fill out the allotted time, adds some exposition, and is absolutely inconsequential enough that it doesn't stick in my memory.
Ving Rhames plays the animal which is not an accurate name for his character ,since his character is no different than a mob boss or a drug cartel kingpin.... this is how you have to be to survive on the streets.. excellent acting by Jim Brown who in real life is a PEACE ACTIVIST.. Ving Rhames does an excellent performance ,, who i think is worthy of an academy award nomination....Chazz Palminteri also performed well as a supporting actor.... this is a must see movie for Kids going down the wrong path in life,, since it shows the consequences of a leading a violent lifestyle....
The sudden change from comedy to drama is kind of jarring, since you don't know what's going to happen next.
It reminded me a bit of Gilbert Grape, since it is a about a man who lovingly cares for his retarded younger brother.
His portrayal of mental retardation is the most convincing I've seen since Giovanni Ribisi in "The Other Sister" (which was also 1999).
Once he arrives at the farm, he sees that much hasn't changed or been done since he left and he decides that they will need a housekeeper to clean up the mess.
I stumbled across this little...... GEM lets call it, since that sounds classier than TURD, while i was looking up cheerleader porn....
John Waters used to make movies like this, before he succumbed to the Hollywood dollar(s), but it's few and far between since then.
Living in the UK, though, it was near impossible to find, especially since the WHEELS OF TERROR Amazon.co.UK has is actually the 1987 film THE MISFIT BRIGADE, which they mistakenly claim is this film as MB had the alternate title WHEELS OF TERROR.
There are no gore scenes, there's almost no blood, but there's a tense atmosphere since the beginning (and the soundtrack helps it a lot, with some classical and disturbing string sounds!).
Which is all the same, since Hellman has already made it, and with the Criterion release the road-dreamers of this and the last century can cherish it, before they get into their 55 Chevy to head out again.
One star for location shooting in Santa Fe, which hasn't changed much since the early seventies.
Problems with music rights have kept this film from being seen much since its release, which is a real shame.
Promoted by Universal Studios in 1971 as an answer to Columbia's Easy Rider, the film was originally released to less than enthusiastic audiences but has since taken on the status of cult classic and it is richly deserved.
Grieco although aging was really fantastic and we all know how well a certain topless actress in this film, Maggie Q, has done since.
I've been excited about _Cats and Dogs_ since I caught the hilarious trailer months ago.
Brown has really improved since the first one.
Though I'm the only with a VCR copy of Halloween High and one day hope to pass the third installment onto all of my neighbourhood kids since I know they enjoyed both Halloweentown one and two.
Instead it turns out that in The Adventures of Don Juan, not only is our hero still swashbuckling up a storm and almost as handsome as ever -- let's not forget, ten years and many events have now elapsed since Robin Hood -- but he is also man enough to laugh at himself along with the audience.
(btw, historical fencing fans should note the use of Thibaults' Mysterious Circle on the wall of the fencing school, completely appropriate since this is the Spanish school of rapier play).
This is the lamest Dolph movie I've scene since... ever.
And it will strike back-as we see in the final scene of the movie- with a fury, in a massive global warming, that hasn't been seen since the dawn of recorded history!
Had an occasional humorous one-liner but not enough to redeem extremely bad acting, bad set design (since this was filmed at a renaissance faire very little of the set was actual quality but simply slapped together), very very very very bad action/music coordination, and lastly extremely bad acting (it was so bad I figured it deserved mention twice).
So even if you do or do not manage to see this movie,do NOT miss the music, since that is bound to stay with you longer.
I would have given Lekin a 10 but, since I do not know Hindi, I have to rely on subtitles and, periodically, the subtitles were a little hard to follow unless you are a speed reader.
However, I have one problem concerning the casting: I would have preferred the young and fresh Olivia de Havilland in the small yet pivotal role of Antoinette de Mauban, since Mary Astor looked old enough to be Douglas Fairbank's mother in the film.
While recently watching the 1952 remake, I noticed that the duel scene was much more imaginatively and elaborately staged that timeÂand even better filmed, since many of the shots of Colman and Fairbanks were mere close-ups in the 1937 version.
Too bad it doesn't receive the strong recognition it deserves within today's generation, since many people my age tend to recoil upon seeing a black-and-white film...as well as hearing about my own imaginary country, Vasaria, due to its obvious unreality and its historical and escapist features.
You don't get casts better than this since it has Coleman, Madeline Carol, Fairbanks, David Niven, Raymond Massey, Mary Astor and C Aubrey Smith.
When the film was first screened for a preview audience it went over only OK and Selznick realized the beginning was too long and since LOST HORIZON another Colman film made that year had it's beginning taken away to speed up the story, that's what he did to PRISONER OF ZENDA, chop off the prologue and epilogue.
As an adult, I discovered the Ronald Colman version (upon which the Granger film was based, scene by scene, camera angle by camera angle), and since Colman is one of my all-time favorite actors (the personification of British suave), I fell in love with it.
I don't want to blame this on the actors, since I didn't really see anything wrong with them, but the script had all the strength of a wet grocery sack.
again i don't know why the director chose this way especially since no one will remember the movie let alone who played such low parts.
thankfully wallace shawn has gone on to be in much better movies since this its too bad i can't say the same thing for c. thomas howell haha.
It seems Jack only filed a return the year he work for Mickey Dee's and has not bothered to submit a tax form since.
I think Madonna was showing how she had changed since the movie In Bed with Madonna.
It's been a few years now since this was filmed and at the time there were big issues about the United States involvement with the Iraq war and Madonna own thoughts are aired.
It's pure movie-making in a great sense of the word, since its filmmaker is just so in love with doing a kitchen sink with a kung-fu grip with giving a wide smile and lots and lots of blood in front a blue-screen.
Instead of traveling with them, Oshare invites her six closest school friends Â all of them with adorable nicknames based on their personalities, like Fantasy, Kung-Fu and Melody Â to head out to the countryside and pay a visit to Oshare's aunt whom she hasn't seen since her mother died.
In line with a ream of other comedies of its time ("Planes, Trains and Automobiles", "Trading Places" and "Spies Like Us" - all SNL spawned classics) and superior in its way to all clones made since.
The actors, since being in the middle of the actor's strike, had time to hang out and through-out the movie you see the uninhibited lunacy that putting all these personalities together, with a lot of alcohol will do.
I remember watching Cannonball run when i was just a child, the opening sequence with the black Lamborghini simply blew me away, and i have loved that car every since.
The Cannonball Run has been vilified by many critics over the years but I love this movie and have been watching it ever since I was little.
But I haven't enjoyed a challenge in quite this way since my equally serendipitous introduction to Paddy McGoohan's The Prisoner many years ago.
Its forgivable since this is a problem with pretty much all animation barring a very few but since it looks as though the producers are putting so much attention to detail, they should'nt have really overlooked that feature.
I don't agree with the reviewer who says it's not for "eastcoasters" since I live in NYC and felt that this film worked on many levels that resonated with me, in spite of the geographical differences.
To me this is quite accurate since our whole entire culture is filled with sex in advertisements, television, and movies.
They're all about liking what you see, since the writing is rarely good enough for you to like what you hear.
I would watch it again to see if it was just me or the movie, since I suspect it's a little of both.
This was the last camping done until after WW 2 since Pearl Harbor was attacked in Decemeber of that year.
Silas, with the help of Caroline's ex-governess (Katina Paxinou) plan to get rid of Caroline, since the inheritance then passes to him.
The concept Â brewing since more than 25 years; the work on the story, screenplay and script Â painstaking; the details looked into the production Â perfect!
This film's "version" of the book and story is well-played, the scenery well-photographed (especially since footage was done 65 years ago), and the characters interesting.
You don't know what to feel for saif, since more time is spent in showing his romance than his place in the drama.
The problem is that since there is very little to happen in the movie, it drags at leisurely pace giving scenes which make bear no relevance on the ultimate message.
First half or so into the movie,you are hooked and quite entertained,but after the interval,the film slowly drags,since the plot becomes weak and it's going in one direction; so there isn't much to tell.Subplots are added to compensate the running time.In other words,it could've trimmed a little more of the length and finished it quickly.That would've made the film perfect.But it gets boring as it drags the story and adds subplot and makes the whole of second half contrived.But the third act,which is the big revelation of who is behind the whole scenario,somewhat pays off with satisfaction.
I will save you the pain of glorifying the performances since it is to be seen.
He has been unable to speak since he survived the fire that killed his aunt (Wayne' mother).
Miss Field is lovely in a non-conventional way; she shines as never before or since.
The main character is so very unrealistic, but since I didn't read the book, I don't know if this is just an awful book made into a movie or it's just the movie.
She looks older than her 29 years, which again helps the film to stand out since it's not about teenagers in peril but about mature characters about whom we might actually care.
The premise was unique and creative, and the movie required some thought as to what really went on in the film, but I praise it as the greatest horror/slasher film since 79.
Certainly the gory scenes are not very attractive, and in a way such explicit portrayal does not seem necessary, since the psychological suspense is the driving force of the movie.
The only good thing I can say about Heatseeker is that I didn't have to pay to see it, since I caught it on the Sci-Fi channel.
At night, the crazed zombies attack his home again and again, but since Heston would later become the president of the NRA, it wasn't surprising that he proceeded to blow the crap out of the intruders--and do it with great gusto and style.
The nascent "Luddite" reactionary element that was in hippiedom has swelled in prominence in the years since the movie was made, as the less harsh themes of Sixties "counter-culture", libertarianism and the renunciation of top-down political dogma, have evaporated.
I hope that Tom Cruise does not spoil this magnificent story, since I heard he had the intention of preparing (or spoiling) a remake.
The film has dated more than other films from '71/72, and with the special effects bar haven risen astronomically since that time there is little hope for the film to grow even older gracefully.
But since the monster is trapped on the other side of the set, oops, I mean cell, it just keeps eating the same guard, over and over.
Along with this trend, SciFi has decided that their original movies should be R-rated, but since they want to be sensitive to the concerns of parents, they block out anything titillating (bare breasts, giving someone the finger, etc.)
We haven't talked about a film like this since EYES WIDE SHUT (you can see my review for this film @ /www.imdb.com/title/tt0120663/usercomments-509).
This affects Karen a lot since she thinks of them highly.
I did have some problems with Kinnear since he still looks fairly young (He's 40) and not like someone who had been married for years (the painted on gray temples didn't help much lol), but it does beat watching him in Auto Focus (solid perfomance, but not entirely factual).
I have been trying since then to watch it again, but i could not get a copy.
Irene finds it very difficult to join the family named Forsyte who were a very close family who thought Irene was just a gold digger since she was not a very wealthy woman at all.
It is very hard to understand just who Irene really falls in love with, and you will never see the men going to bed with her since this film was made in 1949.
John Galsworthy's sometimes ponderous but very interesting social drama "The Forsyte Saga" has been attempted as a TV-mini series since this production of a feature film, based on the earlier books of the series, was issued by MGM Studios' heads.
I'm explaining it badly, forgive me, since this is a film thats better to experience than to hear about.
definitely see this in widescreen since the compositions are geared to that.
8 months since hearing about it, 8 years of watching the same episodes and knowing the script off by heart, and a few discrepancies that really spoil an otherwise top notch programme.
Obviously made for the neo Nazi and female market, since anyone else will be completely turned off by this.
Now he's an international Hollywood blockbuster star since LOTR, but still agreed to return to TV for Sharpe, took a huge pay cut to do TV because he loves the part of Sharpe.
And since they've obviously thrown more money at this one it looks better.
This one needed a few changes, since (unlike the books) this Indian outing is set *after* the Peninsular war and blends several of the "Indian" Sharpe books.
It's been ten years since we saw Richard beat the Imperial Guard on the bloody field of Waterloo, and, like many of the life long fans, I believed that was the last time we would see Sharpe on screen.
Tekkon Kinkreet is the most stunning visual anime that I seen since Akira.
This is one of the most innovative sci fi series lately, as many of the commenters here noticed already, but since it is a Sci-Fi Channel production, I guess their best interest is to make it into a series.
I decided to watch this since the premise seemed fairly original.
It is nice to see her on something since ER.
I was never quite sure if I should trust her completely or not since the objects seem to prove that power corrupts even when you have what you think are the best interests at heart.
Fantasy without rules is far less satisfactory, since characters in those stories can do whatever the writer arbitrarily decides they can do (or can't), and as a result, the writing is lazier.
To be honest, I don't believe I've been this hooked on a show since Firefly.
The initial commenter wondered if Janet Leigh was dubbed in this film since he couldn't remember her singing in any of her other pictures.
I loved this film, and not since Hotaru no haka (Grave of the Fireflies) has a film been able to effect me so profoundly.
Dakota Flemming is, as usual, superb and the mare SoÃ±ador (why should a mare get a masculine name, I really don't know, since the feminine for dreamer in Spanish is SoÃ±adora) really lets you wishing you had enough space in your apartment to have one of your own...
We did not hesitate to accept the offer of previewing "Dreamer" since both my dad and my husband have owned and raced thoroughbreds.
In addition, I have loved Elizabeth Shue since Karate Kid.
And the abrupt end, which we cannot elaborate here, thanks to spoiler policy .... Every European and US-citizen should go see this movie, since it seems to give a realistic picture of Turkey even now.
I would not call this a gripping suspense movie since there are some places that make you laugh when maybe you should not.
But just watch the movie and you might disagree with this, since all you think about at the time is "will World War III start over a snowball fight?
since I believe the 1970's was the ONLY decade that had style and taste (I hated the 1980's).
Ever since the Original Series went off the air, The three TV specials that aired, this being one of the three, really don't sum up the awe and power that the character of Steve Austin has.
I found that to be a little strange, since the Stooges normally suffer dozens of injuries in a short (similar to Pro Wrestlers) and yet I had never seen any of them sporting visible bruises to illustrate that they are being bullied.
This Franco-Italian "Eastern Western" has intrigued me since I read about it on a magazine, in view of its then-upcoming showing on Italian TV, when I was about 7 years old Â but it literally seemed to vanish from the face of the earth in the interim!
This poor excuse for a horror flick actually rips off a movie called Killer Klowns From Outer Space, arguably the worst film since Plan 9 From Outer Space.
Also the movie is so unbelievably short that it's impossible to be really too bored and as always Tim Thomerson is fun to watch, that being said there is too much stock footage from Dollman, Demonic Toys and Bad Channels but you never get too bored since there is always something silly going on.
He's too embarrassed to leave his house since boys mock him and girls show no interest in him at all.
When it exploded onto screens in the mid 1980's, OscarÂ® nominated director  Dominique Deruddere's film CRAZY LOVE divided critics and audiences as few  films before or since.
To say it's been a while since I've seen a movie that was actually as intelligent as it thinks it is an understatement.
since "fine lines" between anything in life prove to always be a more complex and deeper matter that what is seen at the surface, it is truly a feat that this film gives the viewer a chance to see both sides of a very entertaining situation.
Carmelo (Antonio Gades), who secretly loves Candela since he was a boy, is arrested while helping JosÃ© and unfairly sent to prison.
It doesn't seem that they struggled that hard with the challenge since The Palace is just a mindless regurgitation of K-drama clichÃ©s that should have been put out to pasture years ago.
The paper trail totally disputes that claim since Operation Mogul was conducted in the early to mid 1950's years after "The Roswell Incident" was said to have taken place.
And since I bought it, I gave SHE FREAK a day in court and watched it.
The love story was believable, since it was true.
Granted, since Hollywood was funding it, they probably have a different opinion then I do!
So, since those tough old birds that were married in the 1950's (and my Mom was one) paved the way for you young girls, you can now be judges, jet pilots, doctors and ice road truckers.
There are some good things here, basically anything not involving the natives (which I know defeats the purpose since this is film about them).
This is going to appeal more to people with a love for or high tolerance of bad movies since a good half of this is very silly.
I've never enjoyed romance as a genre, but ever since I saw this movie ages ago, I've been enamored of it.
It has been 21 years since this great comedy/romance movie was made staring heaps of really great actors and actress like the dam great actor Tom Hanks,The really funny John Candy from the heaps funny movie Uncle Buck,Daryl Hannah and Eugene Levy.
He's longed for love in his life ever since he was rescued from drowning as a boy by a mermaid.
There are some ironic parts, since the movie was made over two decades ago.
I must have seen 'Splash' a dozen or more times as a child of 8 or 9 and not since.
And we learn that she has been stalking Hanks's character like some paedophilic pariah ever since he was a child.
One day, Allen decides to go to Cape Cod to enjoy the sea, a place where he feels mysteriously good, but he falls into the sea by accident and since he doesn't know how to swim, is saved by a mysterious and beautiful woman,who runs away soon after Allen recovers his conscience.
after hearing about this film since the 80s, i finally got the chance to see it and was seriously disappointed.
I saw this on TV from a very bad print, I hope a better version has since been released.
The relax performances are adequate even though the characters are pretty much vacant shells, since most of the effort went into the look and thick atmosphere.
I decided to see it anyway since I'm one of Alicia's biggest fans.
This is the story about the little people behind the war and politics, as never spoken so far, since it never happened to You.
Sanctions-busting crime and normal crime are their path of socialization in the new and uncharted world, where TV crime shows will give them some patterns to follow, but since they're not the faint of heart, they'll soon make their own rules.
This is the best gangster movie I saw since Scarface.
I've been into the Polish twins since I saw Jackpot and Northfork a couple of years ago, and I'd been waiting to see this film since it was released.
I still had my doubts about seeing it, specially since in a different channel there was a movie about a Gambler in Vegas.
It's impossible to understand why this movie didn't get access to a wider audience, particularly since co-joined twins were, and still are, a slightly hot topic of the day.
I can definitely say that this is a must-see film for everyone, especially since its messages of tolerance and respect have many parallels with today's world.
I lost my sister, and she was not a my Siamese twin, but she was my best friend, and since her death, I've been gloomy.
I will have to do some research to see if the Polish brothers have written or directed any movies since.
I was really disappointed since I thought this movie was similar to Die Hard but I guess not.
if you want to see plenty of hot chicks showering Goofy violence and the overall awesomeness of Orville check this movie out i first saw it on USA network years ago and have been wanting more Orville ever since Check it out!!
It has been a long time since I have laughed this hard at a show.
I wasn't going to sit through the whole thing but I decided to, since I really had nothing else to do, but I'm glad I did.
Kids would understand about the meaning of life since a person named Andrew martin has shown them,that even androids come to a decision about their existence and why its important to take the love you feel for another with you.
When I lived in Hong Kong I recorded all the episodes on to VHS and have since placed on DVD-R. Now that Seasons 1, 2 and 3 are out, rumors are that 4 and 5 will never be released because of trouble with Spelling and Robert Wagner.
Charlie's Angels has became one of my all time favourite TV programmes since May of this year(2003).
I have loved "Charlie's Angels" since I was a little boy.
It's not entirely symmetric, since it only shows one side of the ring.
Nevertheless it's an effective composition, since it shows everything that needs to be seen and apart from its shaking images, it's perfect.
Or is it "blak", since we don't need the "C", as one of the rapsters suggests.
I wish the director had spent a little more time developing these characters, especially since it is clear that they are meant to represent elements of the community he means to and does criticize.
If the Drop Squad really did exist then I'm glad they did but if they didn't I couldn't be more disappointed especially since we need them now more than ever!
I really enjoyed it and have seen it a couple of times since.
This is so obviously a television movie, since the editing looks like it was done with a meat cleaver, but there are some priceless moments in this film, chiefly among them when Marie, juggling three different identities, "dies" as Robbi and comes back as her platinum-haired twin sister Teri.
Synchronicity of form with the content has been an undeniable goal of art since it's conception.
I was still disgusted and horrified, but (since I learned a lot about abnormal psychology during the intervening years), I saw how brilliant "In the Company of Men" truly is...I've watched it many times since.
Eckhart, who has since become a Labute staple, delivers a fascinating performance as a truly despicable character, the smooth and fast-talking Chad.
I was fortunate enough to catch it at The Seattle Film festival a couple of years ago and have been looking for the DVD ever since.
The reactions of the characters as they are terrorized might amuse, since I'm sure many of us have fantasized, in times past, the demise of these immature reality show types who back-stab and bemoan each other for financial gain or if just for the hell of it.
Sanoe Lake makes her first on screen appearance since "Blue Crush", though one might wonder why she bothered, as she gets nothing to do.
The authentic location work helps cement a realistic edge, while the pacing is rather measured and rather low-scale in its escalating confrontations and violence (which is tamely staged, but gut wrenching since you're thrown right into the acts).
I haven't seen it since but I never forgot it.
Unfortunately it doesn't seem to have a point, or at least an ending since the picture sort of stops with a conclusion out of left field.
Hermione Gingold's role as Desiree's mother is reduced to a glorified cameo since they chose to cut her song, "Liasons".
Ever since a friend in grad school described it: "Robert Walker is mean to his mother, so everyone suspects he's a Communist."
Even at the time it probably had this resonance, if more faintly, since sodomy, atheism and Communism made up the unholy, if unspoken, triad of the times (aka: moral turpitude).
They hit on it with Mammy Yoakum's Yoakumberry tonic which she has been feeding a spoonful of to Lil Abner since his birth.
I came on here hoping to find that in the eight years since the movie was made commonsense and justice had prevailed and that Jody Ann had finally gotten to bring up her son in a loving, caring, nuturing home.
Many think it's suppose to be set in the future, but it is actual set in an alternate reality since there are no advances in technology except the DNA hacking.
Parry Shen is awful and overacts all the time, a shame since he has a big role in the movie.
Original is Original, this is a nice movie but no masterpiece and should have been left without the name Bambi II as it is so far from the Original, especially since the Original showed Bambi as an adult already.....
Bambi is having a hard time, his father has to take care of him but his father also has no respect for him since Bambi isn't as brave as he is.
See, Disney has lost its charm by this point (it's lost it for years--at least since the 70's, when the films became more savvy than charming) and they were trying to necromance a charming movie.
I am currently studying animation in college, and perhaps more than other people I've been expecting less and less from Disney since they started putting out sequels to their classics.
I've been terrified ever since I heard that a "midquel" to Bambi was in the works, since I was positive it would be another campy, over-the-top rehash of the original.
The main character is supposed to be an idiot I guess since it defies all logic that a woman in this situation would not call the Pigs when things start to get hairy.
Twenty years later I have long since stopped making my living as a plumber and my eleven year old sister in law hasn't been my sister-in-law for a decade.
I told her that I needed to know if the water was wet, since I could not go upstairs and see for myself.
Hilariously you can find accounts of the conference which never happened in history books written since this film was made!
It was entirely appropriate that they should have done so, since this is essentially a story of ships and the seamen who manned them.
This movie feels like the filmmakers meant for this to be a drama and at the last minute decided to play up some horror aspects since that genre is popular right now.
LOL Deputy Perkins (Mills Watson) was so funny also, he was practically joined at the hip to Lobo-LOL I guess he should since they were brothers-in-law.
for whatever reason, pieces of the theme song are still clear in my head, even though i haven't seen this show since about 1981. being a huge simpsons fan, i delight in all of their pop culture references and this show was referenced close to a half dozen times.
And since then, the word "Lobo" itself has become synonymous with bad TV.
Okay I'm a little biased since I was an extra in the film.
It's been a while since I watched the amusingly titled "Woman is the Future of Man" at the Quad.
The Marines, however, *were* covered even though they were inside since they were carrying arms on duty, hence coming to attention as well as the salute.
In my opinion, (and I may be prejudice since I am ex-Navy)NCIS is the best show on TV.
The last two minutes is the saddest I've seen in a cartoon since the death scene in Lion King.
He gets involved in a plot, impersonating the kidnapped son of a rancher who was missing since he was five.
A lot of the reason it's such a great film is that since it was a new-style film, it doesn't seem clichÃ©d or derivative.
In any case, such punishment did neither Tom Powers nor myself any good since we both turned out wicked.
This film has no grey area, it is hate or love for sure, since it doesn't slumber through the mediocre horror genre formulas and has very little blood for the die hard horror fans.
It's a good thing there were so many characters; since none of them had more than one dimension, it would have been hard for them to stand upright without each other for support.
Apparently, it was just some kind of animal, not a mystical guardian, since all it took to kill it was standard weapons - though it did manage to die and come back.
Okay, I simply had to see this since I saw it's "sequel" first (about two years ago), UNSEEN EVIL 2 (aka ALIEN 3000), and I immensely enjoyed it because it was truly one of the worst movies I had seen in a very long time.
This is not a flaw however, since Claudio Casselini and Giovanna Ralli are very good in the leading roles.
Of course, they will inevitably fall in love, but this absurdity occurs almost in a vacuum since director Charles Walters seems more interested in showing Jenny as a raging harpy when she isn't acting pitiable in the privacy of her bedroom.
Crawford's singing voice is dubbed by an emphatic singer named India Adams, not the worst offense at the time since such lip-syncing was pervasive.
That's not really a big deal, since that happens in real life more often that not, but it's still jarring to see it on screen.
Shooting took place in 1967 while cruising between Los Angeles and Acapulco(Mexico)I earned US$ 80,- for my (very small)part.I since then followed the career of James Garner, especially the TV-series like the mini-series "Space"(Michener) and Space Cowboys (2000) and the series of Jim Rockford, the P.I.starting in the seventies.
The one thing that has bugged me ever since I saw this was the concern of whether submitting to the computer's will is all that bad of a thing.
Like a previous reviewer, I saw this movie in theaters more than 30 years ago and not once since, and yet much of it I remember with amazing clarity.
I bet Romero really regretted this part of the original NOTLD (with good cause) since there has was no mention of this in the remake.
I think at-this-point Savini was burned-out doing the makeup-gig, and has continued-directing since this film, whenever he can.
It should-be-noted that the film was made--in-part--to "shore-up" Romero's and Russo's (as-well as everyone who was involved-with the original) copyright to the original-film, which is only-fair--they have barely-been-paid for it since 1968.
Remakes usually are a curse for us, horror fans, but "Night of the Living Dead" is a different story, since director Tom Savini obviously made this film because he wanted to tribute the original instead of using the idea of a remake as an easy excuse to further exploit a profitable franchise.
Of course, the original can't be topped anywhere, since the initial shock-impact has gone and since Savini can't create the same unbearable atmosphere of mystery and despair.
Hartmann who's been missing, or dead, since he was forced to desert his German Army unit back in 1944.
James Bond devotees might want to check this out, since both  Gray and Pleasence portrayed Blofeld in 007 films, and O'Toole  proves why he is one of the screen's greatest actors (who never  won an Oscar).
The lunacy of war on a grand scale, (since when is war not on a grand scale), is amply exposed in this one!
One of the scenes that has always stood out in my mind since first watching this film is the one near the end when Lugosi ties up Karloff.
Then there is the overall context in which the Germans are losing the war, but nothing much is made of this except to the extent that it generates a movement among (some of) the officers to eliminate Hitler, a movement about which Major Grau (Omar Sharif), investigating the slaughter of a prostitute, observes cynically that it took quite a while for the movement to develop since the army seemed satisfied enough as long as they were winning.
This isn't an easy movie to summarize, since there are at least three major plot-lines going on at the same time.
I decided to watch it again, on VHS, since it has not been released on DVD in Brazil.
I felt some exaggeration also.It shows turks as perfect warriors technically and very mysterious killers The figurine turks used in the backgrounds had actually a comic Azerbaijan accent and spoke very unrelated words in fight scenes I think the director used them since they knew Russian  , so it would be more economic.
Finally in the end, when the exchange was supposed to take place between Wasim Khan and Rishi Kumar, the terrorist just give them clothes of Rishi Kumar, and Wasim Khan was immediately taken back, since the terrorist didn't keep up with their end of the deal.
In the end, we realize that the terrorist couldn't hand over Rishi Kumar, since he escaped, and Rishi Kumar faces off with the head terrorist (Pankaj Kapoor), who after many conversations with Rishi Kumar, changed him as a person, and lets him go.
'The Baron of Arizona' has a title that makes it sound like a Western, especially since it was directed by Sam Fuller.
Standards and practices in psychiatry and psychotherapy have changed considerably since "Whirlpool" was made and anyone watching it now will need to make allowances for this and also suspend their disbelief at a couple of the plot's more bizarre twists which come over as much less credible now than they may have seemed at the time.
Shortly thereafter, Theresa turns up dead, and Ann is implicated as the murderer since she was found at the scene of the crime.
And while Mantan's antics, especially his looks of fright, would probably not do in these politically correct times, he still can be entertainingly funny with what he does here and I don't think it reflects badly on his race at all since to me he's just a funny looking clown who's quite endearing, whatever the race.
I don't want to say too much since the joy here is in the watching, and this film is certainly worth watching.
The majority of the film depicts Cooper and his crew roaming the faux-French countryside -- which will look eerily familiar to anyone who has seen at least three Spaghetti Westerns, since most were filmed on the same Spanish exterior locations -- encountering various indigenous locals, fighting off allied elements, and contemplating the meaning of service, loyalty, the value of life, and the price of failure to follow orders.
Nimbly directed by Eric Leighton and Ralph ("We're Back!ÂA Dinosaur's Story") Zondag, Dinosaur" starts with an incredible ten-minute sequences that not only sets the story into motion but also showcases the impressive advances in computer animation since "Toy Story."
Of course I cannot compare the dinosaurs from this movie to the ones of Jurassic Park, since they are very different from each other, but I can say that they both look very real.
Despite the fact that it has been many years since I have seen it and I am not really able to point out specific details, I can safely say that this was an entertaining movie.
He made his debut as the Time Lord in the closing moments of 'The Parting Of The Ways', then appeared in a short sketch for 'Children In Need' in November, but his first full episode was this special, the first Christmas 'Who' since 1965's 'The Feast Of Steven' with William Hartnell.
Even so, since I'm hopelessly in love with Nick Stahl, I have watched Lover's Prayer many times (for whatever reason it on TV a lot!)
And since this short is based around the title of the story "The Scarlet Pimpernel," I would like to point out, that I've seen the movie version of "The Scarlet Pimpernel" from 1935 starring Leslie Howard on T.C.M.
Cosmo IS a moron, since he goes along with it not questioning this and incurred the massive debt to begin with.
THIS makes no sense since Cosmo had very good credit, a successful business, and would have likely been able to pay the debt off + interest.
Nevertheless after he returns to his club, they lure him away, and attempt to kill him regardless, at which point the hard ass muscle man decides to opt out, saying he wont do it because Cosmo is his friend, and hes the only one who listens to him, which is another ridiculous spiral to be led down, since the 2 have absolutely no meaningful conversation prior.
In fact the reason I am writing this at all is because I wondered what he had done since (I saw this years ago) and found to my shock and dismay no one has given him a project.
I believe the film made since in Korea.
And all you need to know is that this is the BEST serial thriller to come along since The Silence of the Lambs...it's better than Seven, it's better than Copycat, and it's even better than The Crimson Rivers.
I watch One Last Dance quite often since I purchased it.
Not since Ed Wood have we seen someone able to pull this feat off.
She has had mental issues since the death of her parents ten years ago.
I was soon captivated by this sweet and tender movie, reliving the agony and ecstasy of first love) and it made an impression that has haunted my heart strings ever since.
Perfect for the "girls night", since we've all loved a singer in a band so time in our lives!
They should play it though every so often, I haven't seen it since that night.
Just ordered it from CD Universe about a month ago, and have given it about four whirls in the two weeks since.
Being 39 and realizing how much has changed since those simpler '70s times when girls of 13 actually did take buses and go to malls together and had a lot more freedom away from the confines of modern suburbia makes me sad for my daughter Â who is nearly 13 herself.
Ever since I was a tiny little girl, I grew up on Peanuts comic strips and cartoons.
It's so many years since i saw this film, but i'll never forget it.
Besides the surprising lack of fun being a tyrannosaur (you move slow and you're an easy target, but it's still neat in it's own way since he's basically a rampaging house!
This movie was made by men who have never before or since made another film.
Dean can go from making fun of Sam's love of the remake of "Godzilla," to begging Kathleen for help because Sam's been his responsibility ever since the fire in Lawrence, to threatening to kill the entire crazy if the touch his brother.
And I like Sam in this episode, since it's really Sammy who gets out of the cage.
It seems many more murders have occurred since then but all of this remains unknown to these three young upstart employees hoping to finally make it big on their own.
It's not like the concept of this movie is any less silly than that of the first movie but at least the first movie still somewhat worked out, since it was a fine, formulaic though fine, crafted simple piece of horror.
I am a huge fan of her since I began seeing films.
This is hands down the best romantic film since .....well in a long time , all the people i know who haven't liked this film is because its got impossible situations in it and its slow in the 2nd half all i have to say : stop watching Hindi films then and continue watching 25 sec ads which have diminished your attention span .
Perhaps, since Silsila.
Sure the film wasn't brilliant but it beats the other crap Bollywood has been spewing out ever since the arrival of Mr. Imran-Gigolo-Hashmi.
I expected more since it was based on actual events.
I saw it first twenty years ago, and it haunted me ever since; I try to watch it once every couple of years.
Or, on the other hand, maybe it's for the best that he didn't, since he actually did go on to have a remarkable career behind the camera.
Amitabh Bachchan's Mrityudatta Vinod Khanna's Insaaf Dimple Kapadia's Saagar Mumtaz'as Aandhiyaan and Kajol'Fanna are names you cannot erase from your memory since the celebrated actors returned to the big screen after a hiatus.
Debutante director Anil Mehta knows the importance of frames/visuals since he's an accomplished cinematographer.
This might be her Best since (Chane Ke Khet mein and Ek Do Teen) The main theme of this Movie is Dancing!
This is MD's first movie role since Devdas (2002) and it is worth a watch just to see the India's beauty on screen again.
Directed by Anil Mehta and written by Aditya Chopra, this is a musical genre movie and the songs are memorable, which makes it a change since nowadays, there are only some songs and music that can be hummed to or remembered.
The plot drew from stories that have been around since the beginning of cinema.
I guess my standards have slid a bit since she left.
Ever since I saw this movie when it first came out, I have loved it.
Melanie Griffith shines in a tailor-made role as V,the proverbial hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold, in her most appealing performance since WORKING GIRL and Ed Harris is charming and sexy as the dad.
And little by little things are going down but all is well that ends well and I can't reveal the details, except that the uncle will get the kids he should have gotten from the very start since he was the only family.
I can't stand Leelee Sobieski, seriously, ever since I saw Heaven on Earth, her face just, I can't describe it, she annoys the heck out of me.
There music, which has been topping the charts ever since its release, brings a beautiful touch to the film.
The overly emotional acting is highlighted by dramatic panning and freak breezes that even turn up in closed rooms, but it is exactly what the audiences want, and it goes hand in hand with the over-the-top lavish extravaganza of the sets and the well-choreographed song and dance sequences, since ENTERTAINMENT is all the movies aim at.
Again as usual, since he plays that role in many of his films, but he holds the story together....!!
After Koi mil gaya, she comes back in KHNH, with a much stronger role, probably her strongest role since Kya Kehna....and she excels in it.
To really disprove the claims of the Mormons, you would need to test every tribe's blood since before the time of Christ, with a sufficient number of random samples to generate reliable statistical measures.
On the set, Mona notices that Rebecka is not taking medicines that have been prescribed to her (for bipolar disorder or schizophrenia is my guess, since Rebecka protests to her mother, "They make me tired.
Jacks affair almost had him lose his wife Bethany, Hanna Yellard, because of it putting her, Rebecca, into such a deep depression over the whole mess that she hadn't made a movie since.
It's been a long time since I saw the show, but I'm just a sucker for the kind of universe the Harsh Realm was.
The familiarity of Marchand's incessant complaints is almost gruesome since she takes the character so believably far.
While some above don't care for Bracco, I have to say this is the freshest role she has had in years since Good Fellas.
In the years since 1999, Gandolfini has risen so much so as an actor (mainly thanks to his role in The Sopranos) that today he is considered to be among the best in the business.
As a Vietnam era veteran, I object, as I am sure do all those men and women before and since who have left a child to serve; for someone "called" to do relief work, if anything it's a bigger gesture, as they don't have someone telling them they have to go!
Perhaps lingering is the wrong word, since as I write this, I only left the theater about 30 minutes ago...
However, I don't believe there would be much chance for them anyway, since most of the actors aren't very good either.
Not since 2001: A Space Odyssey, has a sci-fi film made science so powerful and exciting.
Because the Strangers inhabit the human dead and, since children can die, the Strangers can inhabit their bodies.
Such arguments seem pointless to me anyway, since the basic premise both of these movies, plus 'The Thirteenth Floor', 'The Truman Show', 'Pleasantville', et al are so blatantly appropriated from Philip K Dick's SF of the 1950's.
Ever since I first saw the first Crow film with Brandon Lee, I've been an avid fan of Alex Proyas' film making and Dark City is another amazing example of his cinematic expertise.
I know of no other movie, before or since (it's been eight years), which shows a city literally re-shape itself each night with buildings expanding, rising, falling, etc.
Everyone seems to have their own reason to be searching for Murdoch, and Murdoch is trying to figure out why, since he has no clue as to who he is.
And any which way I look at it, this film soars to heights unseen since 2001: A Space Odyssey...
It deserves its place with the Matrix, 12 Monkeys and others, pioneers in a field so changed (usually for the worse) since Star Wars and since earlier sci-fi classics.
Apart from that, the enemies since long time ago are not the Russians.
Senseless, waste of time, starring wooden Harrison Ford who has been playing the same role, since Han Solo and Deckard of Blade Runner, now for 20 years.
Well he boards his flight back to the states, Air Force One starts off well, but is quickly hijacked by Ivan Korshunov and his men, terrorists who want their General Radek released from prison in return for the passengers on board, which isn't good since I guess he was hard to capture and is a deadly terrorist.
Notice that another effect has been to convince Iran that it needs to acquire nuclear weapons, since it is obvious that the Bush administration isn't about to invade a country that has them (e.g., North Korea, Pakistan).
I haven't seen the movie in it's entirety since that memorable night so, my inner child gives it a ten.
One does not need to see the original to get that, although it certainly helps with this one, especially since Alfonso Freeman (Morgan's son) is so darned dead on with his impersonation of his father.
Which can be quite sad for the lack of skin, since there is some nice eye candy on show.
It does get atmospheric in spots, which is kind of good since there's no suspense to be found.
The ending sets up a sequel, apparently intending to rip off "Halloween" in the next installment, since they blatantly ripped off the theme music to set it up.
As I am rating it from a child's point of view and have not seen it since then, keep in mind that as an adult, the enjoyment may have run out.
Soon Jim, Herbie and Tennessee are winning races and Jim's ego inflates while Thorndyke's temper grows since he too races and loses every time to Herbie.
Once Jim realizes HE hasn't being winning the races he tries to find Herbie who has since run off.
This has been one of my top five favorite movies since the first time I saw it.
The result means there are some contrived plot turns and certainly variations in the graininess of the film stock (since 1982 was still well before the enhanced computer graphics we see today), but the film is still quite a kick after a quarter-century.
Just before she broke out big in "The Thorn Birds", the stunning Rachel Ward lends a hint of welcome sarcasm to the sexy, Bacall-like languor she provides as Juliet, tapping into a genuine comedy talent rarely used since.
Legendary costume designer Edith Head did her final work on this film, which is fitting since she did many of the costumes on the earlier films.
Talk about cost cutting, anyway after a few failed scripts, Zanuck got American premier novelist John Steinbeck to write an original screenplay and since it was timely patriotic, Hitchcock did it.
et al.. to look back in wonder and emulate but never achieve....yet...  Afterthought: Please note there are some other Brit greats since though with the likes of "sexy beast" and "Gansgter NO1" providing extremely entertaining viewing!
No wonder the film's original backers got cold feet, since while it doesn't in any way romanticise them it does portray them as the very essence of power.
Perhaps this is something of an unfortunate thing for an international market ( Read that as an American market ) since being made for a homegrown market the accents and most especially the slang doesn't translate well over seas but the dialog alone makes up for any shortcomings :   " I knew Colin fancied soldiers but going to Belfast that's a bit much innit ? "
It's probably also uncharitable to point out that Shand is a bit too old school to be taken seriously as a gangland emperor and it's not helped by umpteen films and TV dramas since then showing the London underworld who don't hurt women or kids and who don't grass .In other words it's all a bit clichÃ©d this gangster lark innit ?
With the possible exceptions of BRIGHTON ROCK and GET CARTER,"The Long Good Friday" has a strong case in being the best British gangster film yet produced.It thankfully lacks the jokey,facetious and overtly bloody attitudes that has plagued most UK-based hybrids since the 1990's (as personified by Guy Ritchie and others).It's occasional lapses into nastiness and schematic excesses are easily outweighed by an excellent script (which possesses considerable caustic wit),fine direction,great performances and memorable scenes.
But the final drive away,with Brosnan holding Hoskins at gunpoint is now justly famous,holding on Harold's face seemingly endlessly but ingeniously,with all number of expressions telling us so much.This aspect of Hoskins' performance may be it's most impressive,despite being wordless.There has been a problem in some of Bob Hoskins' film roles since;undeniably a very fine actor,Hoskins however has sometimes fallen into the speech patterns and mannerisms of the role that made him a star into some other parts he has played,much to his detriment,though this has mostly been the exception rather than the rule.
We were introduced to Bob Hoskins and Helen Mirren and both of them have since provided us with some great performances on both large and small screens.
It's the best of the series since part I, and chicken again steals the show from Ekin Cheng as his character allows humility and depth.
In 1980 he began directing feature films and has since only directed 10 films but they include Against all Odds, An Officer and a Gentleman, Delores Claiborn and Ray.
I'm sure these were intended to be socratic dialogues (especially since they reference the concept, albeit poorly), but they managed to sound even *more* contrived than that, impossible as it sounds.
I can't comment on the direction since there isn't evidence of any.
Rebekah Kochan (Tiffani) has done a body transformation since the first installment.
I sound breathless in praise, and I suppose my one reservation is that the movie, since it is based on known facts (and uses real names throughout), lacks imagination.
It is at this moment that director Michael Mann institutes a trick, the likes of which hasn't been seen since All The President's Men.
This film returns him to his prime form, a style he hasn't walked in since Dog Day Afternoon, ...And Justice For All and Serpico.
I was born in '87 so I never got to experience the 70's unfortunately, but my parents never grew up since the 70's.
The main character is Lindsay who transitions from geek to freak, a smart move since the makers of the show balanced the freaks and geeks by focusing on the character who was a bit of both.
I'm a recent convert to IMDb and have been writing and posting these comments since late November and they've mostly been about films.
Not since The Wonder Years have I seen a show that has managed to capture the angst of growing up with such honesty, originality and humour.
And, since TV is often a medium full of vacuous mind-numbing crap (reality TV, Jerry Springer, etc.
May the television show's creators reconsider trying this one again (even if you have to start over with a new cast, since everyone has aged six years--as of this writing).
I feel like I'm committing sacrilege to admit I enjoy this film especially since I'm a huge Film Noir aficionado.
The humor is frequently hilarious and he certainly retains a lot of the integrity he has lost in recent years since he went the way of Eddie Murphy and sold himself out to family audiences.
I have loved him ever since.
Probably a low budget movie, since they couldn't afford a better scenario, as it starts with a story of a war (what's new?)
as time goes by you get more entouched to the characters involved and that makes this film interactive since you try in any way to guess what is going to happen.
Crummy cinematography, really pathetic script (I couldn't believe the actors actually SPOKE these words without gagging or barfing), even worse acting, not ONE sympathetic character, and an ending that doesn't make a bit of sense, seeing it just tells us the same things we've been hearing since the beginning of the movie!
This is the worst thing i have watched since, and probably before, Gigli.
Of course I need to dedicate a paragraph to Mr. Butler here since I assume a lot of his fans are wondering if they should get the DVD or not.
It's been a long time since I've seen such a well enacted and so realistic TV Series.
As a fan of "The Sopranos," I was perhaps a little reluctant to watch "Kingpin," since I felt that nothing could really surpass "The Sopranos" in my affections.
That seems a particular shame, if it is the reason "Kingpin" never succeeded, since its cast was truly talented and I would have liked to see some of those actors get a definite career boost.
They figured he was perfect for the part but, since he was born out of wedlock and under-aged, there were significant difficulties under Louisiana law to be worked out before he could be signed on.
I thought since he goes there and i spent so much time there it might be cool to see it in movie.
Well the scriptwriter should have embellished it since true stories do not make compelling films.
Its an odd way to start a film, but it works since it allows things to be set up and expectations to be dismantled.
This movie focuses on the Aetherius Society, a group of devout and passionate UFO buffs who call themselves "contactees" and have been preaching salvation from outer space since the tense and clammy Cold War era 50's.
Classic martial arts movie scenes like the bamboo forest also get featured in this movie, though the forest did look a bit sparse, since it was filmed in a sound stage.
Over the course of her journey, Natty meets up with a knowledgeable young man by name of Harry (John Cusak), a group of rag-tag misfits with a rather mafia-esque 'you take care of us, we take care of you' motto, and a loyal 'Wolf' (which may or may not be a Husky, since everyone but Natty refers to it as a dog, and it is played by the dog of 'White Fang' fame) that seems to have a sixth-sense when it comes to danger.
I barely feel qualified to write a comment on this forgotten Disney live-action film from the mid-1980s, since I've only seen it once, and that was back when it first came out.
THE JOURNEY OF NATTY GANN   This was in the back of my video cabinet and I haven't watched it since I was a child.
There haven't been children's films that really embrace the darker side of things like these 2 films do since '85... and these under-viewed films deserve a little more credit and public acknowledgment for looking outside of the lines in a genre that is too often trapped within the lines.
Although her film career since Natty Gann has not been noteworthy, you will always remember her for her unflinching portrayal of Natty Gann.
I've seen this at least six times since childhood and I still think it is great.
There was no motive for revenge by Ness since there was no Sean Connery character in real life.
But.... After seeing the pilot, I wanted to growl up, since this wasn't what I expected.
fans of smallville will love this, as i did, i would even go as far as to say that the pilot is a better show than the pilot for smallville (obviously the creative team have gotten better since the beginning of smallville) anyway, with smallville apparently coming to an end in a season or two i think it would be crazy for some network to leave Aquaman dead in the water (sorry) solid acting from all concerned and very cool FX all contribute to this pilot being an obvious hit, watch it anyway you can.
I have liked American Ninja since I was a child and I wanted to see the lead actor in another role.
Heck, even the music is lame since it's identical to the score in "Hell of the Living Dead" and that film already stole it from Goblin's soundtrack for "Dawn of the Dead".
And I have been a huge fan ever since.
Even though it's a one camera comedy with no studio audience or laugh track, it's a sitcom I really enjoyed since the episodes usually featured Bernie talking to the home audience from his easy chair, referring to the people watching at home as "America."
And since I never saw it while it was new, all the reruns are new to me.
The great British actress Flora Robson plays their mother in a colossal bit of miscasting but since her role is minimal she retains her dignity (although some of the lovey-dovey exchanges with her movie son Raft are borderline incestuous).
If there is a flaw it's that there is a few musical numbers that don't really fit (Most musical numbers don't fit in serials since they slow the serial down too much)
I'm sorry but having made 16 movies since 1990 at his age, you cannot expect much to come out if no-one is prepared to be honest.
The camera is static throughout and since the film is driven by ideas rather than story line or character development, the journey at times can be a bit tiresome.
I got five is one of the most original pieces of film i have seen since the days of Tarantino and reservoir dogs.
I saw this flick in the new release section and just had to check it out, especially since it was from the talented filmmakers of one film that I saw of theirs.
A shame that it has been deeply cut, all the section about the house across the road is missing (all you get is the mention from mother at the start) and since the result is a really short film with a jagged disconnect at the end, one wonders why they did that.
I read all the reviews and most people didn't like this film, but i think it's the greatest thing since sliced bread!
Well, as of 2008, 21 years later, it's happened to five US citizens, as far as anyone knows, since 2007 alone.
Personally, I don't think children's shows have been improved upon appreciably since the 70s, when at least diversity and imagination were openly encouraged, and the moral lessons were delivered a little more clearly without the obsequious and nauseating touchy feelie performances modern children's shows tend to use in lieu of actually explaining things to children.
A librarian living in a totalitarian state is deemed to be obsolete and expendable--since books and independent thinking are banned.
It just gives Democracies a bad name since it is so incredibly preachy and obvious.
I was thrilled when I saw that the book had been made into a movie, for the first time since it was written, over 50 years before.
The humor here is that the paterfamilias, James Mortmain (well played by Bill Nighy) is a dried up author who hasn't penned a word since a successful novel of twelve years past.
Raped, Abused and left to fend for herself since 13 years old the film shows the harrowing story of a woman left with nothing but her own salvation.
That only leaves Drake (Kevin McCarthy) and since Cacopoulos had already gambled all Hill & Spencer's money away in Drake's gambling establishment, it's only natural that they help Cacopoulos out in getting their money back.
I mean even a twelve year old with his home PC could do better in special effects - I will not comment on the story since there isn't any but I think you could see this movie as some kind of messed up modern art what at least would explain why it was made.
The man with a little head was too much, really don't think that was real since his body never moved from a frontal shot.
I swear to god this character is about the coolest thing that has graced the silver screen since Herbert West.
The film's antagonists, though much more normal (with one notable exception), may not be as weirdly entertaining as the film's bizarre protagonists, but they are well-acted (they have to be, since they don't have a gimmick to fall back on) and still great characters (they just have incredible protagonists to contend with!
Released at the same time as the mainstream-smash "Lost Boys," it finished decidedly second at the box office -- a shame, since Jenny's performance as vampire ingenue Mae was nothing short of brilliant.
I first saw this episode when it was originally aired in 1961 and have since collected it on LaserDisc.
(I don't recall seeing more than bits and pieces since then.)
Having seen it since, I realize that it is nothing but a routine war picture with little in the way of exploring truly the cost of war to individuals, but it will always have a fond place in my heart from my original viewing oh so many years ago.
What the medium at the time was NOT showing, was that things hadn't changed since the First World War: when the troops come home, they are not the same people they were when they went away.
In place of what should have been a violent, seen-it-all-before conclusion to yet another psycho killer movie, you get the coming attractions reel for the film -- An idea that has merit (if it had been planned that way) since the movie is set in a Drive-In and all.
What a shame too, since a drive-in movie theater would be prime "massacre" territory.
American Movie fans will get to check out what Mark Borchardt has been up to since "Coven", and you'll see up and coming directors like Dave Gebroe sweat through a grueling day of shooting on "Zombie Honeymoon"(which turned out great).
Bette Davis plays a role in which she could had easily gone over-the-top with, since its a very stubborn and spoiled character but instead she plays her role more humane and realistic, which also keeps her likable.
"Jezebel" isn't even nowhere close in the same league and epic proportions as "Gone with the Wind" and "Jezebel" is a more light and less complicated one, that has a totally different style and breaths a total different atmosphere, not in the least also since "Gone with the Wind" is a movie in color of course.
I loved the show, especially since it zips along pretty quickly.
I am watching this movie now and beside myself at how poor the casting was in this film, it is terribly and terrificly acted by most with maybe the exception of Tina's sister, a virtually unknown actress, maybe the actors have no comedic timing, but Pare specifically makes on camera acting mistakes I haven't seen since on camera acting 101, she is unbelievably plastic and lacks any emotive qualities whatsoever, there are no layers or dimensions in her character structure whatsoever her likability is nil, I'm watching a train wreck by a director who should've taken more care with his film instead of just collecting a paycheck which is what this film looks like
I was lucky to have taped this onto DVD-R from Turner Classic Movies, since it probably won't be released on DVD anytime soon.
Ever since I found these two gems, I've become a fan of R. Crumb's work.
Documentaries, since they are fact and not fiction, logically can tell us more about human nature than fiction films, which can tell us about human nature, but they necessarily teach it through the eyes of the artists who created the work.
I had been reading Zap Comics and it's brethren since the 70s and loved them w/out really knowing why.
I have been a fan of Crumb ever since I advanced beyond Donald Duck and Marvel Comics about 20 years ago (this is not to say that I don't love Donald or Marvel anymore, because I do).
Davis's Julie has a remarkably blind spot about how far womens rights have gone in the age of Millard Fillmore, for it is only four years since the first womens suffrage conference was held in New York State.
Her attraction for Count Axel DeFersen was natural since she had no love for her own husband.
I first saw this excellent and powerful story on television sometime in the late 50's or early 60's, and had not seen it since until I caught it on television more than 40 years later.
They also introduce innovations that have since become clichÃ©s and the hallmark of 'women pictures' everywhere.
Whether this is historically accurate wasn't a concern with me since all I really remembered from school was that she was beheaded, so this shouldn't be a spoiler.
The casting of Norma Shearer in the title role -- one of the perks of being married to Irving Thalberg who had had this movie in production for more than a year before its release in 1938 and was in many ways the person above Louie B. Mayer -- is a bit of an irony since she at the time was considered the Queen of MGM, now its Widow, at the height and end of her acting career.
Unfortunately, those unfair remarks carried great weight since Shearer's movies were unavailable on video and rarely shown on TV.
Eventually, Bronson finds himself risking personal injury from his prey as the authorities close in on him, though they aren't even sure what to do with him since, thanks to him, crime has dropped considerably!
Film is dated (NY has gotten much safer since this came out) but is still powerful.
I think this is nonsense, since if this movie is violent, then what about others like "First Blood", "Commando" or "Rambo" just to name a few?...
Obviously, this should have been produced only once; since the sequels misrepresented its purpose.
The fluffy but pleasant story benefits greatly from the director's touch, since he had the knack of giving significance to little things without taking them or himself too seriously.
I cannot name the magic phenomena which appears to surround it.I first saw it on British TV about four years ago when it first made its impression upon me since which time I have been drawn to it like a magnet for some unexplainable reason.
She has been kind of lost since then but the way she plays totally clueless and still manipulative is really superb.
The comparison with "Gone with the Wind" is inevitable since Julie Marsden and Scarlett O'Hara characters have many characteristics in common.
Malcomb, played by Roosevelt Jones, does come off as effective due to Jones' wooden acting since he is playing a simple but sinister man.
He, of course, goes on some obligatory rampages and since this is a so-called "Blaxploitation" film, you see two ladies' breasts--though it really made no sense at all and was very, very contrived.
The actual Frankenstein plot is moderately altered as well, since the mad doctors (yes, two in this case, black & white brotherly messing with Mother Nature and God's creation together!)
I am also very glad they did, since this shows exactly how to make a G-movie...you use the original Big G himself!
The big guy hasn't looked this good since his initial escapade back in 1954.
In fact, I hadn't been entertained like this since TERROR OF MECHAGODZILLA (Toho; 1975), and despite the movie's MAJOR flaws, GODZILLA 2000: MILLENNIUM is still very entertaining.
His design has been in a rut since 1989, where his design was great, but once they stuck to it, he began to look slapped-together in each new film, but finally, a NEW Godzilla design!
The story has great ideas, and a more "realistic" feel than the previous Godzilla movies since the 90s.
As of 1999, the special effects are probably the best in any Toho Godzilla film since Teruyoshi Nakano's breathtaking work in the 1984 GODZILLA.
The fact is, the world around Godzilla is becoming ever more complicated; the film-makers are pretty savvy about it, but many audiences, although more sophisticated about such matters than they were in the 1960s, clearly feel uncomfortable with even minor renovations in the series, since these frequently reduce Godzilla in stature, in comparison with the legendary city-stomper of old.
"Godzilla 2000," actually completed in 1999 (and was released during the summer of 2000 in America), was the first Toho-backed kaiju-eiga film to receive a major theatrical distribution in the U.S. since 1985.
I saw "Godzilla 2000" at the theater and wasn't disappointed, even though a lot has changed since Toho killed off their iconic monster at the end of 1995's "Godzilla Vs.
I'm 19; I've been a hardcore "G"-fan since I was four years-old and of course, I was quite hesitant about seeing a new "Godzilla" film, being that the Americanized 1998 version wasn't that good.
Of course, since I never really cared for the people in a "Godzilla" movie and those feelings haven't changed, it must be pointed out here that the people have been drastically short-changed in favor of the all-out monster showdown that is the film's climax.
Animal lovers should beware, although not in the UK since it's cut, because there's a ratting scene where a dog attacks some rats.
Though not the epic that GWTW became, it contains certain elements that Selznick undoubtedly incorporated at Tara, since the similarities between the films are striking at times.
Wow, this is a wonderfully-filmed movie that especially looked good since it was one of the first DVDs I purchased a decade ago.
It is unbelievable that this movie has yet to be released on DVD - it was a top 10 favorite the year it was made, and has been re-run on television throughout the years since.
First (unless I missed something), the "sidekick" character (think Ulysses in "Hercules Unchained") had a much smaller role in this one, which is fine with me, since I don't always care much for that stock character.
However, since my grand daughter and my wife watched it over and over for months it was inevitable that I would be exposed to it.
Thereafter, the recruit settles in the Ironbound section of Newark, NJ, and is responsible for many of that area's unsolved murders and missing persons since then.
This is a good point for the movie, since the realism isn't too overwhelming.
I am a big fan of Thora Birch, and liked Steve Buscemi a lot ever since his brilliant "Trees Lounge".
Enid says to him at some stage "ever since my life fell apart you're the only one I can rely on because I know you'll always be here" or something along those lines, where as, this somewhat explains that Enid's entire world is changing, except this one lonesome man at the bus stop but once he says he is leaving this means her entire life is changing.
My best fiend saw it with me too, and we have been a lot closer since then.
Add the revealing Locke-centered flashbacks, which begin with a brilliant misdirection about his "disability" and contain the biggest shock since the bus scene from "Not In Portland", and you have the best of the first 13 Season 3 episodes, along with "Flashes Before Your Eyes".
It has been a long time since we last had some insight into John Locke's character.
So please give all of us a break with this age nonsense.The overall production was well mounted and since the original stories have been done so well by Jeremy Brett, a new pastiche always fun because it is new.
Aparrantly the production team's thinking was since they had made (well, ruined) the best of the Sherlock Holmes stories the previous year (The Hound of the Baskervilles, you know the one, the one where Holmes hardly turns up at all, best my eye!)
The BBC is best at the Holmes stories, and I would love to see another production starring Rupert Everett, who is certainly the best since Jeremy Brett.
In everything he just brings that "umph" that is required whether it's to a hoodlum or a psychotic or a corrupt cop, and in Crime Wave his authority as a presence (six foot five inches) and his pattern of speech play off well against the rest of the usual character actors, save maybe for Charles Bronson since he too is unique even at a young age and creepy character actor Timothy Carey as the man put on watch of Mrs. Lacey.
But in all other instances, I adored Jeremy Brett and both David Burke and Edward Hardwicke for their performances, since I take also take Watson to scrupulous account ever since Nigel Bruce.
As for Timothy Carey's truly amazing display of psychotic tics as the last guy in the world you'd want to leave your wife with Â well, since all his directors maintained Carey was never acting but really WAS like that offscreen as well, we can let that slide.
Secondly, Although it is over 60 years since the horrors were first brought to the attention of the world, there are millions who were not born or know nothing or very little about how the human race can be, and still are, so cruel and evil against its fellow man.
The ending leaves one wondering exactly what was going on, since some things that preceded seemed to never have happened, but overall this is a excellent watch, very well done.
The accent-ually challenged military guy sends him to stop Red Skull - the Italian dude from the beginning of the movie - a bad guy with a really awful case of acne who thinks the concept of jokes about English lessons is the best thing since spaghetti bolognese.
), married and has a seriously hot daughter; and has to cope with the cultural changes of the US since 1943, sort of like in "Austin Powers" only less touching.
I have loved this film since I was a little kid, I would'nt change anything about the story: Steve Rogers applies to be the guinea pig in a US experiment to make super soldiers to help win the second world war.
I hope that it will gain a large international audience, since it deserves it.
Granted, I still admit that I prefer the silent clowns in shorts, because it can be a bit exhausting to watch them in an entire feature, especially since they are often strings of vignettes thrown together and my modern brain prefers to edit out everything that's unnecessary, but some of the joy in these films is found in those very moments.
I'm a huge fan of Jeff Noon's writing but I really don't like the play since it feels much too obvious for what it is.
This was fine since the concert was ending.
*swoon* Oh, what I wouldn't do to go back there, especially since some there that day are gone now.
Sex,slaughter,and sanctity in competent hands has delivered both real and imaginary thrills to audiences since Joshua stomped Jericho flat.
And now after seeing it again (it's been YEARS since I last saw it) I can understand why Leonard Maltin and his cronies would say it "takes a wrong turn in space".
After Dante struck box office gold with Gremlins, nothing else he has done since has achieved the same level of success.
Ive only ever since this on grainy VHS, so please, please Paramount give us a widescreen DVD some time soon!
"Toolbox Murders" is the scariest American film since "The Ring."
He has approached this "exploring the unknown" in several films including "The Funhouse", "Poltergeist", and of course, "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "Toolbox" really brings us back to the classic form of screen terror we have longed for since we traveled to "Salem's Lot", which was also masterfully done by Hooper.
Corpses have been accumulating since the early days of talking movies, but nobody in the area notices the smell?
By the way, since most of these death scenes were heavily trimmed for the R rating, you'll have to check out the DVD for the complete scenes which is definitely worth it.
Certainly worth a look, since it differs greatly from the original.
Some of the gruesomely vicious scenes are almost impossible to forget and seeing a masked maniac use a nail gun to slaughter a naked teenager while he merrily hums away like he's changing a light bulb is a shock tactic has never been used as effectively since.
The Lusman Arms is a run down hotel in Hollywood, which has stood since the early twenties.
I first seen Tarzan Finds a Son when I was quite young and have seen it several times since.
I'm curious has to how the final sequence was suppose to be played since the scene as it stands now is a bit silly with Jane suddenly better.)
Three years have passed since the last installment of TARZAN ESCAPES (1936), which provided enough time for the writers to come up with something original.
Because no marriage ceremony was ever indicated since their union, the rulers of the production code couldn't permit Jane to become pregnant and bear forth a child of her own since Tarzan and Jane were obviously living together.
Revealed as relatives of Boy's deceased parents, they learn the truth of the boy and try to persuade Jane into deciding to giving up the youngster so they can take him back to England where he belongs (especially since he happens to be the heir to several million dollars).
TARZAN FINDS A SON is a grand scale production and the only one in the series set in a time frame of more than the standard months or weeks, in this instance, five years, although the movie itself gives the impression of taking place solely in 1939 instead of from 1934 to the present, especially since Maureen O'Sullivan's 1940s hairstyle is evident throughout, but otherwise, makes little difference to the plot since it's the story and action the viewers come to see.
He must have made a great impression since he would reprise his role seven more times until he outgrew the part by 1947.
by Mr. Aune Sand himself) since I was about 40 years older (then) than the very young female teen-agers who had lined up to buy their copies.
later, when they think (not talk) about the American car which has been driving on dusty American desert roads since the fifties, and it is a mid-sixty car!
If anything, Allen Klein managed to do what nobody else could -- reunite the Beatles, since by about the mid-1970s, Klein had screwed over Ringo, George and John too, and they were all suing him too.
I know plenty of illegal Mexicans, who live since years in the US, own houses, cars and phones and have good paying jobs.
It's been a while since I experienced in the movies, a mother's love for her young child, and vice versa, being the primary focus of the film, especially with one that dealt with distance and longing.
Otherwise for the most parts she's often debating within herself whether it's high time to return to Mexico since her intention and goal seem to slip by every day, given being swindled as we are told, by her previous owner, and of course making sense of the love that a fellow Mexican has for her.
However, when his grandmother dies, Carlitos decides to cross the US/Mexican border with the help of two young Chicanos (America Ferrara and Jesse GarcÃ­a), since doÃ±a Carmen, la coyote (Carmen Salinas), refuses to help him, due to a promise made to Rosario, Carlito's mother, even though she handles an illegal crossing business.
Maria Rojo had a minor role, I hadn't seen anything with her since Danzon and I still have a fan-crush.
An all Canadian affair, appropriately enough since Dottie was a Canadienne.
She has a sweet voice with her Canadian accent and great physical appeal, made even more delightful since she was all natural and not "enhanced" like many of today's starlets.
They don't dwell on that, but there must have been a good reason since she loves the kid and vice-versa.
This was probably the worst movie I have seen since The Arrival.
'Quid Pro Quo' deals with a difficult subject, namely paralysis: Stahl's semi-paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair since involved in a brutal car-accident at age 8, during which he lost both his parents.
Interestingly, Isaac is a paraplegic, confined to a wheelchair since age 8 when he was the survivor of a car crash that killed both his parents.
Stahl plays a public radio reporter confined to a wheelchair since a childhood accident.
The main stars happen to be Irene Dunne and Randolph Scott and you do not want to watch Dunne sing since she is awful and Scott doesn't even try to dance or sing, which is a good thing.
Walker refused to plea bargain since she considered herself to be innocent and devoid of inside information.
Not since Al Jolsen does an actor make fun at a nationality so well by doing it so fake.
Rick Moranis is always the worried little guy and that's OK but Martin is at his best, clowning it up as a Mafia good guy, wearing some of the most outlandish outfits since Jack Nicholson in Prizzi's Honor.
It's their first film together since "Parenthood."
Whether inadvertently flinging an album across the room or swinging spastically at a discotheque, he is a master of slapstick, a gift he has too rarely displayed since.
He even the spirit of Humphrey Bogart act as his adviser when he faces romantic complications since Bogie always knew how to treat his women.
Personally I loved "Supernatural" ever since the pilot, but it's still very encouraging and stimulating to see how the show gets better with each and every episode!
What we have here is a series of slasher murders being investigated by a very angry cop, he's been on leave for a while since his daughter got killed and now he's back and he uses lots of 4-letter words and goes right into ballistic without even working up to it, whew!
In any case, it's fascinating to note how times have changed since the 1930s.
He gets through partners rather quickly too, since they die, become super-powered ghost partners and then get re-incarnated.
Bender: one of the most popular TV characters of all time - an amazing feat since Futurama was mostly a cult favorite rather than mainstream.
Just recently I learned that new episodes have been in the works since mid 07.
Not since I was 10.
I have since forgotten everything after Andy goes into the television, except for a few fuzzy details.
Some good dialogue and well done characters by Astaire, Rogers, and Dunne, who looks as lovely as she ever was and sings the show's more operetta style songs (and thus its best, since we're talking about the great Jerome Kern).
The wires seemed to serve no purpose since they were attached to nothing.
"Standard Operating Procedure" doesn't successfully address all the questions it sets out to answer, but that is hardly a weakness of the film, since it is dealing with a complex, messy situation involving complex, messy people caught up in a complex, messy war.
He was provided the shawl since it was cold and shortly after the photos were taken the wires, which were never connected to any power source, were removed.
But if anything the movie has actually gotten more poignant over the decades since it's creation: We now live in a world where middle eastern fanatics do indeed shape global events & have shown themselves capable of inflicting apocalyptic events.
Having said that, then, there is the dancing of Astaire and Rogers, unmatched by anyone before or since.
The glib answer is that Hitch had no gift for 'period' pieces - witness Under Capricorn, the biggest turkey since the one Scrooge bought for Tiny Tim - but that implies that he had a gift for SOMETHING.
And the zippers in the backs of the monsters were not bothering anyone at the time since it was such a marvelous improvement to have the puppets on the screen speak in real voices.
Nature was against you from the start; everything else has been against you since."
I have been lucky enough to have this fashion parade comedy musical film in my life since the mid 70s when New Zealand TV stations sent all their old 16mm prints to Australia for junking.
Payne was playing such a vile character that his performance seemed a bit forced at times, but I can see why he did this picture since the portrayal is a bit different from most of his roles He's up to the stretch, and should have done more dramatic work and fewer formulaic westerns & cop/investigator parts.
It has been years since I saw it, but it is one of half a dozen films I'm still hassling the DVD shop if it will be available on one.
But then there is an even greater irony inasmuch as Holly too is drawn to Harry; after all they have friends since boyhood.
I first saw it as a 7 year old in the early 50s and, although unable at the time to appreciate its full qualities, I remained strangely moved by it and have been haunted by it ever since.
I have not stopped watching it since.
"The Third Man" is a flawless film of intrigue and suspense, a summit of perfection within the genreÂ It is one of the most literate thrillers ever madeÂ It is superb1y acted by an ensemble working in an understated, effortless styleÂ Its cinematography includes some of the best black-and-white work ever doneÂ Its score of haunting zither music is still remembered, instantly familiar to anyone who ever saw the film, and now thorough1y identified with most people's impressions of ViennaÂ Finally, the direction by Carol Reed is exemplaryÂ Rarely has a motion picture represented the collaboration of so many exceptional talents... "The Third Man" may be the greatest film made in Britain since World War IIÂ   The night city terrain of "The Third Man" is unique: occupied postwar Vienna, baroque, bombed-out, decadent, patrolled by Jeeps containing representatives of the four occupying powers, an American, an Englishman, a Frenchman, and a RussianÂ  Corrupt, world-weary people hang about its fringes: the overly suave Rumanian, Popescu; the frayed violinist, Baron Kurtz; the atheistic collector of Catholic antiquities, Dr. Winkel; Crabbit, the tired head of the Anglo Cultural Center; and Anna Schmidt, the Czechoslovakian girl friend of Harry Lime, an obscure actress with forged papersÂ   Moving among them are three extraordinary principals, Holly Martins, a typical Greene creation; a hack American writer; a used- up second-rater; Colonel Calloway, a Scotland Yard type, chief of British Military Police; and Harry Lime (WeIles), the corrupt two-bit racketeer, a fully immoral, totally unreachable villainÂ   These characters wander through rain-slick night streets, in and out of shabby cafÃ©s, over the rubble of bombed-out buildings, even into a terrain vague dominated by a huge Ferris wheelÂ  The Vienna of "The Third Man" is a vast city that seems emptyÂ Its streets are always damp, and water rushes through a system of sweet-smelling sewers underneathÂ It is a world of slinking cats and biting parrots, of people taking advantage of each other without pityÂ   "The Third Man" meets the test of complexityÂ The characters interact, their stories conflict: A man who is supposed to be dead turns up alive, there is a question of whether two men or a "third man" carried off Lime's "body," there are conspiracies, deceits, and double crossesÂ   Reed owes debts to Fritz Long for some of his ideas: the geometrical shots, the montage of evidence, Welles' whistling, etc., but Reed has his own original visual style, particularly his use of a slightly tilted camera to produce so-called "Chinese angles," employed to project danger, foreboding, a twisted universeÂ He is also capable of providing suspense in the tradition of HitchcockÂ   "The Third Man" is unique in the genre for its realismÂ Despite the complexities of plot, the characters are understandable, dimensional, emotionally genuineÂa tribute to the fine ensemble playing and special, low-keyed acting style that is the cinematic equivalent of Graham Greene's writingÂ  Carol Reed was knighted for his excellence as a British filmmaker, and for a body of work that is notable for its good tasteÂ It is this taste, of course, that works so well in "The Third Man," but which has destroyed some of his other films, such as "Our Man in Havana," which require a certain amount of excess to make them workÂ
But what makes The Third Man so great is its historical commentary (well not really historical since it was commenting on its own time, but to us it is historical).
Its not a sense of remembering 'how good we are' (as it feels in many other 'Classic Album' docos, where the band has long since retired/disbanded), but more of a sense of revisiting 'how good we were'.
And therefore begs the question what has gone wrong since.
I never thought much of these guys before, but I now have a much better appreciation of their work since seeing this video.
And for the first 2/3, things are fine, especially since director Davis and writer Kelly add a twist on the "murder" that's smart and surprising.
But, since only one out of one hundred (at most) of the people seeing this movie have ever seen/remember Dial M for Murder, then logic dictates that 99% of the population will enjoy it considerably more than the 1%.
Emily obviously would not protect Steven at that point since she not only didn't love him anymore but also had a reasonable belief that the thug was hired by her husband to kill her for her inheritance.
Burt Lancaster's best performance since "7 Days in May".
Hard to bring your best effort into the fight since who and what you're fighting and fighting for seems to change weekly.
Joe Unger is who I think gives the best performance as the shavetail lieutenant with all the conventional ideas of war and believes we have got to be with the good guys since we are Americans.
I was in the army from 67-70 (did not go to Vietnam) and have read, written, and watched films about that time ever since.
There is a long time since I have walked out of a movie but this one made it.
I can only assume this was semi-autobiographical, since this movie has no clear ending in sight throughout, and the ending it does bring about for us is clumsy and completely incongruous with the rest of the story.
But of course it's impossible to say this with a 100% certainty, since I haven't seen the 'real' moving full length version of this movie, for the obvious reason.
Enlightenment Guaranteed may seem funny at first but in fact it's very serious and explicitly Buddhist, since it involves two German brothers and their adventures in getting into and out of Japan's Monzen Buddhist monastery.
I expected less, since the series in the late 60's was so lame; but this long, two-part series was pretty damn good.
I'm giving this film a three, since I have seen "A Night to Dismember" and know how bad a film can really get.
Diana, however, when she's not running naked through the wilderness (which is, actually quite often), is fairly adept at fighting back against Mr. Sadistic Big Game Hunter, who seems to be related to Jason, Freddy, & Michael Myers, since he takes a rock in the face, falls off a cliff, and gets run over by a car, only to keep on ticking...well, for a bit, anyway.
And maybe since this is situational mental horror, the movie just might stay in our minds more than the simplistic slasher movies.
To make a personal commentary: the only reason for me as a film critic person since 30 years to write here for no money is the fact I want to push movies I like.
There is a "goof" listed for this film: "A room which has been locked since 1915 contains up-to-date (1935) fixtures".
As the reviewer on IMDb says it confounds your expectations by allowing things and people to survive and for events to unfold differently then you thought... (Read The IMDb comments after you see the film since they give too much away) Basically this is about an old guy who was going to give his fortune away to friends and relatives because his grand daughter can't be found.
Hawks overcomes what could have been stagey picture- since it is based on a play, and feels it at times with its main set at the newspaper office- with what is first a true intuition to how to tell the story without getting in the way of a good conversation; sometimes going in three directions!
The film is also perhaps the perfect example of Hawks' trademarked rapid-fire, overlapping dialogue, which has never been as fast nor as furious anywhere else before or since.
since that film there has been nothing better.
But I must disagree, and I'll also ask if all those Crow 1 / Brandon Lee fans would be so adamant that the first film and that actor were the best thing since sliced bread if Brandon hadn't tragically died at such young age.
I had never seen the Five Satins and they remain in my memory as great performers that I'd enjoy seeing more of, but I haven't heard anything of this great movie since.
If your experience of "limited" animation is "South Park", you can be forgiven for thinking that "limited" is just a polite synonym for "bad", since "South Park" looks crude and awkward and just plain awful even when compressed to fit the tiniest of TV screens.
His grandfather hid the treasure and no one has been able to find it since.
(not children though of course since it is quite violent}.
It is also kind of dry, since the movie takes place only within the walls of S-21, involving only the few survivors of the prison and some of their former jailers.
There's not much to say about this film, since the laughs come from a bunch of simply random elements of the film.
There were a lot of changes since 1962.
Obviously this film doesn't have the budget of a Hollywood blockbuster and the story is most definitely naive, but the very optimism of this film and its lonely dissident cry make it far more interesting to me than anything Hollywood has produced since "V For Vendetta".
And as for this comment: There has since long not been said anything more important in a movie!
This movie was the most unexpectedly wonderful movie I have seen since Forrest Gump.
It is more than a movie to me.I could really relate to Joshua as i also used to think a lot about God at that age partly because i was born in a very religious family.The feelings Joshua goes through in his search for god and how it changes him to a certain extent for eg, when Freddie Waltman-a boy who has bullied Joshua since 3rd grade has to leave school...instead of feeling happy he feels really sad for him... have been narrated on screen beyond words...only a genius could have achieved this.
i've since taped this movie off of cable and i still cry every time i see it.
Flawless directing by Shyamalan and a great score by Edmund Choi that has since been used elsewhere.
-I'm not a fan of Opera since it's bores me to tears but those who do will love the soundtrack on this movie which uses various opera cues that I've never heard and don't really care about.
What I initially thought of as a kiddie flick, I was pleasantly surprised to find 'Wide Awake' so much more (though I should have known better since it was written by the wonderful M. Night 'Sixth Sense' Shymalan).
In a roundabout and murky way, viewers learn that he died and the following birth since perhaps is to symbolize his reincarnation.
Further, even if there was information in the box about the prior marriage, it would never have reached the detail that the boy later disclosed to the widow, and since the boy confronted the widow very shortly after the box was buried, he would not have had time to have read and memorized all the information contained therein.
I like Jerry O'Connell as a TV actor, but can't think of a film he's been in since Stand By Me that I've liked.
While the subject matter is somewhat unoriginal (Games a man must play to land a "perfect woman" and the pros & cons of commitment/marriage), the film has a magnificent script that gives these themes a freshness not seen since Swingers.
Seen with the benefit of hindsight, the story is rather far-fetched, since there really was no serious threat of a German invasion after 1940, but of course those making the movie (and those watching it) didn't have the benefit of hindsight, and so it has to be seen for what it is: a well done bit of movie-making encouraging the English to fight back in case it did happen.
Prequels are always anti-climatic since you know what happens to the main characters later.
I've been a Texas chainsaw fanatic since i saw the original (when i was about 8) and all the sequels obviously tried hard (except the one with Bridget Jones in which was an utter waste of time) but ultimately failed to be worthy of following up such a classic.
I have always loved Al Pacino, ever since seeing his early films in the seventies and early eighties such as Dog Day Afternoon, The Godfather, (parts 1 and 2)And Justice For All, Author!
And is typical stuff with the woman disappointed after finding out that Frank lied, and is predictable since you always know Pacino and Barkin's character will end happily together (and well the detectives found out who the murderer was just out of luck).
Keller & Sherman since he spent $300.00 placing the ad, a beautiful poem that he took a lot of time and effort to write, in the paper and even had a secret apartment in the city that he was paying $500.00 a month for?
I do not know how many times I have seen this movie since the release in the movie theaters, then on VHS and now on DVD.
I have not seen this since "All In the Family" on TV in the late 60's.
Well,let me start by saying I haven't seen so much honesty in a movie since the '70's.
Hats off to the character Ulises and the actor who plays him, since I think his performance was absolutely real, believable, sincere and just superb.
The movie is notable for Balraj Sahni's performance and since it is another of Bimal Roy's movies you can expect only the best.
And ever since have asked people about it but nobody ever heard of it.
I have seen nothing like it, before or since.
and this is, my best Asian horror movie i've ever see since Noriko's dinner table and a tale of two sisters.
I know they are super popular--especially since they seem to be remade so often in the States.
I have to laugh at the arrogance of some of the comments on this and other "horror" films that claim since it didnt scare them the film is NOT SCARY.
It is remarkable that - the longer the time runs since WWII - war films are becoming more realistic and "fair" with the former enemies.
It is of course "sanitized" as far as language and violence are concerned since the Hayes office was still around.
This movie was a chance to make film history by featuring Murphy in his own exciting story, something that's never been done before or since.
But not all characters are female characters since, according to an alleged proverb "these are men whose minds are absorbed by sex."
Perhaps Italy began these a decade or two later than, for instance, Northern European nations, but it got there eventually and in its own special, culturally individual way that can be compared to no other, since Italian men and women are not German or British or Swedish.
The way to play is here: you choose the weapons, the equipments and the men, you can made a plan, and you got to accomplish mission, such as defuse bombs, rescue and escort hostages... you CAN KILL TERRORISTS, OF COURSE, BUT THEY ALSO CAN KILL YOU, OR YOUR TEAM MEMBERS, OR THE HOSTAGES, so you must TOOK CARE... when the character that you're using dies, you get the control of another team member since they're all gone (you loose) or the mission is accomplished (you win), but you also loose if hostages are killed, or the bomb explodes, it depends from the mission.
So one thing that disturbs me about the first part is that it feels like just an introduction to the Bolivian Diaries, and that it by itself could have resulted in a 2 part movie, since there is actually more happening surrounding the Cuban revolution than in the failed Bolivian attempt.
The Sydney Film Festival version sported even more irritants, since eradicated:  A) way too many blue filter shots (poor man's day-for-night, last used in C-grade Westerns);   B) illegible, jittery subtitles yanked off too quickly, supposedly "compensating" for his unremitting Spanish; and  C) no helpful Benicio voice-over at all.
Soderbergh completes his canonization by closing Part One with the victorious Che 200 miles out of Havana and for good reason since it would be difficult for his lead to maintain an ethereal demeanor while ordering mass executions without trial.
I haven't seen many films since 2009 came, three visits to the movie theater before the one to see Che Part One (The Argentine) and of that three visits I had not really entirely pleasant experiences since Bedtime Stories is simply a bad movie, RocknRolla is just OK and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was not bad at all yet was not my cup of tea (certainly to read my entire opinion of those movies you can check my comments!).
And talking about memorable parts the very last scene is marvelous since it resumes how Che was.
How ironic then that his execution has sparked a 'cult of the revolutionary' that has not diminished over the intervening 40 plus years since his death.
He delivers a focused and unwavering performance worthy of a thousand accolades: his finest since '21 Grams'.
'Che' is certainly appropriate since Ernesto "Che" Guevara is in almost every scene.
Yes, but both parts have a lot in common--too much--since both spend a large part of their time following the guerrillas through rough country.
Guerrilla an unmitigated downer since the Bolivian revolt was doomed from the start.
But it's forgivable, since he does it so well Â it is in fact one of the best sequences he ever filmed Â and there's a great twist to it which I won't reveal.
It has an interesting structure, since the bulk of the film is told in flashback before returning to the beginning and then reaching the grand finale.
That being said, since that is exactly what I was looking for - I wasn't disappointed.
I will give a brief synopsis, and this is what I gathered, since my copy has no English subtitles or dubs: A reporter is doing some research on underground sex films.
Howard Vernon provides a further link with the EYES WITHOUT A FACE prototype Â since he played the title role in Jess Franco's THE AWFUL DR. ORLOFF (1961), a character to which actor and director would often return (the last time in FACELESS [1988], a viewing of which followed the next day).
The movie spawned two sequels, a short-lived TV series(which was good), and a 2005 remake starring Billy Bob Thornton which is so-so, since it's a carbon copy of the original.
Walter Matthau, one of Hollywood's greatest curmudgeons, is in fine form as the star of "The Bad News Bears," playing the grousing, beer-swilling coach of a misfit little-league team that has sewn up last place since their formation.
Buttermaker is a has been baseball player and now an alcoholic, he is given the job of a little league coach for the Bears since no other fathers are taking the job.
On a sadder note, I also couldn't help being impressed with how far this culture has regressed since 1976.
I guess we haven't really learned that much since, have we?
Best documentary I have seen on a gay-related issue since "The Times of Harvey Milk".
I would love to see that edited some more, and then an update on what has happened since.
I have always considered myself an activist, especially since I moved to Arkansas but after seeing "Saving Marriage", I see how little I have done.
At first, I was interested in seeing this film since it was named after a series of prints by Hogarth.
I can assure you, firsthand, that David's mother would indeed have been far too frazzled and depressed to carry on a relationship with a man even so patently wonderful as Sam Waterston's character (and I've had a crush on Waterston ever since he played Benedict in "Much Ado About Nothing").
Many critics have dogged this work since its release saying it spent to much time with the writers, when in fact, many millions of fans were clamoring for more back story and conceptual histories of these wonderfully Machiavellian Aliens.
There are also a few plot contrivances and remarkable coincidences which have to be overcome, but it's easy in this case since the rest of the picture works so well - just go with it, or 'key flow', as they say in football.
Elam should have gotten extra pay since everybody and his brother knocks the skinny wild-eyed guy around.
That way, viewer interest is kept up since a new wrinkle might pop up at any moment.
I guess Dona Drake's role was a touch of local color or a favor to somebody since she adds nothing to the plot, but apparently her Mexican girl does sell more than just souvenirs.
Some might consider this a noir film since Payne is trapped by unseen forces through no fault of his own.
They don't know what any of the gang members look like since all of the thieves had to wear masks throughout the planning and execution of the crime.
However, since the boss hired them, he knows them all.
It's weird seeing a documentary about this music, since I can relate so much to some of his experiences and feelings.
I would imagine this scene was often cut in the South since it doesn't directly impact the main plot, but it was fascinating to see.
Donald Duck had been mentionened as an idea since 1931 but this was his first actual appearance.I was introduced to the character mainly by the comicbooks and at a lesser extents by some great shorts as "Commando Duck".Donald is obviously the most interesting character in this short.According to comics continuity he was 14 years old.Not bad for a teen-ager.But this short introduces as to his voice actor"Clarence"Ducky"Nash.Why should Donald's speaking be almost incomprehensible?I usualy hate hearing it.Since his name is Donald a slight Scottish accent would be more acceptable.A nice short but Clarence ruins it for me.I greately preferred Scrooge's voice in Ducktales.
I've always loved Farrah Fawcett, ever since I've seen "The Burning Bed", a couple of months ago I heard that she was going to do a movie for T.V., so I came on the internet and went here to IMDB, when the movie came on I thought it was not the best, but what commercial t.v.
Prepared to give it a mediocre score, partially to just be nice since it contained work from big names like Robert Redford and Ben Kingsley (who's names didn't appear on the credits on the outside of the package) and more.
Redford plays Martin Bishop, who has been on the run from the law since 1969, when his friend Cosmos was caught hacking into some large bank accounts - like the Republican Party's, Richard Nixon's, etc.
Bishop (whose name back then was Brice) was outside the building at the time and has been wanted ever since.
The bad guys have been pitted against the good guys since the beginning of time, but with each passing year, the stakes continue only to escalate.
This is the best caper film since "Topkapi".
I'm a Caltech undergrad, so I have a better feel for Large Number Theory and hacking than the average person, and I have to say, it's about a thousand times more possible than anything technical that Hollywood's churned out since.
Seven years have passed since this movie came out, which is a long time in the gadget world in which this film is based, but none of their equipment or techniques (except a brief glimpse of a now outdated version of Windows but that's REALLY nitpicking) seem out of date; it could still be today.
And Robert Redford has done nothing better since.
Favorite character was probably Victor, but liked Martin Landau and loved seeing Barbara Bain each week (which fed a crush I had on her since the Mission Impossible days).
They do share scenes but there are only lame suggestive remarks from Murphy and Nielsen's character is so devoid of humour that you have a nagging suspicion that she was only cast as some sort of deal with Stallone (Nielsen's hubby at the time), since he was to star in the first movie.
The series writing was, despite the bad press it has often received since, pretty exceptional, although there are a few let downs.
A long time has passed since I last time saw my favourite SciFi programme.
The emphasise of style over content is here for all to see, with the excesses of the 80s for all to see (I'd like to say we have evolved since then but I am really not sure).
That is to say, any audience of its day, since it's now a fascinating freak of unspeakably wretched period cinema, way more fun and thought-provoking for what it gets wrong, than what the same year's highly regarded, and similarly set, "The Hospital" once seemed to get right.
It appears as if all the movie was taken in one shot, since all the characters are genuinely sincere, and they even do some mistakes especially in some 1-1 dialogs.
It's worth watching over and over, since all the dialogs are marvelous and thoughtfully written by Cem Yilmaz, himself.
Unfortunately for me, since I was feeling poorly already, I subjected my eyes and ears to this horrible waste of film.
The trailer I saw on TV looked pretty good but I didn't have much expectation since it was a cable movie.
The junkie obliges, and starts to murder random people who come into the business (that looks more like an abandoned warehouse) where he is working, since everybody in town somehow has a key to the front door.
I would give it a chance since i heard there were a few good gore scenes, and Rachel Rotten and Her only other partner in a sex scene, Rob Rotten were in this.
I have been a Golgo-13 fan ever since I first played "Top Secret Episode: Golgo-13" for the 8-bit NES back in the fall of 1988.
I first saw it on an untranslated VHS tape in 1986 and I've been a staunch supporter ever since, sharing it with as many people as I can convince to give it a chance despite its reputation as a bomb.
and two, since first watching it, I've seen a lot more films in the rubber reality genre, and Identity is nowhere near as mind-bending as many other examples.
Several things in our lives have been "Texas Tragedies" since watching this beauty.
Unfortunately, since his family is wealthy and her's is not, "problems" develop.
since racism, antisemitism and sexism are stupid by itself, the minimal requirement should be that they were presented in a witty way.
Eddie Murphy goes into more of his hilarious improvisations and since Tony Scott is in the director's chair this time around, the action scenes are more elaborate.
"BRAT 2" is the best movie since "BRAT".
Ever since I've had been trying to hunt down a copy of Brat 2.
These two are worth taking a brief look at since their conflict makes up the crux of this intense melodrama.
Without viewing the film a second time, Stephen Boyd's character, I believe, comes closest to acting out a consistent Egalitarian standard since he refuses to sacrifice another without sacrificing himself.
After all, the law, at least as we proclaim it, reflects an egalitarian standard (everyone is equal before the law), and on that basis Power is guilty in some sense of a crime since he has valued some lives over that of others.
In many ways, this film is more involving and enjoyable than similar films such as 'Home Alone' since Dennis is a very sweet, likable character compared with the more cocky and, at times, grating Kevin.
It would have been nice to see more of interactions between Mr Wilson and Dennis since that was always a great focal point of the cartoon series but this film is still a worthy successor.
Which isn't that bad, since it was a modest hit at the box office and audiences of all ages should enjoy this.
I've loved this film since I first saw it.
For whatever reason, this film has been somewhat underrated since its release in the early nineties.
It has stayed with me ever since.
She stole the things from everyone because it gave her a part of them since she didn't make friends with anyone.I can really feel for the Cleo character.
The building at Battery Park, at the tip of Manhattan, has since lost its roof and interior to be returned to its original (now landmarked) form as the actual battery (a fort - "Castle Clinton") which protected New York Harbor in the early 1800's.
Paul Valentine is a friend I've known since grade school and this video was the first I'd seen of him since 1974.
I saw it on TV about two years ago, but since then it hasn't been on and is fairly vague in my mind.
I saw this film a few years ago and since then I have been trying too find a worse film.
I'm assuming that since the way it ended and since there was no explaination that there was plans for a sequel, but I guess that never came about.
Luckily, that never happened since there were already enough bad 80s horror movies by 1986.
It has been at least 12 years or more since I last saw Neon Maniacs.
The exaggeratedly abrupt ending disappoints too, especially since the obvious sequel never got made.
I think the main reason is because since the main characters acted so stupid yet nice, you could kind of relate with them and feel closer to them, which means more laughs.
They think that the gas company is after them since they didn't pay their bill, but is actually the kidnappers of Mary (Holly)'s husband, who were supposed to pick up the money where she left it in the airport terminal.
Vitus faces such a decision, a decision accentuated by the pressures of his parents to capitalize on his gift and the mockery of his fellow students, since he excels in the classroom as well.
And, in a good nod to realism, one soldier eats canned meat that clearly has an American label on it (something Stalin NEVER would have allowed in a film--since he ALONE is why the Russians prevailed, or so it would have been portrayed if the film had been made before his death in 1953).
You'd feel another treating since the early 1990s.
the movie and it's consistency with,the reality of such kind of religion originated community, is marvelous since you feel familiar most of the stages with the man you recognize which is rigidly religious.It is rare and very difficult to create such kind of complicated film especially for a director which had directed only moderate TV series in Turkey.He surpassed the expectation thanks to his talent and observation.Besides director, the casting and performance of the actors is impressive since they really overcame the difficulty of the performing the characters who are rare in community and which differs from society by small details.The way pilot flows is satisfactory but on the other hand,the simplicity of some parts of the movie, especially in final minutes,does not meet the expectation of the audience which expects the ultimate end.The issue director criticize is imagined untouchable for the conservative parts of society.according to me we should congratulate the courageous and objective view of director.it is a good film for whom are open minded and opposing.
I was fascinated by the way Takva engages with contemporary Turkey, a notionally democratic and secular society since the 1920s.
Takva starts off with humble Muharrem, an introverted single man living in Istanbul, being drawn into the inner circle of a Muslim brotherhood he has adhered to ever since his childhood days.
It is a shame as Yam is certainly someone who has come a long way since those Cat III days and one just need to glimpse at recent films like Eye in the Sky and Election for any indication.
The movie has a titillating sexuality (which seems very 1970 but quite un-Lovecraftian but it has been a long time since I've read his stuff) with a few quick almost subliminal nude shots.
second one is the one scene that contains an explosion and where the cgi effects are VERY bad( while that is not important to the plot at all, somehow will affect your impression and visual perceptions since the suspense about around there is great- kind of a "let down" for a few moments).
enough said, i am going in circles on this title since it is a rip-off( there, i said the word again, hehe) and the original score keeps pupping up in my head, the resemblance is just way to great; overwhelming actually even if completely different in details( only Nora Timmer character, the woman, is more developed here in comparison).
I won't spoil the plot, but it's apparent that a lot of time and effort went into this film, and since they don't have the money to drop on the "special effects that can make you forget that there's no plot" concept, there is a lot of time devoted to developing and furthering the storyline.
I feel compelled to comment on this movie, since the other comments presented here must have been made by people involved with the film.
The rather ham-fisted editing further adds to confusion, with sequences ending to suddenly, settings changing without proper establishment, and events being referred to which the audience never saw take place (though, this may be since I saw an incomplete version).
I had not seen this film since its theater release some twenty-eight years ago.
Anyway if your political bents swing towards the Greenpeace crowd than you will rate this a 7 to 10, since I'm on the other end of the political spectrum it gets a 2.
Also visible are occasional film scratches, but it is far superior to anything I have seen since the 70's theatrical release in "Sensurround" or however they spelled it.
Now, I'm not sure how accurate the wags were since Soviet films were never shown here, nor ours there.
Besides Jason Isaac, a very good English actor who, who when asked if he was tough like the sadist on "The Brotherhood" said, no, I'm a little Jew from Liverpool, or words to that effect, and Fionnula Flanagan there was nothing to recommend that show, but Chris Isaak--long since gone.
While it was long since canceled, int won't be soon forgotten.
"Beau Pere" was banned in Ontario when it first came out (the ban has since been lifted).
However, I still couldn't help but feel uncomfortable watching this, especially since Besse was about that age when she made the film and appears bare-breasted several times.
Again, my introduction to foreign films came from the Los Angeles Based "Z" Channel - even with the hundreds of premium channels out there in 2005, I still miss Z for I haven't seen in on American TV since!
The gameplay itself is also far better than the previous games and since the HUD is uncluttered I consider it slightly better than WC IV in that regard (the HUD in IV has a huge gunsight).
It's not that she invented the genre, giving that credit to Lucille Ball, but she embodied it like no one did and no on one has ever since.
The characters are so much more defined and dimensional than any that have been written since; not that there haven't been some able attempts (Murpy Brown and Designing Women come to mind).
The best part of the 2005 version of the DVD is the commentary by Eddie Muller; as a noir expert, he's not afraid to call a turkey a turkey and he has a lot of fun poking fun at the movie and (surprisingly, since Fox paid him) calling it out for what it is.
I won't directly recommend it since I only like to recommend films I love but yeah it is a nice little film!
For all he knows, since thugs are chasing him...hell, he himself may be the mysterious Cravat.
The role is played with subtlety, and some stiffness, by John Hodiak, I think because he is meant to be eternally confused by events (since he remembers nothing) and yet can't show his confusion, so he draws up a blank face.
Too bad a lot of them haven't been heard from since this 12 year-old film.
And since the movie revolves around music and the fact that August is a "prodigy", more effort should have been put into teaching the kid to look like he knew anything about music or conducting.
Why does he even need to go to Julliard since he knows everything already?
This is the worst movie I've seen since "The Love Guru"!
The movie "August Rush" was healing to my soul wounded since early childhood;and again, in my early twenties.
Not since "Strictly Ballroom" have I been so moved by a film.
I have been watching this show since it premiered.
The first few seasons have been great, and although it has faded a little bit since the start, I will continue to watch this show.
If it wasn't for almost every other show on the Comedy Network then this show would be the worst all time, but since they have made even worse shows than this it is saved from the title of "all time worst".
I know that it's tempting, since they show commercials for it every 5 seconds, but please!
The story was unexpected and definitely better the second time around since I was paying attention this time.
I it was hard to tell what was going on around the characters since there were so many close ups.
Even the basic story, since it's one that has been the plot of a few trashy trade paperback gay novels and even the plot of a few trashy 'JO' (since IMDb doesn't like the more precise verbiage) stories in gay male adult magazines, needed more development than it got.
Too much time is also spent with the Izzy character, especially in context with the Senator's wife, since again, there is no pay-off.
And while getting drunk and having coffee is certainly the way for a relationship to begin, there was nothing on screen to justify Noseworthy doing this, especially since they don't end up together in the end.
You would think since he asked him to stay with him in the gym that they would've at lease kept in touch.
The movie is well done, although I think it is hard to watch for most of the people nowadays, since it has that 60's-70's feel to it.
Somebody must have forgotten to inform Avery that he was producing cartoons for children, since there's actually little to laugh at for anybody who isn't yet acquainted with the birds and the bees.
Ever since I found out about "Red Hot Riding Hood", I had been wanting to see it, but I never did.
I have the opening melody as my cellphone ring ever since my Cellphone was able too...;)   There are so many little details, over which discussions can be lead for hours and hours, or pages and pages, and this s one of the best parts about the movie - although it gives an interpretation, it is not finite.
(in another movie called Fever Pitch)) I love the following scenes:  "You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you";  "and when sanctioned by your excellent parents..." dab dab collapsing sweatily against the doorpost while Lizzie rapidly retreats, finishing his speech to himself "I am sure that my proposals will not fail in being... acceptable";  "the Look" as my wife calls it between Darcy and Elizabeth at Pemberley;  the party at Netherfield where most of the Bennets disgrace themselves;  Lady Catherine 'refuses her consent';  Mr Collins' visit to 'condole' with the Bennets;  "for it has been many months since that I have considered her the most handsome woman of my aquaintance" so there!
And that's no easy feat since it's so long!Ohhh but it's worth it:o) The casting is perfect with Colin Firth playing the impossible Mr. Darcy and Jennifer Ehll (sp.
This film has obviously gained a lot of attention since Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill Volume One and Volume 2 came out.
By jingo, this is just one of the best things to come down the pike since the motorcar!
The darndest people turn up in the cast, too, such as Frank Gorshin, Anne Jackson (billed as Madame du Froid, for some reason), PRODUCERS Tony-winner Gary Beach, Susan Egan (our household has loved Egan and her brightly sultry voice since we heard her cartoon voice work in Disney's HERCULES, among others), bandleader Lester Lanin, and Bobby Short, the swankiest saloon singer The Big Apple ever saw (yes, he's involved in at least one of the musical numbers :-)).
Gators are not on the move right after a meal and since gators are from the dingo age.
Now since the Rampart scandal, Rodney King and other incidents nobody can do this anymore.
After seeing "Lady Snowblood", I now have endless respect for Toshiya Fujita's spectacular exploitation classic and actually a little less admiration for QT, since he blindly copied the entire concept of this film and even took over the ingenious narrative structure.
Were shown at the beginning of the movie that Lyles has been suffering from a sever case of claustrophobia since he was in Vietnam but yet he managed to get into the LAPD where, being assigned a deadly weapon, he may very well be put in tight places where his phobia would take over his common sense.
But since it was made on celluloid and not on paper that doesn't appear to count for very much   THE CHOIRBOYS is a mess .
He could also combine some elements from the second game since it has the best story in the franchise but whatever the case I have full faith in Mr. Gans and know he will make another masterpiece that I'll obsess over.
He offers up a comedic/action-hero performance not seen since Bruce Campbell in the Evil Dead trilogy.
Haven't heard Gee anything since the Bradybunch.
Every time I've seen it since, once a year on average, it's made me weep; not many films ever have this effect on me, even once.
25 years have passed since the original airing and upon review, they're still great!
This is the third decade since then and life moves on.
But still, it didn't really bother me since I was enjoying this damn movie so much!
However, Italy has not produced a better piece of film work since....the 1980's.
If the film had just told the story of General Dallaire and his failed peacekeeping mission and then focused on how Rwanda has changed in the decade since the horrific genocide, it would have been a very good documentary.
Danes and Crudup played against each other beautifully on the screen and in real life since they teamed up in real life after this film was finished.
"Shakespeare in Love" has been one of my favourites since its release, but I have to say that "Stage Beauty" totally takes the subject matter up one level, and blows it out of the water!
I've seen it probably 10 times since I was 14 or 15.
And since this was released in the 1980s, our Italian friends threw in a little STAR WARS shtick in the second half for good measure.
This story is visually stunning, but then again, it appears that this was a pre-requisite to make this film since all three short stories are equally good looking.
"Cut" explores the anger of a movie extra whose life has been a miserable existence since birth.
Very few horror films released and made in the US since 1995 can compare to what has been coming out of Asia recently.
But Miike surprised me, since "Box" was entirely different in tone and structure from his famous film "Ichi", and I wasn't expecting anything like this from him.
I agree that "Cut" was one of the most enjoyable horror experiences I have had since High Tension.
If it had been done with more polish and vigor this wash-out could have made for an amusing and enjoyably quirky little horror black comedy, but since it's really bland and slapdash it instead qualifies as a very middling and forgettable cinematic dead end.
Father John runs a church that Maxwell was involved with and member in since he was in prison at San Quentin.
Obviously back then it was more interesting to make a spoof, since there already was an over-production of regular teen slashers, but efficient comedy and genuine horror are two incredibly difficult ingredients to mix into one scenario.
I remember Hutchins because I hadn't really seen him since Merrill's Marauders and Sugarfoot and happened across this in the IMDb.
But a darker or more subtle take could've done it wonders since Fielding has chalked up some jarringly bold pieces in other films.
I am not the biggest screwball comedy fan, since most movies just don't seem to really quite got 'it' and are more or less often too much more of the same and they get drowned by the movie its clever story and low key sentiments.
Perhaps, since it was live and there is no video or film of the original to keep.
I have since dumped the b/f, and changed teams, and am now a huge Jennifer fan.
It is in fact a movie which would have been called a Video Nasty at one time and caters to the demand for Extreme Horror.And since the 70s Horror is in demand more than ever especially the kind about mad doctors who get struck off the register for conducting live autopsies!
Ron Zombie presented a visual and auditory assault on the senses that moved right along and featured an outstanding soundtrack and some of the best special effects I have seen in a horror movie about a family since those rejects in Judge Dredd.
Zombie's directing debut is wonderful, and had some uniqe and unusual touches to make the film that much more bizarre and spooky, such as the split screen effect, I mean I haven't seen that used since the movie Carrie!
Maybe the unrated version is better, but since it's completely unavailable I have no way of knowing.
Now Josie's dad, who has a nasty cheek scar from being bitten by a reanimated turtle brought to life by some crystal that shoots blue rays, has a large picture of Josie on the wall of his office that looks like some sexy 80's model picture, and when you see this keep in mind Josie has been dead since the 50's, ??
She has been a very talented actress since childhood, whose talent can be obscured by her astonishing beauty.
This story, based on a novel by California author Dan Totheroh, could have failed miserably if it had not been cast correctly, since the entire tale hangs on the believability of the girl played by Ida Lupino.
The "'Alien' rip-off" label is a bit of a misnomer, since 'Alien' is itself a rip-off of 'Planet of the Vampires', but accurate in that yes, the plot is basically the same, the setting being a genetic research station on a planet that just happens to also have the exact same rock formation that Captain Kirk fought the Gorn on in the classic 'Star Trek' episode 'Arena'!
As for bible-thumpers who object to sex and violence, they should start with banning the bible since, as this story shows, it is chock full of both.
I have been an RN since 1984, and now work as a nurse practitioner.
It is almost 40 years since I have seen an episode of Julia, but reading the other comments triggered a little memory for me.
Firstly, it is hideously amateurish and fatally miscast with awful, cliched one liners that haven't been heard since Roosevelt was inaugurated President.
NONE of this is talked about, I liked Greta Saachi as Gale Sondergard WHO WAS NOT a major actress, She won here Oscar for her first performance & was in supporting roles ever since, I felt Goldblum was effective as Biberman also a minor writer of films,   as always   jay harris
It's just too bad that the Earl shunned Dearest right off, but I guess living alone and being lonely would take its toll on anyone, especially since his son married against his wishes.
Very, very interesting as well as well made--this British horror film is well worth seeing--especially since it's true!
I reckon that writer/director John Gilling then added some fictional elements to his film, like the characterizations of the main roles, since Hare's persona is almost blackly comical and Dr. Knox' attitude is stubborn and typically obnoxious like nearly every scientist in horror cinema.
This flic will be remembered as a classic for the some of the funniest dead-pan dialogue and gratuitous shots of T&A to fill one of the most absurd plots since "Gymkata".
The mores of suburbia have been fair game for satirists ever since the first suburbs were built, and here Waters is sending up the culture of middle-class conformity which all too often attaches to such places.
While others might have stopped as soon as Turner is caught, Waters keeps the story moving throughout her trial -- which features the most entertaining act of courtroom self-defense since Woody Allen in Bananas.
And another remark: since 6+6+6, 1+8=9 and that corresponds to the 9 circles in Dante's vision of Hell in the Divine Comedy.
The music varies between zany and irritating, which is noteworthy since Hugh is a music teacher.
"Thirty Something" star Ken Olin has certainly had a fascinating career since the series ended.
Robinson has been hiding the truth from himself and his neighbors ever since, concerned only with making a decent living for himself and his family in suburban America.
I found it funny, and I have been watching the show ever since.
After seeing it for the 24th time since I first saw it 5 years ago, on my 13th birthday, I can gladly say that this movie went far and beyond the 80s, and the power and inspiration of the message can be felt every day.
I won't summarize it since it's been summarized many times here, but I will say that it is one of the best coming of age stories for not only adolescents, but anyone.
Very typical Robert Altman style, but definitely more off-beat since it is based on two characters from National Lampoon magazine.
Film-making technique and technology had improved rapidly since 1920.
There is no exposition, no character development, and no visible bonds exist between them except for one couple who don't even have sex on-screen since the movie was only rated PG.
But since this evil is never explained and the summer camp angle isn't ever explored as a setting the result is a null-sum gain.
"Screams of a Winter Night" was made with student actors attending Northwestern State University in Natchitoches,Louisiana,a college that has since been abandoned,the neglected campus becoming a popular teen hang-out.It consists three genuinely spooky stories told by a young campers in an old cabin.The first one is about 'The Moss Point Man',a Yeti-like creature encountered by a local girl and her boyfriend deep in the woods.The second one is about a mute psychopath in an allegedly haunted hotel with the climax somewhat reminding me "The Blair Witch Project".The third story is about a sexually repressed girl turning psycho after an attempted rape.The strange,howling wind is becoming stronger and stronger...Creepy low-budget gem from late 70's without gore and nudity.It has some great scares and surprising twists.8 out of 10.
The text on the back promised an anthology film, and since I have always had a weak spot for those, I gave it a chance.
Nonetheless, this is a surprisingly tense and uncompromised look at touchy subject that's since become familiar, but still merits a look-see.
-he had, after all, been playing them since Marked Woman, Knock On Any Door, etc - but even the multi flashbacks can't really spoil this good old-fashioned 'thick ear' entry.
Of course viewers today aren't going to drop their jaws over the cinematic debut of words that have long since become common in the colloquial lexicon.
Today I have just watched this movie on cable television, since it has not been released on VHS or DVD in Brazil.
But this is probably one of the best send ups of the genre since blazing saddles.
I haven't laughed out loud so much since SHAOLIN SOCCER, yet secretly really caring about what was going to happen to the characters.
If it's true it will be included on the future Beyond the Rocks DVD it will find a whole new audience, which can only be beneficial to Mae Murray, since not a lot of her silent film work seems to be available to the public.
Dorrie seems to have mellowed since Men and Nobody Loves Me, both of which were fresh and delightfully uncharted-water, passionately warm takes on one of her overriding concerns and themes, an exploration and advocacy of an existentialist philosophy of life.
Sci-Fi Channel's business model must have something going for it, since it's survived for years by broadcasting and sometimes even making these cheapie, careless fantasy rip-offs.
As for production value, the filmmakers really didn't care, since they were probably scouring the most recent issue of the Hollywood Reporter for their latest inspiration.
Anyway, are they really indigenous, or just left-over from previous crashes since they speak English as well as their native tongue?
This was his last "hairy" movie for awhile since in PICNIC, LOVE IS A MANY-SPLENDORED THING, RIVER KWAI, etc.
There are more memorable gags in this one film than in any other film he made- or perhaps anyone has made since, and it deservedly won him his first Academy Award at the first ceremony in 1929.
I've been spending a lot of time lately going through and watching all of Chaplin's oldest short comedies that he made for Keystone and Essanay, and with only a few left before I get into the 1920s I decided to jump ahead and watch this one, which is reportedly the last true silent film that Chaplin made, since there were elements of City Lights and especially Modern Times that were clearly moving toward the sound era.
It has always left impression on me since I ever saw it.
Excellent mixing of the suspense and comedy since original tightrope walker had left and The Little Tramp replace him.
Despite this danger, and despite Chaplin's off-screen egotism, the premise plays beautifully, especially since The Little Tramp (though not Chaplin) is such a terrible comedian when he's trying to be one.
The final shot has the little tramp walking away from the woman he loves, alone: never before (or since) have we so sensed Chaplin's true gloominess.
Hundreds of movies have broken this code since the early fifties.
However I was not let down one bit since "Fracture" more than held its own.
The rest of the ensemble was at least adequate and the only one who I was a little disappointed in was Billy Burke since he didn't seem completely convincing.
Walter makes Rosales look like Cary Grant, in fact it was the best psycho act since Steve Ihnat in Madigan.
Four generations of special-effects technology have already passed since J3 was made (maybe more... it was first released in theaters almost twenty-years ago), and the viewer simply can't get over its bad chroma-key mini-sub, cheesy 3-D props, et al.
What amazes me is why Dennis Quaid consented to be in this travesty since he is not that bad of an actor.
I thought that it kept my attention since it did have many strange creatures.
He was marvellously played by the charismatic Robert Lindsay, in his first television role since 'Get Some In!'.
Lindsay may have done other things since, but to me he'll always be 'Wolfie'.
We visit a torture chamber and examine blood stained instruments of torture neatly laid out on tables, then hear two mothers' testaments of unspeakable brutality, so unspeakable that one mother, who watched as her two sons were tortured to death, literally lost the ability to speak coherently, so unspeakable that a little boy whose head was stepped on and father killed by the invading Iraqi army has refused to utter a word since.
There is no storyline to this motion picture since it defines itself as such, - not as a visual derogative of verbal expression but as a free form of expression displayed in sensuous, demanding and touching PICTURES!
Herzog has been making brilliant films since the late '60s, and frankly it's a bit of a pain in the arse keeping up with such a prolific director.
In this case : your true love may walk beside you since a long time without you realizing it.
This film has a comic style and charm that has been unparalleled since.
It is an injustice that Fox has kept this film, along with Wilder's 1975 classic "The Adventure Of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother" on the shelf since the early 80's, having never seen the light of day on DVD.
The other being Carl Reiner's "The One And Only", which Paramount has sat on since the early 80's as well...
While it is frayed about the edges, this classic favorite is one ripe for a DVD restoration...perhaps even a 2-disk director's cut for those of us fans who have BEEN fans since the beginning.
I hadn't seen it since it was first released and couldn't remember it that well.
I enjoyed the first HSM even though I thought I wouldn't since my kids are in college and the Disney Channel is something I rarely watch.
I have to say, I am not usually a fan of sequels, since they are not usually as good as the original.
I admit I wasn't blown away by High School Musical 2's stankocity, especially since they stole the plot from and summer special of Saved by the Bell, (and a word of advice to the writer and producers of HSM2: DON'T GET PLOT IDEAS FROM SUGAR-CRAZED CHILDREN!!!).
I give this movie one star since it is not possible to give it none.
You may think I'm exaggerating, and you might be right, but a movie hasn't dragged like this since the Forty Year Old Virgin.
I had no interest in seeing Bulworth when it was first released, and only gave it a chance on video since virtually every review I'd read recommended it.
).Bulworth appeals to all masses as well since it very intelligently funny with certain scenes that literally will make you laugh out loud!.
Or maybe it would be for you even more, since all it does is attack the political system.
Once his speeches and raps become a success, this is obviously a big problem since he wants to live again ("You should never make life and death situations when feeling suicidal").
Masochistic Irene however refuses to bring out HER knowledge about his affair into the proceedings since she is fighting the divorce.
The ending has to be seen to be believed - especially since it was made in 1934 - so it isn't a pre-coder.
He has been developing his talent since he was a young boy and is definitely one of the best I have seen.
I don't think it has ever been shown on British TV since about 1980, though i know it has been shown at least twice altogether because i remember my dad telling me he had seen it (and giving away the ending!).
Max (Pierce Brosnan) knows he can easily clip Napoleon III and make Lloyd look like a jerk againÂ For him, it's more about the challenge and the alibiÂthat's his work of artÂ But he affirms that the two are a couple of retirees trying to enjoy the island lifeÂ   The gorgeous Lola (Salma Hayek) knows that, with Max, they went out at the top of their game, undefeatedÂ They were great togetherÂ But, now, she feels it is the best time to quitÂ For her, now, the challenge is to find joy in simple things, as a life filled with sunsetsÂ   Lloyd was chasing Max for seven yearsÂever since the first Napoleon Diamond went missingÂ That day, he got to the scene, and took a few shots at the getaway carÂ Next day, a bottle of champagne arrives at FBI Headquarters with a note saying, "Aim for the tires next time."
It has been sometime since I have seen this television movie.
I saw it on TV I guess around the time it was made, and have never seen it since.
When Selena is sent to trial, she makes Dr. Swain to promise that he would never disclose the truth, since she was afraid of the scandal and of hurting her beloved boy-friend.
One character's low-cut dresses and "easy" lifestyle are simply explained away by her admiting it was all to get the boy she loved since she was six to marry her.
Obviously so, since his name stuck in my head over the decades between.
Worst back-word since I read a bad horror story about the mysterious Count Alucard - oh, brother!
This is the worst CGI muck I've seen since the Hulk!
I was looking forward to seeing it, especially since this is the first time the "Fab Five" have been computer animated for a movie.
A good friend of mine recommended this movie to me, since we are both in History at University I thought I would give it a shot.
This drama is very shallow and maybe may interest Americans (and specially New Yorkers), since it mixes historical facts and fiction.
In amongst this diversion there's something of a plot hole since Bill takes the young Amsterdamn under his wing even though he knows who he is .
(Oh yeah, since his legitimate front is as a butcher, he occasionally throws a decent steak their way.)
This was playing at the theater the same time as "The Two Towers"... unfortunately, most of the people in the long line-up went to see "TTT"... they sure missed out, since GONY has more to say in the first 10 minutes than LOTR has to say over 3 hours.
I was in Turkey when the movie was first released however I haven't heard of it until I saw in on DVD, since it possibly was not well advertised due to financial issues but the cast and the plot is really spectacular, and well directed.
It's been a while since I've seen this film but I still remember that it is a good laugh.
I am an enthusiastic of foreign cinema, somebody told me look over southamerica cinema, since Mexican movie-making has gone since time ago down the drain, I was trying to find masterpieces out of Spain, France and Asia.
I have been trying to catch up with this for years...ever since it was barely released...critically slammed...and buried.
i was really looking forward to it since it got votes.
It's been a while since I saw this movie, but I remember being impressed with the performances of both Fess Parker and Jeff Chandler.
I've since heard part of the movie score on a soundtrack CD showcasing the music of Jerome Moross.
It's been nineteen years since I saw it over the airwaves.
It's pretty much unknown in the U.S (American - International Pictures dubbed it into English and released it as "Voyage to the End of the Universe" in 1964; it's been seen here only rarely since then).
Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire, performing together for the first (and only) time since 'Ziegfeld Follies (1946),' light up the screen with their lighthearted theatrics, proving Â at ages 64 and 77, respectively Â that time has done little to dim their talent for entertainment.
It makes you want to go out and rent all the others... and still watch it over again just to revel in Astaire and Kelly being onscreen together for the first time since 'The Babbitt and The Bromide' in ZIEGFELD FOLLIES almost three decades ago.
He also seems to have scripted a larger amount of the film, since the scenes are almost all structured for the delivery of a single joke (which is true of most comedic films).
I'll keep it short and sweet since the movie was just that.
Having been a fan of Christopher Guest since Waiting for Guffman, I was extremely disappointed in his latest "For Your Consideration".
Beats all you ever saw, they've been in trouble with the law since the day they was born.
It can be difficult to endure, since many things in the film fall into the category of "Something I would never do," yet watching it is like seeing a train wreck; chilling and disturbing, but you just can't turn away from it.
Indeed, watching this film showed just how many of our famous and infamous rock stars have passed away since 1970.
It's a big-budget picture for a French film, but it really does feel like the picture started without a script - of any kind - and since they had the crew and the actors they had to film something, anything, but the only thing they could think of was... walking.
But then, I'm a sucker for a good car chase ever since I saw Bullit (1968).
(WARNING: SOME SPOILERS AHEAD) I'd like to vindicate this movie, since many people seem to have disliked it.
Both movies require some sort of "suspension of disbelief on the basic premise, and this is especially difficult for "Second String" since it has NFL license team and all the history behind it.
A scene in an airplane perfectly displays their hatred for one another- but in a way, they are best friends- since they're always around each other, competing, gossiping or nagging.
NUTCRACKER FANTASY was theatrically released in America for a limited time in 1979, but ever since it has become one of those difficult to find anymore movies.
The videotape dates from 1986, and since Robert Englund (who later played Freddy Kreuger) appears in it (albeit briefly, towards the end), the title is probably meant to suggest A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984).
I doubt five years from now, there will be clips of this year's presentation floating around since there were no memorable moments at all to be found here other than Martin Scorsese winning his Oscar for Best Director.
Same goes for Forest Whitaker who did the best speech of the evening, though he of course was also the one that could prepare himself the best, since it almost was a formality for him to pick up the award.
Morricone wasn't too happy in advance that he received this Honorary Award, claiming that it would look like as if his career was over already but nevertheless he seemed emotional and touched by this honor when he stood on the stage, next to his friend and interpretor Clint Eastwood, since Morricone himself (still) doesn't speak a word English.
Just wanted to issue a "heads-up" since I see that there are some "Kate and Aliie" fans reading this site.
"Kate & Allie" filmed at the iconic "Ed Sullivan Theater," which has been home to "Late Show With David Letterman" since 1993.
It has been years since I have seen this on TV.
I won't spoil the story since I think it deserves to be seen, but they managed to give a true picture of very particular yet totally second-rate lives.
The movie started out nice though, since me and my friend have a little gag going around that there are three things that a good movie needs: a helicopter, breast and a midget (preferably one that gets kicked away, or kicks himself in the head).
I was only finishing the movie since I wanted to see if the end was as ridiculous as the rest, and boy it was.
I will admit though that the avalanche scene is quite well done even though it steals footage from the film Avalanche (1999) so I can't give it that much credit since the best sequence in the film was at least in part stolen from another film.
Also, if such a discovery was found, I don't think the U.S. government wouldn't be involved, since such grants for such things are granted by the U.S. of A and since they know everything, I think some agent would be sent to see how their money is spent.
Where's they get them since they left the original three tied up miles south of there?
( sidenote - The "cheesy" dubbing makes Kung-Fu movies BETTER if you don't understand Cantonese or Mandarin, and if you have watched a lot and can understand the nuances of the voice teams{since they used the same general group for like 25 years}.
Basically they help define the characters since Kung-Fu movies generally were always about the same types of characters.)
I feel about the movie the same way I feel about all of the wars the US has been in since WWII.
Every war since then has gotten increasingly more questionable in terms of why we were there and what we were trying to achieve.
Well this show has yet to be released on DVD but since that Deal between Nickoldeon and Amazon.com to release old Nickshows i think this show has a chance of becoming released on DVD.
Which is OK since it's nothing new.
We can feel the irony since the first to the last minute of the movie, and its dark humour mixed with some gore scenes makes it a really dark comedy!
It's almost unique by its madness since we can't find many movies with this kind of roughness.
It's also pretty depressing, since it shows how desperate people lift their spirits through something that doesn't really does anything else for them.
I worked three or four days a week, and since I usually arrived for my shift hours earlier than I needed to...well.
In this since it served its purpose well.
Their ninja skills are very impressive, however, since they manage to kill their opposition without leaving even a trace of blood on the body or their sword.
The Ninja squad is entertaining for several reasons, one is that the Ninja's costumes all have headbands with the word "Ninja" on, it's like they're pointing the obvious to the audience, another thing is that the Ninja's are all white males, no Japaniese Ninja's just white Ninja's which is funny since the Ninja originated from Japan so you'd think they'd have some Ninja's from Japan.
The reason for this is simple, apparently Godfrey and Joespeh Lai found reels of unreleased Hong Kong movies so to make a quick bit if money they shot some Ninja scenes and edited it in to other films then re-dubbed the unreleased movie they was using to make it like it was connected to their Ninja movie, it does make sense since why does the films always have a Ninja plot and a non Ninja plot, wouldn't it just have one plot like American Ninja.
Billy needs to find a job since being a Ninja doesn't qualify as a paying job, it makes you wonder why Billy decided to spend all that time training with Gordon if he's told to get a proper job but again the whole Billy plot was from another movie.
Anyway Billy meets a group of thugs and beats them up and so because of that the kill his mother so Billy decides to get his revenge, Billy also has other problem since his girlfriend's father doesn't like her being with him since "He's a Ninja and a very dangerous man."
The highlight for me is always the final chase seen through the store, especially since Douglass Dumbrille joins in the fun.
I've been a fan of BOTTOM and YOUNG ONES for years, since I was 11 to be exact (Im 20 now!!)
Most other films before and since (until the late 70's early 80's) stereotyped Asian characters as clownish and comical to an absolutely racist degree.
Well i suppose the story could have been interesting, but since there were amateurs involved through the whole movie; from the director to probably the craft service team, this movie shows it.
I would have loved to break this DVD in a million pieces , and test the vacuum, since it was a rental, my super-sucking machine will have to wait.
-I've been listening to movie scores since I was five, and this movie just might have one of the best film music I have ever heard in my 21 year life on this planet you humans call earth.
The Gundams are sent to the sun for destruction since they're no longer needed to maintain the peace.
well I had my mind made up for this movie to be just plain horrible, according to the reviews, but since I had no choice but to buy it I did and wasn't REALLY disappointed.
Anne Hathaway and Kate Hudson play Emma and Liv, two twentysomethings who have been inseparable best friends since childhood.
In Manhattan, the lawyer Liv (Kate Hudson) and the school teacher Emma (Anne Hathaway) have been best friends since their childhood.
I found it pretty good.it's certainly not the movie of the year,but since when a comedy is?The movie is light and there are some funny moments.
Hudson and Hathaway have been friends since childhood.
Let me just say that I have been excited to see this movie since before it was even announced.
Liv (Kate Hudson) and Emma (Anne Hathaway) have been best friends since childhood and both have always dreamed of a gorgeous June wedding at the luxurious Plaza Hotel.
Emma and Liv are best friends who have planned every detail of their weddings since they first witnessed a wedding at the Plaza Hotel.
The blind man's beating heart getting ripped out is the ultimate in gratuity, since it lacks all the significance of Evan pulling out his own heart in Michele Soavi's _La Chiesa_.
In addition to the apathy of the cast, the scriptwriter obviously didn't care too much since this film makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.
But since there was a time when I first saw Fulci's CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD and just dismissed it as B-movie rubbish (Hey now, don't give me that look -- what did I know back then?
You almost feel sorry for him and in that, Lawrence Harvey gives a memorable performance since his role in the Manchurian Candidate.
Of course different doesn't also mean better but in this particular case I didn't mind some of these changes, since the movie obviously still worked out and can be regarded as one that is on par with most of the other Columbo movies and even slightly better than just the average ones.
They might as well speak in Spanish since they already introduced Spanish throughout the whole film.
The game scenes were not as contrived as in the first movie, hardly surprising since some of the clips were straight off real matches.
I guess we did not realize how little we had as graduate students, since we were even able to afford an off-campus apartment!
Then again, of course the Americans would leave him out, since he's a parody of every single angry police chief in American movies.
I'm not kidding when I say that this a remake of the three French films since although the film is mainly a poor remake of the the first film, it lifts sequences from the second and third films.
I'm a huge huge fan of the French films, and for me there was no real point in my seeing this since anything that worked came from the originals.
Heck, after a while, you even grew to like Asten--especially since he mellowed and was less of a paper-pushing bureaucrat in later episodes.
With the amount of technology which we presently have available to us now, it's amazing that a lot of it has only been available since Quincy debuted on television, less than 25 years ago.
She is not afraid of dying, since she believes she provoked the death of her family in a ghetto.
This is Steven Spielberg's best film since "Saving Private Ryan."
Three people have been transformed by some genetic manipulation into seers of the future and their predictions are considered as absolutely infallible since they always seem to agree.
Bottom line, this is the type of picture to see twice, first to get the feel and presence, and the second to clear up any misunderstandings in the plot (or maybe to avoid Scooby Doo and Windtalkers), since this is indeed one of the best pictures of the year and one of Spielberg's best recent pictures.
My esteemed colleague and close friend Christopher Brown (see his brilliant reviews at http://us.imdb.com/CommentsAuthor?625436) points out one of these plot holes in his review of Minority Report, but makes the mistake of suggesting that, given the nature of the precognition and of the crime itself, Anderton's murder should never have been predicted since it did not entail premeditation.
The plot was ridiculous(something skulking around on 2 legs is killing deer and other wildlife on a mountaintop;and now it's moving on to humans...so the forest rangers figure it's gotta be a cougar or wolf, since everyone knows they are bipedal predators, right?!)
Even as an 11-year old I thought Lon Chaney Jr. was an odd choice to play the Dracula role, although I was a Chaney fan since I had seen "The Wolf Man."
In fact it`s somewhat insulting to consider NOT NOW COMRADE a " film " since as one contributer mentioned it`s a stage play .
It's interesting that both this film and "Rear Window" came out in the same year, since the base plot is identical: person witnessess murder through apartment window in opposing apartment and spends rest of movie trying to convince everone else what they saw.
it is very suitable that a python would handle this subject since much of it verges on farcical, if it weren't so utterly horrible.
:)  I thought this film more realistic compared to "The Snake Pit" and other similar films exploring this topic, since the story builds so slowly here, and Joan's character appears normal in the beginning.
We can only hope with the great advances in mental therapy, since 1947 when the movie "Possessed" was made, and psychiatric studies that what Dr. Willard told Dean Graham turned out to be true.
I love how you are able to identify with the character, since right off the bat he give us some vital information about himself.
I expected some decent martial arts action since Bas Rutten is an all-time great fighter (Pancrase, the Ultimate Fighting Championship) and Insonato is also a martial artist herself but this movie can't even deliver that.
But, since the Universal films had a contemporary setting, wasn't he destroyed in the 20th century in this particular universe?
However, in this case having her play some supremely beautiful "goddess" actually works since the film is so often played for laughs and doesn't take itself too seriously--a definite plus in my opinion.
Another cool atmospheric vampire film that's a sequel to Dracula and Dracula's Daughter, but can stand alone since there's no reference to the previous films.
I just got back from the movie not more then 30 minutes ago and I am still in a mood I have not felt since I don't know when..
It's been a while since I last saw this film, as a matter of fact, Pelle SvanslÃ¶s is one of the first films I saw as a child.
The Love Guru may just be the worst movie since Meet The Spartans.
After the first 10 minutes it become obvious that the entire movie would be nothing but massively overused, immature jokes that were never funny in the first place, along with very poorly written dialogue and the most predictable storyline since a cop eating a donut.
In the years since, I've seen TV adaptations and TV broadcasts of stage play versions.
Her star player, Darren Roanoke (Romany Malco), hasn't been performing up to the best of his abilities ever since his wife, Prudence (Meagan Good), left him for the goalie on the rival team - a French player named Jacques "Le Coq" Grande (Justin Timberlake, embarrassing himself here) who is known for his over-sized "manhood" as much as he's known for his talent in the game.
In Chuck Jones' Scaredy Cat, he's Porky Pig's mute pet who, despite many attempts of signaling his master of danger, gets admonished as being delusional since Porky always sees something different.
I saw this movie on SBS (Australia) two years ago and have scanned the TV guide for it to come on again every week since!
This is where I feel the series began to take a dip thanks to TV executives demanding what they think people want, since soon into the second series, the same old routines and gags kept on popping up again and again.
East of Eden doesn't make it since Kazan used less than a third of a towering novel.
Not only this but there was a distinctly unfunny voice-over by the great Tom Baker and the worst laugh track I'd ever heard (since usurped by Hope And Faith's).
Probably the best sketch comedy series to come out of Britain since Monty Python.
It's too bad that there is no rating for the music too since the music by Jiping Zhao is outstanding.
It is a heart warming story but not mushy since the story is fictional, sort of like Mulan which is based on fiction but has its twists and turns and poignant moments also.
Amongst those that I've seen, I was blown away by the quality of storytelling and craft, and had wondered how soon after would I have the chance to watch something from China again, since our local cinemas don't really bring them in for mass consumption.
It's been a long time since I was moved so immensely moved by a single film, and I'm glad that Electric Shadows shone brightly through and cemented its place in my mental list of all time favourite movies.
We understand things will get complicated since Dabing and Ling Ling did not recognize each other when he was smacked with the brick.
This is the first movie Adam Sandler has made since Punch Drunk Love.
I think he owes that to Jack Nicholson's performance, since Jack can carry a film so well he also makes the jokes into perfect cues and great laughs.
It's hard out there for pet detectives, since it's a field that nobody takes too seriously, except Ace, that is.
That player hasn't been seen since.
Of course Carrey has done plenty of better things since this flick, but for commercial purposes, so let's just leave that in the future.
I have not been the same since viewing this film.
The story is based upon the true story of Ernest Gordon (available since 1962 as "Miracle on the River Kwai", "Through the Valley of the Kwai", and "To End All Wars" among other titles) and is adapted by Brian Godawa.
Ever since seeing Aladdin for the first time I wanted to see this movie.
This baffles me, since most of them seem to be returning from the original movie, and the acting from that was much better.
And it can't even be entirely blamed on its direct-to-video status, since the other Aladdin sequel was much better.
It's been one of my five or six favorite films since I was a teenager, but I hadn't seen it in years.
It's pretty crazy, but I like how they are continuing the story between Aladdin and Jasmine and how Aladdin's life has been since the Sultan has invited him to stay within the castle and to love his daughter.
Despite being a vicious and murderous pimp which is the exact opposite part, as the perpetual good guy, he's been playing since then Morgan Freeman's film career took off and never looked back after his chilling performance, as Leo Small/Fast Black, in "Street Smarts".
Freeman hasn't played a role like this before or since, and his best known roles to come after this (including Oscar nominated roles) have consisted of more positive characters with effective leadership skills.
In a role far removed from the calm, authoritative, and wise persona that has been his stock in trade in the years since, he shows his true range, portraying a cunning, ruthless and also intelligent criminal who can come off as genial and welcoming and then turn on a dime and reveal the ugly side lying underneath the smooth exterior.
The proof of this statement lies in the films which Lam has made since returning to Hong Kong: _Full Alert_, _The Suspect_, and this, _Victim_.
Haven't seen it since the late 40's.
I have not seen the movie since, but do wish it would be re-issued so that we old fans could enjoy the music and characters again.
For years I've sought Ultimate Evil, ever since I discovered that Plan 9 not only isn't the worst film ever made, it probably shouldn't make the Bottom 20.
I was a little surprised but I expected them to have a movie like this because they had been open since the dawn of video and the owner bought every movie he could get his hands on.
The guilty party is a mobster named Don Vito, and he's certainly an adversary to be reckoned with as Rico, two years since he was sentenced to jail, is forced to match wits and out everything on the line to get revenge on the vicious Don Vito.
A better title for this movie would be: "The Spatula Rape Rampage," since the butterknife he uses to rape his victims resembles a frosting spatula used in a bakery.
Violent 'pinku' movies are the Far East's offering, and many fans of extreme cinema agree that they rule the roost as far as sexual nastiness is concerned, since almost nothing seems to be 'too taboo' to be portrayed.
Jack The Ripper (a misleading title, if ever there was one, since 'Saucy Jack' is nowhere to be seen!
Fortunately for the studio, this film was not released since they knew it was a bomb and it was later released on cable and video.
Can't argue this is a great film, but it IS funny and that's something Jerry had not been since at least "The Big Mouth" back in 1967.
I'm so glad that, since Michelle's ordeal, legislation has been implemented for tougher sentences.
I am not the biggest screwball comedy fan, since most movies just don't seem to really quite got 'it' and are more or less often too much more of the same and they get drowned by the movie its clever story and low key sentiments.
Also, this film doesn't really make any since at all, and it doesn't try to either.
At risk of going overboard with compliments on the movie, it actually has inspired me to do my own movies full-feature, and I've since been impressed with the Linn brothers' other works.
This film is the proof that a low-budget movie may work, since supported by a good screenplay and excellent casting.
I recently watched this cartoon a 15 years at least since I last saw it and laughed out loud at all the pranks that Bugs pulled out of his hat.
When I read Christina Crawford's tell-all of all Hollywood tell-alls, "Mommie Dearest," I remember her writing about not being able to sit through "Queen Bee," since her mother's character in the movie was just too close to that of the real life Joan Crawford.
The film is drawing-room bitchery, yet with only minimal camp appeal; still, it's hardly enjoyable even on that level since nobody here appears to be having any fun.
Joan Crawford's best role since 1952's "Sudden Fear."
When I first saw it (and every time since), you could literally FEEL the presence of God in the theater.
You can see this movie as "Ringu" meets "Carrie", since this movie story- and character-wise definitely show some similarities to the Brian De Palma horror classic "Carrie", from 1976.
The two men then embark on a journey to find the soldiers, and eventually find Ding Chavez, hiding alone near a jungle stream since his comrades have all been shot or captured.
If you add good actors and tight direction (Noyce knows Jack Ryan and Ford, since he already directed Patriot Games) you can not go wrong, and this flies high.
What a shame, since Disney hasn't made a decent film since Aladdin.
Another disappointment from Yuzna & is it any surprise or coincidence he hasn't directed a film since this & Rottweiler?
I thought that it had to be some professional and experienced people that where part of the team behind this movie, since the sound, the directing and the effects where above average, but why would these people accept such terrible acting and bad storyline?
They also never really resolve the problem since one of the main characters for some reason has the power to stop seeing ghosts bought the book then his grandmother figured out that somebody is putting a spell on them.
but since you see breakdancers in the movie break dancing with a guy who is possessed i don't think this movie was really made to be that much of a serious horror flick.
A few of those ways are really funny, its a long time since we have laughed as much as we did seeing this movie.
We found this particularly amusing since, a half-hour previous to this point, the movie depicted several dozen canvas tents exploding.
Angus' interaction with his granddad (played by George C. Scott in possibly one of his most memorable, though short, roles since "Patton") is very interesting to pay attention.
This disease seems to have contaminated Japan as well now, since I really think Ringu 2 suffers from it.
The film really all centres on the leading man, which isn't surprising since the actor is also the scriptwriter.
Esther is a battered woman and must endure that syndrome--she cannot fully grasp what Philip says to his buddies: "her weak point move me," and how many times is she willing to forego the depth of her own words: "since when do you care what I say."
When he say to Esther that all his sufferings (since their breakup--ha, ha, ha) "must be compensation for what I've been through," the viewer can only say bring on the executioner.
The household staff includes a matronly housekeeper, who has cared for Corey since his youth; a skittish, scatterbrained maid; and an unmarried, impoverished cousin of Harriet, who acts like an unpaid servant.
In a case of Joan's art imitating her life, as well as her life imitating her art, Harriet provides Joan with yet *one* more of those peculiar roles Â roles which must have been written with *only* Joan in mind, since it would be difficult to imagine *any* other actress in this role.
If Rosalind Russell had had this much focus on her in *her* version, *Craig's Wife*, it's hard to imagine if she could have sustained it, since part of Russell's strength was her ability to respond to other characters while seemingly on a course all her own.
I am of the opinion that Abel Ferrara's movies have been steadily declining since "Ms45".
I personally find this movie adorable, since the scenes showing Tuck Pendleton inside of the human body, amazes me until today, seeing all those organs, embryo and even the cells in the veins.
I am not surprised to see that this movie is produced by Steven Spielberg, since the guy has a natural talent to make most of the movies a great success, with incredible stories.
It was a horrible horrible experience since the director was a huge, freakin' idiot who didn't know what he wanted or even how to get it in the instance that he did know what he was aiming for.
Juliet is very similar to Bree since she is the readhead who tried to keep up appearances all the way through the pilot, while Zoe feels like a younger Lynette since she has to struggle with the same issues.
I don't think the storyline was confusing at all since it mostly concentrated on Sadako's life (Derived from Lemonheart) and doesn't really focus on the curse of the video tape.
I can see why many are baffled by the story since the one who directed this is not Nakata Hideo and obviously lingered a bit from the previous adaptations (I guess you might say more on the book than Ringu and Ringu 2.).
This movie was a joke, if I kept on watching it was because my only other option was some Martha Stewart show, and i Can't put up with that since my liver is about to give up on me.
Last night I watched this HBO special since his road material is usually different when he does the big show.
It's hard to engage in adultery since a tricycle doesn't have a back seat.
And since Americans are becoming more dimwitted and righteous, the bulk of them will not laugh at themselves, the purpose of intelligent humor but prefer the sadistic, mean spirited "humor" they see on television (which George satirizes in "The All-Suicide TV Channel") or read in those idiotic emails too many people forward to everyone in their address book with titles like "10 jokes about rag-heads" or "Stop complaining you homeless person".
Probably this is because since this film he's become so type-cast.
But if anything, the influence was the other way around, since Agatha Christie's novel was not published until 1939.
And I don't know my models but it's probably a Mitsubishi since they made it into EVERY Hong Kong action movie in the 80s.
Granted, it's been over 10 years since I've seen it (though I'm downloading it right now... found it on Sharaza, hence my urge to look it up here), but it quickly became the standard all other XXX movies had to live up to, since (most don't hold my interest for more than ten minutes.
But, since this was a first season episode, it may have been filmed before Leonard Nimoy had fully come to understand his character and the proper way to play him, (for example, he was still speaking with that put-on British accent like when he pronounces the word command as "commond").
Tom Magnum played wonderfully by Tom Selleck who has since moved back to Southern California and created his own paradise by having a ranch with wife and daughter beside him.
when by chance I saw an episode I now recognize as a third season one; I was puzzled then since I realized I was missing something from the life's stories of these intriguing characters: it was like intruding in someone else's life, more than a pi standard TV-movie... That's it: I believe you're hooked by the believable interaction of the main characters, their likes and dislikes; some episodes are quite 'poor' and unbelievable, but never awful; other episodes are more complex and well shot; but almost always you'll have some fun with them; and finally Magnum's off screen voice is capturing your attention, and make you another close friend worth of his confidence... After so many years, one day I just missed that feeling and I discovered the two first seasons were published on DVD, so now, after watching them, I feel reassured of not being a 'stranger' in Magnum's world anymore....
Although I can't correlate the two events, when Magnum went off air in 1988 I stopped watching network television and haven't watched it since.
This was Tom Selleck's big break, he was a soap opera star before "Magnum" and even a contestant on "The Dating Game" ... "Magnum" is what put Tom Selleck on the superstar map, and since "Magnum" he has been tremendously successful as a big box office movie star!!
I've since become rather obsessed with my "three 80's M's" -- Matlock, M*A*S*H and Magnum.
And since this was made for TV, you might get the idea...: No gore and nudity either.
I've not read or taken any mythology classes since college (a long time ago) but remembered many of the stories/myths from my undergraduate days.
A progressive people's movement, which already exists, although pathetically fragmented since 9/11, needs to come together and at the center of it needs to be the will of the Native American, even spearheaded and centered around them.
I have since bought this film and on a bigger-than-computer screen it was truly wonderful.
I really liked this one since there was an all star cast.
How it ever got by the ABC execs I'll never know, since it's just miles ahead of the usual garbage they present.
It's been a number of years since I've connected with an Australian film to the extent that I did with THE BLACK BALLOON.
'Darjeeling's' trio of obviously privileged sons have been estranged for a year, since their father's deathÂwhich their mother, Patricia (Angelica Houston), now in a convent near the Himalayas, chose not even to attend.
'Hotel Chevalier' is a bridge into the full-length film, and was also a way for Schwartzman to readjust to working with Anderson as an actor after the long interlude since 'Rushmore.'
It's a long time since I've seen something as laboured as this.
Wilson's character has organized a spiritual journey through India with his brothers who have not spoken to one other since their father's funeral a year ago.
Although it's been years since I saw this film, and it's not available anywhere in the States (although I did see a copy in a Sydney video rental place...anyone wanna sell me one?)
He's not a good guy, in spite of the fact that the movie half-heartedly attempts to make him seem so, since he is trying to get money together for his parents to replace their home, which got blown away by a tornado.
It soon comes unglued, screwing with chronology, and deploying some of the most jarring, disconcerting jumpcuts I've seen since Godard.
Leading man Adrian Grenier has gotten handsomer since he made this movie; he grew into his looks.
I chose to comment on the last movie since it's the one not deserving the rating it has here.
I was though pleasantly surprised not only was it a good film but Dracula was amazing.I was glad to see that they had kept most of the same cast as they all are amazingly talented actors and actresses.I was glad to see DG (I cant spell his actual name) back and as brooding as ever, he is defiantly my favourite character in the film and has been ever since i saw ascension.
This baby oozes with style not seen in a vampire flick since 1998's VAMPIRES, one of my top ten favorite vampire pictures of all time.
Democrats who watch this movie will get bored, since it's the same rhetoric we've already heard.
The musical choices, the actual score, is repetitive and doesn't do much to add to the picture, which is a shame since Moore is usually creative and inspired with his choice in music, and only some moments of his brand of "gotcha" humor creeps in.
It's the right choice to offer it up online for free or as cheap as possible on DVD, since those who want it can get it and those who definitely don't can pass on by... unless their curiosity is peaked somehow.
I haven't seen this film since it came out in 1971; my mouth dropped open.
I've loved this movie ever since I saw it when it came out.
But since it effectively doubles the Sadako quotient, why quibble?
Even though, since... i've seen hundreds of gory films, but this one is still implanted in my head, possibly because it was my first.
This angered Lancaster, but the rich guy said that he could care less since the dead man was Black.
Now I may be biased since I myself am a ham, but I am very glad to see this fun hobby portrayed in a movie.
This is Quaid's best after his early bloom and nothing he's done since can compare with it.
It has been such a long time since a movie was made that warmed your heart, while keeping you at the edge of your seat.
But those are overly generous comparisons, since at least the first hour of Ring 0 has little of the suspense, style or directorial panache of either.
Ten Inch Hero may be one of the strangest titles to grace the screen since Eat, Drink, Man, Woman but at its heart is a tale of the meaning of love and individuality.
The few "twists" I expected since the beginning, I just didn't believe the script was really so dumb that it would actually go for ALL these clichÃ©.
And sometimes you just got an overwhelming since of happiness.
It certainly can't be Ackles' leading man looks; especially since most of the audience had no clue who he was.
I watched this movie again last week (I've watched Leo ten time since I bought it) and still feel strongly that this a great movie that ought to rank as a classic.
I hadn't seen Elisabeth Shue in anything really good lately, and I hadn't seen Joseph Fiennes in anything since Shakespeare In Love, so I didn't have high hopes for this movie.
Must have been 16 years ago since I saw this movie for the very first time, as a kid just 10 years old.
It's been several years since I saw this film, but as low-budget as it is, I remember it was still kinda fun to watch.
Although times change and mores shift, mankind hasn't changed much in the 2000 years since Petronius wrote The Satyricon.
Fellini once said that he loved decadence much more than sound-mindedness, since the former was so much more rich in its imagery and colors.
The film did drag here and there (certainly with Fellini letting some vignettes last longer than they should) but overall, the cumulative effect of all the stories creates a unique visceral experience that's seldom seen, back then or since.
And life has never been the same ever since.
My brother and I have been watching and re-watching Twilight Zones since they first an live back in the early 60's.
I don't remember exactly my age when I watched it for the first time(I think I was 11) but since the time I watched for the first time until now I cannot be tired of the story!
After being thoroughly excited to see this film ever since I first caught wind of it, I left the theatre in a state of bewilderment.
It is perhaps the first time since Andy Serkis' rendition of Gollum in The Lord of the Rings, that great acting has eclipsed terrific special effects.
"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" is quite possibly my favourite film of the last 5 years (not since Sofia Coppola's "Lost In Translation" a contemporary film had moved me so much).
Instead this is his most low-key performance since Meet Joe Black, in which he played Death, who was really just a nice young man curious about the world.
Getting drunk; cheating, no matter what, in order to win; girls taking off their tops; and the usual round of bad guys, who as always never win, since we all want to see the underdog win.
But overall, the movie was too formulaic, but that's okay, since sometimes movie-goers just want to watch something that does not require too many brain cells.
Definitely one of the true 'must see' films of the nineties, not only because it was the first to fully establish John Woo as the master of action movies and Chow Yun Fat as a superstar, but because it has had a massive influence on every action movie made since, and is easily one of, if not the best action movies ever.
The hospital sequence, which lasts nearly an hour, is simply an amazing piece of action choreography, which tops anything done before or since.
And Woo's film-making skill is on the same level as Cameron's since he can make films that have great eye-candy action and a film that makes us identify and care about its characters.
And we also have some suspense and emotional to along with the action since the hospital scene is very tense with all the babies in danger when Tequila tries to save them all while narrowly dodging bullets.
), therefore the viewer does not get tired, since most of the plot happens in the interior of the Benson's house.
The theatre troupe has a bad feeling about Sadako, as most of them have been experiencing the same disturbing dream about her, where they see her next to a well, and a certain air of doom has clouded the theatre since her arrival.
However, as it stands, this has been the last good adventure game to come out since Monkey Island 3.
Additionally the skip-feature is also annoying since it not only skips actions but dialogue as well and the feature should have been implemented a lot better.
I don't blame him; this is the film world where even since this period - around 1920 - marriage is always trivialized and people are always lying.
He must have been used to pain: as the star of an act renowned as the roughest in vaudeville, he'd been "taking it like a man" ever since he was a toddler.
In fact, the evident workmanship on display serves to heighten its effectiveness, since the visible seams lend a sense of unease and unpredictability that accentuates the central character's uncertainty about his personal values, which is the key subject at hand.
A shame, because it's the type of storytelling that I sorely miss and that has been largely absent in cinema since the early 70s.
Scorsese has come a long way since, having honed his craft to a point where he is able to engross his audience in a story without hiding, and the go-for-broke energy of his style is actually what makes his films so ceaselessly enthralling.
It is strange that he tells her the story because she has been a part of his life since childhood.
The role written for Teresa Wright by her husband Niven Busch is pretty much impossible to pull off credibly, since she starts as an open, gentle, loving girl and suddenly morphs into a cold, hate-filled avenger, only to change back again just as abruptly.
However you must be careful if food or drink is made part of the experience since choking and projectile fluids could be a problem.
I have watched all of Red Dwarf many times since I was little and always found it funny especially series 4-6.
It is hard to believe it is just over twenty years since 'Red Dwarf' blasted onto our screens.
With such a strong cast and production crew, the show attained a peak of perfection unseen in British comedy for years previously - and some would say, not since.
It is now ten years since the transmission of Season Eight.
I would like to stop here, but since IMDb requires 10 lines of text in every comment, here goes...
And since sci-fi comedy series has not been done a lot, I guess there is something new here after all - so I give it a 3.
You could relate to all characters (all the actors deserve the highest praise), and although there were plenty of plot holes, and continuity problems, there was a classic blend of good story lines, mixed with classic British-style humour.............it was unlike anything else before or since.
Basically it seemed like someone had pressed the show's self destruct button, and its never been the same since.
"Mauvais genres " is a return to form for Girod.He has never been so nefarious since his debut.Two actors give stunning performances:Robinson Stevenin plays a transvestite ,a part so difficult -he is on the screen from the beginning to the end- it's a miracle he could pull it off so brilliantly.But Richard Bohringer's cop is even more impressive:his character speaks in a croaking voice ,close to a whisper.Meava the transsexual is probably the most humane character in the whole movie.
**SPOILERS** Experiencing nightmares walking in her sleep and missing time since she was 4 years old Judith English's, Markie Post, teenage daughter Katie,Candace Cmeron, is now going through the same things!
The made for TV movie "Visitors of the Night" explores the modern day phenomena of alien abductions that has, since the first reported case back in 1961 involving Betty and Barney Hill, gone from dime store novel material to being taken seriously by millions of Americans as well as tens of millions of people all over he world.
I haven't felt this way since i was a kid, it emulated all my favourite childhood films ALIEN, HIGHLANDER, PREDATOR....with a touch of WILLOW  So SO good!
I had been interested in seeing Outlander ever since I heard it described as a fantasy re-telling of the Beowulf legend.
The story is basically a sci-fi plot but since the lead character's space ship crashes in the Iron Age, among Vikings, you can understand that most of the movie takes place with Viking themes and scenery.
the best performance was given by the sly pi, and since he wasn't a central character - this gives you an indication of the films quality.
The movie is in Spanish with English subtitles, but there is actually little Spanish at all, since Cabeza de Vaca is often alone or isolated, with no one to speak to.
I saw this film when it came out in 1984, and since then, have been unable to forget it.
For starters, these teenagers believe that the world revolves around them, and that they are the best thing since sliced bread.
What this beautifully bad baby lacks in credibility and originality (plenty, to be brutally honest) it more than compensates for in sheer riotous absurdity, tasty all-out cheesiness (the shark looks laughably fake throughout), and, since this is an Italian fright feature, the expected in-your-face graphic and unflinching abundance of gory carnage (one poor lass has a leg bitten off by the shark).
Interestingly, he even saw fit to steal from himself Â since JONATHAN OF THE BEARS (1993) bears {sic} more than a cursory nod to the latter; another thing he was prone to doing was reviving popular mythical figures, such as the disastrous SINBAD OF THE SEVEN SEAS (1989) and the TV mini-series THE RETURN OF SANDOKAN (1996; which I recently acquired but have yet to check out) Â though, in all fairness, he did muster a fairly successful re-imagining of Homer's "The Illiad" in gangland terms with the little-known spoof HECTOR THE MIGHTY (1971).
It's been a while since I've seen a good bizarre flick like this, it's right up there with Visitor Q and Penetration Angst.
The elements that fans have come to expect from an FF game are all here to be seen, although they are in an infancy stage since this is the first game.
The ending is anticlimactic since there is no tension when one party is the living Buddha (or something like that).
A last note: "A Touch of Zen" may rub fans of the usual wuxiapian the wrong way, since its artistic ambitions are a bit more personal than regaling the audience-as-king.
The ending will strike you with a sense of awe that you have not felt since "2001", that's how good it is.
Once I saw King Hu's martial arts masterpiece A Touch of Zen I was rather surprised since it exceeded in almost every level.
The director really knew what he was doing since all the important scenes have that special quality to them that can only be acquired when superb direction, believable acting and a great sense of situation come together.
The use of light is especially worth mentioning since it is so well done.
And indeed, the fighting sequences are brilliantly done - there definitely has been no progress since 1969 - but there is not only that.
I haven't felt this way about a movie since I saw The Seventh Seal.
The model this utilizes has been used other times(since), recently in the Generals game in the C&C series.
I think that a filmmaker who decides to make a slasher flick has two choices : having a lot of faith on the screenplay and to trust that he found a new perspective for making that formula interesting or making a completely mercenary film which is full of clichÃ©s for finally making a cheap movie.The crappy film Steel Trap belongs to the second style.The slasher films became popular thanks to Halloween (1978) and Friday the 13th and,since of that,we have seen hundred of movies with similar structures,characters and story.The details change,so every slasher movie tries to be different by using a curious location or a new mask,just to mention two examples.I do not pretend to find a lot of originality on slasher films but what I pretend to find is even the minimum effort for giving the known formula a special element,making it interesting and entertaining.Steel Trap could have chosen that difficult point but,instead of risking,director and co-screenwriter Luis CÃ¡mara and co-screenwriter Gabrielle Galanter wasted that opportunity so Steel Trap is a tedious experience with an extremely weak screenplay,repulsive characters,a boring and generic killer without any personality and a forced and arbitrary ending.I usually do not like to criticize an independent film from my favourite genre but,even on some incompetent works (like Return to Sleepaway Camp),I appreciate some energy and enthusiasm which on some way compensate some fails of the movie.But Steel Trap does not even have that.Plus,to add more negative things,CÃ¡mara's direction is completely insipid.In other words,it seems nobody involved on this movie was really interested on it.The characters are so repulsive that I was glad when the killer started to kill them.Steel Trap is a very crappy film.This is one of that movies in which I feel I really lost the time with it and that's the worst sin a movie can make.If you wanna see a very good modern slasher flick,I recommend you the Norwegian movie Fritt Vilt.Skip Steel Trap,a very bad horror film.
The first time I saw Richards was in the 1997 sci/fi epic "Starship Troopers" and since then she has appeared in "Wild Things", "Drop Dead Gorgeous", and the recent James Bond film "The World Is Not Enough".
The title seems throughout the film to be rather ironic, since most of the situations they encounter, such as being cheated at a snack bar, are far from wonderful.
This seems like that sort of material but since I don't read those I can't be sure.
Overall Score (Not an average): 8 - Previews of this movie definitely got me interested and its been a good while since something totally new and different came along.
After a number of outrageous, preposterous statements, he got progressively more contentious and finally loudly contended that all the scientific advances since the birth of Christ were a product of "western Christian civilization."
Suicides abound, and children have long since been killed or shipped away from the ghetto.
Good cinematography, If you are making a film portraying the emotion of hope , always there will be a difference in the way different people look at it, since things are relative to different people depending on their thought process.
Even the much talked about sex scenes start to get boring, since they are so gratuitous and repetitive.
Jakob has to make up information since no one believes he doesn&#8217;t have a radio and the information brings the Jew's hope.
I think he has come a long way since Mork and Mindy.
I was completely stunned at how well Robin Williams pulled off more serious dramatic roles, since he's much more well-known for high-energy comedy.
But his roles as the bad guy in movies like Insomnia or, even better, One Hour Photo display the extent of his acting abilities, since he is able to pull off such different characters so well.
Jakob, first and foremost, is absolutely terrified that word will reach the Nazis who will execute him if they discover he has a radio (whether he really has it or not), yet at the same time he can't let it get out within the ghetto that he DOESN'T have a radio, because since the whole rumor began the rampant suicides have completely ceased.
Obviously, holocaust movies are nothing new, and different depictions of the holocaust have been especially in the spotlight since Roberto Benigni made a holocaust movie called Life Is Beautiful in 1997, at least half of which was a comedy.
The script would have benefited from more externalization of Michael since his reticence obstructs our ability to fully empathize.
This film really starts, though, as a drama, telling us the story of Sadako in a very linear fashion (which, deliciously, has become the more difficult and confusing path to take, since we already know the end of the story).
I would love to see it again, but to date I have never seen it on TV since it originally aired in the 60's.
I was only about 13 when I saw it and have never been able to view it since then.
It is not the best recording, but since this is probably the only version I will ever be able to enjoy, it is priceless.
Their "liberation," realized by blindfolding a guy and making him wear a chicken hat (since nothing else really happened) is far overshadowed by the graphic scenes of not one, but two of the three heroines being raped.
we've seen a couple of good ones since "shiri" came along.
I don't know, since I couldn't follow for longer than the first couple of minutes.
Notice that you can actually see the bullets making holes in walls (you don't even see that in most Hollywood movies since they seem to think bullets will just bounce off brick-walls...).
It only works distracting, since we never really get to care about any of those characters and are only interested in the faith, antics and silly situations the two boys get themselves into.
At least twice, there's a twist and I have not been that thrown from a movie since 'Usual Suspects' The Director did a great job both with the film and the screenplay, which I think was brilliant.
I've watched it another 10 times since and it's still as awesome as ever.
Bill Sargent had the idea of filming Pryor's act, but since most of the industry thought it would flop, they had trouble getting anyone to distribute it, so a few mavericks in the industry distributed it themselves.
Pryor is a comedic genius, and you can see his influence in every comedian since.
And since I am a stringent critic, I think the movie was a home run all the way.
this is a beautiful and amazing work by SLB .I rate this as the best movie of SLB as iv being a fan of his movies since his debut with hamoshi each and every movie is different from one another and from all other movies made in bollywood .. when he remade decdas many tried their hands with umrao jaan , don and sholay but no one succeeded becos its not that everyone can make a great story into a great movie.as for the time its only SLB who have done this.
Ever since I was turned on to Mr. Bhansali's work with "Black" - and later watched"Devdas" - I have thought of him as the modern day, Hindi film industry's answer to Luchino Visconti.
Don't hesitate to have high expectations since this one is made to beat them.
I didn't notice since I was so involved.
In the end, I took what seemed like the first breath since the opening of the film.
I love the music and the plot.It's not long, and since it's in sections, can easily hold a child's attention.
You will like this game the most if you have played the previous three, since there are a lot of flashbacks, and characters from the old games in this one, so you will miss out on a lot of the jokes and story if you haven't played them.
(I was fortunate enough to find a copy of it on vinyl and I have been a happy person ever since.)
It's pretty much of a cult item since the songs were done by 10CC (Gee, aren't WE dating ourselves with even KNOWING about 10CC) but the songs are prett good in the context on the story (especially the song that Kit Mambo and Rene Fromage run to)  The voices are mostly provided by Billy Crystal and Gilda Radner, which adds to the semi-cult status of the full-length version.
They were easily the most fun and interesting games I'd ever played, especially since I was used to the whole "Sierra" theme and didn't really know what to expect.
I didn't mind it too much for using inventory, but simple commands became a bit difficult since you couldn't directly click on something - you might have to turn several times to get it right - and the walking style took a lot of getting used to!
The leading lady, in particular, is ill-suited for the role, one of the most annoying characters ever, and the worst female performance since Maria Putillo in "Godzilla" (1998).
At some point, this porcupine personality girl meets one of the CIA agents who is hunting her down and they become instant pals and the CIA agent immediately turns against his boss, especially since Ms. Porcupine is the most abrasive leading lady short of Martina Navritolova.
I haven't watched a 'horror' movie like this and doubled over with unintentional laughter since the 1980's!
It was a product of the times and can't be completely ignored just because it makes people uncomfortable--especially since this is such a super-important film to our film history.
This is especially true since this short pre-dates Jolson's performance in the seminal film "The Jazz Singer".
It has stayed with me since I saw it on Masterpiece Theatre in the '80s.
I've only seen it one more time since then, and that's not nearly enough.
In testimony to this films lasting effect, it has been over 5 years since I last saw this on tape and I remember it this well.
Although I don't think that I have seen this movie since 1973.
I have been haunted by this movie ever since I saw it at age 8.
I have only seen it repeated once since then,and that was several years ago while living here (in New York).
I thought this movie was excellent.I have been looking for it for a long time, since it has not been on TV.
I was always curious as to what happened to both of them since this was a true story.
Like so many others, I only saw it once, and I have since scoured everywhere looking for a personal copy to keep.
It has been over thirty years since I first saw this movie and I still remember its effect on me.
She obviously spent a lot of time on them, since the discs are really well done.
It's hard to believe that 10+ years have elapsed since the show ended....  We love(d) various other police shows such as Homicide and we're also devoted viewers of Law & Order and Law & Order: SVU, but *nothing* can compare to High Incident.
It has since become a cult classic.
Many clichÃ©d (and I don't say this to be mean) elements are brought into play, although since this is Sweden the "forbidden" pleasures are more in the perception of the American movie goer.
Which is hugely liberating to say the least since i've seen that A-list in what feels like a hundred disappointing movies already.
I believe that films should stand on their own two feet and not be compared to previous works, but since Nicholas Ray was so clearly trying to recapture the magic of his astonishing debut THEY LIVE BY NIGHT, it's hard not to compare the two; after all the love story between Pretty Boy and Pretty Girl directly parallels Bowie and Keechie's relationship.
I think it's worth examining some of each since the film does feature the legendary Bogart and perhaps the fastest rising young director of the time, Nicholas Ray.
Too bad also that the courtroom scenes are prolonged (probably to accommodate Bogart's starring role), since they amount to another key flaw.
That's not surprising since no one was better at bringing out the touching side of romantic love than Ray ("They Live by Night" {1947} or "Rebel Without a Cause" {1955}).
Andrew feels that he owes him at least that since he holds himself responsible for the violent life that Nick had chosen years earlier.
The Trial of the Incredible Hulk should have been called, Daredevil, guest starring the Incredible Hulk, since the movie focused way too heavily on its guest star, Matt Murdock alias Dardevil (The Bionic Showdown reunion movie from that same year did the very same thing).
What we in the audience know, and Templeton eventually figures out, is that it's not her that has become anything, it is him who has been changed by the decades that have passed since the last time they saw each other.
Its tempting to say this is not a run-of-the-mill Twilight Zone episode, but actually, none of them were, so I guess my point is that this one stands out for reasons one might not expect, and since I don't want to write any spoilers here, I'll leave it for you to watch and see for yourselves.
I had been watching her (and being annoyed by her) on TV since I moved to L.A. in 1989.
However, since "Chosen Survivors" isn't only about bat attacks, there's more to hold our interest.
There's something about BNO that has stuck with me since I first saw it in the early nineties.
It has a natural funniness that I've just not seen on anything since - it just didn't try too hard, it was just that funny.
sounded interesting at least, and since i'm Canadian, thought i would catch a movie from home...  as the credits started rolling i was pleasantly surprised at how many names i knew attached to this film!
Fitzgerald called this version "the director's cut" since his Canadian distributor previously showed a much different version which cut several scenes, and jumbled the stories together.
Daniels has skills but still suffers from that most odious action film clichÃ© of bad acting, true the writing and direction can be some of the culprit but since most of the actors in the piece suffer the same affliction we'll strike it up to 'group effort'.
Harris, however, has obviously matured - in more ways than one - since his days as Doogie Howser.
Goldie Hawn gives another one of her many funny film performances here as a girls high school track coach who's always dreaming about coaching football since she grew up on the sport.
There's not much originality in "Wildcats" but since it's alot of fun so what.
The underdog movie has been an American staple since the beginning of movie history.
I don't know how many times I've seen it since then, but it always gives my heart a lift and I leave the theatre (it must be seen on a large screen)with a happy face.
), or the section of children, which should be a topic that could at least cover a lot more of the film, especially since the filmmakers obviously want to leave it as something of a climax...so to speak.
This is quite ironic since these conservative "gentleman"are the one's who've lambasted the liberal left for its unruly and inappropriate support on free speech when referring to the word f*ck.
The ships captain asks Dick Berry if he's sure he wants to return the criminal to Earth for trial since it will be 20 years before they return to Earth, and all the witnesses will be either old or dead.
The acting was great, Gabrielle Anwar, who has just vanished since her star turn in the Al Pacino 'hoo ha' movie, and I have always wondered what happened to her, but she is great and still looks beautiful, but she can really act.
Movies have changed in many ways since this was made.
Some of the most poignant scenes involve SV visiting her mother and having an honest talk about her settling down (both of them end up teary), visiting a hypnotist to try to improve her self-esteem, talking about her on-again, off-again relationship with her boyfriend (also in the industry), leaving an Adult Entertainment Awards ceremony by herself, with no award, in the dress she was so excitied about wearing earlier that day, and petting her cat, saying since she doesn't have a special man in her life, there's always her cat for affection.
But I have loved the film and Errol Flynn ever since.
This movie was shown on Australian TV in the mid-'60s and never been seen here since.
Of course since Paramount bought the screen right and they had Mae West, why not use the real deal in the lead.
Typically, for comedies from this era, romance and songs have been incorporated into the narrative as much as a device by which to counterbalance the star's antics as for purely commercial reasons (since these films were largely intended for family consumption).
Ever since I first saw it as a kid I've counted it among my favorite W.C. Fields comedies, and when I saw it again recently it was just as funny, warm, and entertaining as ever, maybe all the more so with the passage of time.
But as Olivia discovered in that French theater and so many of us have been discovering ever since, "Robin Hood" is audaciously clever, a perpetual-motion motion-picture machine when it comes to delivering the goods.
There has never been a film since that did the things "Robin Hood" does, but I find that less remarkable than the fact a film this good was ever made at all.
Words may not be enough to express the genius of Louis Malle or Attenborough, but somehow too much water has flown down Thames since the time that image of India was believed in.
However a friend talked me into seeing it and I haven't taken reccomendations from her since.
He's even more perturbed when his boss makes it clear that Todd will be in charge of training the Indian workers to efficiently handle orders while sounding as American as possible; that's important since the firm markets all-American knickknacks, such as miniature flags, hot dog toasters and Wisconsin cheese hats.
I guess since Boys Town is still here we do know that Father Flanagan did solve the problems shown in this film as well.
- especially since I haven't watched these films for what seems like ages - but I won't be doing so immediately, given that a second set is actually coming in March; that said, of the 10 films included, only 1 will be a first-time viewing for me - THE DAWN PATROL (1938) - but it would still be great to have these childhood favorites readily available on the new medium (rather than in the worn, and often colorized, prints I've had to make do with up till now)!
Well, I would have to say that I have been a true Lois and Clark fan since I was 6 years old...and boy do I miss the reruns that used to be on.
I watched it because I liked Dean Cameron in an old TV show and was curious to see what he had done since then.
Though I must admit the villain, Brent Sheppard as Steve Longwood, is a far more ruthless and demented rival to our hero than any antagonist has ever been before, or since.
Henry has been annoying people since he returned to WWE last autumn, inflicting a genuine injury on then champion Batista (which led him to relinquishing his belt).
Leonard Fenton has been acting since the 1950's, mostly on stage and on television in the UK.
I can only wonder why Luciana Padraza has not been seen since.
Conspiracy theory as a way of life has been endemic here, as far as I can tell, since the country first got going.
The fact that so many Robin Hood films have been made since, and not one of them remotely measures up to The Adventures of Robin Hood shows just how good the film is.
I am a truly HUGE Brent Huff fan, and have been since seeing Perils of Gwendoline.
I found the film surprising, specially since the couple of main characters don't perform according to expectations.
Also as a come-back in theaters since their last theater movie "It Takes Two".
Especially since the end result is their hair being straightened.
I have disliked the twins ever since their full house days but this movie was vaguely better than the rest.
Eugene Levy was not funny and it was kind of sad watching him in this movie since you know he is way above this material.
Ever since he watched a movie for the first time (as a member of the LumiÃ¨res' first audience), MÃ©liÃ¨s was convinced of the enormous potential of the new invention as a form of entertainment, as as soon as he could he started to make his own films.
It's been a while since I saw this film, but the one thing I remember best is the fact I was so unimpressed by the acting.
It also definitely helps the movie that the three of them are real life friends and went to college together (along with the movie its director Willem van de Sande Bakhuyzen), it definitely shows on screen, since they all have such a great chemistry and share some great anticipation and reaction with each other.
I can only imagine how funny that might have been, considering the title, the fact that World War II was still going on, and that since there were 221 total films made in the entire "Our Gang" series what the film to make it an even 222 would have been like had it been completed.
Everything is taken care of by somebody else (cleaning up after him in the bathroom, laundry & ironing, bills, shopping, preparing dinner etc), he does not have to buy a car since he can use his parents' cars, he does not have to spend his money on everyday's life necessities and he can concentrate without a single worry in his mind on whatever pleases him (e.g.
However, he gets involved with criminals and becomes more and more entwined into these break-ins, as he is the only one who can actually be punished by law since he's the only one who physically breaks in.
It's been 10 years since director Anthony Minghella worked with Juliette Binoche in The English Patient and 2 previous film (The Talented Mr Rpley and Cold Mountain) with Jude Law before the trio meet up again in Breaking and Entering.
I really found this movie touching, probably since being at that stage in life when one can easily understand and identify with these situations.
She becomes entangled in a relationship that she should avoid but, as she states herself, it has been years since anyone showed her affection so she is vulnerable to an advance.
I didn't love Jude Law this much since Mr. Ripley and Juliette Binoche is heart breaking.
Steven Martini, an extremely talented actor who aside from a doomed TV series and a few made-for TV movies, has been lost to me since _Major Payne_ where he blew me away as Cadet Alex Stone.
Well for starters Eddie Murphy hasn't taken any good roles since Beverly Hills Cop and Thomas Haden Church is more smarter than to accept a role like that.
In fact, you can tell the exhibit hasn't been updated much since 1998, as everything was referencing Star Trek at that time.
And since there are only 4 killings (I'm counting the couple in the opening-scene as one), I'm gonna give HELLBENT 4 out of 10 stars.
This movie, like a number of movies that have been churned out since the New Queer Cinema days, suffers from a genuinely bad script and performances by actors who obviously don't want to be in a gay movie.
By this point, even some stupid queen in a k-hole would have realized there was a bloody, decapitated body on the dance floor and since the "devil" wasn't taking wallets, it shouldn't have been that hard to ID the bodies.
but since it takes itself seriously as a horror/slasher film, it just comes across as amateur.
I had heard good reviews before finally seeing this movie and am already a fan of the horror genre.For a gay slasher film it was done tastefully.I like a movie like this that is more realistic instead of being b-rated and campy.I am glad the gay characters were more normal instead of showing all the negative stereotypes that a lot of TV shows and movies show.It's refreshing to see a regular gay movie about ordinary(but pretty)people in realistic circumstances.In some ways it's just eye candy since every character was cute and sexy,but no different then a lot of other movies.This movie has a good story,good actors,and nice effects with the right amount of suspense,gore and humor.It is very well directed,produced as well as acted.I hope a sequel is made to understand the motive to the killings and to see who is behind that demonic mask.
Horrible performances, terrible direction, inadequate film quality (M4TV), the worst Scottish accent in the history of film, and the most inept CGI since Ang Lee's The Hulk (2003) the render this production completely unwatchable.
I have loved this Movie ever since it's release in 77 i believe.
The special effects are awful, which is surprising since I've seen Sci-Fi do better with other movies.
Unfortunately I didn't get to watch this on SciFi originally but saw a copy recently since they're releasing it to DVD soon(www.lakeplacid2dvd.com).
Well first of all I have to say I mainly rented this since I found out that Jamie Kennedy was in it, and I didn't think it'd be that good because well I was only 13-years-old thinking this would be boring.
Vlad was a patriot who took it to the limit - and beyond - since it seemed necessary at his time and situation!
The character of Reggie also becomes less likable, since director Coscarelli obviously found it necessary for this formerly very cool character to annoy with 'hip' one-liners.
To those who enjoyed the first 3 "Phantasm" films, and haven't seen number 4 yet, I recommend to skip this sorry attempt of a sequel, since all it does is destroy some of the magic of is predecessors.
This addition also allows for a (rather predictable) love story, since it's completely unreasonable for young Malone to conclude the film as a single man.
I have a lot of experience watching movies of all ages and types, and I don't make the mistake of comparing silent movies to talkies, since the dramatic form of the motion picture simply works better with sound.
First, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle appears in the film and, since he died five years after it was released, it may be the only chance you have to see the creator of Sherlock Holmes.
It's also strange that a Brontosaurus was selected to be loose in the finale, especially since this sequence wasn't included in the novel.
To summarize this movie - probably the most 'atmospheric' modern gangster movie since the Godfather.
Here is a movie I've been a fan of since it's release in 1990.
Speaking of whiskey, I have been celebrating St Patricks day every year since '95 by downing several glasses of Jameson, and viewing STATE OF GRACE.----now thats Irish.
Ever since I saw it at a preview screening, this has been one of my favorites.
After watching Dogma for the umpteenth time on Comedy Central, I became a Linda Fiorentino fan along with others out there who wondered what happened to this promising actress since 2002.
Wedding jitters plague Ray (Ken Olin of "thirtysomething" and a producer of "Alias"), since he's a talented painter born and residing in Queens, and is about to marry longtime sweetheart Patty (Chloe Webb) a hairdresser with a philosophical outlook.
The legendary performer plays Alonzo, whose act in a gypsy circus involves throwing knives - no mean feat, since he happens to be armless.
Alonzo is a circus performer, who uses his feet to throw knives since he appears to have no arms.
Alonzo, fearing that if he revealed his secret to Nanon that she would recognize he was her father's killer since few men have an extra thumb, blackmailed a doctor into removing his arms.
He's really not armless, but has his arms strapped to his sides to appear limbless since he wishes to hide his identity from the cops.
Alonzo is the perfect complement for Nanon then, since he cannot manhandle her.
I probably made that synopsis sound more soap-operatic than it should, since it doesn't very well convey the overall twisted, creepy atmosphere that Browning achieves in The Unknown.
Unfortunately who ever was suppose to sync the voices to the lips was blind since the words never match the lip flaps.
Luckily since we had passes for the convention, it was free, but even then i felt ripped off.
It's been more that 7 months since I've watched it for the first time and posted a comment in IMDb.
I first became acquainted with this movie on Movie Plex on True Story Saturday several years ago, and it has stayed with me ever since.
What people say is of little importance anyway, since it only serves them as a mask of sound to cover what they really are, and you can always see it in their actions, that never lie.
This slasher does nothing to separate itself from the countless number that have came out since the 80's heyday.
And it is what we have gotten in 95% of action films since 1965 or so.
Hmmm ... just saw this piece at the Horrorfest and I wish I had used these 90 minutes for more useful activities, like shooting myself in the head or something ...  ... but seriously, this is the dumbest plot since 'Slumber Party Massacre 17'.
There is a bit of dismay expressed by the RV owner's girlfriend, since her boyfriend has cheated on her numerous times, and he's not done yet, you can bet.
One being deformed brothers, who wear jumpsuits, running around and murdering/raping teenagers (Wrong Turn, Hills, Home) and secondly the biggest concept I will not say since it involves a twist ending but that ideas includes movie like Texas Chainsaw and Hills.
I could compare this movie to an A&E special or Cold Case reenactment gone horribly wrong, but than I would contradict myself, since I obviously like this movie.
What was scary was not only just those deformed Billy brothers but the family in which they come from, again I will not say since this is a twist and I don't want to ruin it, but that realization is far more disturbing than those evil twins.
I would recommend this movie to horror fans since this is a newbie of horror and I think that it should be given a chance.
While we Americans(I say we, since I'm American even though I'm landed in Canada) tend to think of Monty Python when we think of British humor, there's also a satirical type of humor that seems to be unique to Britain.
The characters are wonderfully portrayed, and I've been a fan of Kate Beckinsale and Rufus Sewell ever since.
Her instinctive snobbishness (Beckinsale has a real talent for this) is played for laughs since everyone would feel a bit superior and distanced from this eccentric collection of misfits.
I dashed home and haven't stopped watching it since.
The cast is sheer perfection.Beckinsale is vivacious,perky,gutsy and completly charming,Sheila Burrell is a riot as family matriarch Ada Doom who keeps a tight leash on her family and hardly leaves her room since she "saw somthing nasty in the woodshed".
As mentioned in the comments of others, Ms. Beckinsale, clad in her natty period togs and radiating a winsome, unflappable aura (while also projecting a strangely prepubescent vibe), hasn't had as good a role since Flora.
The cast is sheer perfection.Beckinsale is vivacious,perky,gutsy and completly charming,Sheila Burrell is a riot as family matriarch Ada Doom who keeps a tight leash on her family and hardly leaves her room since she "saw somthing nasty in the woodshed".
Well, it has been a very long time since I have seen this film.
In spite of their friendship, they do not become lovers since Helene is still recovering from the disillusion of her last relationship.
She claims not to have formed any attachments since.
However, it becomes quickly confusing since a man called Frank gets killed towards the beginning of the film, but then either he or some other man named Frank become quite central to the plot, shortly afterwards.
I would have LOVED to have had the kid reply: "Well, not hardly, Mom, since you had my face pressed to the carpet the entire time."
Operation Kid Brother is more entertaining than all of the Bond films released since Diamonds Are Forever.
He's perfect in the role since his openly wise-guy exterior is in sharp contrast to Ayres' gee-whiz personna, in spite of the fact that they are equally violent.
I would like to have seen a better resolution of the Ricarno/Mileaway relationship, particularly since Cagney's character just disappears after his 'confession', and even more so because of his heavily implicated fling with Ricarno's wife - very risquÃ© stuff for the 1930's.
Well,not in my Dad's instance,because when my Dad saw the film on the Screen, it was shortly after Bogart's death and Cagney was already a long since established star.But still a treat nonetheless.
Okay, maybe the parts with her father (real-life papa Hashimoto) were a little over the top, but since the whole movie is just eye-candy anyway they seemed to fit.
Allen has a good eye for detail and places that haven't changed too much since he was a child.
I've been a Woody Allen fan since the 1970s, when I was about 20, and this gem is one of his absolute best.
Jacky Wu also shows how he has progressed since Tai-Chi Boxer.
The one-liners are brilliant, and the bad guys are two of the most eccentric characters since the Bond movie henchmen Oddjob and Jaws (see the amazing genius frog?!?)
However, it is not that strange, since this movie is a Dutch re-make from the Danish movie "Old Men in New Cars", something most viewers seem to have missed.
It all works perfectly since the movie fortunately doesn't take itself seriously at all.
That makes the rest of this flick come tumbling down, since old-fashioned justice is the point of the film.
This film undeservedly took a bashing when it was released and since then Get Carter '71 fans have insistently tried to bury it.
However, in the 7 years since it's release I've come to realize that this isn't the worst film ever made.
Sten, since she so vulnerable and Sig Ruman, who portrays her strict by the book father.
A young Hitchcock (he was my age when he made the film, about 27 or 28) allowed himself to be swayed by popular and studio pressure much more than he would later in his career, since he allowed the entire ending of this film to be altered based on the popularity of it's handsome star, stage actor Ivor Novello.
Hitch's humor comes through in scenes like a showgirl dramatically giving up peroxide, since the Avenger seems to prefer blondes.
I haven't seen this since its release, and I've looked for years to see if it made it to tape.
I saw this when it was making the Drive-In circuit and since there is nudity in this movie it must have been rated R but 14 year-old's had no problem getting into Drive-In features.
I have been looking for a video of this movie since videotape/DVD became available.
And, since this is a '60's movie, there's a lot of hat-dropping going on (if you know what I mean).
The only honest performance was turned in by Buck Henry, who plays a raving mental patient- of course, since he also wrote the screenplay for this abomination, it was probably only typecasting.
I have been wanting to see this movie again ever since I first saw it in college, 30 years ago.
The actor played the character a little one dimensional, but since it is a comedy it still works.
As for myself, not only did it do that and more, it also had me think about myself, and my current situation in life, and since my country damaged me so hard, I guess in a similar way, I wont experience a great deal if at all.
However, since the fake photo was released, some soldiers in the Allied camp become interested in finding the "creature" as Crusoe is called.
Just outside, a young boy discovers a strange rock in the waterÂ Water Horse: Legend of the Deep channels the same fantasy-within-war quality that Pan's Labyrinth does, albeit to a lesser extent since it follows the tropes of its genre so well.
I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie since the "Loch Ness" subject matter is kind of an overused topic.
Even though the lead character is a young kid, it was OK since all of the characters and story were realistic and serious - and not depicted from a kid's point of view.
Ever since the time of the Third Crusade, Saladin has often been painted as a chivalric opponent by westerners and Ian Keith's performance of Saladin in The Crusades certainly falls in line with the "chivalrous hero of the West" style portrayal of Saladin.
De Mille collection; however, since I already owned both THE SIGN OF THE CROSS (1932) and CLEOPATRA (1934) via TCM showings, I kept postponing the purchase of this set Â until I acquired the lot through a friend of my father's!
That is very important to state since a lot of people associate DeMille ONLY with sets, visual effects, costumes and bathes.
The first story - directed by Ken Russell ("Gothic" and "Altered States") - IS probably the most enjoyable since it features the most nudity and gore of the entire movie and is about an aspiring young actress whose breast implants have a vicious thirst for blood...
I would recommend just checking out the first segment since it has nipples biting people in the face...
I am reluctant to call this the "worst movie ever", (since there are too many doofae who do that, but ,IMHO, should be considered.
Also since this tale can be seen apart from this film in other places, I'd recommend that rather than sitting through this whole film merely for this one part.
Sadly, Shanghai Triad has a superior video cassette box, since it is a film of superior marketing, but drastically inferior plot, scope, characters and quality.
And since it's by him, all the symbols, allusions, circular events, juxtaposition of characters - and all the rest of that - applies.
It requires a period of reflection, one that does not equal that of 'Raise the Red Lantern' but is the only film to have such a numbing effect since.
Hopefully he will become more diversified in his roles since he is such a talented actor.
Apart from this problem, the film is a decent but not great Lloyd short since it's so contrived and has some cheap laughs.
I wasn't entirely sure this movie would stick out from the rest but I chose to go since I had nothing else to do.
It does, however, leave you wanting a little more since it IS made for T.V.
It is the most funniest Adult Swim series since "The Boondocks".
This is honestly one of the best shows Adult Swim has put out since they began to air shows like Space Ghost Coast to Coast and Family Guy.
Synopsis: "Na Nan has known best pal Dong Mi and Jung Joon since childhood, and now the trio shares the ups and downs of their turbulent single lives together.
If your kid insists on seeing it (I presume at a friend's house, since you will have better taste than to bring this into your home), there's no harm in it.
The Chinese cities look very modern and I am interested in a peaceful way in their Television Satellites since I have never seen a diagram of one living here in North America and having given a lecture on Satellite Technology in Air Cadets.
Princess Julia since you and I are eternal in the Moonfleet you will always be in the thoughts and prayers of my Deoxyribo nucleic Acid selves.
Dr. Spectre is by far one of the best villians I've seen since Kevin Spacey in se7en.
William Girdler made his directorial debut in 1972 with the surprisingly decent exploitation flick Three on a Meathook, and since then basically everything he's directed has gone on to become notorious - though mostly that's because his films are so low quality, not because of any content.
Joyce is constantly talking about killing Jimmy, and since the movie begins during the investigation into his death, the movie raises your suspicion from the start.
In movies, since anything can be contrived, it is the usual rule to have the camera show the truth while letting the characters do the lying.
I'd say this is a must for serious collectors if you can get a copy as this has been deleted in original format since 1993!
the directors obviously had a very low budget since half the scenes, which were suppose to be all different where all in the same location and they didn't try to hide that.
I am giving Shadowzone a 9 out of ********** since this is a classic example of turning basic horror elements (in this case the storyline) into an effective, creepy, moody and atmospheric film.
The story must be autobiographical to some extent, since we see Agnieszka encountering political opposition to her digging too deeply into the past trying to reconstruct Birkut's life and figure out why he essentially dropped from the scene after having been so highly visible; there is also a famous film director in the movie whom we get to know well.
the directors obviously had a very low budget since half the scenes, which were suppose to be all different where all in the same location and they didn't try to hide that.
And since every trailer in Jacksonville not only has to have push-outs and a separate stall shower but a wife, it seems as if this is only real reason Gazzara's character wants to form an attachment or have some kind of a relationship with Rowland's character.
It's very clear which are the clips from other films, since both the quality of the film and the actors change between scenes.
since it's local, it's criminally underfunded.
Hence, since last month, i have taken a break and have started watching Korean movies instead..that is till they run out of Hollywood scripts to photocopy.
A wonderful movie since Doris Roberts is so able to depict this wealthy woman who comes to the aid of others.
It's been a long time since a movie touched me enough to make me cry, and this one did.
It's been almost two decades since I watched the film on CBS-TV one Saturday night, but I remember it vividly.
Joel Grey was a very good Chiun as well, though at the time I thought that they would never have him on the regular series, since it wasn't Broadway.
The special effects earned it a rating of 5, though they were ruined in day light shots by cheap-looking filters reducing color saturation, common in B-series on TV ever since Saving Private Ryan set the standard for the phenomena of filter-credibility, to be abused ever since.
I have to say that this first episode passed by so quickly that i thought it was a regular episode (which means 50 minutes long because that's the length of 'Miami Vice' episodes unlike some shows which have 40 minutes episode's length) and not a double one, it was exciting and entertaining in almost every scene, acting was very good, far better from what i have expected, since i heard that 80's detective shows aren't well known for their flawless actors, but Johnson and Thomas are dead on most of the time, specially in dramatic scenes and dialogs.
In fact, the only serialized alien invasion show to come along since that even comes close is Neon Genesis Evangelion (1995), a series that wears its Macross influence on its sleeve but somehow comes up a lot less satisfying.
At the end of teenie horror wave here comes a little horror-thriller about 5 young students passed luckily their MATURA ( maybe like finish of High School ), good friends since Primary school.
"In Drei Tagen Bist Du Tot" (2006) is an excellent slasher movie from Austria, a land that has, since the silent time, proved to deliver constantly world-class movies like no other German speaking land did.
Then a bit later Spock informs the Captain that the pilot's son plays an important part in space travel history so they MUST return the pilot ASAP--especially since at this point, the pilot hasn't yet sired any kids.
I'm very happy I went along to see it now, and afterword's I even felt that movie buzz that I haven't had since Dark Knight.
Moreover, he campaigns for registering them since they cannot be trusted to supervise their powers responsibly.
I thought they did a great job of adapting the comic book into this film as I've been a big fan of the comic books since I was very little kid.
I've always been a fan of the X-Men, since the Animated Series aired (I'd never really read any of the comics though... ^_^).
I guess since Arnold ran for Governor he couldn't do movies.
The new ending since they changed it works well with what they set up and it flows well.
I know Subiha way back since Eighties.
This movie is the first since Transformers in which the action had me stunned.
Khamosh Pani will go down in Pakistani history as the most important work of art and politic since the country's inception.
Khamosh Pani will go down in Pakistani history as the most important work of art and politic since the country's inception.
The title says most of it but does not suggest the humor found amid the gore, the sex amid the bodies, the decadence of the love interest and her special talent, or talents since one would hope that both instruments are operative.
Ever since Clive Owen ascended to the A-list of Hollywood's leading men (something that took far too long in my opinion), he has often been pipped as the next actor to inherit the ongoing role of James Bond.
I haven't much to say on the movie itself since its ones of those "entertained me but probably won't buy the DVD" films I so often see in cinemas.
Michael Davis spoke before the preview and said he was an action movie buff since the beginning and made the movie he wanted to make.
I guess, since the show was too daring and didn't fit a regular "format", the sponsors threw their weight around, and instead of more episodes of War Stories we got more mind-numbing sitcoms, reality shows, and cheesy thrillers.
Well that is carried over here, these guys won't stop until their processor is dead, but since they're CGI for the most part it lessens the feel of real danger... Somewhere deep inside the Terminator fan in me was wishing to return to that dark skull covered gritty landscape we saw glimpses of in the first Terminator (this definitely isn't the future Connor's Mother warned him about)  Hardcore terminator fans might want to avoid this, it was better than T3 but still pretty far off the quality of the first two, still, if its a Summer Blockbuster you want then go see Terminator Salvation, you could do a lot worse...
I am a connoisseur of "horror" movies/series, and have seen them all since the 1950s, but One Step Beyond remains the scariest of all the series.
I first saw this episode in 1995, and it has haunted me ever since.
Its hard to believe that it has never been mentioned since.
The production values on "One Step Beyond" were certainly on par with the average half-hour show of that time,since some of the stories kept the audiences' attention on sheer focus and a superior track record of consistent quality.
And since they're were no spaceships,prehistoric monsters,or aliens no lame effects were used here.
I am a connoisseur of "horror" movies/series, and have seen them all since the 1950s, but One Step Beyond remains the scariest of all the series.
Through a flashback, Stein explains to a random striptease dancer how an old & anonymous shaman handed him a peculiar amulet, and since then the sharks obey him.
This is interesting since you get the feeling that everyone on the street has a story to tell.
He clearly has run away without notice and ever since his parents have lived in disarray.
It's been years since a movie has invaded my head like this one.
This is English kitchen sink drama without the tired clichÃ©s of class wars, which have seemed a bit anachronistic since the fall of the Tories.
It's not intended for children, since Inuyasha likes to curse a lot, and there tends to be some brief nudity occasionally.
...not the kind of character that makes sense, since she's always switching sides and constantly disrupts the flow of an episode she's in.
If this weren't a Terminator movie, I would have given it 3 stars for being so bad, but since it destroyed so much potential I couldn't give it any more that 1 star.
Although it's too long (the only major flaw, since the 160 episodes watered down the story) and has some weak episodes, "Inuyasha" is nothing short of brilliant, and it seems it's characters will never become boring: from Miroku, who is always touching woman's butts and asking them if they will have a baby with him up to Kagome who is trying to maintain her good grades in school while fighting in medieval Japan.
Basically, Judd's character is a rich hermit who insists on living a self-fulfilling prophesy of going insane, a notion that has been ingrained in him ever since his father flipped out and slaughtered his mother.
I would say that if you are feverish to experience the ruins of Afghanistan and the misery people endure since the war, then you would probably enjoy it.
Even though I did not understand the language and the subtitles were in French (which, since I am not very proficient in French, I had trouble reading sufficiently fast), I did appreciate the emotions conveyed by the protagonists.
The film is, at times, incredibly funny, and contains one of the funnest dinning scenes I have seen since Meg Ryan and THAT scene!
This is probably the most unromantic representation I have seen of Paris since moments of Paris, je t'aime.
Secondly, since we are talking about shallow artists, there is an enormous amount of politico-sexual "art" on display in the film.
Especially since she witnessed him going down on this retarded boy.
I've loved Joseph Gordon Levitt since he played "Tommy" on Third Rock From the Sun and he's grown into a powerful actor.
I've faithfully followed Araki's career since TOTALLY F'ED UP and I've since felt he could make an important and profound film - if only given the opportunity and the budget.
3RD ROCK is one of my all time favorite TV series, and I've since felt JGL had could prove himself as one of the all time great actors, if only the right script presented itself.
I say strange, because this movie is more hard-core than any American film I've seen since, perhaps, "Happiness".
The film resonates on a level of rawness unseen and unfelt since Cuesta's "L.I.E."
Not since HAPPINESS has such a difficult subject been tackled head on!
So I didn't get around to it when I lived in California since it came and went very quickly however the film did show up in a little theater about 5 miles from my house so I figured I have to check this film out and so I did.
I don't think I saw anything this graphic since I first saw "Irreversible" a few years back.
I had high hopes for this film, since I have been a big fan of the novel on which it is based.
After watching this film on CMT recently, having not seen the film since I was a young man in the '70s, I was impressed by the fact that the filmmaker had definitely captured a time and an attitude prevalent in the South.
The sequences between Rathbone & Colman are very enjoyable, especially since in their only other joint appearance, A TALE OF TWO CITIES (1935), they had no scenes together.
For me watching If I Were King is like watching The Vagabond King without the music since I know where the songs go.
Either way Slaughter Studios has remained unused & empty ever since... Jump forward 20 years & aspiring low budget horror filmmaker Steve (Peter Stanovich) is going to break into Slaughter Studios & use the unused but still intact stages for his latest project.
I think the reason that the TMOTMM didn't make it is because wives wouldn't let their husbands watch it, which is perplexing since husbands don't mind if their wives watch the predictable pretentious, "Sex in the City."
I enjoyed it since it seemed to grasp how every marriage that I knew from friends and family.
Especially since I have been on both sides (being the single guy and the married guy *sort of) The complaints seem real and the responses genuine as far as I could tell.
I have since watched it and still find the humor.
I was more curious about how long the show would last since they covered the main question of infidelity?
Not since Fellini's 8 1/2, have I had the privilege of imbibing myself in such artistry Â losing myself in a maze of charismatic characters; prescient prose; dramatic drama and alluring actors.
I've seen it a few times since then, and found it improved in pace with my understanding.
You can't help but love the part where his Captain comes into his office, kicks his feet off the desk and gets stuck into him for nosing into a case belonging to Homicide, particularly, since when he comes back into the office and tells him how much he loved that outburst.
In that the killer finally reveals himself, due to process of elimination, since almost everyone who were murdered in the film had earlier ended up murdering somebody else making the point of the film being a whodunit totally moot.
Still, the fact that no sooner has a murder been committed that the killer is himself brutally dispatched adds a refreshing touch of irony (since usually there is only one killer) â none more so than during that knockout ending!
I haven't seen a movie like this since "Kids" and "Clerks".
been watching the progress of this movie since i first found out about it on the view askew web board and knew i needed to see it.... after watching the trailer i knew it was going to be one of the greatest movies id be allowed to see by the evil gnomes who choose my movies very carefully.. the type of movie this is really isn't done enough and the quality of the writing will amaze you... its tough writing a review for something while not saying too much about it but i really hate to spoil movies for other people, as i hate having them spoiled for me... let me just say to you.... awesome frickin' awesome   check out Kisses and Caroms, you surely will not be disappointed...
one of the best no/low budget movies I've seen since clerks.
I stumbled across this film at a friend's house one night, and wasn't that eager to watch it since it's not usually my type of film, but I am very pleased I did.
And since thats really the only memorable part, I'll just give a brief overview of what I would expect to find.
Gates who had shut himself off from the world since his wife the daughter of the town's Sheriff Deegan, Kurtwood Smith, was accidentally drowned-when she fell off her horse-would in fact find a new reason for living in the dangerous world beyond the "Wolf Valley" in the Oxbow.
This film was written and directed by Tab Murphy, and it is a tragedy that he has not directed another film since (and this was his first).
I have not come across such a touching "Western" since Duvall and Costner's "Open Range".
The American Paint horses use in the movie for the "Lost Tribe," were a special touch for me, since I own a Paint horse.
"If it ain't on the page, it ain't on the stage," actors have maintained since, oh, Euripides.
This was most probably unintentional since sources state that the screenplay follows the story closely, but today's values would have Flammchen behave much differently.
The weird thing is that since things went belly-up in the cat house when the ghouls revealed what they were, the entire population of the town apart from the Sheriff has vanished.
Where did these people come from, since it started with a mere 7?
Plus, since this is a horror film, horror fans will be disappointed with the uninteresting violence and lack of nudity Jason Goes To Hell has to offer.
After Jason was killed in the last 8 entries, it seems rather stupid to try and explain that this would indeed be the last time, especially since they would go back on their word, also their Final Chapter was hardly the last.
His swashbuckling feats of dynamic swordplay and athletic scaling of ship's rigging were genuine sit up and take notice moments, especially since he was doing all of his own stunt work.
Unless I missed something, which is possible since I had no problem going to the fridge without pausing this waste of time, I only counted 2 mummies.
Although, drowning out the dialog may have been a good thing since the dialog itself was dull and repetitive.
I've been a Robbie fan since the beginning, even when he was with take that, he was born to be a entertainer, he's got the talent from his dad, who's a well-known comedian in england.Robbie's comedic talent, his gestures, his voice, the whole charisma, has made him to what he is now: THE mega star!
Don't get me wrong, I'm a HUGE fan of horror and have been since near birth.
Love low-budget films since they nearly all contain the raw, gritty edge that Hollywood films almost always lack.
It was a fair cultural shock to see Jim Backus (as agent Locan) in a dramatic role, since until then I'd seen him only on sitcoms & as Mister Magoo.
I have it on tape & watch it maybe once a year & have seen Cagney & co-stars in other vehicles since then: especially Jane Greer in her unsavory "Out of the Past" role.
I love Binoche very much and since she doesn't exactly make six movies a year, I'm glad when I can see her at all.
Ever since "The English Patient" and her unexpected but deserved Oscar, I've been mildly obsessed w/her.
Some scenes are mildly entertaining but about 30 minutes into the film you begin to wonder why you should bother finishing it since it's just not interesting.
But, after the initial half hour, things get a bit bogged down, especially since most of the remainder is a dialogue between Rose and Felix and in a hotel room.
The great actresses and films of the 30s may have long since disappeared, but surely someone can provide fine romantic/comedy scriptwriting...at least before we get to Bridget Jones 12...
Thompson's assured directon shows signs of maturity since "La buche", while her writing is as astute as ever.
It looks more expensive than most standard Swedish TV-fare but since it was made in Estonia it was probably quite cheap.
No matter though since this was definitely a case of very little bang for your buck.
The last twenty minutes plays the same "tick-tock" inspired music that has been in every Swedish TV- production since times beginning.
The hero is, of course, the chosen one who is the only one who can break this evil spell, he's the chosen one since his father were one of the prisoners.
Not even the gore can save this one, since there's very little of it and all the FX sucks, so even gore-hounds will be let down.
He hasn't been in a good film since.....oh yeah, he hasn't been in a good film EVER.
Not only do you have these great characters you also get the one and only Martin Lawrence with his best performance since Remember the Titans.
Today I had a chance to see it again, and was a little worried that being 20 years older, and having seen so many more movies since then, I may end up being disappointed.
Elinu, high priest of the albinos, and the rest of the people revere the two doctors as Gods, since their flashlight becomes a sacred instrument to the light-shunning albinos.
In terms of the Universal monster series, this is a very disappointing effort since they film is not as fun as interesting as previous monster films.
Because they have lived under ground since ancient times and are look much like albinos, as it turns out their civilization was swallowed into the earth along with them.
Who gave them these clothes, since the Sumerian folk who live underground are wearing skirted tunics and gowns?
The patrols face uncertain deaths every time they confront a band of poachers, since they may readily be out-gunned or simply shot.
I mean, talk about letting the subject-matter "speak for itself"-- it starts out with the premise of some high action-adventure, but continually "breaks" the pace to let the realities of high-altitude patrolling intrude.... And since we are mostly "embedded" with the reporter who speaks only a little Tibetan, very little is explained to us/ the reporter (the patrol-men aren't great "talkers"...).
I've been waiting for the screening of this movie for a very long time, and I guess I was really lucky that I was able to watch it at all, since there are only four copies being rotated in Germany.
Kekekili is a mountainous wilderness in Tibet, home to the Tibetan antelope - now an endangered species since their fur became a valued commodity in the west.
A Star is Born has had two remakes since this 1937 version, but when this film is discussed this is usually the version that stands out.
The reason why it scares me is because since early childhood I've suspected that I may be a victim to alien abduction.
I've seen 'Fire in the Sky', I've watched and been a fan of 'The X-Files' since the beginning, I've seen that Roswell movie with Kyle MacLauchlan, and that TV special 'Intruders'... none of them have been able to do what Communion did.
Flip enlists the company of some guy to track down drug dealers, since dealing drugs is the first step on the "how to become a gangster-rapper" handbook.
When you see this masterpiece, remember that more than 65 years have passed since it debuted on the big screen.
This movie just drags on and on which is not good since it's only 88 minutes.
Janet Gaynor is perfect as the home-grown farm girl seeking to make her mark in Hollywood, and Fredric March is very convincing as the has-been who cannot cope with his declining value in Hollywood, especially since he caused much of it himself.
And since you never see more than three of them at a time, and they show no evidence of spitting poison or some other otherworldly power, you just feel like everyone in the movie ought to be able to beat the s*** out of these ants anyway and just go home.
Needless to say, he brings home the horrors of Iraq with him in all their bloody infamy in what could be one of the best post-war syndrome studies since Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver.
Richard's initial work that he carries out on the gang all feels as if it builds up to the big showdown with the final gang member; the one member we will feel a juxtaposition toward since he has a wife and two children.
And for me the film stands as more evidence that South Korea is currently making many of the best films in the world (they have been since 1997).
I first read Jane Eyre the novel many years ago and have since watched various adaptations of it but never really found one that I thought captured the essence of the book and portrayed the characters as I imagined them.
at least fifteen episodes; but, since it was a "low budget" production, it has only five - and, because of that, the "gipsy scene" had to be pruned up to the point of becoming just a hilarious scene, and the character of Rosamond Oliver had to be simply tossed off.
Part bodycount flick, part emotional drama, part vengeance movie, it all adds up to one of the most satisfying pieces of work that the UK has provided since .
well, since goodness knows when.
This became a favourite book of mine for all time and I have read it many times since.
I have not seen this series since that original broadcast and to the best of my knowledge it was never repeated.
Michael Biehn has grizzled nicely since Terminator.
Garrison discovers "scissoring," in the most graphic sex scene on South Park since Dawkins made love to Garrison last season.
When I went to the theater to see screwed I knew it would be a good film, with Dave Chappelle and Danny Devito, I also knew that since Norms previous feature film (Dirty Work) was hilarious and very well-written that this movie could not live up to it, and it doesn't but it is still a wonderful piece of work.
It was one of the funniest movies I had seen in the theatres since The Whole Nine Yards.
I just was channel surfing and ran across "Daugher of the Mind", which have not seen since I was a young child (I am now almost the big 50), however, much to my dismay the movie was 3/4 over and I only got to see the last 1/2 hour.
It is very hard for me to agree with almost everyone who reviewed this movie and Giallo A Venezia, because the question arises how did they sit through them in the first place since they have always been movies with such bad reputations.
And since all you sick puppies liked it so much ('cause I read about it in almost every single comment), I'm gonna list you some other movies containing scenes which show different ways on how to mutilate a vagina: Lucio Fulci's THE NEW YORK RIPPER, Ruggero Deodato's CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, Buddy Cooper's THE MUTILATOR, Pierre B. Reinhard's THE REVENGE OF THE LIVING DEAD GIRLS and Andreas Schnaas' VIOLENT SH!T II.
I've been waiting for Meadows to make a film that fulfilled the promise his short films showed ever since seeing his short film Where's the Money, Ronny?, and with Dead Man's Shoes he finally delivers.
It's been twelve hours since the closing credits rolled and I am still processing my experience of Dead Man's Shoes.
Oh yeah, "breasts", I would say tits, which is much cooler, but for some reason people find that offensive, and since I can't say tits I refuse to discuss the matter any further.
(However since it is next to Critters 3, I bet you'll pick up both covers and compare the pictures on the boxes for awhile before you skip over both and rent "The Truth about Cats and Dogs," which is much cuter I think.)
The pacing slows down a little then, since new moronic characters need to be introduced first.
It's entirely possible the film would have worked better without the "mystery" angle, especially since it seems to come from left field midway through the film and then becomes all-pervasive, in direct contrast to the semi-documentary "romantic comedy travelogue" feel of the first half.
Additionally, since Maxwell Bright was shown as part of Scottsdale's International Film Festival, producer Steven Wolfe and actor Patrick Warburton hosted the filming and stayed after for a Q&A -- REALLY wish there were more of that in this country.
Often moving and always- always- respectful, Little's documentary is the tribute to the memory of the greatest martial artist of the 20th century that we've been waiting for since 1973.
I also love the brutality of it, Mr Considine in all scenes looks like someone with so much anger and distaste for the people he is dealing with comes across really unstable and alarming, such strong character portrayal is rare in a film these days, the intensity of his character makes the best anti-hero seen for years pretty much since taxi driver, I have heard Paddy Considine being called the British Robert De Niro, I just can't believe he hasn't been poached by bigger (but not better) films.
I especially liked the parts from the movies, since they reminded me of the time I was watching them.
Overall, I've been a big fan of Bruce Lee since I wore Osh Kosh an this made me admire him so much more.
I kept wanting to hear Sigmund Romberg's melodies in the background for the soundtrack, too bad they couldn't get permission at the time, since the musical was introduced in 1924.
Not since discovering Christian Bale did I feel like wanting to see more films from someone.
** End Minor Spoilers **  This movie moves slowly sometimes, and I wish there were sub titles, since I had some trouble with the accents in some scenes, but it's also got scenes that look like poetry.
The End of the World hasn't been this funny since Kubrick's wink at oblivion in Dr. Strangelove.
Fearing such doom as a certainty has become less of a concern since the end of communism and the arms race.
Is it any wonder the writer/director's CV looks painfully thin since this film?
Not even the director of this crap, who by rights should be forced to watch this movie again, and again until he publicly denounces his film as the worst since Howard the Duck.
It has been years since I have seen this film, but was kinda worth the time.
"Papillon" stroke me as a little shocking since I wasn't expecting so much "controversial" material in a movie this old, in other words, a movie with Steve Mcqueen.
That was the first and last time I watched this movie since this year, when I found it in a store and immediately bought it.
I supposed it was "classical music" since it was not on the official score of Jerry Goldsmith.
Robert Stack's character is a bit of a selfish jerk, but, since it is the 50's, everyone knows he'll come around in the end.
I have enjoyed watching this film several times over the three decades since it was released.
I haven't seen it since I was 15, but I love it.
The film covers the art of cinematography since the conception of cinema at the turn of the 20th century.
So all in all this is a well rounded movie but since its muppets it gets a extra point.
It is similar to The Muppet Show, since it took place at the same theater, but all of the segments had to do with movies, there were two guest stars instead of one (only a small number of Muppet Show episodes had multiple guests, and those were either married celebrity couples or special groups of entertainers), and there didn't seem to be any backstage plot.
The acting was terrible which is weird since the magic of the Real World is the fact there is no acting.
I still remember this movie through the eyes of a 12 year old girl and while I may not be a good critic of quality acting & scripts, I do know that this movie has haunted me since I was 12.
I was struck by her saying how this movie has "haunted her" since she saw it when she was about the same age as I was!
He THINKS everything will be fine since he is a foreigner.
Seeing this movie for the 1st time almost 7 years since it's release brought me mixed emotions.
Filmmaker Noah Baumbach is back in fine form since his debut with the excellent "Kicking and Screaming" (a personal fave of mine; a "Diner" for the '90s) in this semi-autobiographical account of his family's dealing with his parent's divorce with bittersweet frankness and a heaping of witty humor.
That mental health issue is pretty much useless as a plot twist in this movie, since it is pretty obvious from the get-go that the townies are hiding something.
I saw this movie since I was impressed by the visual effects in HM1.
You're Dead") since this topic is so important, and relevant to problems in American society, the audience is entitled to some theory or detail from the writer, as to events which led up to the Columbine killings.
With this in mind, one has to consider the development which the comedy genre underwent during this time: from the mildly risquÃ© sophisticated antics of the Doris Day/Rock Hudson films of the early 1960s to the cynical anxiety-ridden variety that started emanating towards the tail-end of the decade Â with which the likes of Jack Lemmon, George Segal (the male lead of this film) and, in particular, Woody Allen (since he was his own writer and mostly directed himself as well) are forever associated.
His performance is so convincing that he has been known as an expert comic ever since.
But the night we did, I don't think I've laughed that hard since I was on a teen field trip to see Romeo and Juliet (1968 version) with my class.
And, that one scene will give me enough to fantasize about in the gym, especially since he's always fully clothed!
Miss Coco who I had fallen in love with since her small part in "TRICK" her blood curdling scream make me pee every time!!
This movie has no redeeming elements whatsoever, since even the sleazy scenes are uninspired and boring as hell.
If you want cheese you'll have no trouble finding it (the Darth Vader-like breathing of Tintorera or the underwater conversations between Esteban and Miguel directly springs to mind...), but don't look to hard since the larger parts of the movie is actually pretty well-made and totally undeserving of its bad reputation (which I think is more due to the whole idea of a shark/sex movie, than the movie itself).
He should stick to action and urban films since that's what he's best at.
And, judging from the recent televised court-case, attitude towards African-American's hasn't changed much since then.
One is a balding red-head with bulging eyes who has since made a career out of playing serial murderers.
A generation has passed, only a generation, since the governor of Mississippi's neighboring state stood in the doorway of the university and proclaimed, "Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever."
The worst part was that I am from a very racist town, unfortunately, and watching the beginning of the film terrified me because I felt like this world hadn't changed since I felt like I was living that film.
The chemistry between the two Robinsons is unbearable, especially since Phyllis always seems to have such a pained expression on her face.
What is really sad is that the powers that be at FOX have managed to come up with shows (in my honest opinion) that are even worse than this mess since then.
It's been so long since I've seen it I can't even remember the names of the characters.
That's what he's been doing since his early days on "Second City TV" (SCTV) (1976).
The suspense part of this film--and I don't think I'm really giving anything away here by prefacing this--slowly builds,which may seem a little unusual for American audiences,since film here in the U.S. that are considered "Suspense" usually want to set the stage and tension as fast as possible to not lose the audience.
Authors are always grateful to their characters wherever they may come from, since without them there can be no story.
The rest is just how the book develops-and since she is an experienced writer of murder mysteries, a murder is written in too.
For example, he took riding lessons, and in my opinion was one of the best riders, certainly among those who hadn't been riders since childhood (such as John Wayne and Gary Cooper).
He directed no less than fifteen movies since the new millennium and I think all his fans should see them!
It was all kind of predictable since you could see the handwriting on the wall: the death of Moira, the growing up of Ricky Nelson / Farley Granger, and the ultimate success of Douglas and Angeli.
For example, you knew Angeli's character would not die up on the trapeze since she had already suffered the death of her husband.
I was really disappointed since I thought this movie was similar to Die Hard but I guess not.
if you want to see plenty of hot chicks showering Goofy violence and the overall awesomeness of Orville check this movie out i first saw it on USA network years ago and have been wanting more Orville ever since Check it out!!
The one thing that REALLY got on my nerves bad (I mean besides the vampires dancing like zombies half the time), was the fact that logos on shirts were blurred out, and since a good deal of the cast wears a jersey during the first half of the film, this became extremely distracting and almost made the film unwatchable.
This is one of the few cases where there is a pistol that shoots dozens of times without reloading (a common thing in Arbuckle films) that makes sense, since this is part of a dream and dreams DON'T need to make sense!
), the film plays like a good little paperback-original mystery novel--especially so since Mitchell provides voice-over narration here and there to speed things along and to mention things that would be too expensive to show on camera.
He had been married just over a month, Priscilla was pregnant with Lisa-Marie and this film would be his biggest hit since 1965.
And, since this is an A&C picture, the bit, unfunny to start with, is naturally overdone.
is done to perfection by A&C with Murray Leonard as the Derelict, which I've always remembered as one of my favorite A&C routines since I was ten years old.
But since it's not in the Universal set, it's not available on DVD anywhere.
Her subtle delivery and acting style had improved 100% since the early days of "River Of No Return" Its lovely to see her portraying a real woman who is warm, convincing, and with depth.
From waiting patiently for the very first show to appear, I watched that episode and I have watched and enjoyed each and ever episode since the first one!
Olivier was to direct her, his first film direction assignment since RICHARD III.
You don't have to be an expert in Mayan culture to know that tribes were constantly fighting, killing, and enslaving one another, because that's how all society has been since the birth of mankind.
They began with human sacrificing about 300 A.D.This is a fact known since 1973(the year scientists managed to encrypt the Mayan hieroglyphs).Besides:who sais that the bad guys in the film are too Mayans?!
"It's a rather frustrating question since I'll never know the answer.
By the time of Cortes' first landing on San Juan de UlÃºa island near the future city of Veracruz in 1518 (no other Spaniards had landed in Mexico other than a couple of shipwrecks in 1511 or so), the Mayan city states (no where near Veracruz, where Cortes landed) had long since disappeared.
The point in this case, is very bleak, since we can assume that they won't be able to escape no matter how far they run, and will likely perish from smallpox or some other disease within a few years.
Mel Gibson obviously has some major demons but maybe that is what makes him such a masterful storyteller.Apocalypto is his latest and IMO his greatest film, this film plays out like the bastard freak brother of the Fugitive, it is wildly entertaining and violently sick, it also is an allegory of todays society.The images in this film are breathtaking, shot with the genesis digital cameras this is the best looking digital film out to date, the cinematography is superb, the costumes,make up and art direction are top notch.The acting is a real surprise since Gibson casted actors with no experience at all, yet they are convincing.What Mel Gibson has directed here is like an ultra violent yet very entertaining action/adventure chase film, the best one in years, this is a must see, and for people worrying about subtitles, do not worry, they are simple and brisk.
People who are not as familiar with exploitation cinema will probably find it crappy, since one has to perceive this film's pioneering character in order to acknowledge it adequately.
In fact, nobody else could have done it, since what we're seeing in this film - as in most of the Findlay collaborations - is a very, very personal vision, a celluloid representation of the dark demons haunting one man's mind.
I'll start by saying that it's been a few years since I read the book but a review of the film I skimmed before watching it and my own surprisingly thorough recollection indicates that Visconti's film is a rather close adaptation.
Although completely panned by critics and Visconti fans ever since its release, I happen to think that this is probably Visconti's best film.
I would have to believe Robert had only recently taken it up after the pain of losing Maurice and his overwhelming loneliness, since he doesn't seem to have friends or a life outside his computer and fiction.
I've loved Campbell Scott ever since "Longtime Companion," and his mature performance here fulfills the promise he showed in that film (also written by Lucas) over a decade ago.
The airport runway finale was the most romantic movie farewell since " Casablanca".
Anyway, I thought I should defend the film since so few are giving it its due credit.
Sure, all of the cliches are built into this film, especially the wrongfully imprisoned man (haven't the 90's been a real haven to these kinds of films ever since "The Fugitive?").
But of course hindsight's always easy, and since most people who reviewed Red Corner eight years ago never lived in mainland China, it was likewise not highly probable they would see it through the same jaded, seasoned eyes.
For example, Richard Gere (as subtle and low-key as usual) portrays Jack Moore, a US-based business person willing to forego ideals and politics in order to enter the much vaunted mainland market, hyped up to be the best thing since instant noodles, when in fact like everything in life, it too comes at a price.
Also I've got the TV on mute since I don't like listening to the dialogue.
And apparently her son's disk-man has the same dirt-floating ability, since otherwise her husband wouldn't have been able to find him under the slide.
And since it isn't worth anyone watching any further, I think I'll stop here.
I just saw it this week after not seeing it since the 70's, and the film stands the test of time marvelously -- still as fresh, funny, and involving as when I saw it originally.
It never achieves "suspension of disbelief" which is crucial in a movie, so it mostly falls on its face when it comes to really grabbing you, and that's a shame since it easily could have been so much better.
Arguably the dragon is even more distracting, since it's a huge, spectacular, golden creature.
But that aside, this is an enjoyable film and seeing those early 90s computer effects at work is always fun, especially since the ones here never try to outrun themselves.
But unfortunately since you know that you don't have control over the video game looking and that all the things you are seeing are being controlled by artists via a computer program there's no reason to become to involved in what's happening on-screen.
But since this is a section that I have never seen before, to see it at all is wonderful.
Fantasy films have been around since silent films first took the world by storm.
The Princess herself (Julanne Johnston), far from being the entrancing mystical vision who captivates and transforms the Thief is, unfortunately, almost a cypher, since her face is hidden behind a veil for much of the movie, and she's not staggeringly beautiful.
But since this is a section that I have never seen before, to see it at all is wonderful.
Well isn't that ironic, since MTV and its nauseous ilk are forever trying to ape old-school underground film makers, and they usually fall way short of the mark simply because unlike these guys, MTV are clueless.
I'm convinced that the only reason this series was a ratings success on CBS was that viewers had been watching some version of Lucy on Monday nights since the early '50s, and they were unaware that they could change the channel.
I can't really compare this show though to "The Lucy Show" since I have only seen about thirty episodes most of being color.
The main thing that was inconceivable for me was the so-called hero: Beowulf, hailed by many of his entourage (during the movie) as a savior, as a luminous figure with glorious achievements and high courage is in my eyes, as portrayed in the movie, again I repeat, a braggart, a liar and a cheater( since there is a difference between the two), a power-grabbing sell-out and a lecherous Don Juan in the worst sense of the word (no flashbacks to long-suffering Johnny Depp, please, they're in different classes).
Beowulf has been my personal favorite book ever since I read it.
Okay, this is definitely the dumbest movie I've ever seen since Satan's School for girls.
Also, maybe it's better that you're somewhat fond of Dennis Miller, since he basically carries this vampire flick.
Before I write this interview, I wanted to just explain that I have been a Dennis Miller fan since I was 11 (1994), and he was the only reason I saw this movie.
It's been almost a decade since I last saw it, so I thought I'd rewatch it.
However, he is scarred badly due to a rare disease that has disfigured his face since he was born.
Ever since he was born, Rusty delivered tough love towards her son, not to the point where he'll suffer a nervous breakdown, but just as way to keep him motivated and to blend in with people his own age like as though he was a normal child, without taking advantage of his deformity.
I have seen "Mask" many times and it remains one of my favorites, since the first time I saw it in 1986.
Those who feel it worthy to mention him at all usually hand out praise to "The Last Picture Show", but his output since that milestone - such as this and "The Thing Called Love", for example - undeservedly gets lost in the shuffle.
This movie has moved me since it first came out in the 1980's.
The Helsinki segment seems to end the film on a sad note but in my opinion, it actually says more: Although we sympathize with the two "talking" passengers since they sympathize with the taxi driver, it is again these two who are inconsiderate to their friend.
"I felt so badly, I haven't eaten meat since."
This is Zemeckis' best movie since Back to the Future and definitely one of my favourite films of the year.
What Jarmusch is going for is to contrast the social classes -- he has an obvious, unfunny line where Ryder's character says she's never been to the executive terminal at the airport before -- but what's really interesting is seeing, since Jarmusch is usually a male-oriented director, how he handles women (one a tomboy, one in a position of power).
Here since it is met with a more realistic approach, with situations that could be happening right now at night in these cities, I'm almost reminded of Renoir.
Crispin Glover is genuinely scary as the tormented and raw-boned Grendel, whose main problem is that he just can't stand the sound of people having fun, although since most of this fun consists of hairy men singing lewd songs you can see his point.
Presumable there's some connection to the opening scene, but since we don't see that in its entirety, as it is, part of that intro is pointless.
It is probably a tad too slow, which is why I can't give it the highest score, since if it had been say, five to seven minutes faster I wouldn't have had to check my watch a couple times to see how long was left.
I was an avid watcher of the television show Popular since its debut and followed it until the end.
It's the least they could do since they unceremoniously ended the series without a proper resolution (b*****ds!)
Sandra Bernhard is so harsh, she's long since left off being funny.
The video monitor displays were obviously VHS videotape, since one of the special effect for those displays was just simply visual searching back and forth throughout the scenes, with parts of the video sequences showing dropouts, probably because the tape was being worn out through excessive use during production.
The videotape version would be best, since you probably will be able to celebrate when the VCR decides to eat it.
Besides, it's been a couple of years since I've danced around the kitchen with an open wine bottle lip synching "Mambo Italiano" by Rosemary Clooney.
That should be rectified, since I consider myself a big fan of cinema, and I choose as my second enthusiastic recommendation Big Night.
Director Sorak seems to get the right lessons from the mistakes in G.O.R.A., or may be he fares better since 'Sinav' (The Exam) is his own project.
His and his pilots' achievements were dismissed, however, by battleship-loving admirals who claimed that the test was meaningless since the ship wasn't defending itself.
I'm baffled that people actually thought this was real since there are numerous clues, nay, out right examples of why this couldn't be real, how the young film maker made movies years before anyone else is actually quite silly.
If can see this on the DVD since the extras add to the magic of the film.
One of the few times since leaving kindergarten I have been completely taken for a ride and the only time I remember enjoying the trip.
I watched this again tonight - probably the 4th or 5th time I've seen it since it was first screened as an (allegedly) true doco back in 1996.
On the other hand, since she is that "obscure object of desire" (which really should be that "unobtainable object of desire"), and because Bunuel wanted to emphasize that Mathieu's desire for her had nothing to do with her personally, he used two actresses and made it clear that Mathieu didn't notice the difference!
The Bob Fosse/Debbie Reynolds seem to suffer because Debbie couldn't fully realize the moves that Fosse was giving her - especially since she was much younger than him.
in fact it was the only movie i ever saw, that was able to both analyze and illustrate the TV strategies of war reporting since operation desert storm (which it is exactly about) and the beginning new world order.
Well, I think it is obvious you were oblivious, since you didn't seem to notice the innumerable times he is shown reacting to these events, but please learn to speak for yourself.
than anything concrete since I'm still pondering the film and wondering when I'll be able to see it again.
Clint Eastwood has tackled issues of all sorts, especially since he directed 'Unforgiven' and this is his grandest film yet.
I think that this picture is the finest war story since I saw Saving Private Ryan.
I found it moving and thought-provoking in a way that nothing else has since I saw 'Molokai: The Story of Father Damien' a few years ago.
He's been assigned to work with a French officer named Richard (Tcheky Karyo), who's obviously corrupt and also calls Li by John since he can't pronounce his real name.
Jet Li proved to everyone that with the right movie material, he can show that he is rarity among martial arts actors since Li can act pretty well, which helps the audience to sympathize with Li's character.
All in all, not since "Fist of Legend" or "Once Upon a Time in China II" did I felt this good about watching Li in action.
This is definitely Jet Li's best action movie since he came over from Hong Kong.
Viewers with an interest in British history might wish to note that since the first Hanoverian came to the British throne (George I in 1714) it has been occupied by dimwits.
It is a well known fact, since the late Bruce Lee's time, that it does not matter how strong the opponent is, It matters how you quick you react and how fast you can move.
I, too, wish that there were re-runs of this wonderful program (but on one of the broadcast TV channels, since I don't have cable).
He has done the show since 1993 and is still keeping the spirit of doing talk shows and entertaining everyone.
That is when I started to like it, since BB5 it has still been a great show.
I stumbled upon in during the 3rd season premiere, and have been hooked ever since.
BB3 was the last great year and it's been a grim downhill tumble ever since, my only surprise is that anyone remotely contacted with it has the energy to drag themselves out of bed.
"Celebrity" now is synonymous in describing those who have no talent at anything accept appearing on shows like BIG BROTHER.The amount of people who have earned a career,and a lucrative one at that,from this programme since it's debut has been astonishing.Brian Dowling and Kate Lawler are just two examples,but the most remarkable was that of Jade Goody,who didn't even win the series she appeared in.She came a cropper in 2007's CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER after her misguided behaviour towards Shilpa Shetty.Now having sadly passed away after a battle against cancer,it is arguable that unscrupulous media types exploited her naivety and inarticulacy (which was in no way particularly her fault) when she was not especially conscious of such events.
The Series has gone Downhill since the Big-Brother the Experiment, when the Housemates slept with each other.
Davina McCall, who apparently has nothing better to do with her life as she's 'hosted' this mince since the very beginning, interviews that person with eyes and attitude that loudly suggest 'Who the hell are you and why are you taking up so much airtime?'
This seemed to be an action packed movie as stated in the comments that I read.I am a fan of Lou Diamond Phillips so thought it would be a good one to watch,but according to the review it was to contain violence and language,but about 15 minutes into the movie it had female nudity which I prefer not to watch in mix company,I felt let down since I rely on the ratings and that they did not state that and so we did not complete the movie.
It's been a few years since I saw this, but as I recall it was an enjoyable variation on the venerable(even by 1954) femme fatale theme, the sort of thing EC was doing month after month in Crime SuspenStories at about this same time.
I have followed her career ever since.
After having seen it a number of times-- first in the mid 1980's after if was released to negative reviews and poor box office receipts--most recently last week-- I think that THE MEAN SEASON is an under-appreciated, tightly crafted suspense thriller that, in spite of what other reviews have stated, does NOT pander to clichÃ©'s--this film is old enough to have helped establish those very same tropes that have since become clichÃ©s; remember, this was made before Manhunter, Silence of the Lambs, 15 Minutes, etc etc...and was one of the first films to deal with the whole notion of fame/celebrity/serial killers and the lack of ethics displayed by journalists, who must rank somewhere below pimps and pickpockets in terms of moral turpitude.
As to the one comment in the discussion section, yes, Mariel does indeed look a tad 'Manish' (except for the lovely set displayed in the shower of course : ) but ever since seeing 'PERSONAL BEST' (cough...) I'm afraid that I've been quite taken with her (and THAT was PRE-implants!!!)
You feel like this is Part 6 of something, since it doesn't start at the beginning.
But when his achievement hits the news, it captures the attention of the mad Dr. Emilio Lizardo (John Lithgow), who catches the story on television from his room in the insane asylum, where he has been a resident for many years, ever since his own attempt at developing an overthruster failed.
But though Lizardo's trial run with the overthruster failed, it did put him in contact with alien beings from another realm, one of whom-- Lord John Whorfin-- has since that encounter inhabited Lizardo's mind and body.
I quote that movie almost everyday since I saw it, and hope to own it on video or DVD really really soon.
I give it a 7 out of 10 since it may not be for everyone.
It has been a long time since Jan Micheal Vincent has been on 'Airwolf', and has seemingly carved a niche for himself in bad science fiction and soft-core porn flicks.
Its doubly unnecessary since anyone watching this kind of film isn't likely to have a clue what its on about and the presumed target audience of undemanding science fiction horror fans aren't likely to require such an explanation anyway.
I guess they didn't have the budget to write all that in the screenplay, since they clearly used only three sets or so.
The woman, can't remember her name, been a while since I've watched it.
I don't know if I love the film since its a too rich meal.
was the title of DC Thompson's Dandy comic that is seen next to a copy of his own book, and for some reason it's that image that has always stayed with me since '81.
A real person would have given up on both of those women since they are obviously defective.
This all is surprising, since the budget present was high.
Well, this is basically an average Columbo movie in every way thinkable but since all of the Columbo movies are such of high quality and features a great and successful formula, this movie is also a perfectly good one to watch.
Especially since we know who does the crime after the first ten minutes, we love surprises in how Columbo catches his man or woman.
The black and white to color switches, the acting, the actors, the music i found it really well done as well it should be since it is so well loved in Russia.
Ever since The Godfather and Apocalypse Now I've been a big Coppola fan.
When he actually made the film in 1987, Joe Jackson provided the hopped-up big band licks and gave Mr. Coppola his best score since Rumblefish.
Jeff Bridges' character he portrays is a cheerful, mind-mannered guy who dreamed of making these autos since his childhood.
i wouldn't normally post my opinion here, but since someone else already has, i'll just say this - i thought this is one of the worst films ever.
The collection of superior performances by so many fine actors in one series has probably not happened since - it surely did not happen before.
When I rented this on video, a few years ago, my mother (who has passed away since) commented on how she would watch this back in the 70's, absolutely fascinated by it.
Most of which were little known then but have since gone on to become better-known.
OK, the title can be misleading, since apart from the setting of the town this one has little relationship with Stephen King's novel Salem's Lot or Tobe Hooper's film version of it.
Ricky Addison Reed doesn't appear to have done any other film or TV work before or since, & it's not at all surprising.
Because of this, there is an air of tension and sadness in the main character since she knows that each tryst will end with rejection and emotional pain.
I've had to make do with a full-frame edition culled from TV with forced Spanish subtitles to bootÂbut which is appropriate in this case, since the director actually hails from that country!
Ever since I first heard that the book by Erling Jepsen was being put into a movie I have been anticipating its release since I have read the book with much pleasure and since I have actually worked on that mental institution Sanne is committed to.
Name a slasher since the big three that has added anything new to this genre...more graphic gore is not setting a trend...blair witch was absolutely a yawner...and i am guessing the same people yapping at this movie loved Blair Witch...what an awesome idea treating it as behind the scenes documentary for the first half...sure it was predictable....name a slasher or any other movie for that matter that isn't...sure there were movies that have shocked us but they are few and far between...as to protecting people...relax those protector's also love the nanny state and probably need people to protect them from things like horrible flicks.
This movie would probably be the best horror satire since Wes Craven's Scream.
A minor thing that kind of bugged me was that this movie promotes two big stars (Robert Englund and Zelda Rubinstein) as if they were the greatest things since sliced bread.
There are really so many things I want to blab about concerning this great deconstruction of the slasher horror genre, one of the best since the first SCREAM installment.
Well, since he's not even listed on the IMDb, that seems likely to remain a mystery!
And since Tarantino style post modernism is fashionable make sure you steal lines from films like SPLIT SECOND or JAWS because the critics will think you`re a genius .
We are supposed to smile and thrill at the same time, but in reality all that scene is simply idiotic and it's a misplaced step that bring us to hate that character since the starting.
Its been awhile since I saw the film, but I do rememeber that this film does not live up to its expecatations at all.
I have had a crush on Randolph Mantooth since I was a teenager.
I saw this for the first time since I was 7-8 years old, I had a fuzzy memory that she took the downward spiral, went into seclusion and then came back with a roar singing THE ROSE in concert ending the movie.
I have yet to see the Glass Menagerie performed live, and really have nothing much more to say now about the motion picture versions, except that further commentary may very well be forthcoming since my mind has been activated on the subject more than ever before thanks to websites like this.
Considering this is a Tennessee Williams play being dramatized, it's not hard to make this assumption--especially since homosexuality is a theme in several of his other plays AND since Williams was gay.
Many great actresses have been associated with the role of Amanda Wingfield since this play made its Broadway debut in the 1940s: Laurette Taylor, Katharine Hepburn, Joanne Woodward, Maureen Stapletobm Jessica Tandy, Julie Harris, and Jessica Lange have all played the role on stage, film, or TV.
The last 5 minutes, with slow-motion photography and soaring music (pre-dates "Chariots of Fire" -1981), better illustrates male bonding than anything seen before or since.
It's worth remembering that this was still only twenty years since the emergence of the first extensive film productions, and that it would have been sophisticated in its day.
If you haven't seen it since the first few episodes, take a look at it now.
I have been watching the series since the beginning, seeing the 5th episode yesterday.
And since it's production is in Vancouver, it should be immune from the writer's strike.
At this point I figured out the missing thingamabob is in dad's old watch the one Flash has worn since his dad died, so much for secrecy.
I guess I shouldn't be surprised, SciFi Channel hasn't done science fiction since they took the 4th Season option to cancel Farscape.
I picked this DVD off the shelf and flipped it around, looking for the tipoff that this was, indeed, a British flick, since it is called "For Queen and Country".
It was also good to see Hogan in another theatre release, since he really hadn't appeared in one since he starred with Elijah Wood in 1996's Flipper.
As an actor, she is talented, has an extremely natural screen presence and is absolutely gorgeous; it's a shame she hasn't made more than a half dozen movies or so since `Dundee II' in 1988.
It's been a very long time since I've seen a movie with my children that did not have to rely on gross-out humor just to get a laugh.
Under the direction of Sidney Poitier the film is a lot of fun to watch, but in viewing it again after so many years since we last saw it, the film feels flat, at times.
on the basis that since he had been away at war, his country of origin had gained independence and therefore he was not entitled to a British passport.
Things for people that have served in the British army have changed since and I am sure that this film played a part albeit minor.
The one with orange hair looks like a cat LOL and he is the funniest little man since that other guy I like.
I hadn't seen Stir Crazy since at least the early 1980s.
Recently I had a chance to rewatch Gene Wilder's The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother (1975), which I hadn't seen since the 1970s, and I was a bit disappointed.
Returning home means for him returning to people who got stuck in this ghetto, since it is a kind of a ghetto, deprived of any future, of any hope for better future.
And since that isn't the plot point that the movie hinges on, it doesn't feel like it matters in the end.
Here he finds that not much has changed since he left about 10 years beforehand.
And naturally, since the plot demands it, the most virginal female character just *must* "fall in love" with him, even though she recognizes his purely evil nature.
There's a chance for a slice of life movie about a bookie who's as ethical as such a profession will allow him to be and what happens when the vultures want to muscle in--a particularly annoying plot point by the way, since Falk's character has said he's retiring in a year and we believe him.
Having his not too dependable under-link Uncle Pete, Frank Vincent, break in his coke sniffing nephew Tony Cisero, Freddie Prince Jr, as both Vinnie's partner and muscle man, debt collector, Locasso made the biggest blunder since Hitler invaded the USSR back in June 1941.
National Lampoon has gone downhill since their "5 Deadly Sins" movie.
A short such as 'Chute' with Al Parker and the far more gorgeous and naturally sexy Colt model Toby (it would be interesting to know what has happened to this long-ago, never-surpassed porn icon as well; I only know he is apparently still alive, but there must be something, since such illustrious authorities as 'Smutjunkies' have decided that, if they do know anything, it's on the q.t.)
There's been no one like him since.
Well, since we didn't see them die, I assumed they did.
But, I guess since she has big eyes and 2 x chromosomes, then that makes it okay?
This isolation has kept the accent there mostly unaltered since the 17th century days when it was inhabited by British seamen.
Luckily the monster is shown in shadow and darkness frequently so we can't always see whats going on, which is good since it adds a sense of mystery to the proceedings that Beast is lacking.
The film has a few problems, its slight and a bit tricky to care about proceedings, it could have done with more havoc, more personality and more of the monster bringing death to individuals, preferably by eating, since the radiation effect looks a little weak in practice even though the burn effects are good.
The funny thing is since they could care less IF they sell any luggage, the customers start frequenting the store in droves.
One problem though; ever since crime rose with 400% in 1987, New York has become one giant and demarcated prison where criminals determine their own "civilization".
Especially the first sixty minutes of this movie are terrific, since there constantly is the introduction of new and imaginative characters.
In fact, this was the first feature of the two writers involved and they haven't written another film since, presumably due to its lacklustre showing at the box office.
Dougray Scott has appeared in over a dozen movies since Twin Town, including Deep Impact, Enigma and of course MI2.
All we seem to have had since then is a load of cgi filled soulless film equivalent of a fast food outlet (Hancock?).
It's been over two months since I've seen it, and I still laugh when I think of certain scenes.
I haven't seen something like this since the Holy Grail.
Not since "Olsenbanden ser rÃ¸dt" have a Danish comedy been so funny.
This was probably the best VMA's since 1992.
I guess, the problem is, the jokes used in that film are really old and pretty used for us Germans, because Otto Waalkes used them since the beginning of his career.
It's been a long time since I've seen the French "La Cage aux Folles," and I saw the musical on Broadway as well.
It's the best golf comedy since Caddyshack (1980) and really puts you in the golfing spirit.
Happy Gilmore is probably one of the funniest movies since this day.
Here, Sander is even more vocal and violent than normal and definitely more crude, which is saying something since this actor usually doesn't play guys with a lot of class.
Indigo young people and children been on earth since Atlantis and up until the 1970's !
its all about DNA .. they have been being born in huge numbers since 1975 and are here to herald in a new age of light, love & communication on earth.
So much history involving both celebrities of a bygone Hollywood era, but also political significance since it was in the Ballroom kitchen that Robert Kennedy was assassinated.
It has been a long time since a film has begun with such a brutal punch!
It's almost 30 years since I last watched Chico, but I still remember the theme song after all this time.
The rest was hilarious as well especially with the title animal causing havoc with the boys and scaring an African-American porter played by Dudley Dickerson though one may pause a little bit before laughing since that was a stereotype of that race at the time.
The boy promptly goes to school and tells everyone he comes into contact with what he saw, but since he's prone to exaggeration and tall tales nobody believes him.
Of course, since there's no indication that Caine cleaned up the crime scene and since the film takes place not in a big city but in a more remote part of England, you would think something would turn up to corroborate the boy's story.
I note that the director's children appear in this and that none of them have found a great deal of movie work since.
Story  Simple and to the point it was just good ol Revenge..Nice gratuitous violence =) Aborted babies always a good for a cheer in my book(You'll have to see the flick to understand how messed up it is)!..I liked also the constant hits of coke etc prob most coke hits since Scarface lol..  Acting  John Fallon who played Rane was solid the rest of the cast ranged from decent to passable(I felt weakest acting wise was female cop)..I Rane's coked up buddy he was cool and I liked the two Fhorensic Cops cracking the jokes.
It's nymphomania and it's not good for you since anything in excess doses is not good for you- whether it's food consumption, drugs, alcohol etc.
That is a bit hard to take, although in the context of the investigation, it makes sense, since Lloyd has been following an invisible enemy.
The director, Moussa Sene Absa's did a below average job directing, since there are scenes that are shot in the day then suddenly are in the night time.
I sure watched this movie too late at night and since the pacing is slooooow (and thats still a compliment) it got hard to focus on the plot.
Anyway, the plot is fairly solid, though I did find at least one of the ending plot twists useless and incomprehensible, but since it really affected nothing else in the film, I ignored it.
and hands down, the best freakin' cinematography that I've seen since..., well, since Fight Club!
Other reviewers seem to miss a motive for the atrocities, a reason for the escalation, apart from Ruths obvious derangement and general frustration with life, and ask why the others (especially since they're still kids) join in so easily.
Its been a really really long time since I seen a movie this intensely horrifying.
the only people who should really be offended by this are saddam hussein (but not really since he's a... anyways) and winona ryder (since her piece didn't make any sense).
B) It's the best movie musical made since MGM left the mass-production business.
I've been watching the show since it started back in '97, so of course i went and saw the movie when it opened.
I hadn't seen a former music-video director operate with such authority in the realm of mainstream cinema (and, come to think of it, I haven't seen one since).
This movie is so great it's hard not to love it, especially since it made the Book of World Records for 399 swear words and 128 offensive gestures.
Not since Pynchon's "Gravity's Rainbow" has a work of art so subversively exploited the conventions of the movie musical as South Park.
I can honestly say that I haven't laughed so hard since Office Space.
Maybe part of the problem is that the film is definitely targeted towards a British audience and since I'm American, I don't get it but I think that even the English would find it dated today.
Sadly, since this is a public domain title, it's hard to find a good copy of it.
Osamu Tezuka, who created "Astro Boy" and has since been hailed as "the God of Manga," turned his back on a career in medicine to write stories about an android "Pinocchio" whose feats of strength and speed more than match the DC Comics' hero Superman.
And yes, up front, I know that as a 25 year-old I'm too young to have loved the classic and too old to be the target audience, but I haven't felt this alienated by a film since the stink bomb that was Legend of Despereaux.
But since this movie has a lot of action in it, Kids will most likely have a blast and adults will probably enjoy it.
Case in point: the second act builds heavily on Ham Egg being portrayed as a replacement fatherly figure and an all around good guy but all of a sudden, he turns on Astro Boy with no justification since his introduction.
Awesome animation, since The Incredibles and Meet the Robinsons.
Unlike some others, I have no problem with some of the revisions to the underlying plot since they do help bring some of the book's major issues into somewhat sharper focus.
The Ehlinger film's animators may not have had the resources to make as slick a film as Travis', but they obviously gave a great deal of thought to what they were doing (or maybe not, since the necessary designs were all in the book).
But since it is hard to explain the 3rd dimension to "A Square" the 2D character and the audience are transported into the 3rd dimension inhabited by spheres, cubes etc.
This is a thinking person's film and since I've seen it, I've been trying to explain to my cat what a solid is.
The free world means almost slavery, since people without papers have no rights.
I normally don't go for grisly films, especially those with Brad Pitt, but since it had such a good write up on rottentomatoes, and I am such a bad movie theater goer these days, I couldn't really pass it up - even if it meant sitting through almost 30 minutes of commercials as is wont on New Zealand TV.
We usually let that go if the acting and the rest of the movie is decent since we know they can only do what their budget allows but this just compounded the horror of the movie.
Ghost Watcher 2 is now out, we'll rent it since we want to see if the 2nd part to this "film" could possibly get any worse!
Even though I found this distressing, I had to give Billy West credit for accuracy ... since several genuine Chaplin shorts from this period also include Jewish stereotypes.
I had avoided The Derby Stallion ever since it came out, because I was so much more concerned with other movies(but of course), and one day it was about time to leave the movie rental place, so I just grabbed it and ran on, and now I'm glad I got it.
And it's definitely not Zac Efron jumping, obviously, since none of the camera angles are of his whole body during the entire race scene.
This is big part in the film since tension comes from everyone, and not just racially focused on the typical black and white.
Of course, since 2000, Linux has made great strides into the server market, the desktop market (even Walmart sells computers with Linux now), and the embedded market.
A whole generation has passed since then, and there is a new wave of techniques and tools available to the filmmaker of the nineties.
Although the DVD transfer may be awful too, I think this movie may have been made in the original 2 strip Technicolor process (since it was in 1937) which always has a blue tinge to it.
That kind of humor is rare for a movie that's 60 years old-- I haven't seen/heard these jokes duplicated in a movie since.
I knew it'd be memorable, since I've yet to meet a Ben Hect script I didn't love, I am very fond of Carole Lombard and Frederic March is one of the most under-appreciated actors of all time.
Oh, you need to put Political Correctness aside--the only serious point I make--since there is insensitivity, racial and otherwise.
However, since the film is a brilliant satire on the phoniness of those who take themselves too seriously, it is natural that when these people see themselves in it, they will be offended.
Technically Shivers is a little on the rough side but this is to be expected since it was Cronenberg's first film, having said that it's not badly made but it's just not as polished as maybe you might expect from Cronenberg.
Somehow, the patina of years passed since the filming of this movie has rendered "Shivers" a more gut-wrenching experience.
Well, whatever inspired him to make it, Cronenberg in turn 'infected' countless other filmmakers with his vision of parasitic terror, and many, many horror films since have duplicated the SHIVERS vibe, (NIGHT OF THE CREEPS, THE HIDDEN, SLUGS and most recently the excellent SLITHER, just to name a few.)
The movie really should have been titled, "Death Valley: The Revenge of Earl" since I think he steals the show with his cocaine-as-supercharger routine.
I've waded through lots of zombie movies trying to find some good ones.And since Romero has only made 5 there aren't very many good ones among the loads of stinkers out there.This one was one of the worst pieces of homemade garbage I've seen yet in my quest to find good zombie movies.
Suffice to say I have never seen so evil and complicated a plan in a movie before or since.
I liked JTT's segment more since the story hit close to home ( I am not gay but considering he is a senior in high school going of to college).
I truly loved Brittany and Jonathan's performances since they are much more younger and less experienced than the actors in the third segment.
For an example, in Stray Dog, the effect of heat is barely felt since it's hard to ditinquish heat waves and the color differentaces in skin tones that show how moist skin is and how sun burnt it is.
It's only been 4 years since the dreadful A-bombings and the subsequent defeat of Japan in WW2 and both the country and the people are deeply scarred.
I haven't seen it since I was a kid but the memory of that climactic collective murder still makes me wince.
I don't believe that it could have been "workmanlike" in any way since I remember the feelings so strongly.....A "Workmanlike" made film could not have made that happen to me...I would really like to see it again as an adult....I hope I can find it on DVD.
Also since that time I have seen other movies that Victor Von Wright, has played in and they also were very good.
And, as many have found out before and since, if you lash out at society, society will hit back - and you find that society has a lot more weapons than a microphone.
But since I'm a fan of his work I think I might be a little biased.
Well, since Tarantino's remake is in the air, the accessibility of this film has widened a bit, and I managed to catch a midnight showing.
They decide to flee to Switzerland, which is not easy, since they have both the Military Police and the Germans against them... Basically, the five unite all the characteristics that the twelve members of the "Dirty Dozen" had.
The only notable thing about this film is that one of its characters is (coincidentally) named Kevin Murphy, appropriate since Mystery Science Theater 3000's Tom Servo is voiced by an actor sharing that name.
Even the title is unappropriated, since there is no peculiar paranoid in this movie.
OK, so in my opinion this is either the most brilliant satire on the action genre done by those who write and direct in it, or it is the worst possible action piece of crap since Segal's Into the Sun.
You can imagine how prized those vintage gowns are today, especially since so many were ruined in the filming of Titanic.
I don't know why Jane & John weren't used in the original series (The Winds of War) since they were so marvelous and believable and held true to their characters throughout.
But I'm a big fan of biography movies, so I decided to give this movie a shot, since I like Dustin Hoffman and also a world of stand up comedy.
It's been so long since I've seen this movie it's been about five years since I've seen this film.
She first begins to use it, but then is told by Susan that it's too late, implying that since he's already dead, the potion would do no good since it's meant to heal injuries only.
Peter, I can understand, since he's a kid, but the witch should have been a lot smoother using the dual swords.
Or how those videos that they show in driver's training look like they haven't been updated since the conversion from BETA to VHS?
One might argue that they give the film emotional weight (or some such crock), but they really don't, especially since they don't really have any bearing later.
I had been waiting for it ever since it was announced, so of course I couldn't pass up the chance to see a press preview this morning.
I saw this film during it's initial release in the theaters but have only seen it twice since then.
I remember seeing only one Lash LaRue film as a kid growing up, but the image of the black clad cowboy brandishing a bull whip has remained with me ever since.
Seeing one of these "B" Westerns some sixty years after they were made is a neat exercise in nostalgia, and only goes to show how far films have come since the good old days.
I picked up a DVD of this British series from the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC and it's fitting that a filmmaker be featured prominently in an art gallery--especially since this film isn't a biography of Chaplin, but a step-by-step analysis of his working style.
I really liked this, since GOLD RUSH might just be my very favorite silent film (though it's hard to say for sure, considering some of the great films of Lloyd and Keaton).
I've long since decided that Myrna Loy was one of the most underused actresses of her time.
When he tries to get one he is effectively laughed at since he is 28-years-old and is very much out of practice and indeed never really practiced that much.
The non-Francophone teacher is a brilliant conceit in this respect - since we do not understand the Chinese (non subtitles) the drama moves from dialogue about the piano to the physicality of the exchanges between the characters.
He DID render the whole thing believable, because I am not a fan of classical music either, and I had that music from that film in my mind ever since.
On a chance encounter of his mothers old manager, his love of playing the piano is rekindled; not since played from his mothers death.
he is invited for an audition and since then his life is filled with his passionate pursuit of his dream.
I just keep wondering why there isn't a love interest yet for the President since he did say in the first movie that he is a widower.
But overall, it was a great movie, that unfortunately hasn't come to DVD yet, so I hope since "First Shot" has, this one will finally make it.
This was her second movie with Gary Cooper since her appearance in William A. Wellman's superb, high adventure 'Beau Geste,' and her third with director Hathaway...  Richard Widmark proceeds his ways of gambling with a neat line in cynical cracks; Cameron Mitchell fails in his unwelcome sexual advances; Hugh Marlowe uses a variety of both conscious and unconscious processes to deal with his angry feelings; Victor Manuel Mendoza gets intensely angry after being hit; and Rita Moreno delights the environment with her sweet voice...  Hathaway was one of the great Hollywood veterans still in harness, a versatile director whose Westerns have been as variable in quality as his other films... Filmed on location in Mexico, his 'Garden of Evil' is a beautiful spectacle to behold...
It's only been THREE DAYS since the little darling's death, and they are splitting up because they just can't handle the grief (this explains why Dunne is packing to leave Grant throughout the current time scenes in the film).
Dunne wrote to the kind adoption lady telling her their tragedy as soon as the girl died, and before Dunne has a chance to leave Grant for good, the adoption lady informs the couple (who have yet to make up and are just as miserable as ever - remember it has only been three days since their little girl died) that the agency just got in a sweet little boy (two years old, golden curls, the sort of kid they thought they wanted to adopt before they saw their baby girl), and would they be interested in seeing him?
This wonderful film has been a perennial favorite of mine, ever since I first saw it as a small boy.
The movie depicts in a very real, truthful way, everyday vignettes in the lives of this couple since they first meet, with plenty of dialogue (some viewers may find it kind of "talky"), but nonetheless of a very honest kind.
What bothers me the most is the fact that the makers seem to have picked a the girl's country of origin at random - since they weren't going to check any facts out before shooting.
There are no catholic schools for girls in Stockholm, at least not of importance, since catholicism is a less important religion than Islam in Sweden.
I watched this movie the very first time it was aired on october 1992 and have watched every rerun on lifetime since.
The film is simply huge (though not done on a huge budget) and I bemoan Philip Kaufman's film-making choices since.
These astronauts cooperate with this mischaracterization since it fits well their monumental egos, but the director makes clear in myriad,nuanced ways (like during the fan dance in the Astrodome) that deep inside they know they are shams in comparison to those slogging away at Edwards without media attention and unearned perks.
Probably the greatest since Columbus, nearly 500 years earlier.
The acting and the directing were terrific.They put me back to a time of my youth that has been long since forgotten.
For some reason this story touched something deep inside me and I've loved it ever since.
I am tempted to buy this movie, but then, I don't see why I should since one viewing seems to have grafted these images onto my very soul.
Not since Rossellini and De Sica had a filmmaker, in this case Isao Takahata, touched a nerve so deeply etched out in deconstructing the horrors of wartime.
Setsuko even goes to the doctor, since she is with malnutrition and diarrhea, but in war times, everything gets even more difficult.
And I canÂ´t help feeling like Seita, her brother - because my daughter and I are alone since my wife left us a few months ago.
What happens to them should be seen by anyone thinking of starting a war since it tells very graphically what happens to those often forgotten, the children.
The animation is beautiful, though certainly not dated by any means (even though Japanese animation has progressed well since this film was made).
Visions of this film have haunted me since first watching it, and I would find it hard to watch again, simply from it being so heart-wrenching.
Great film.......I laughed, I cried and I've done a lot of thinking and reminiscing since seeing it.
I love this actor, ever since I saw him as a kid in two movies I loved, Ivanhoe and The Scarlett Pimpernel.
However, the controversy was generated by opera purists, since from a purely artistic viewpoint, not to mention a strictly cinematic one, LA TRAVIATA has never been so well expressed, in fact no opera has.
Placido Domingo and Zeffirelli have since made more opera movies, and they are all excellent.
This was entirely unnecessary since Clampett had already made the great one-bunny show with 'What's Cookin', Doc?'.
My only regret is that they did not make sequels out of the second and third Lavransdatter novels to complete the trilogy, since, indeed, the ending of the movie and of the first novel leave you hungering for more.
It is a testament to this film's lasting power which, unfortunately, remains limited only to Serbian filmgoers since an English-dubbed DVD is still nowhere in sight.
Odds are you'll know whats going on, but you won't mind since the cast is the real reason to see this.
Spike comes off as a big idiot who is only capable of sleeping and eating, his fighting abilities appear forced so that Mr. Watanabe wouldn't be stuck with the dumbest lead character since that (insert following curse word: combine the one which begins with "s" and ends with "t" + the British slang one which is "a" + "r" + "s" + "e") from DNA2.
They don't water down the show so kids can understand, and since their target audience is not kids it gives the chance to do whatever they want.
Fey is also not a role model since she dresses like a hooker from California and has a gambling addiction.
True, the romance between Katharine Grayson and Howard Keel isn't very interesting, and except for "Make Believe," you'll have to yawn through most of their numbers since you can't understand either one of them.
Unfortunately, since she had the best body, the rest of the movie sucks even worse).
He's the spoiled rich boy in a girl meets boy story striving for a Cinderella touch, since the girl is a poor waitress posing as the daughter of a rich couple so that they can mingle with high society.
8/10 : The best British horror film since the brilliant 'An American Werewolf In London'  Now comes the wait for 'Dog Soldiers'!
Long Time Dead is one of those horror films that has nothing really wrong with it & entertains to a certain extent but suffers by being just so average a few script problems that should have been ironed out especially since four people worked on the thing.
Its been a long time since I have seen a low budget British film that I have enjoyed and this came as a pleasant surprise, it is well filmed but doesn't go down the route of trying to be too clever.
(or "imbibition") Technicolor prints are becoming increasingly scarce treasures since Technicolor stopped U.S. production of them in 1974.
If you've enjoyed anything Steven Seagal has made since Under Seige, here's another no-brainer for you.
I won't even start to list the inconsistencies of this flick or explain the foolishness presented in the flick, since doing so will generate quite a long list.
The whole "A-Team," including Mr. T at his meanest, maybe 45 seconds, since they usually have some armored vehicles.
(He also has to be certain none of the lady guests are harmed, since there is a party involved.)
Ever since I was a little girl, I loved Darkwing Duck!
I've often thought that a hero can only be measured by his nemesis and unfortunately none of the Darkwing Duck bad guys are up to much, but that's fine since Darkwing himself is sort of incompetent.
In what is sure to be one of the most intriguing yet bizarre pictures to come about since the work of Fellini, Luis Bunuel directs this dramedy picture about the random incidents and moments that come about in the thought of the mind, yet somehow reflect on the hypocrisies of society and man.
What moved me the most was how, after basically watching movies since I was born, I realized just how programmed I was to the standard structure of film narrative that each transition by BuÃ±uel struck even more drastically than the last.
And in fact, since this movie deals with liberty and with persons of very different cultural, religious and aesthetic backgrounds, it is a sociological movie.
But faeces play an important role in Bunuel's "Phantom of Liberty" (so the English title of this movie), too: The teacher explains his friends how many kilograms of faeces a human produces daily, and since there are so and so many billions of people on this world, this makes so and so many tons of faeces per year.
Through many episodes with some linking points since 1808 in Toledo (Spain) to the present days in France, Bunuel presents a delicious surrealistic satire to the moral and costumes of the hypocrite society, to the family values and to the church.
"Le FantÃ´me de la LibertÃ©" is perhaps BuÃ±uel's least accessible work since his first two films, "Un Chien Andalou" and "L' Age d' Or".
So far, so good--both are wonderful actresses and I had my hopes set VERY high since they were in the film.
However the main problem with this film is not that the women's movement has moved on 70 years since the film was made - 1930's comedies are after all, remembered for the strong and independent heroines and Fred is of course made to regret and reconsider his words and actions.
The supporting cast is also quite strong: Richard Barthelmess and Harry Carey (both of whom had been stars in the Silent era and had since settled in character roles) appear as Dietrich and Wayne's sidekicks respectively Â the former is shady and the latter hot-headed, and each prefers to settle arguments with a weapon (Barthelmess a flick-knife and Carey the shotgun he calls "Betsy").
Sure, since it's a John Wayne flick you KNOW that he will win in the end and you KNOW what to expect.
I always enjoy seeing Harry Carey in a movie, and this role is particularly neat, since he was one of Wayne's idols.
This is the fourth of five filmed versions of Rex Beach's redoubtable northern classic and since it's the only one out on video, it's the one best known to movie audiences.
Since his trademark series "Blade" came to a close in 2004, Wesley has been really almost hitting rock bottom since then.
70% of scenes are at brothel, which is unusual, since most CSIs are usually at lab.
I see by his resume here that he hadn't acted for four years until this little part, and hasn't acted since.
I saw this movie in England when it first came out and it has stayed with me ever since.
I don't remember when was the first time that I hear something about this film but since then and when I saw the trailer it becomes for me the film to check this year.
Like the other reviews said, the spoken word of the movie can be very hard to understand since the actors are speaking a language other than their native tongue, but when I turned on the subtitles, they turned out to be almost completely nonsensical!
The local inhabitants have long since fled and those that have stayed behind have been living in terror ever since.
I wasn't expecting much of it since i only went to the theatre to see Alexandra Mutu who was sooo hot, but i was far worse than i had expected it to be.A poor plot, poor characters(except Garcea who makes you laugh a few times only because of the stupidity), crap acting and crap directing.The beginning made me wanna know what the heck i was doing there in the first place, the Skol beer advertising was horrible and the character - director interaction from the movie, which was intended to be fun was just bad taste.The TV show is far better.
It has been far too long since a straight romanian comedy was made.
I was really hoping they would since it was Valentine's day.
Maybe this man's not an expert, but he apparently was an idiot--especially since this moron returns to the island later in the film!
The alternate versions listing for the film mentions that the film was somewhat trimmed for its original release which is unsurprising, since the film has a nice amount of bloodshed for a British film of the period, as well as some nudity and even a spot of entertaining thrusting sex.
For example, one of the main actresses constantly wears a bikini-top, which ranks as one of the hottest ones since Raquel Welsh's in `One Billion Years B.C.'.
I just think Lawrence Kasdan (who wrote the script) should've just made Whitney's character a singer, since we never see her act in this film.
The 'Compo's Funeral' episode was very touching but in my opinion, this should have been the show's final episode, ever since then, the show's quality has declined rapidly.
This programme has been one of British televisions centre pieces since the first pilot episode.
Banderas fans should note that his chemistry with a female costar hasn't been this good since his hookup with Catherine Zeta-Jones in Zorro.
Don Andres hires a huge man from the slaughterhouse, a man who adores him since he has been a mentor for his entire life, and the man he hires is determined to strike fear into the hearts of anyone who would dare to stand against this wonderful man.
There is a lot going on here that deals with superficial impressions, since Pedro, the Brute (played by Pedro ArmendÃ¡riz, who, as an unfortunate side note, committed suicide in 1963), is completely determined to help Don Andres but then changes his mind entirely once he gets close to the people that he is sent out to scare into submission.
I will likely watch this movie many more times since my friend owns a DVD and I am buying one.
He plays a young Indian man named Kisna, who falls in love with a young British girl (played by Antonia Bernath) who has loved him since they were toddlers.
This movie  is beautifully crafted, and features Winona Ryders best  performance since Little Women.
Quite possibly the worst actually since Day of the Dead:Contagium and Zombie Night are right down there in the sewer with this worthless piece of garbage.
An Oscar winner for the costumes--appropriate since the picture is really all style.
THE AGE OF INNOCENCE is a meticulous, beautiful film with glowing production values and a pallet of production techniques not seen since CITIZEN KANE.
I think that, cinematically, it is the best picture Scorsese's done since Raging Bull.
I have seen "The Age of Innocence" about 15 times since 1994, and find the argument as to whether it is boring or not to be fascinating.
His technique forces us to really watch the story, to look for details, overt and covert, since like the opening montage of roses in bloom at the beginning of the credits, this is a movie of deep contemplation -- not because of the lush images, but because of the subtle game of tradition which is being played behind the curtains, just out of the camera's view.
Serial Mom worked because we knew what we were getting into when the film was released, but since there was no real clue in the promos, it was baffling - and I love that.
If not a .07 would be about correct since there is awful and then, well there is this movie.
This makes (the only bright spot) Bela Lugosi angry since he is in love with her and so he turns Mitchell into a gorilla.
Ever since, I've been on the lookout for the movie in any form, and today was my lucky day, in a manner of speaking.
But it could after all have actually happened, since Passaic, New Jersey isn't that far from the Bronx Zoo!
Don't get me wrong I love bad movies but this is something else, or Sammy is, since if one could remove him from the film then you'd have something someone might want to watch.
After seeing this I must take back anything I've ever said bad about Jerry Lewis, since as annoying as he can be, at least he is funny.
Nothing I have seen since has caused me to change my mind.
Let's start with a shallow story, awkward pacing, loads of unmotivated 360 degree jump cuts, inconsistent character super powers, recycled explosion footage, unresolved two dimensional character issues, inconsistencies in alien monsters, and perhaps some of the worst secondary character acting I've seen since Hercules Goes Bananas.
I thought that with Andy Lau and Rosamund Kwan in the film that it would be decent, but I should have expected to be as crappy as it was since it had Wong Jing in it.
Rediscovering Lelouch on DVD, not having seen his films since they were aired on TV in the 70s and 80s, I enjoy them even more than expected.
After more than 25 years since they released their first album, they are still going strong!
Many mini-series have since come and gone, but very few match it in quality or in hauntingly evoking an era.
TV has really gone downhill since programmes like this were made.
I have seen this series again since the first American run in 1977, so I'm not relying only on dim memory.
I also tried TV Guide.com's Q & A, but since I couldn't remember the name, all I could do was give my best guest at the actors, and that I remember that the logo was a pink rose.
Whether the audience was ready for the show will remain a mystery, since few people ever had the opportunity to see it.
Well, since everything these days is "all that and a bag of chips" no matter how bad it is, I was pleasantly surprised that this was as good as it was.
Anyway, a video store owner is the first to be visited by a zombie, and since the sheriff is out of town and the deputy went back to the place of some woman he went out with last night (who just happened to live in Panama City, Florida), the town is without an authority figure, so the video store guy plops the corpse in the lobby of the sheriff's office with a post-it note stuck to its forehead (for the sheriff to call him on Monday, of course).
And, since he's no longer a household name, it's not surprising that this film is very much unknown.
since I am a hugh fan of that 70's show, i had the feeling that this show was gonna be a step down.
All the jokes are predictable and stale, and the subject itself is somewhat offensive since it seems to (yet again, as in "Taxi" or "Hitch") justify racially-tinged humor at white guys without taking the same swipes at the other races dishing it out.
and Verney i love him too but since Ashton is more in my age range i like him more he attractive too uh oh i think i have a crush anyway they say i have to write ten line so I'm just killing words.
'Guess Who' is a good reflection of the changes in society since the Sydney Portier version was made many decades ago.
And now, since 2003, we have Adam Vardy's "Mendy", a masterpiece of authenticity, with exactly the right balance of hidden critique and irony, illusion and satire, a real "Laughing under Tears", as Dr. Salcia Landmann had characterized the work of Sholem-Alejchem.
The whole crew plays formidably - namely: adequately - whoever has a bit of an idea what happened with the grand ... grand children of the great Eastern Eruopean Yiddish speaking Ã©migrÃ©s since World War I, recognizes that Vardy's portrait is that of a linguistic connoisseur and a competent social insider.
Not necessarily major faults, but if in the market for hard-hitting content, look elsewhere, let alone since Rice Rhapsody does attempt a dabble in the more controversial, namely homosexuality, but stops short of genuinely addressing issues of any meaningful disposition.
Furthermore, the decision to make this into a Singapore-based item seems random and bizarre, especially since the main character and star obviously insist on reverting to what sounds suspiciously akin to Taiwanese (Chang's from Taiwan in case you were wondering).
And since Anthony Ainley was already doing for Roger Delgado what Richard Hurndall was doing for William Hartnell, there was no problem with The Master.
(Actually, I only wasted about an hour and 15 minutes, since I fast forwarded through everything that didn't have subtitles...and I was still bored.)
Gerard Depardieu is a terrific actor but he just ain't priest material and it's been a long time since he (And Sean Connery and Harrison Ford and a few others) could play a believable romantic hero opposite a (much, much) younger actress.
I regret only the disappointing end, since the plot deserved a better conclusion.
Times have changed since then, and I recently viewed the film a couple of times, when I wrote subtitles to it so I could show it to a close friend.
The book (1971) was banned in France, ostensibly for too much erotic content, but the Foreign Department may have influenced this, since the story gives a decadent impression of them.
These days, it's hard to imagine that there was indeed an erotic cinema before EMMANUELLE as the film's style as well as its substance have forever influenced and perhaps tainted the genre since with its exotic locations, lifestyles of the idle rich and empty philosophies on the nature of love, fidelity and jealousy.
It is quite fascinating to watch this character develop from a wide eyed innocent, into a free-thinking sexual being, a woman not afraid to enjoy what men have enjoyed since the dawn of time.
After the initial shock of seeing this 'soft porn' (I can call it soft porn now since I've seen regular adult movies/X rated porn against this!
This is the worst film I've seen since Gigli.
It's a shame Honore didn't realise that before releasing the film, or we could have been looking at the funniest film since 'Airplane'.
Sadly, instead we are looking at the most pretentious (and I hardly ever use that word) film since someone handed Asia Argento a camera.
Another interesting and quite original aspect is the unusual number of French collaborators, since it is very difficult to see a movie that recognizes that they did exist in times of war.
If you can find it playing at your local Jewish Film Festival (about the only place you are likely to find it in the US - a shame, really, since it is not a film only for Jews)by all means buy your ticket and go.
I did not read the book, I haven't read a Grisham novel since the nineties (when I was in High School)...That being said, I have enjoyed hiss film adaptations in the past--particularly Runaway Jury, The Rainmaker, and A Time to Kill.
Obviously, since it's a Grisham movie, we assume that nothing is quite the way it seems, but ultimately it is pretty much the way it seemed from the beginning, with a few additional details that had been swept under the rug by the powers that be, for obvious and totally unsurprising reasons.
The vast majority of films have been in their library since about ca.
It's perhaps more than prudent then to point out some of the criticisms one would have of the film (which, perhaps, is moot since he's been dead for decades).
His fears, doubts and anguish and his gradual descent into debasement, are in many ways more disturbing since they are in direct conflict with the sacrifices and moral strength demanded of a priest during religious persecution.
Although that isn't really saying that much since this movie really doesn't have much in common with Death Race 2000 other then the title.
Death Race is his goriest film since Event Horizon and definitely right up with his most impressive looking films.
Having wanted to see it since the trailer showed with Wanted, I was excited when I walked into the theater to see it because it looked fun and cool.
Filmmakers haven't made a nice-guy warden since the 1950.
You also have other clichÃ© prison characters, the kind you see in all prison films since "The Longest Yard."
The script follows correctly an old tested and tried recipe, everything is at its place, and although you can easily plot out the whole course since the beginning, somewhat even this sounds good - you simply have the guilty pleasure of savoring again a story that you know from dozens of other movies.
William IV was forced to call back Earl Grey and bow to the wishes of the people's representatives, now even more representative since the Reform Act of 1832 reapportioned Parliament after several hundred years.
I would have liked to have given this film a 9.99, since there were two scenes which I felt were just a bit too long.
Lepage has created in his character Philippe probably the greatest sad sack since Nabokov's Pnin.
this movie isn't my cup of tea.i couldn't watch it all,since i lost interest,but form what i saw,it just wasn't good.i just found it boring,with pretty bad acting,and a plot that is all over the place.it's a Russian made movie,the second i have seen now.the first one being Nightwatch.i didn't like that movie either.it also has a plot that doesn't make a lot of sense,at least in my opinion.anyway,Mirror Wars starts off promising enough,with some scenes of jet fighters doing maneuvers,which look pretty impressive.after that though,it's not so good.i wouldn't recommend it myself,but if you liked Nghtwatch,you might like this movie.for me,Mirror Wars is a 3/10
Not to compare the two, since they are completely different types of films, but if you want to see real amazing direction, in which the story unfolds with tremendous, unsuspecting power, see THE PIANO.
This is a great movie for teens into martial arts movies since it has a light handling of adult situations that if I were directing, would probably result in this movie being banned in 18 countries.
As for the fight scenes, since this is really what it's all about, they are mostly average.
I had missed this film during the many years since it was made, and caught it by chance on a Friday afternoon, after a particularly long and hectic week.
i have just re-watched this film, maybe the 5th time since its release.
She becomes her widowed mother (Zubaida Sahar) and grandmother's only hope for survival since the Taliban rule decreed that her female family and thousands of others like them cannot appear in public without a male relative as escort.
this should be a required film to be seen be all those quo are either in denial or are immune to the many "inequities" that exist in the world since time immoral up into what is now the 21st century, submitted with the utmost respect and love... jamie jo Jesus   i realize i would be hung, burned at the stake, tortured, crucified, stoned to death, and more if republished this in iraq..if not now?
One of those rules,is not allow any woman to work and even go out of the house without the presence of a man;since there aren't men in Osama's family, she needs to pretend that she is a boy,to bring some food to her family.
This is the first film made in Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban.
The story focuses on a young girl living in an all female family, and since they live in an area ruled by the Taliban, they are not allowed to leave the house, because women walking around unaccompanied by a male are promptly arrested and subjected to inhuman punishments.
With no way to feed themselves, since women are not even allowed to leave the house, much less work, their only choice is to dress up their youngest member of the family as a boy and have her go out and find work to feed everyone else.
There is no men in her family, since her father and her brother were killed in previous Afghan wars, and the family has no means of survival.
This is the first film made in Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban.
Essentially a handful of obnoxious pretentious snobs, the lot of them investing their meaningless little lives with melodrama, since they seem to have no real problems to speak of.
Nobody cares how the movie ends, since the dialog is the key to this film.
I'm not so sure my only finding Metropolitan was such bad luck: It's a fantastic film and, because I've watched it four times since Thursday, I probably would have had to return Last Days of Disco or Barcelona to the video store before watching them anyway.
I can say this film has staying power as I've seen it about half a dozen times in the 12 years since it came out; the most recent occasion was a week ago, and it still holds up, like a great play.
Edward Clements has done virtually nothing since this film, ditto Carolyn Farina (apart from a small part in Age of Innocence); likewise Eigeman and Nichols, although the former seems to have racked up a few more credits, and the latter was in Boiler Room, although I didn't realise it was him until the credits rolled.
I have not seen this movie since the 70's and would love to acquire a copy of it.
I guess since it became Peru's official nomination to the Academy Awards the Festival organizers felt they should bring it back as they feature most of the films that are official submissions to the upcoming Academy Awards.
the acting is what i love best about this film the lead actor has to be good in a film like this since it focuses on his life and he is almost perfect.
Here it is more than seventy years since the film was made, and it still holds up as an entertaining if highly fictional Western based on the life of the sure shot artist and her days with Buffalo Bill Cody's Wild West Show.
It's been a long time since I've seen this film but I would definitely watch it again if it came out on DVD.
Also of note are the actresses who played Lizzie and the money-obsessed Bella Wilfer, since so much of the story hinges on their believability.
Ever since (at least) the eighteenth century, with its cult of the "noble savage", tropical islands have frequently been seen in Western culture as the nearest that it is possible to come to Paradise on earth.
I am a wrestling fan and it's the reason why I love so much Smackdown and dislike RAW since 2002 because all the entertaining, wrestling and interesting story lines are.
Smackdown is the total package, sometimes it have his ups & downs but right now since Wrestlemania, the show is back at what it always was, a top WRESTLING show... plus you have very good entertaining...
Then again, maybe it only seems that way since I have grown accustomed to seeing him in this role.
Tony, of course, is a moron, since, raving terrorism expert that he is, should have done this hours ago.
Of course, since he was trying to be discreet, I'm sure no one would've noticed a truck parked out there for hours on end, working on the same telephone pole?
it's just that, well, since it was made for French television i had my doubts.
Especially since, according to another commentator, this was actor-director Welles' first venture into colour, he has used the unaccustomed medium masterfully both in his interiors and exteriors, and with the addition of the strident and insistent cicadas and refreshing dawn chorus has rendered the subtropical oriental night and its golden dawn beautifully realistic.
But not everything is bad, however, since the innovative visualization--that of mixing various formats, be it 35mm, 16mm, 8mm and even standard NTSC video--has left us with a visually and aurally interesting piece that can be appreciated again and again.
John Grisham--the famous author--even took to court against the film since it spawned some copy-cat murders.
The other is police officer Scagnetti, an insane, perhaps sadistic officer that is in love with Mallory - he also has some weird obsession with mass killers, since his mother was killed during the massacre at Waco, Texas by Charles Whitman.
Disappointing, since it was penned by one of my favorite film directors, Mr. Quentin `Bad Motherf***er' Tarantino himself.
NBK has since even been the subject of copycat crime sprees, or so the culprits claimed.
Stone, who is working from a script that has since been virtually disowned by Quentin Tarantino, pretty much took over and shaped the screenplay to his own vision.
After viewing this film many, many times since I first saw it I came to the conclusion that this film basically put on screen my feelings as to why I disliked and still continue to dislike the 90's/Post-Millenium American Pseudo-Culture.
Everybody who is reading this review right now has probably seen the film anyway so I won't reiterate the plot, but what I will do is try and help explain the concept of the film since it's quite obvious that there are a few people out there who don't understand this film.
That proved to be a disappointment, since some of the stories were much more intriguing than others.
There could have been some real development there, but since these are based on true stories, any alterations to make them seem more cinematic would have taken away from the "reality" these shorts try (and on a lot of levels succeed) to convey.
Lastly, since I don't want to come off as pathological about this movie, "Manhattan Miracle" was extraordinary.
In the mid-seventies a relative gave me a big stack of old Evergreen Review magazines, and I started an interest in more counter-culture things from the '60s because of that, since I was just a child when much of it took place.
But since it centers around someone like Henry Miller, it's high art apparently.
I saw this film in Washington, DC in 1995 and have since purchased the tape.
Alfredo is shocked because since he is not participating, Carmen will have to perform with the leading man!
To sum this up: If you are not annoyed by ample nudity (I have to say this since IMDb is also accessed by... ahem... cultures not quite fond of nudity), you like witty (the Spanish way) humor and you are a bit of a Bergman-geek (does such an animal even exist???)
It's been twelve years almost, and I've played this game from time to time since before adolescence.
And while it wouldn't be fair to say they've gone downhill since (I love CMI, especially), this has to be the best of the Monkey Island games.
He did it anyways and since then, I wanted to play adventures again.
I have grown up on his films since seeing Bottle Rocket, and I love the way this man creates.
I do not want to give away too much about the plot, since this is an ingenious puzzle that all fellow Giallo-buffs should experience entirely for themselves.
And that is what sets this apart from most other games, and is it's most memorable quality: when the Dreamcast, which I had this game on, "died" and my console fell into disrepair, I found something I have found with only one other game since: I began to mourn for the loss of the game, and began to miss it terribly.
I still play it since there's so much to do (get every emblem, get perfect scores, etc).
Robin Johnson was my hero as Nicky, and the proto-type for the kind of butch girl I've been attracted to ever since.
I received a DVD copy of Times Square for review and didn't expect much since I was not much of a fan of the whole punk rock scene when it came about.
It's been rumored that other lesbian-themed footage was shot and subsequently cut out, but since the film was such a forgotten flop, we may never know how much.
It must be 35 years or so since I saw this film in an "Art House" Theatre.
Spoiler ahead: The film's conclusion is really the fitting endpoint of the tragedy that has been going on since the film's beginning: Bob becomes his own victim... Like a goldfish that refuses to be fed from outside the bowl, he has barricaded himself into his own world, and thus cannot survive.
Maybe I'm overreaching or being overly critical - I did like her in "The Girl Next Door" (2004) - she can act, it's that I haven't liked too many of her film projects since '04.
It's nice to see William Macy in a different type of role than I usually see him in, but anyone could have done that turn -- not much there for him to do, but he ably supports, which is a fine thing, since that's what his role here should be...
When the greedy local businessman Hamer Thorne (Warner Anderson) brings the actress Tally Dickenson (Angela Lansbury) to perform a show for the locals, Calem is haunted by his past since Tally is his wife that left him in Apache Wells due to his dangerous way of life.
This is one of Power's very early films; he was only 22 when it was made, and though only a year older than he was, Young had been around since silent film days.
Normal Lynch themes and techniques run through story, infidelity, identities changing, cyclical editing, Hollywood artifice, oblique dialoge, deadpan comedy, and the most disturbing special effects since Eraserhead.
We can also question the connections since David Lynch said he got a lot of the ideas separately and serendipitously and only after it had begun did he understand why his brain was giving him these ideas.
Its dense, so dense, I'd say Lynch's most obtuse, sprawling and encompassing film since Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me.
While this film does feel like a retread of Mulholland Dr. it also stands on its own especially since it contains a much more upbeat ending and perhaps four layers of storytelling,good luck figuring out which is which.
The use of equipment used in the late 1950s as opposed to equipment used in 1954, is on little or no relevance unless you've been working in a television studio since the early 1950s.
Not an easy thing to notice since, since I consider both to be among the best actors of our time.
The fourth was less funny, but would (in his own way) be as much a figure of historical interest (even more so since he vanished).
We got this movie because we have a squirrel.Whoever came up with the original idea obviously had a squirrel as a pet,the character's actions(other than the obvious dancing in a kilt)are pretty close to what a squirrel keeper sees.More squirrel scenes would have been nice,but probably wouldn't have added anything to the plot.Ours didn't like one slightly scary scene(for a squirrel)near the end,but everything was okay in a few minutes.Of course,since the squirrels in the recent Willy Wonka movie attacked the little girl,he didn't like that one(ran out of the room and stayed until it was over),so I'd have to say it's HIS favorite squirrel movie,since the people and animals got along.It's a funny,simple movie that anyone who likes animals would probably enjoy.
Her dates with a important,wealthy, Chick Chandler (Phil Davis) were never considered serious since sincere feeling can not be purchased in this film.
I spent first 20 minutes itching to turn it off since the animation style didn't seem all that pleasant, but then things just kept happening and before I knew it I was really immersed in it.
Initially seeming to be a tale about Nishi and his unrequited crush on Myon since childhood, this anime goes in all kaleidoscopic directions that leaves you breathless all the while.
At first I thought the title was bad, since it didn't say anything about the film, but in the end I realized it does.
The moral of it all is that you must live your life to the fullest and enjoy everything life throws at you, since it is all you have.
Aside from feeling a genuinely exalting rush with its almost mosaic imagery and perfectly fitting music, I felt something else while viewing Mind Game and I attained a certain notion afterwards, which I don't see worth sharing, since I believe everyone who'll give this a watch will acquire on their own terms, levels and depth.
Winner of the Noburo Ofuji award (the most prestigious award in Japan for an animated film), this film has unfortunately only had a very limited release in Japan (although it is playing in theaters again since winning the award).
it had been a long time since i had a headache watching a movie but i presume we should torture ourselves once in a while with such pathetic movies to appreciate the well-made ones.... the movie is about a simple constable of Punjab,nihaal singh(sunny deol) who is too sweet and innocent to be believed.
By concentrating it's sights directly on the gutter and shooting straight about it's nature the movie succeeds brilliantly: This is the best party movie I have seen since NIGHT TRAIN TO TERROR.
Hitch always created something new which audiences viewed as typical Hollywood entertainment which is a shame since his movies are art in itself.
Any Hitch fan should view this and go along with the ride and not question everything since it would ruin the experience.
--Minor Spoilers--  While reading user comments for other Hitchcock movies, I came across this phrase often, generally in association with TOPAZ:  "This is by far Hitchcock's worst since STAGE FRIGHT..." or something to that effect.
But compared to the whole lot of crappy facsimile suspense films made since 1950, Stage Fright is quicker to entertain than most.
The Irishman seems like a sadistic killer since he seems to kill every viking he meets, how could he know which ones pillaged his village?
This movie has pretty bad image and sound quality which is understandable since its old.
None of the others made since (Trees Grow on the Stones Too, 13 Warrior, The Pathfinder *yikes!
I hope that Matsushita continue with the manga, because it sadly remains on hiatus since 2003, and the manga is FAR superior then the anime series.
And those images are brilliant since the director of photography was Frank Griebe ("Lola rennt").
I finally had the opportunity to see it after many years, since I saw it included in a list of best films, in James Monaco's book "American Film Now".
The performances are first-rate all the way, including Richard Chamberlin, who has never been this good before or since, and Joseph Cotton, who speaks volumes in his brief scenes.
But since I'm a journalist, I can appreciate the many scenes taking place at the newspaper.
Well, it's been a long time since I've seen a movie as boring as this one.
I have just finished seeing the movie in the theater and was moved more than any movie since Titanic.
The ending was both surprising and touching, especially since the whole movie you aren't sure if Terry had a dream or whether he really was sent back.
Like what has been said before, this movie shouldn't be compared too much to Tombstone, since they carried different story angles.
It's been 14 years now since these were put out and the more I watch them, the wider the gap between the two films becomes.
I probably am more forgiving of this film since I like Westerns, dark dramatic stories, and admittedly uneven plots, because the characters usually are so great in them.
While it's hard to take Rock Hudson as a stud since he came out of the closet, you won't care...you'll be too distracted by the numerous up-the-skirt shots of the "Pretty Maids" in the movie (where were the parents during the filming of this??
Either the times have changed drastically or we have changed drastically (pobably both) since the days of the Flower Children.
It's one of those movies you catch on cable at around 2 A.M., watch it since there's nothing better on, and end up getting sucked in by it.
I wanted to see this movie since I read that they were shooting it... well, living in Germany didn't help much!
As a "Star Wars"-Fan since 1977 i expected something, that surely will not par up to George Lucas original movies, but a least pay homage to the original movies, but after 15 Minutes i turned the TV off.
Lucas commissioned a series of animated shorts to depict the contents of the clone wars and explore many secondary characters, since he had run into a wall by only starting the war at the end of Episode II.
Finally, since great characters like Yoda, Grievous and Mace Windu have seldom been better used than by Tartakovsky, we should rejoice that his input in the Star Wars universe is destined to continue for a while.
Each short is extremely action packed, which makes watching each micro-episode one after another a little exhausting, since you rarely even get a chance to catch your breath before the next section of action begins.
It's been a while since I have seen an action movie of 'this type'.
In fact, I am not really a big fan of SW's Expanded Universe since its purpose is to explore the possibilities beyond the movies (which in turn ruins the rhythm of the saga's overall presentation).
I think Bert had received the nomination and Ernie was begging him for a job in his administration, but Bert had since distanced himself from the cookie and milk addict and was trying to brush him off.
First, I have to say that I am a big fan of Jean-Paul Belmondo, ever since I saw him in the french original "A Bout De Suffle" of the later remake "Breathless" (with Richard Gere).
In my opinion it makes no sense to waste one's time watching this picture, since it is completely idiotic with a lot of bad dialogs and other mistakes.
It would be really fascinating to read a french viewer's opinion, since that is the original language of "Joyeuses Paques".
I bought it on DVD this spring, and we've seen it about five times since then.
Belmondo is perfect, Laforet is perfect, Marceau is not so perfect but we love her since La Boom.
I was hoping for a nice, solid portable Grand Theft Auto ever since I first played Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas a while back.
I recently got a PS2 which came with a controller,memory card,3 PS2 games and 1 PS1 game for a good price.I didn't play the GTA series when it first came out starting with GTA3 in 2001.I started loving the series in 2005 when I got GTA Vice City for Christmas.I loved it.I then got San Andreas and thought it was the greatest video game of all time.I had GTA2 as well.Now with my new PS2 I play Liberty City Stories which was originally out for PSP.This game costs $30.00 and it is definitely worth it.Remember this is a PSP port and PSP is not as good as PS2 so the game is definitely not as good as GTA San Andreas or even Vice City actually but it is still a good addition in the series.Liberty City Stories takes us back to Liberty City(where GTA3 took place).The year is 1998 and you play as Toni Cipriani.During the game you do various missions for different people just like in the other GTA games.When you are not playing missions you can steal cars,kill people and just plain be a cold-hearted criminal.The storyline in all the GTA games are good with Vice City having the best one.The storyline in this game is pretty good as well.There are some parts of the game that are not too good.First of all the soundtrack.Just like in Grand Theft Auto 3, aside from the classical music station and the 1980's station the other music is re-created.Not real music.It is re-created well but we want music that was popular for the time.Actually out of the whole series, this game has the worst soundtrack.Flashback FM is the best radio station in my opinion but there aren't that many good songs there either.Even in GTA3 the only good station was Flashback.It had some good songs from the Scarface soundtrack but there were so little songs.I like 80's music and GTA Vice City provided the best radio station with actual songs from the 1980's.San Andreas had classic rock from the 70's and great rap and rock songs from the early 90's.If the soundtrack was better the game would be on-par with GTA Vice City.Anyway Liberty City Stories is a good addition in the GTA series but don't expect that much since its a port from PSP.
Yet, since the release of those films over a decade ago, he has continued to crank out by-the-numbers mediocrity that lacks any feeling of comic discovery.
And yes, while I have aged a bit since I could appreciate the his silliness, there is still a part of me that enjoys the goofy fun that Adam Sandler likes to put on screen.
By the end of the movie, Sandler had done the most outrageous acts I had seen him do since "Happy Gilmore."
And Mr. Moriarity continues to gain better recognition since this movie.
Similarly Dolph's visual style has developed even more since his exciting debut.
Not surprisingly R. Lee wasn't stretching his acting muscles too much since he is in fact a globe-n-anchor combat vet who did multiple tours in Nam.
Not even a chick getting cut in half by guillotine can save this one especially since you barely get to see it.
Lenzi's next film, Le Porte dell'inferno, was further proofÂas if we really needed itÂthat the director's best days behind the camera had long since gone.
Most Italian Horror films lack logic, but like 'The House By the Cemetery,' a film this could seen as a loose sequel to since it uses the same location, 'Ghosthouse' is even more out there and nonsensical than usual.
I don't exactly know why, but since I watched this movie first in 1988, I've seen it about thirty times.
...i was truly disgusted by this piece of blatant, fundamentalist Christian (so-called = since Christ never advocated this end- of- the- world- chosen- ones- get- to- be-saved -the -non-believers -good-or-not -get-to-burn -in- hell-on-Earth apocalyptic poppycock!)
But I think Proyas deserves the main kudos for turning this into something creative and special, and I'd go as far as to say this it is his best movie since Dark City.
Zach has hardly been heard of since the role of Billy in Gremlins (and the sequel).
I admit I am biased- I have always loved Ms. Adams since "The Dead Zone"...Stephen King at his earliest, and best.
I have been a movie freak since my birth.
Eddie Macon (John Schneider, in his first film starring role since coming to prominence on 'The Dukes of Hazzard') is an honest-to-God good man who ends up in jail after losing his cool with his sleazy employer.
To be honest, this film made me feel very uncomfortable, luckily I watched it alone, and i FFWD through the beginning a lot, since it is embarrassing to watch and every second you expect this guy to make even more of a fool of himself than he is doing.
This film looks low budget, but I was wondering all through the movie how much extras were used, and they were all extras, since none of them looked into the camera.
In that sense, it is debatable whether Lewis is a miscast since he has this typical middle-class suburban image, and not an outsider/fringe/loner.
The moments where he cared for Kira as his own daughter seem to momentarily suppress our perspective of his condition, but when he starts to put her in situations that suggest a setup for someone to potentially abduct her, we know he is still unstable and it keeps us guessing as to just what he is planning since he's spent a good deal of time reviewing his daughter's kidnapping over and over again, attempting to orchestrate what could have gone differently.
Shot hand-held in the gloomiest of locations, Lodge Kerrigan's unromantic portrait of New York is very real but, conversely, since the sequence of events occur through Keane's eyes, it's uncertain as to quite what is reality.
So much so that I have always kept an eye out for anything by Lodge Kerrigan since.
KAGOME just can't seem to remember the hero's name, since she's constantly shouting/screaming/saying/whispering his name at least 100 times in just one sentence.
That does not however have to be a bad thing, since the story is well told, and does not hurry.
This movie was seriously the worst movie I have seen since like ever.
It made no since in how it flowed into a movie, they crammed way too many parodies into a 1 hour and 20 minute movie.
I could write a better parody than this and, since I'm not a good enough writer to be hired by a studio, I just have to assume that the writers are capable of better.
Ever since The Naked Gun films and Airplane!, Wrongfully Accused, Spy Hard, Scary Movie..
Sad to say, this was the worst movie I've seen since the beginning of 2005.
This is just the same Matthew M movie you have seen since the year 2000.
I wasn't expecting much from this movie since I think the whole 'Christmas Carol' theme has been beaten to death already, but hoped at least for a few laughs.
She was rather surprised that I disliked it so much since I usually like romantic comedies, but I would rather watch "Made of Honor" than to ever watch this one again.
Once they left I decided to watch it by myself since I spent 5 dollars on renting it.
Not surprising since the story was written by men.
Friends since childhood, Connor once wooed Jenny but the relationship turned sour, due to Connor's aversion to commitment.
Gremlins benefits a little from the fact that I grew up with it, but mostly I liked the sequel and since then I've realized the original is better.
So I just thought I would share this info with you as I had previously tried for years to get hold of this fantastic little known miniseries without success.Remembered watching it when it originally aired on BBC in 88/89 and since then it has always stuck in the back of my mind as aone of those "Must own" series.
It's been awhile since I've seen it but Jeff Wincott and Gary Hudson are brothers.
I TiVoed it and have watched it many times since.
This same choppiness also prevents Spider-Man from using his incredibly limited repertoire of attacks effectively, since any attack activates about 2-3 seconds after the corresponding button has been pressed.
I a Spiderman fan since I was a kid, although I stop reading the comics long ago, but this movie is probably the best in the series, mainly because it's superb special effects and CGI.
Historically important since this was the first Merrie Melodies short after a year of Looney Tunes with Bosko as the star.
Even though the humor was dark and cruel,it was hysterically funny.For a movie made on a very low budget,this was impressive.It began with a gory scene in a thunderstorm and then begins years later.The actor that played Monty was perfectly cast.I loved it at the end when he got back at his tormentors since they sure had it coming!
I enjoyed the original gruesome deaths.That pizza scene really stays in your mind  since it looked so real.I hope there will be a sequel to this movie and that it doesn't end there.
I thought Feast was a satisfying film.I will say I was just a little disappointed, because I was expecting a tad bit more, but still, it was very enjoyable, and even though at some parts I felt as if they overdid some stuff a bit, it contained cool action scenes, and I believe really lovable characters.Also, they kind of throw you off guard, and do some of the things that you least expect, such as how they killed of Heroine, which when I thought since she was like, one of the most important characters of the story, they would've kept her alive, and also at the part where one of the creatures devours that child, I wasn't expecting that either, which I believe was clever that they were able to do that.There was even pretty laughable comedy, which one of the best mixes of genre is Horror/Comedy, and like I said before, I was really into the characters, like the old woman and Tuffy were some of my favorites in Feast.This was a good movie, and I think it has a pretty reasonable rating, so I have nothing further to say, except that if you absolutely flat out hated this movie, you DEFINITELY need to watch it again, and maybe you'll see the error of your ways.
After all this time - it's been a while since I saw it - I still get a kick out of it.
At the least, it's got cult classic written all over it: --campy, smart writing --quirky characters that are developed enough to give them dimension without plummeting the depths of their personalities (it is a horror flick) --a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously --outrageously funny (more than you can say of other cult classics that have somehow survived)...I haven't laughed out loud that much since Meet the Parents (the original!)
We've heard since the 50's about little green men, and in this movie, they are there.
30 seconds later I realized it is not real, since the actors' names appeared during the end credits.
Although the idea has since been adopted by The Blair Witch Project the originality of Alien Abduction is what will see it remain a classic horror movie.
Well, I guess I can wrap this up already since there isn't much to discuss in terms of the "plot".
Sorry, it's easy to forget since it is specifically pointed out at the beginning of the film and then virtually ignored for the rest of the story.
I have seen this movie several times since owning it and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in history, golf, Ben Hogan, or generally being entertained.
This proves to be a bit awkward, since he and the woman were romantically involved once.
The most striking independent feature seen by this reviewer since Reflections Of Evil, the interrogatively titled ?
(Unlike his co-director, Harz's career has blossomed somewhat since making ?, appearing in no less than four projects in 2008).
has been discussed, praised, shunned, ripped and probably copied since, that you can easily lose sight of the fact that what you have here is a genius-ly original film, and when experienced over and over again, STILL never fails to amuse.
Very possibly one of the funniest movies in the world, but probably not Oscar material, since Borat, Monty Python, Eddie Murphy, and the like will never sniff site of such honors.
Obviously this is not a movie for everyone, since this bleak view on human life is clearly not shared by all.
movie is the most original & humorous film I have seen since 'Team America'!
Since I live in the U.S. ,it is like taking a 1-1/2 hour trip to France, or at least what I would imagine France would be like, since I was never there... Great film, go see it...
I had still remembered since then some of the memorable scenes, like opening the fist of the rapist's body to find the button, and Charles Bronson giving Marlene Jobert the button.
I don't believe there's been anything like it before or since.
The best use of Bronson's action hero persona since "Once Upon a Time in the West".
Set in the distance future and in a place far far away, Screamers is an excellent sci-fi flick about two warring entities whom both have been long since forgotten.
I really enjoyed it, and have watched it many times since (until the VHS tape gave up the ghost).
Very cute and very funny film, in French with English subtitles, though I doubt any of the females will be reading them, since the "visuals" in this movie are not to be missed.
The film is one of the first full features made in Cambodia since the 1970's when the Khmer Rougue Regime took over.
I guess since everyone is so use to mutilating the genitals of new born baby boys it comes as no shock.
I finally got around to catching this show in early 04 and have been watching it ever since.
The first time I watched this show I was flipping through the channels and it looked interesting so I watched it and I have been hooked on it ever since and have never missed an episode.
I love this show, since the first episode.
I used to see it while flicking through the channels, I quickly flicked over to another channel, just because I didn't think I'd like it but one night when there wasn't much of the TV, I had no choice but to watch it and as soon as the episode finished, I was so blown away by it and I have been engrossed it in ever since.
I've been watching NCIS since it started and have been a regular viewer since the debut.
I have been hooked on this show since the beginning because I love watching mysteries and crime like CSI and CSI Miami.
Leo naturally declines, since his ego in check will not recognize that this is the blame for the building's plague of problems (i.e.
the most underrated show on tv, and while th andy richter show looks really good, i hope it doesn't replace the best attempt at a new show since malcolm in the middle (fox works wonders by going against convention...look at it, simpsons is a cartoon, 70's show is a period piece, malcolm introduced a new style, undeclared is breaking new ground, grounded for life is flashbacked, titus is hardcore...man i love fox)watch it, you won't be disappointed
I saw this for the first time when I was 13, and have been watching it ever since.
So I browsed the movies and picked this one since it had an interesting name & Peter Weller was in it.
In the years since its release it has become a cult film for those who can appreciate it for the blockbuster it never was.
Now since the waring is out of the way I want to say i think this movie is genius and i love the WTF?
The first worked so well because it was such an unrelenting and grueling experience and was the finest horror film since "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre".
There has always been a huge debate whether Evil Dead II is a sequel or a remake, since the second film contradicts the story that occurred in Evil Dead.
There is no credibility in here, but that's okay since I think most of this is played for laughs more than horror.
Although he always found steady work in films and television since 1950, Best never quite reached the top tier of film stars; despite the fact that he was a remarkably handsome young man.
As good as the episode is, I can't help thinking it would have worked better in a half-hour format, since there is noticeable padding, especially the quicksand sequence which does add action to a talky story-line, but does little to advance the plot.
Anyway, I've seen nothing quite like it before or since.
Personally I haven't been able to appreciate her beauty in a long time since maybe Aur Pyar Ho Gaya (1997).
Ever since I came to know that a movie is coming out on Akbar, one of the Mughal ruler, I had decided to boycott it by not watching it.
There are a couple of nice action set pieces ranging from full scale war with the clashing of two opposing sides (the elephants were a great bonus, trust me), to a duel which turns out to be a courtship ritual, something not new since both Hrithik and Aishwarya challenged each other before (though on the basketball court), with the latter quite well versed in swordplay given her earlier role in The Last Legion, and one featuring what I thought took a leaf out of the battle between Hector and Achilles in Troy.
But, it wouldnât qualify as a documentary either, since the concept of Jodha in Akbarâs life is in itself fictitious.
Let me get rid of the flaws first: Ashutosh Gowariker is not an action director, so the battle scenes and even the action sequences lack panache Â when they could have been executed brilliantly Â especially since Hrithik Roshan can do action fabulously well.
In the last decade since Aishwariya Rai was introduced to movie-going audiences, she has grown tremendously as an actress.
"Jodhaa Akbar" is not her best work, but it offers ample evidence of her growth along the spectrum of Paro-type roles she has enacted since Bhansalli's "Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam" : Nandini of "HDDCS," Paro of "Devdas," the eponymous Umrao Jaan, and now Jodhaa are essentially different interpretations of the same feminine archetype: a Lady Beloved of the Legends, who, having been robbed of all agency because of her gender, comes to embody beauty, suffering, fidelity, and, of course, love.
Swades was released in December 2004 and since then, this project was said to be considered by the director, Ashutosh Gowariker.
I'm so glad there was so much more to offer in the way of Musketeer films especially since I wasted money going to see that horrible loosely based adaptation of The Three Musketeers called the Musketeer (2001).
It's the sort of film they must be showing film students in Germany, since the film is in German with subtitles.
WHich is appreciated since I don't speak German and was reading subtitles.
Over 70 performers have covered the song since 1935, and some famous names include Billie Holiday, Paul Robeson, Pyotr Leschenko (in Russian, under title "Mratschnoje Woskresenje"), Bjork, Sarah McLachlan, and many more.
This part was very predictable, since one knows after seeing so many stories like this, it always ends tragically because of Nazis, even friendly ones, as Hans was, deep down inside hates Joachim because he had what he never could have, Ilona.
You don't need to be a Kath and Kim fan to enjoy this film, which has a few of the funniest scenes in it that I can remember from an Australian film since 'The Castle'.
Cross reference http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1445990/usercomments-1  NBC has really messed this up, as the ratings for both Leno & Conan's Tonight had gotten better since the feud started.
I have one suggestion for FOX, since your trying to build your Late night ratings to become the number one network, try & talk Conan into doing Conan Tonight like Carson originally did the Tonight Show, for 90 minutes.
It's different from Leno's set since it's a more traditional talk show set with a little New York flavor.
This is the scariest psychological/horror film since Psycho and at times i was shaking all over.
Too many people don't let themselves 'go' into the experience; it's been a long time since it's been 'squinting through fingers viewing'.
i always wanted it since i saw the trailers for it on TV in the cinema last year and luckily got it on DVD last Christmas.
lol one night my friend & I were watching this movie since her parents rented it.
Can't believe it has been 18 years since I first viewed this little gem, and it was as good today as in 1985!
The main reason I remember this film to this very day, even though I have not seen it since today, is that I fell totally in love with Sophie Ward.
Ms. Ross was the second (or third since Cicely Tyson was also nominated that year for Sounder) African-American to be nominated an Oscar for Best Actress after Dorothy Dandridge's previous nod some 18 years before.
While we can all regale each other with stories of Miss Ross' idiosyncrasies, one thing is patently clear: She WORKED this movie and this is the best singing I have EVER heard from her (or since, for that matter and I was a Die-hard Supermes fan!)
He has never made a truly good movie, (what has he been doing since "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"?).
Particularly impressive since it was the acting debut of Diana Ross - what range!
I have watched this movie a few times, the first time when it was first released in 1972 and I was barely 4 years old and it has left an indelible mark on me ever since.
My parents eagerly awaited this film and since they could not find a babysitter took me along.
It's too bad, since with better direction and screenplay, coupled with Ms. Ross's capable acting and singing, this could've been one of the truly great musical biopics.
As a singer, She never before or since has sounded as good.
Nine of ten, and since it can be viewed for free, On Demand, it is highly recommended to any and all film buffs.
And, indeed, rather risque for its day since there is a supposition at one point that Ann Harding's character, Joan, in trying to trap William Powell into marriage, is giving pre-marital favors and is actually caught in the process.
This is by far one of the best Filipino films since, I believe, Mike de Leon's Bayaning Third World.
Personal note: I have been in love with Maryska (literary homage by Hrabal to his mother)since the blessed day I read the first lines in the book... some years ago.
It really was a lot of fun and quite the breath of fresh air for children's movies since the slump between The Incredibles and now.
I went to see this film today with my daughter, who is 31 and her 5 year old daughter and it's a long time since I saw such a truly wonderful film in the cinema.
There she was, the consummate professional and I, standing in for Mr. Lancaster, was face to face with an actress I had loved ever since seeing her in such films as "From Here to Eternity" and "The King and I".
Maybe I'm not the most objective person to comment on it since I really like those complicated, layered, troubled-but-good-at-heart characters, yet, this one was amazing...it's just a shame that this gem will probably be slept on since it isn't any kind of blockbuster or even an indie movie that could shake some spirits.
For backpackers this series is a real turn off since everything they do is dependent on a guide and with 5 star luxuries from the hotels to the activities they do that most travellers would not afford (or care for).
It's a fitting gesture, this burial, since the violin, once symbolizing the music of the tyrannized, now epitomizes the music of collusion.
Then the grandfather understands he has to face this situation, confront it and hence to die, since anyway all the leaders of the revolutionary armed group is was part of are prisoners and will soon be dead.
This reveals that the guard who gave the grandfather a weapon twice pretending it was a taco for the road must have had an equivalent spy on the other side since the military forces knew every intention of the revolutionary forces.
And since no one seems to care about them and their welfare, why should they return the favor?
I was very interested in seeing this film based completely on the synopsis, since I couldn't find a review ANYWHERE online.
I must admit that I probably would not have seen this film except for the fact that Miss Lohan stars in it, since I'm not in the habit of seeing horror films.
It's easy to see how I Know Who Killed Me has garnered so many unfavourable reviews, since it doesn't follow the standard rules of your typical Hollywood horror, and stars Lindsay Lohan, whose popularity has been steadily waning since her much reported 'drunken episodes'.
I have been dodging this movie ever since it was released on DVD.
I joked to the person beside me that I hadn't laughed as hard since the first time I saw "Borat".
I have been a avid Royal watcher since I was a little boy.
It's also fun to see again in the cinema since its 1998 re-issue.
I have watched this movie over and over ever since i was a little girl and i still cant forget this movie, its so enjoyable.
No other musical made since had can stand up to this type of quality.
Though films such as Moulin Rouge and Chicago have been made since they are not the same type of musical as this.
Morris Chalfen, the boss of the revue ÂHoliday On Ice`, considered Pawlik EuropeÂ´s best show-star on the ice since Sonja Henie.
Claude Chabrol had directed about 50 movies since 1957.
Common wisdom has it that Claude Chabrol's been trading water since the superb La Ceremonie, and decidedly minor efforts like La Fleur du Mal, Rien ne va Plus and Merci Pour le Chocolat certainly do little to change that view, but the surprisingly excellent Au Coeur du Mensonge aka The Heart of the Lie/The Color of Lies is easily one of his very best.
With a better, more expressive actor, this movie could have soared, since she has to carry the bulk of it.
I saw this film some 6 or 7 years ago on TV and have been looking for it on DVD (to no avail) almost ever since.
To appreciate it you have to remember two things - firstly, it was made in 1942, and thus there are quite a few patriotic themes in the movie, since that was the kind of film being made at the beginning of World War II, when the U.S. didn't yet know if it would be successful fighting a two front war in which everything was at stake.
The finale, then, has the hero relinquishing (not without a certain remorse) his political career to make up to the long-suffering heroine Â especially since their past dalliance had borne him a son (with whom he also shares his name) he was unaware of.
OK, maybe its unfair to dis a movie like this since the Communist film industry must have had a lot of problems.
I like the first 2 seasons and I was expecting more of the conclusion of season 2, since it ended completely with a cliffhanger.
I don't think I've met a cartoon yet that I've loved since Episode I.
It also covered the story of King Arthur better than any other film before or since.
Many here have detailed very well the merits of the film, and since most people know the story, I will keep this short.
The entire look of the film, which I have not seen in a movie since, reeks of Medieval Legend.
The acting is rock solid, the effects although poor (it's 1981, let's be fair) don't really matter since they aren't integral to the story.
I can remember that when it came out, a film magazine reviewed it twice, feeling that it had to do so, since its two reviewers had such contrasting opinions.
Let's see: I had great expectations towards this film, since Danika pretty much has the potential to be a fairly enjoyable thriller, but to my disappointment, it turned out to be one of those films that deliberately try to be confusing just for kicks.
The story is little more complicated than that since there are many sub-plots and you get to understand our characters and the bad guys actions.
Reallyreally remarkable.I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since I saw it yesterday.
(Total of 2 tissues for the entire film) I wish there was some sort of prequel, since a sequel is def.
Ever since I saw "Quatermass Xperiment" at age eight(shown in the U.S. as "The Creeping Unknown"), I've seen and enjoyed almost all available versions of the series.
I rented this DVD four days ago and have watched it about 5 times since then.
Eugene O'Neill remains, some fifty two years after his death and some eighty seven since his first plays appeared on stage, America's greatest dramatist.
It's been almost 60 years since the films release, and yet today, it remain as relevant as ever, as still the biggest stars in the world, gets destroyed for the exact same reasons as displayed in the film.
It's quite outstanding how the cynical Wilder achieves to really make us care about the characters, all of them, but especially Norma Desmond's, whose oblivious outlook on the world surrounding her and her own long since gone fame (Von Stroheim writes her fake fan letters) really makes you pity her fate.
," a technical flaw I've never understood: why wasn't the move re-lit and re-shot, since everything else in the film is perfect?)
How long has it been since an American film had me wondering who among the cast was going to disrobe?
They also skipped really quickly over important scenes and yet took ten minutes on the Samwise the Strong scene which, while important should not take up quite that much time, especially since they had to cut the book down so much to fit it into a movie.
I had never seen it, but I figured since it had the "Return of the King" name it would be decent.
Although, I suppose it would have been difficult to have it on the correct timeframe since they kind of skipped some stuff that happened in line with the other characters.
But then, we might not have wanted to see Legolas since in the Hobbit, they portrayed Elves with blue skin, very long ears and pointy fingers.
I really like this movie, but it sure brings me close to tears since the movie sucks you in as well as it being so heart-wrenching.
Colbert's is pretty decent, but Beavers' daughter is ashamed of her black mom--especially since this daughter is so light-skinned that she can, and does, pass for white.
Not since Little Women have I seen a melodrama where everyone is so nice to each other.
This was the first time I have seen it since I was 13 and I am amazed at how well the film still holds up.
Gee, what a cast Woody Allen was (and still is) able to muster for his movies, even though none of them is paid blockbuster wages since Allen's movies tend to draw in a selective audience.
I suspect Allen was taking advantage here -- more than he had before or since -- of the newly relaxed regulations regarding the depiction and discussion of sex and violence on the screen.
Ever since the mid-70s, I have had a nostalgia for Woody Allen's early films.
He simply loves to take his shirt off since he does it in every movie he plays in.
You know he is the bad guy from the start since he looks like a bad guy and sounds like a bad guy... Not very subtle since you are supposed to believe he is there to help Mark, I mean the doctor Mark plays(sorry, it's just that Dacascos seems to play the same character whether he is a soldier or a doctor).
Well, since I watched this movie for the third time, I must like this rubbish, no?
), but he does seems to be trying, and since he's a "newb", we can look trough his fingers...  Now, take a better look... Bosniak, Serb and Croat... and voilÃ , you have a generic ex-YU wannabe comedy... and that's it.
Original is Original, this is a nice movie but no masterpiece and should have been left without the name Bambi II as it is so far from the Original, especially since the Original showed Bambi as an adult already.....
Bambi is having a hard time, his father has to take care of him but his father also has no respect for him since Bambi isn't as brave as he is.
See, Disney has lost its charm by this point (it's lost it for years--at least since the 70's, when the films became more savvy than charming) and they were trying to necromance a charming movie.
I am currently studying animation in college, and perhaps more than other people I've been expecting less and less from Disney since they started putting out sequels to their classics.
I've been terrified ever since I heard that a "midquel" to Bambi was in the works, since I was positive it would be another campy, over-the-top rehash of the original.
So if you're smart, and I know you ARE, please - DON'T put this show on DVD, especially since you recently stated the sales of Newhart's first "comedy" series on DVD were below par - thank goodness - and that more contemporary and MUCH funnier comedy series of yours like "The Simpsons" and "My Name is Earl" on DVD ARE selling!)
I've been a religious follower of all of his television series since I was a young man.
Since the French think that Jerry Lewis is a comic genius, I've long since given up trying to understand THEIR aesthetic.
When a Hong Kong magnate sets out on an expedition to find a prehistoric ape in India, he and the others find not only the ape but also a scantily clad woman (Evelyne Kraft) who's known the big guy ever since her plane crashed in the jungle many years earlier.
The whole "rock candy" angle was odd, and didn't make much since and could have been left out.
Robert Patrick as Rome is sub-par since he wasn't as threatening as he used to be in Terminator 2 and even in Die Hard 2 which he appeared in only 2 scenes.
I think this is not in a fair and good spirit of a web-site to make such a requirement since it violates the freedom of expression, like, I personally think I've already said what I wanted to say bout the film.
this is a very unfair process since this person will always get out, if the contestant succeeds.
In the 5+ years since it was released, the premise has been made less outrageous by real world events in software development, and I found it less boring than the previous commentator for that reason, I imagine...
Although it's been years since I read the story the first time, the differences between the novel and the movie are humongous.
Still 4 out of 10 since it was hard to stop watching because of the great basic plot by Ben Mezrich.
I rated this movie a 1 since the plot is so unbelievable unbelievable.
The first half an hour was one of the most boring i have had to face since i've started watching movies.
I have traveled all over Israel, and I have never seen an IDF recruitment poster, since service is mandatory.
But for some reason, images of an unrealistic, non-comic, and violent scenario manage to elicit applause from the audience since the director has smeared the Israeli side so much beforehand, that any shot of Israeli soldiers being killed would be welcome.
Oh, and Samantha, raised in this harsh jungle since a child, wears a lot of make-up.
This is the worst film I have ever seen since The Blair Witch Project.
While his and Wong's characters barely interact, there is a love scene that appears out of no where AND makes no sense since the lady was already in love with another man.
This type of deliberate internal logic gaffe is not uncommon in stage plays since it gives actors the chance to show off a bit and of course the story is entirely low concept just like you`d expect from a stage play .
The worst film since "Plan B from outer space"!  
First: As I am Norwegian, and have lived with this film since I was about six years old I am biased!!
The films are full of the clichÃ© scenes that filled Tarzan and earlier jungle films, clichÃ©s that have since become attached to the Indiana Jones films by those unfamiliar with the earlier genre.
It's a surprise to see that it was shot in post-independence Zimbabwe since it has many of the hallmarks of the kind of film that used to shoot in apartheid South Africa Â blacks are expendable children, Indians comic buffoons with silly voices, whites are the master race and everyone would stay happily in their place if it weren't for foreigners stirring up trouble.
I was actually excited to see this film especially since I loved the original.
The annoying fat guy was just horrible, I felt no sympathy for him whatsoever since he was a pain in the @$$ to others as well not mention the worst actor of them all.
And it had been twenty years since the original, twenty years that the writer/director had to mount an effort superior to his overrated debut.
It seemed to me like the actors were brought out of a closet that they have been stuck in since the 80's Some of the themes of the movie were not approached like they should have been.
and i'm not one of those bitter people who woulda hated it reguardless since it completely ignored parts two and three.
I first watched this movie when I was about five years old (already at that time it was old) and I've seen it many times since.
I rented this movie because of the Kevin Smith connection, since I'm a huge Smith fan.
I don't feel like our watching this film was a complete waste of time, but I'm really wondering how we managed not to turn it off before the bitter end, especially since the ending was not exactly satisfying.
It's a crying shame since there is a good comedy to made out of the conflict in the North of Ireland - but this definitely isn't it.
I'm surprised anyone is still able to remember or care about the murder subplot by the end of the movie since it concentrates more on the soul club scene of the late 1970s .
Ever since I watched it the first time as a 7 year old, I have loved this movie.
mayhap, but since i could not get past the (sort of) music, there was little or no treasure for me in this one.
The 2006 movie Boston Strangler is not a remake of the 1968 movie with that same name, since they have completely different perspectives on the historic basis of the respective stories, although both versions attempt to blend fact and fiction about events in the early to mid 1960s.
Imagine my surprise when the movie ended that it had only been two hours since it began.
The film might have been improved had David and Rafi achieved any kind of a meaningful conversation, but since they failed to do this, being too preoccupied with bedtime gymnastics or quarreling, we were denied any access to the thought-processes behind the decisions they made, particularly the most important decisions, to go for a baby (on David's part), and to separate.
National Lampoon has gone downhill since their "5 Deadly Sins" movie.
Obviously made for the neo Nazi and female market, since anyone else will be completely turned off by this.
Unfortunately, it has been a while since it was shown in national television, but everybody my age (22) know it and love it.
The problem with this film was half conceptual too, since Taj was only funny in Van Wilder in the limited doses we got.
Then, Mega Mountain was aired on HBO, years later since the last time, and saw it for whatever reason you could think of that included weed.
The computer girl had not a cinch of fear since there was a four-minute bomb inches away from her face.
Jim Varney, who also appeared in this film, has also since died.
after seeing 3 ninjas kick back and 3 ninjas knuckle up i wasn't expecting 3 ninjas high noon to be that good, since the 2 preceding ones weren't' that great.
Particularly remarkable, since one of the kids appears to be about four years old.
My kids told me we needed to go to Burger King and get them (after the fact, of course)...since I don't watch the Nickolodeon ads, I didn't know this.
But I can't recall anything much about it - too many other books since then.
I haven't been so insulted by a CGI dragon since the Dungeons and Dragons movie.
If you have NOT read LeGuin's Earthsea Trilogy, you might enjoy this mini-series **MIGHT** since you will have nothing to base your disfavor on besides stiff acting and predictable plot-line...
Let me just say that if this was even partially true to the original story, many of these issues would have been thoughtfully resolved one way or another, since they would have been addressed in the original story.
I am a huge fan of the Earthsea books and have been since the 1970s.
It is easily the worst film I have seen since "Dungeons & Dragons" (and I paid money to see that!)
OK first off, I would like to say that Hulk Hogan has appeared in some amazingly bad films since he became famous.
I'm sorry to disagree entirely with everyone else here since I enjoyed this film tremendously.
I respect the fact that this film was made in a mature way, since movies with lesbian characters often contain silly jokes or numerous stereotypes.
I don't want to Talk about it since I hated the film.
since there aren't too many of those we it becomes clear very early in the movie what will happen within the next 90 minutes.
This is almost unheard-of for "Lifetime" flicks, which alone must be a significant proportion of Canada's economy, since most are filmed there.
This is clearly a low-budget, poorly-made film that the makers of Executive Decision didn't want to sue since the makers of Executive Command wouldn't have to money to pay them anyway.
This is without a doubt the worst film I've seen since Boxing Helena.
And since Terry is riddled with paranoia, the filmmakers spoon-feeding us with several minutes of news footage and Bushspeak before the movie even gets underway, the movie simply has nowhere to go.
His reluctance to end up looking foolish again would be outweighed by a sense of duty (nay, 'civic' duty) to Gabe, whom he is now motivated to protect since he put him through such an ordeal to begin with.
But since this film was a remake of a TV miniseries, it reveals itself as a dim shadow of a brilliant melodrama.
CSI has been my favorite show since it first aired.
It has to be the most boring western I've seen since the old John Wayne and Elvis Presley crappers.
There were no drawn out gun sequences, they were quick and packed full of shooting, which makes perfect sense, since everyone in the gunfights are supposed to be well trained gunman.
After rationalizing (since I had nothing better to think about during the movie) I figured that the only way I could recoup the cost of the movie was to cut my losses and leave.
I have admired Stephen Dorff in many films **but this was just, well, a grunting quasi-Neanderthal that pretty much embodied every tired clichÃ© there is for a world weary cop since sometime in the 1930s**!
**) I adored Natasha McElhone in MRS DALLOWAY (and -- even GIVEN the weaknesses of the character in the script -- in THE TRUMAN SHOW), and have been an admirer of Stephen Rea ever since THE CRYING GAME, too -- but I can't figure out why they agreed to do this one; did they all need some quick-and-dirty money or something.
Add a poorly written script about a murderous website and completely unconvincing characters to this and you've got yourself one of the biggest cinema-turkeys since the new millennium.
I think most people who have had the opportunity to enjoy this show would say this is maybe the most beautifully written drama since Shakespeare.
However, since every second of the film was even more tortuous than the depravities depicted on the screen, I believe no amount of focus groups or editing could save this film.
And since we now have new cases to solve, AND they're dying from what looks to be a virus, we need to bring in the woman scientist and nominal love interest (Natascha McElhone - who displayed quite amply in 'The Truman Show' that she can't act.
The landlord has a right to enter the apartment in case of an emergency or to do repairs or any number of reasons since he owns the building.
I'd rather be at the dentist, especially since my dentist, unlike Dr. Mabuse, is a nice guy.
I suppose the audience was supposed to have foreknowledge of the game and its cosmology, since there was little explanation given to the rules that framed the events and sequences before us.
You can never get a handle to what exactly big time city mobsters wife Lucinda, Susan Blakely, sees in her boyfriend Scott, Dale Midkiff, since he's about as far away from her in lifestyles and interests as the distances that the North & South Poles are from each other.
Nick and his father Sheriff Charlie Prescott haven't seen each other since his wife's death because Nick felt that his father didn't press the case hard enough.
She is excellent two or three films, but hasn't done much since "Speed" which really merits attention.
If you have no idea who Leary or Kotto is and thought "since Bullock is in it, it must be OK", you would be TERRIBLY wrong!!
While the film is based on a genuine local legend, the director's strict adherence "this is exactly how it happened" sometimes detracts from the story, since he seems unable to resist stuffing _Lucy Keyes_ with every possible detail of the legend and the current happenings in the town, regardless of whether or not it contributes to the plot.
There may be logic to that, but a little further explanation of how sharks cycle back into the oceanic ecosystem would be great, since it's not immediately clear how creatures at the top of the oceanic food chain help those at the bottom (phytoplankton) create oxygen.
I feel disgust for not only myself since I cannot have the 90 minutes of my life I wasted watching this garbage, but for every single person involved in the making of this film except for the director (he is solely responsible for its fruition).
I have loved the book series since it came out in '79.
But mainly, this is the kind of story to be read, especially since I feel that V.C.
It has been almost 20 years since my girlfriend of the time, an obsessive Madonna fan, talked me into seeing this piece of trash, and I still go to bed at night praying to God that I can somehow get that two hours of my life back.
And since there is no Rigaud it follows, perhaps, that there would be no Cavalleto, another uniquely Dickensian character who was sorely missed.
So little is made of the Meagles family, a major omission in itself, that I suppose it is no surprise that there is no Tattycoram, and since there is no Tatty, there is no Mrs. Wade: more great losses for the audience, since their highly charged and emotional subplot helps to define and humanize the characters of the Meagles family and of Arthur.
Dickens version of the story behind Mrs. Clennam's secret is, of course, quite complex, but certainly worth accurately telling, since it is the motivation for the entire plot!
As other reviewers have already pointed out, the insertion of archival footage from previous mid-40s Curly shorts is what proves to be the downfall of this particular episode--which is something of a shame, since I found a lot of the new scenes to be quite hilarious; particularly the opening scenes with the stooges making their homemade brew (I'm sorry Moe, the crock skidded).
The funny thing is since "oppression of women" is largely a myth they really should not be getting even for anything.
Now men on the other hand should be thinking about getting even since we have been treated horribly by women for years.
The only thing is that movie would be over in 15 minutes since the law would react viciously to any man doing what these women did.
It's hard for anyone to prove since no real zombies actually show their rotting faces during anytime in this painfully slow yawner.
HAil IPS - Movie is trying to teach the world that ultimately Let the dumb and the dumber rule...since majority of common mass are dull !
I believe since the budget was so low they had to ask someone's younger sister to just play for fun.
My partner and I won tickets to see the Sydney sneak preview so off we went last night (Monday 16th October)   Let me begin by saying 'that is 88 minutes of my life that I will never get back"   I was set to see a great Aussie flick; instead I found it mind numbingly boring, predictable 'comedy' (and I use that term lightly)   It was more of a reflection on a horde of has been 'comedians' (and I use that term lightly also) who have unceremoniously used their names and positions on radio stations around Australia to tout the movie as being the best thing since sliced breadÂ   Suggest you spend 88 minutes watching the grass grow than see this movieÂ   I think I would have enjoyed having my fingernails ripped off one by one followed by an acid bath more than that ghastly piece of 'Australian Film making'
While time has past since a good under dog tale, does BoyTown turn the tide; no.
This movie is the first English language movie for Virginie Ledoyen since "The Beach" and I think it is fair to say that she will always be known as the girl from "The Beach" because she is a bland and boring actress.
Harrison and Burton play lovers who have been together for 30 yrs but you'd never know it since all Harrison does is crucify Burton with mean,ugly insults and Queenie bitching.
Supposedly according to the gay author, Harrison and Burton did it only for the huge paychecks of 1 millions dollars a piece which by todays standards would be the 20 million monster paydays you see the big stars get.Also,Harrison supposedly was disgusted with some of his dialog and left for Italy -only to come back when he was threatened with a lawsuit from the movie studio and Burton also only stuck around since his lover Elizabeth Taylor was filming a movie close by at the time.
In the end ,Harrison has to go to trial for a crime,he does not want Burton to come with him since he thinks his old gay paunchy lover with a head wrap will cause him to get the book thrown at him.So he leaves their flat and heads towards the couthouse, as he tries to cross the street he realizes that he cannot do this alone and screams for Burton who runs to his side and holds him as they cross the street .
I haven't wasted money on a Anime Series like this, since Trinity Blood.
Perhaps you had watched a few movies or, like Elvis, had always noticed him as the "understood" representation of juvenile disillusionment and delinquency (more the latter than the former, since our culture celebrates rebellion more so than simple dissatisfaction).
- Derek has a cell phone (obviously, since he used it to call Stacy a number of times) and neither Rachel or Joyce called him about all the silly goings-on around his (Derek's) life, particularly the fact that the dog, Bob, has superhuman powers.
Ah, I thought to myself, this HAS to be a well-thought out movie, since the last movie I saw with a Shakespearean quote in it (Runaway Train) had been very very good.
At this point, her bizarre chain-smoking overworked former bus driver and former something else (I can't recall at the moment) coworker played by Holly Hunter--who smokes everywhere indoors, which I haven't seen happen in real life since the late 70s--suggests she call one of the names from the handheld, a woman who just happens to be a supermodel (of course) who was on the show a while back, and stage a fake interview.
The poor coworker's story seems to serve no other purpose than to use screen time, since the subplot involving him comes from nowhere and then goes nowhere.
As far as Sundance and IFC go - I simply have to assume that ever since the 'independent' genre made it big, finding quality programming that draws an audience without having to pay great sums must be becoming increasingly difficult.
In the first scene, a man is murdered in cold blood, and his family seems hardly ruffled by this inconvenience, instead carrying on with the same grim determination that has gripped this film since the beginning of time (or, at least, the opening credits).
Enjoyed this horrible horror film mainly because I just wanted to find out what it was all about and since I have been a big fan of Dorothy Malone for many years and enjoyed her performance in the great film, "Inherit the Wind".
But since I have seen worse pictures (at least you can see they're trying here and my b-movie fable might also play a role), I gave it 3 stars!
None the less, never laughed so hard since Bridget Jones.
There is a point of view that every possible genre of literature was invented by the Greeks and we have just been ringing changes ever since; so there in nothing wrong with re-imagining the classics--Jean Cocteau's films, "Clueless" on Jane Austen, John Gardner's "Grendell", Kurosawa's "Ran" and "Throne of Blood", much of Roger Corman's work,and numerous others.
Not that I know what his strongpoint is, but just having a group of soldiers sit around and jibber jabber about the things we have heard in any and all other Vietnam films produced since Oliver Stone's platoon induced yawns that were larger than the holes these soldiers were climbing down.
It is very easy to understand the solitude of the unpleasant Delphine and I recommend to see this movie on DVD, since the viewer will be able to use the rewind (when he or she takes an involuntary nap) or the fast forward button in case of unbearable boredom.
It's difficult to comprehend why since it has no bearing on the quiet desperation Rumley's grasping at, instead evoking the feel of an Eighties music video or a VW commercial.
So the family moves to the house and the Swedish boy starts seeing some 1800's-ish looking girl, but it's hard to tell since this movie was made in the 70's.
I saw this movie in the bargain DVD rack at my local Blockbuster, and since I had mildly enjoyed some of Fulci's other movies I decided to give it a try.
The incoherent plot involves some psycho doctor who has been living in the basement of a Boston mansion since the start of the 20th century, occasionally popping up to hack off the odd body part to replace his decaying limbs.
When the story advances to the road aspect of the movie, we get 'surprise' devices like .... finding a blind man listening to a radio in the boonies somewhere in Mexico .....how this living-alone, elderly impoverished sightless man was able to find the fuel to run the .....presumed..... generator since his cancer-ridden son hadn't visited in six months is a different story problem......
I know it was a crappy B-movie but at least since it had some wrestling in it they should have at least had some action.
In one episode they need money, so they sell they're Shore Suck beach restaurant, but in other episodes they HAVE a cottage in the mountains, where they go to in vacations or something like that, and it's probably really theirs, since they always go to the exact same.
I might be so wrong,because I haven't seen this show in years,but how is this realistic?And what the hell is with the slang?I'm around lots of gangs nowadays,and I've never heard anyone say I've never heard the word "shoobee"or whatever it was.Even when I was at the beach in Maryland,I never heard one surfer kid say that.And what's with he word "lame-o"?Honestly,these kids are like 13 or 15 and they are still using baby ghetto talk.I haven't said "lame-o" since I was like firkin ten!
I would argue that it WASN'T made for the fans since there were several recycled jokes that die-hard fans would have spotted and cringed at immediately.
Up to this point, The Collector was supplying Weller with kids from other towns since local kids were of no use to Weller.
But, since this is an 80s horror movie, it doesn't matter as Weller resurrects his helper and decides Teri will be the final sacrifice.
I almost wish that Boll had used a different name when he made it since I doubt the film will ever get the attention it deserves because of who he is.
Oddly only a small glimpse of the town is visible in the movie, in the scene where you can see an old barbed wire fence outside of the car window as John Schneider drives down the road... well the hill just above it has contained 3 apartment complexes since around 1992 and I currently reside in one of them.
In another scene you can see out the door of the "Inn" (if you can call it that) the old historic Co-Op building which used to be a Railroad Station that was used in the Civil War (tracks have been gone since 1990 or so).
It is set in 1877, two weeks have passed since Custer's defeat, and the new town that sprung up on the back of the gold rush is chockablock with foul mouthed characters of all types, either looking to prospect, or service those who are finding the gold.
The original BASKET CASE is one of my all-time favorite B-movies, and has been ever since I first saw it as a kid on cable over 20 years ago.
I don't think I have since received so many late-fees from a single rental as I did with that movie, from keeping it for weeks on end... As I got older and learned of other Frank Hennenlotter titles, I sought out other gems like "Frankenhooker", "Brain Damage" and, of course, the "Basket Case" sequels.
I vaguely recall having also seen the two follow-ups as a youngster and, of course, they never really stuck with me since...
Reading all the comments about how funny and amazing and "true" this film is, I hope that the world has progressed a LOT since it was made or that the people who commented didn't actually see the vast majority of this film.
I have to admit that nudity would really have helped me enjoy this movie more since the first forty minutes is boring as hell.
Seven years have passed since a sorority sister was killed as a result of a Russian-roulette-type initiation, which was ruled an accident.
Well since Rodan, Godzilla and Rodan did it by themselves in Ghidra's first appearance, what's the likelyhood that he can beat all of them?
Trantulas: The Deadly Cargo is pretty crap stuff all the way, it has no excitement, it's slow, it's dull & since Arachnophobia (1990) is ten times better & much more widely available there is no need whatsoever to be wasting your time on this.
Honestly, it feels like this is supposed to be part of the universe "Appleseed" exists in because I get the expectation that we're supposed to already know who Vexille and Leon are (especially since it comes across much like Deunan and Briareos), so I seriously wonder if this was a retrofitted story that was rejected for the "Appleseed" series.
I don't remember being bored like this since I was on detention at high school.
I've been a fan of horror movies and thrillers since I was a child.
There was potential for this movie to be a cute yet somewhat cheesy hallmark type, and hey, since it is the holiday season I was fully prepared for that.
This is possibly the worst movie since Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton graced the screen in "The Sandpiper."
The issues of Kashmir have never been easy to solve since Nehru took the issue to UN.
This is one time I'm sorry I didn't turn the DVD player off, since watching the entire movie ended up making me feel culpable in the on screen activity.
The Secretary-General (a woman, which has not yet happened and may not since none of the Islamic nations, which have a vast, unreasoning fear of women, would vote for her) underplays a pivotal role here, and needed to have appeared a lot more.
Of course, since they're so obvious, the bad guy may be someone else entirely.
Changing the House and Gardens tour into a Mystery Bus Tour was another problem, since I found it hard to believe that these people selected by Mr. Rafiel would willingly remain when they are visiting places connected to their past which they wanted to keep hidden.
When I first read the "sisters" would become nuns, I was open-minded since it could have provided a way of tightening the story.
Nothing much has impressed me more since then.
And no matter how many 'emotional' scenes are rammed in, it has been five years since he left his pregnant fiancÃ©e at the alter.
then all the scenes in the total pitch black, where honestly since the characters are so flat, you don't really care whats going to happen, but regardless, after it happens and someone is killed, you just say to yourself, was i supposed to see that?
Full of stuff that just doesn't happen in the real world (since when were British police inspectors armed with handguns in shoulder holsters?).
I think "Bertram's Hotel" is the one that disappointed me most since it was my favorite book, with "Nemesis" as second.
I've no idea the nationality of Kotting but I doubt if he's from the North of England since he seems to be under the impression that Yorkshire is a vast wilderness .
I wouldn't be surprised since it's the only way that you'll be able to follow the story .
These trinkets also make Noah, a dim bulb at school, turn into a nationwide science fair champion (since he can communicate with spiders and make then spin webs of his choosing).
The night scenes are so incompetently photographed that you can't tell what the hell is going on, which could cause some alarm if the daylight scenes were any good, but since everything is equally stupid, blame whoever, in front of or behind the camera, you want.
The children Noah and Emma Wilder (played not too convincingly by Chris O'Neil and Rhiannon Leigh Wryn) open the box which contains some magical rocks, a seashell that allows them to hear things humans can't, a contraption that looks like a dead sea urchin and a stuffed doll rabbit that is the weirdest artificial intelligence to grace the screen since that stupid bear gave me nightmares in Spielberg's A.I.
But director Bob Shaye, who has not been behind the camera since 1990's Book of Love, weaves an incoherent and completely unbelievable plot that goes nowhere fast and results in a dead end once we get there.
I can't really comment on that since I was only 12 when she was kidnapped and knew little about it.
This bombed in 1988 and has since sunk without a trace.
Low level family film is good for undemanding three or four year olds since odds are they're the only ones who won't have seen it all before.
No wonder why he went all out in the final twenty minutes, but this creature could've been mistaken for a machine since all of the punishment it encounters and still it doesn't bleed.
THEN they get thrown out again, and  are back four scenes later since that was the best set they had.
You'd think, since money was invested to have working security cameras in the decrepit asylum, that the security would have been a hell of a lot better at the new one!
Technically the film is fine & is really the only positive aspect of it but since it sucks so bad in every other way does it really matter?
Amy's moronic friends think the coach is great since he buys them wine and lets them drive his truck...too bad, Amy!
The principal of Amy's school can't/won't do anything, since he's a limp noodle who doesn't want to get crosswise with the popular coach, and since the football team is more important than any girl who's being traumatized by a teacher....too bad, Amy!
The coach's wife must sleep like a hibernating bear, since the coach wanders his house at midnight and leads poor Amy off to some empty bedroom for some "extra credit".
This movie could have been A LOT better, since the subject deserves a better rendering.
This is the kind of incompetent garbage that would be made bearable only by either good-natured silliness or barking mad humour; but since the tone here is rather nasty, and laughs are pretty much absent (funniest line: 'What the sh*t?
After torturing the audience with some of the worst movie making the world has ever since (I have seen Cable Access shows with better film making skills and production) they give us a cheap payoff by repeating what happened in the beginning.
The screenplay discloses since the very beginning that Mimzy was sent from the future to save the human race, therefore there is no surprise or twist in the end.
The lead actress, who must be the girlfriend of the director since she also stars in the directors only other film Southern Nights which never even received a DVD release, has all the screen presence of a pile of wet cement, she sleeps walks her way through the film.
They obliviously skipped color correction during post since they wanted to cut their losses on this dog.
The level of fear factor in this movie is zero, it shouldn't have been in the mix of After Dark Horrorfest since it seemed like "made for TV" cheese.
But, since the group needs a leader (they're all too dumb to think for themselves) they elect this liar to basically set them up for the kill.
or b) elect a useless leader (who is happy to spend his day banging his woman), leave all the hospital entrances open, and not worry too much about food and weapons, since you have plenty of tasteless army rations and at least two guns and a handful of bullets in case of an emergency?
I should have known better, since it's one of the 8 Films to Die for.
Another dud Australian film, which proves to me , that the quality of Australian films has declined since the good old 1970's & 80's when all the classics were made.
There is trouble in paradise, however, since they find themselves on opposite sides of an attempt to pass satellite codes to the Russians encoded into a homemade porno film.
I really wanted to like this movie, especially when I saw that Patrick Stewart was in the cast as the voice of the raven since I'm a long-time Patrick Stewart fan.
Meanwhile, a young couple arrives in the inn since the husband will have a job interview in a video company of the town.
The unknown cast is reasonable, and the beautiful Kelly Sue Roth deserved a better make-up, since the DVD highlights the acne in her face.
Well, that would be appropriate, I guess, since this possesses all the thrills and chills of framing a house.
Update #2: I've since spoken to a couple of people who were involved in this production and they both reported that "no-one seemed to know what they were doing, and boy does it show.
Beyond that, South Park has really taken a downhill turn since pretty much the end of season 5.
From the BAD "Matrix"-Parody in the intro-animation to the Alfons Hatler-Character (possibly the worst impersonator of the Fuehrer since the original), its just terrible.
This was the first movie I was inclined to leave since "Hoffa" (I fell asleep in that one).
Killed off screen (for the life of me I couldn't understand why she was screaming since she was clearly hiding some nefarious, evil pact with the creature)  Probably, to answer my own question, she was just a poorly conceived character like the rest of the cast (these people make the cast of The Squid and the Whale seem like Leave it to Beaver.
This movie was definitely done on the cheap since the lighting and the sound both were sub-standard, considering that the actors and actresses were all unknowns there should have been more than ample money to hire people to properly do the sound and lighting.
And the more I emphasise that Therion have had choirs and orchestras as an integral component of their material since before Metallica's post-black-album crisis of how to revive suddenly ailing record sales, the better.
For the hardcore Pixies fan, loudQUIETloud may be sufferable since it gives viewers ample face-time with the band members themselves.
We do not learn from the documentary too much about the sources of their music, we do not understand why despite the success of their second career and despite of them writing music for their individual careers there was and there is no new album since they reunited.
OK, the two friends are so closed since childhood that this past means a lot in their adult life.
Okay, it's nothing a friend should do to cheat on his best friend with his wife - but hey, feelings sometimes make us do things that are not really clever, but still that's what feelings are there for in a way... and since it always takes two persons to cheat on a third one, I really could not understand what this movie wanted to express in the end.
Director Gregor Jordan's filmography is getting progressively worse since the amazing Two Hands, which was made back when he had little money to work with, away from big Hollywood influences.
I haven't seen a movie this bad since JCVD's "the quest" and that was actually better.
I don't blame him (and I feel for Jordan too since you gotta respect someone who has the guts to face the honor - and pressure - of having your movie premiering at Sundance).
The movie cannot has 1/10, since it has still one funny part: "Oh Silvia!..."
And thank god there's no laugh track, but Christ, I have to voice a counter opinion to all this wanton praise since I've sat through repeated viewings of it now (with the aforementioned friend and his flatmate) and I honestly hate it.
The scenes of the artists painting are pure vaudeville - most of them seemingly getting more paint on themselves than on the canvas; this is not a total loss however since the paint looks decidedly better on them than on the finished paintings, which are dross.
But since that moment some strange murders occur in the quiet tourist destination.
And since it was made for TV, there is no gore, just women screaming as Jack raises a blade as we fade to commercial.
It seems that she's been a star since forever and she didn't aged a day.
I'm also not sure of Joe D'Amato's actual involvement since his name (or "David Hills" for that matter) is nowhere to be found in the credits.
And both of the writers had never written anything before - and haven't written anything since.
Why shouldn't we expect global temperatures to increase since we are still coming out of the last Ice Age?
I'd filed it under "raffles" since, at the time, I didn't recognize any of the actors in it.
I don't know why I have not seen this film since it came out in 1968, but I really wish someone would bring it back.
Note: since we have no understanding of backward time-travel, it does not need to be explained.
I haven't seen Attic since the mid-80's and have kept an eye out for it ever since, to no avail.
Im a big fan of the western genre and so bias but that said Deadwood is the greatest thing since moving pictures were invented.
This movie is one of the worst movies to be put on film since The Blair Witch Project.
I can't believe this movie lasted close to two hours since I personally didn't believe there was 32 seconds of useful material in this horrid farce of a movie.
The cover made the movie look fairly creepy, and the comment on the back "The most terrifying movie since The Shining" (probably by the director's mom) made it look like a decent movie.
What also drew me to see it was the comment that it is the scariest movie since The Shining.
Whoever said it was the scariest movie since The Shining should be ashamed.
And I later noticed that on the cover, a critic (must've been a dumb one at that) quoted this "The scariest horror film since The Shinning".
I'll admit that I did like this movie when it first came out, but I've since graduated from Junior High.
The character's army flashbacks are interesting too, especially since real life serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer had a bad experience in the army as well.
It clunks, but as a contrast to the beautifully scripted and acted films he's made since, it just about bears watching.
The director is childish to think she can direct, since any good director would change lines, direct actors to react a certain way and frame the shot so that is not in a constant 3-shot.
He's fortunate most of the time not to be exposed since he's done little research to pull off his deceptions and in one instance is unmasked when he accepts credit for a film most people know he didn't make.
To summarize its an OK film for kids but i think they forgot what made Stewart Little films liked in the 1st place,and thats decent animated characters in a real world environment,and since this is all animated i cannot see the same appeal being prevalent.
Interesting that Jaclyn Smith was front and center for the first act since she had the least amount of acting experience going in.
I saw the ending coming a mile away, since it was a LOT like the ending to Sixth Sense.
Unfortunately, I'm not going to do that, since I watched it again just last year (I'm 26 now).
One could wonder why this isn't a sequel to the "Saw" movies, especially since it resembles much with them, including Tobin Bell (no wonder he decided to be in the movie!).
this sequel is nowhere near as good as the original.there is lots of blood in this one,courtesy of the fight scenes.,which is a good thing.the fight scenes themselves aren't too bad.however, if found the plot to be lame and uninteresting.this martial arts movie did not really engage my interest very much.this movie lacks the depth(i,i said depth and martial arts movie in the same sentence)of the first film and even the following two sequels.the worst part of the experience is the song selections and choice of band.who picks this crap.these guy don't even rate as flea bag bar band.and the songs are pathetic.the only good things in this movie are Sasha Mitchell,who makes a credible hero and Dennis Chan,who plays the wise oriental sidekick.i suppose i could eke out a 5/10 for this movie,since it is watchable,but the music just sucks so damn bad,i have to give "Kickboxer 2" 4/10
He's been a hack since his first feature and continues to be with this film.
I had never heard of the movie before but when they showed it on TV it had a great review and since I like everybody from the Friends cast very much I thought let's give it a try.
In other words, the conversation scenes carry a cute, predictably plot-twisted story revolving around all the clichÃ©s that we've seen since the camera was invented.
This is the worst movie idea since Uncle Sam.
Her dialogue doesn't make her character seem very stupid, but since she is, she makes everytihng and everyone around her look and act dumb, but once she's gone, they all seem smart.
(Matthew Settle, who really did his best in a thankless role), since Ray is unaccounted.
But this time it's idiocy all the way, from the title (the most inaccurate title for a sequel since "Rambo III") to the climax featuring the world's only six-shooter that fires eight bullets, while Danny Cannon's direction and John Frizzell's score duke it out to see which is the most OTT (the music wins).
I'll give this a 2 since Teal'k made at least 6 minutes of the movie watchable.
The show is to be commended for attempting to educate viewers about little people and demonstrate how they are essentially "just like you and me", but that is also its downfall - for ordinariness simply hasn't made for compelling TV viewing since the days of "Father Knows Best".
Or it will be quickly forgotten and gain a reputation of the worst Christmas movie idea since Santa Claus Conquers the Martins.
Chris Kattan's Sparky became annoying quite quickly, as did the script's constant barrage of in-jokes for adults (since it was shown at the 9PM-11PM time slot they probably thought it was necessary to attract an adult audience.)
I'll have a blue Christmas (since I've seen you.)
And the ending is one of the saddest endings since that of "A Tale of Two Sisters".
at one point it even tells new-yorkers that they should be more concerned with doing the "first-strike" because they would be the first target if "someone" acquires "weapons of mass-destruction"( so wait... this actually must be about Iran since everyone knew, by the time this feature was produced,that Iraq had no such "evil" things?).
But Sega's really been pounding the series into the ground since the late 90's, introducing more characters than necessary and cranking out games in a fashion and speed that would have Paul J. Smith kneeling before Yuji Uekawa's feet and worshipping him.
I have been a sonic fan ever since the old genesis games and I am still a sonic fan.
Instead of wasting your money and two hours of your life watching the biggest over-baked John Woo film since...John Woo's last film, Face Off!.
The story centres on 2 friends who have been friends since they were kids.
An interesting point to note is that since we know that Jim Phelp's salary was 60K PA There is no way the Rogue IMF grunt in this film could afford a massive private army along with a beach front Condo.
I didn't really like the characters in it because they are stereotypical and simple, but I guess you have to make them like that because if you don't it would be difficult for the audience to get to know all the characters since there is a lot of them in this film.
Christina Ricci was a huge disappointment since she normally is a great actress but she didn't fit in playing her character.
decides that since they haven't reported back, then that MUST mean they've been killed by the weed farmers, who are only suspected to be in the general area.
I never watched it on TV because when the Buffy movie came out, I hated it (of course, a lot has changed since then).
I decided on the later, since this was purely painful.
It's been sometime since I saw the two follow-ups to this film: 'The Magic Cloak of Oz' and 'His Majesty, the Scarecrow of Oz,' but I remember them as more of the same.
A better ghost (I guess since there is at least one ghost) movie wouldn't have to create a lousy reason for ghosts to be there.
It was the worst attempt at an accent since-well since Ms. Stone's accent in the remake of "Gloria".
Tim has gone on to do some great and creative things since this came out.
That set alarm bells ringing since it's only April 2007 now.
These most be the most boring circle of friends ever, since all they do in the evening is sit around a table and murmur the entire time!
However, like the other good-time girls before and since, her 15 minutes clearly lasted 14 minutes too long.
It also purports to be something of a mystery, which is daft since there isn't one!.
If so, it would have placed the film completely out-of-balance, since there wasn't a hint of depth or charisma - not a trace - in any one character, performer, or portrayal.
At first, I thought it was a movie about college, since all the actors were so old and just walked in and out of classrooms at their leisure, but then I was stunned that they were suppose to be high school age.
Also, the ship models might just be the worst I have ever seen on film since the very early days of cinema--with obvious paintings and toy-like ships that wouldn't fool anyone.
For no apparent reason although it's hard to feel sorry for Rachel since she was standing right in the middle of the road.
The script by Ellis Walker is a total mess from start to finish, there are flashbacks, flash-forwards, dreams, dreams within dreams, hallucinations, a confusing plot that doesn't work, a terrible ending that makes no sense & the whole film is just a narrative nightmare as you are thrust from one scenario to another in the blink of an eye & thus not really giving you the chance to take the already confused plot in since it chops & changes so much.
The ending is awful too, since when does dying for a few minutes enable you to travel back in time & change past events?
Director Feifer does OK & to be fair to Grim Reaper it's fairly well made, I am not sure why there are no lights in St. Joseph's since it appears to be the darkest mental institution on Earth but as a whole the film is reasonably well made & photographed.
the zombie is then not even after the now senior citizen soldier, instead they want to thank him since he stood up for them.
I'm sure that at one time these special effects were considered state of the art, but for God's sake he's been using the same damn techniques since 1956.
I had not seen it since, until a few months ago when I caught it on cable.
I FORCED myself to watch this movie to not only see how much I could stand since I was bored anyway, but to see it entirely so I can be totally correct when I say it is the worst movie to ever see.
I even said to myself "I wonder how they would escape since the old couple could barely walk much less run even though they always kept within seeing distance of the others".
The actors probably died before that scene since they were so old!
"Empire of the Ants" is an interesting epitaph for a genre that has long since passed, but its best possible fate will probably be drunken viewing at your next house party.
Better yet, actually READ the book, since apparently you did not if you think THIS movie is 'true' to the book.
Difficult to tell actually who is copying whom since apparently Deep Core is dated 2000 and The Core is dated 2003.
Sadly my expectations withered slowly away since the very beginning.
It's long, drawn out and slow like a typical CSI-ish drama with just a not-so-subtle hint of religious preaching now and then (discounting testimony's from "God", since we'd expect that, but the "it's only logical to believe in God" speech from the nerd-brother?).
I had never seen a Nanni Moretti movie previously and I was pretty curious since he is the kind of "respected author" among the European critics.
Bruno Bonomo is at a loss, maybe he wants to assert himself and then the Berlusconi biopic project lands in his life where it doesn't belong but it is very difficult to understand why he would be interested at first since he doesn't realize what the project is about.
I was going to review the acting but since this is running longer than I expected, I just want to say that Pacino sleeps through the role and gets his paycheck and Leelee Sobieski is one of the cheesiest and phoniest people I've ever seen act.
It is pointless to comment all trivialities and the length this movie voyages without a hint of single intelligent solution : She is a vegetarian but she decides since she has nothing to loose, she can "stop the torture" and enjoy the flesh again.
But wait, since we have a very clear targeted demographic with such prosaic hooks; lets, lets even offer threesome pleasure to be even safer with the audience.
And since it was on Sky Movies weekly for a month back in the 90s I had enough opportunities to hate it.
I added the extra 1/2 star since the film did end correctly, that is, that school comes first.
If you edited out half the gaps between their words the conversation might actually appear to flow normally but since this was not done you are simply left with big gaps where audience members ( the smart ones that is ) will run out of patience and leave the room.
From 1961 through 2006 I can't say that I personally was overcome by the death of non family members and certainly not actors or actresses, especially since a majority of them suffer through the excesses of drug and alcohol abuse This film is mostly a curiosity for all the up and coming stars (*1/2 Out Of ****)
I don't think that a movie can survive using special effects only, and since this movie is like one, big special effect with no interesting story whatsoever I have to give this movie 4/10.
In fact, all of Michael Crichton's books since Jurassic Park was a smash hit have been sub par to downright awful and this is no exception.
If anyone wants to disagree with me - great - maybe I missed something - it's been a long time since I've seen it.
Apparently the two used to be friends and have since had a falling out.
You'll feel the urge to buy the single of that asap since it's sooooo catchy.
I figured it would be at least an entertaining fun movie, especially since it had the stars back from the first film.
I've wanted to see the movie ever since.
I'm sad to report things have gotten even worse, since now we need to resource to _our_ (external) knowledge of the period to understand what's going on.
He has a crazy idea that entails killing the boss dragon, since it is the only male dragon of the millions around the globe (must be a busy fella).
This movie used jokes that would've been funny about 10 years ago, and have since been beaten mercilessly into the ground.
There's no conceivable reason to hate your audience here, since presumably they'll be pretty close to the same audience that watches Reno 911.
Dan Fogler is the least funny leading man since Jimmy Fallon and mugs for the camera every opportunity he gets, imitating Jack Black as best as he can.
This is the best post-apocalyptic action film since THE ROAD WARRIOR.
I was only two when the original miniseries came out, but ever since I was in about grade 5 or 6, and first saw it, I've absolutely loved it and even created a webpage dedicated to The Thorn Birds.
Even if I've only seen it two to three times since 1996...
In the original Ralph tells Meggie its nearly been twenty years since we saw each other.
I DON'T WANT TO BE BORN stars Joan Collins so right away you've got a problem since Joan Collins is unable to play any character that isn't Joan Collins .
Or at least I think that's what happened since the editing leaves us none the wiser .
He was responsible for an endless amount of great TV-movies and a few downright classic Hammer titles (like 'Countess Dracula' and 'Hands of the Ripper') but, ever since Doomwatch, he just seems to make crap.
He starts heading for the dope smoking crowd and why wouldn't he since Tamblyn's an undercover cop.
As is Russ Tamblyn who was finding it more difficult to get work from MGM since they cut back on musicals.
But you got to love Mamie Van Doren as Tamblyn's 'aunt' who tries to seduce him since she's not getting any because her husband has flown the coop.
This one should have been released as satire since that's what the producers unintentionally got.
High School Confidential remains notable from a view of drug trafficking and the process of addiction that had advanced not a whit since Reefer Madness in the Âthirties.
The movie obviously had some great production values, since the movie is set all around the globe, from Paris to Istanbul and everything around it and between.
Too bad that his career has derailed so badly the last couple of decades, ever since his Oscar winning role for "An Officer and a Gentleman", from 1982.
I couldn't begin to suggest if someone else will like this movie, since clearly everyone has their own reaction and some love it.
Chuck and his bride-to-be barely communicate apparently, since she never knows anything until almost the end of the movie.
Considering the kiss, one would think he really wanted to, since even when a lot of guys 'experiment' with other dudes, kissing is rarely on the menu.
Towards the end of the film when Jim returns to visit Antonia and her husband and children, the narrator states that it has been fifteen years since he last saw her.
The finale is effective as well, since the gargoyle meets his death in a rather nasty fashion.
No, it's fairly obvious early on that NONE of the actors had ever before acted (and probably never since!).
To say the least, Malcolm Lee's "The Best Man" is the most respectable African-American oriented movie to be released since "Soul Food" and "Love Jones."
Plus, her success in the European scene might have buried her even further down, since Hollwyood might not have taken too well to this occurrence in foreign lands.
It just isn't very funny and is a dud in so many ways--especially since the lead, Jack Shutta ("Windy Riley") is about as entertaining as Ebola!
The acting doesn't help, since it doesn't look like they're trying at all - well, maybe George Sanders, as much as he can with an underwritten part, and Henry Daniell has a spark of life that makes him stand out - but if I hadn't seen Joseph Cotten before, I'd never suspect him of being a competent actor, judging by this performance.
SF movies have come a long way since this, and we should thank the stars.
It is years since I saw something as bad as this.
I'll start with the history since no one else did.
Well, you'd expect that this film would be really, really good since it was such an important film--and you'd be 100% wrong.
Actually, "low-budget" is an inappropriate description, since that might imply there WAS a budget for this crap.
'EnterÂPlaga Zombie 1.5' could be an alternate title since it could almost be a missing higher no-budgeted spin-off from that series.
It's not like it was the Labour party which holds the reigns since 1997 which has enacted all current anti-Terror laws and has greatly enhanced the power of the state and reduced privacy and freedom of the individual.
A political protest need be neither political, nor a protest; it needn't be coherent as long as it's Creative, since those viewing the goings-on will either be In Tune or are The Living-Dead Corporate Enemy, in which case they are irredeemably evil despite their support for anyone in La Vie Boheme.
I rented this movie, since the awful (and yet still too kind) reviews kept me from wasting my $$$ at the theater.
The worst film about the war in the East since "Never so few".
I didn't get into how Elliot was getting naked with his friends and watching porno stuff with monkeys and bad music, but since your friends are not even worried about how corn and vegetables will kill you, then it makes sense that you button up your shirt when your girlfriend shows up unexpected.
I'm gonna tell you, since it's so retarded.
This is probably a good thing since the first movie wasn't even funny in an awful way, just horribly lame.
There is not a single troll in Troll 2 anyway, since they're all "goblins."
These dorks couldn't score with Nilbog girls if they paid them, but since there's a weird homo erotic feel to their interactions, it probably wouldn't come to that.
Stone's wife(Elizabeth Wilkinson)realizes that her husband has become cold and distant since sampling the brandy.
Of course you could argue that it's not fair to criticise this film for being rubbish since anyone going into a HGL film will know that already; but the fact of the matter is that A Taste of Blood is a heinously bad film and it would be impossible to write anything about it without highlighting the numerous flaws.
Filmed in Florida, it's pretty torturous to sit through, and is recommended only for Karen fans, since she does look especially attractive, in black eyeliner.
How long has it been since the original?
Boy, I haven't seen this movie since I was a kid.
since this movie is so groovy and with it that it doesn't really have to make sense.
In the end, the mummy retrieves its tacky jewelry and is about to beam itself up(to what, we'll never know, since I doubt the mother ship actually hung around waiting for it to return for three thousand years)when a security guard tries to shoot it.
Warning: Don't expect too much from this twist however since it is the most ridiculous twist I have seen.
And since you can't write a terribly compelling film about training vocalists, we're trapped into watching seemingly endless camera pans of trees, birds in them chirping ad nauseum, pseudo-profound, meaningful stares between people who have nothing to say to each other, and a Mahler symphony on the sound track that just simply won't go away.
There are many shot in California and other places but, since I have lived here it's great to see familiar territory.
William Zabka was the only one that I truly was familiar with since "The Karate Kid " (1984) which of course hit big at the Box-Office!
That's another familiar Hollywood theme since the '60s: make the hero morally unsound but someone to root for.
When Eddie Murphy hit it big on Saturday Night Live,he became the hottest featured player on there since John Belushi.
Also , since this is the 1980's , all car wrecks or "dangerous scenes" , have to show the bad guys running to safety just before the big bang!
Note: I can only really comment on the first hour of this movie, since that's all we stayed for.
No surprise, since it is based on a novel by William Faulkner.
She hasn't been good in any movie since the parent trap (also why are people saying shes hot?
Lohan doesn't really get support from the rest of the cast since they all decide to phone in their performances.
The ending is also pretty bad since it randomly ends with Lohan kissing Sam even though they hardly focused on this romantic subplot.
Carla will be there since her father is the lawyer that represents Sid Arthur.
I guess I can't judge whether or not it is offensive or if it is funny in a satirical sense, since I'm not a racial minority, but it seemed pretty disrespectful.
The action is the real reason to watch the movie since everything else is handled poorly.
I wasn't surprised by this and there was really nothing they could have done since the film was 95 minutes long.
I've since bought their DVD of "BOND Live in Concert at the Royal Albert Hall" and it is fantastic.
-the plot here which has been stolen from EVERY action movie ever made consists of a planned hit on the president's life or something like that and since no one else can stop the masterminds behind it only XXX can save the day.
And since the action sequences are the only reason to watch something like this, and they suck, there's no real reason to give this movie even a moment's consideration.
I bought it on DVD (very cheap, since it was part of a Hong Kong Legends commercial pack) and I never watched it till the end.
I gave it a 1 since 0 is not possible.
I spent most of the movie thinking about how fat he's become since the last Seagal movie I watched (which must have been "Hard to Kill").
This is another sequel from the great one since Under Siege (Which I never knew about Seagal making this sequel) from the 2003 movie The Foreinger and that one was better than this and I can't believe what crap this movie is.
People always want to think that they were the first to do something, when things like profanity, substance abuse and prostitution have been around since before man walked erect.
I had been expecting a lot from it, as I'm a huge fan of James Cameron (and not just since "Titanic", I might add), and his name in the credits I thought would be a guarantee of quality (Then again, he also wrote the leaden Strange Days..).
During the Cultural Revolution photos (and most anything else like musical instruments, art, foreign clothing, books, or even nicer furniture) were not allowed and were destroyed or buried, as you could be severely punished for having them, since they were considered "foreign" I even heard of a lady putting her family photos in soup ( when her house was being searched by Red Guards) to get rid of them lest she be caught.
For fairness, I must disclose that my entire family is french, I speak fluently, but I have lived here since i was 6, and everybody considers me an american.
Even more so since I got my hands on the video with the Rick Wakeman score.
I saw this film years ago - so am a bit rusty - but since I'm reading their book at the moment I feel compelled to write: The thing that I remember most about it is this: The main characters are two despicable types so you don't care for them - I found my self not caring what happened because there was nothing about the characters to like or admire or empathise with.
I'm pretty sure the acting is the pits too, but I can't be sure since the dubbing is so bad.
It makes me wonder why the producers felt there was a market for these movies, since it is hardly providing anything new.
However, if you are gay or, especially, lesbian, you should have quite a few problems with this movie since there is a homicidal lesbian depicted (not an altogether ugly portrait, but still...).
And since it is set in the world of a music academy, it contains many beautiful pieces of classical highlights!
I won't even get in to how absurd the sasquatch looks, except to point out that the monster is supposed to be a male, since he sexually assaults women -- so why does the costume have breasts?
All this may not have much to do with the movie, but since the producers didn't have the guts to put a disclaimer on their film that any any resemblance to real characters is strictly accidental, I will continue to describe some of the errors of the film itself.
This type of deliberate internal logic gaffe is not uncommon in stage plays since it gives actors the chance to show off a bit and of course the story is entirely low concept just like you`d expect from a stage play .
So I decided since I had aready seen every other movie playing in the theater to give it a try.
I remember the real life events of this vividly since it was one of my best friends and the drummer in our band who was portrayed in this movie as the stepson.
I saw it when it first aired, but I couldn't watch it again since it brings back such bad memories, plus it's so biased.
Don't expect typical Hitchcock touches in this early silent of his called Easy Virture since this isn't even a suspense film but more of a melodrama about a divorced woman who can't escape her past, a past in which her then-husband discovered her painter's infatuation with her, which he mistakes for an affair, and gets shot by him but survives though the painter later commits suicide (which I wouldn't have known about if I hadn't read the synopsis on the DVD case back).
At least some must exist since this movie got a score above 2.
The notion is of course more than likely going to anger many audiences simply because Jesus is black, which is a shame since the poorly made film is bad enough on its own to deserve brickbats being tossed at it.
There is a reasonable possibility that Jesus was dark skinned since those native to the region tend to be of a darker skin than the light skinned Europeans who had invaded the country, so from a historical stand point one can't really argue with a dark skinned Jesus.
One can argue with pretty much argue with most of the rest of the film historically and scripturally since it contains a great number of errors.
Unfortunately, I can't say for sure since Carpenter's painstaking direction failed to hold my attention for more than a couple of minutes at a time.
I do have to agree with Don that this movie was bad but since I'm a firm believer of the second coming Christ and have been a born again Christian all my life you'd think I'd really love this movie guess what NOPE I DIDN"T IT FREAKING SUCKED COW BALLS!!!
Michael Massee has gotten better since even the first episode, but for someone supposed to be so evil, he's really not all that horrifying.
Since Charlotte's attire wasn't conservative and she was seen dancing with Jim and because she didn't physically struggle with Jim when he raped her, it is not surprising that no one believes her when she claims that his advances were unwanted especially since, by this point, Jim has already bragged to his entire fraternity about his encounter with Charlotte.
After all, who is going to buy his story since he was on drugs at the time?
When, on occasion, the need became critical, they would begin to return to their alien form, but since they could not live on Earth in their native form, they would die before the transformation was complete.
Thus they could be killed as easily as any human, but since David Vincent's need was not just to kill them individually, but to have a living specimen to prove to a disbelieving world that they were here and the nightmare had begun, and since their dedication to their purpose and anonymity was greater than their fear of death, he just could never bring off a perfect disclosure.
IN THE FILM VERSION, we were given the hype that this would answer the question of what became of the aliens and David Vincent in the quarter century since the show was terminated without catharsis.
Well, usually that is, since this "SS Experiment Love Camp" is an utterly boring mess!
This Movie seems to have increased in showing frequency since it first aired.
My boyfriend and I didn't even hesitate to pick it up, we thought it was going to be another awesome fright fest of the blood thirsty cannibals with probably better effects since Wes had pretty much made good money at that point and also established himself as a great film maker at that point.
If so, it would have placed the film completely out-of-balance, since there wasn't a hint of depth or charisma - not a trace - in any one character, performer, or portrayal.
It has been a favorite of mine since I first saw it on ABC Family Channel when it first come out.
Filmed in some wood here in the UK in Cambridge somewhere although it could have been shot anywhere since one tree looks much like another.
this film gets increasingly boring every time the mountain-top-view is shown and we see how many days have passed since the beginning.
When the two become romantically involved, a complicated situation forms since Lillian is being wooed by Meno Argenti (Omar Sharif), a powerful plutocrat who controls the emerald trade for the rotten Mexican government, thus leading to shared distaste between the two men.
With Yule blackmailing Tom since he has the most to loose between the two, his wife Patty, Kerrie Kane, and his textile business.
This film makes Abel Ferrara's THE ADDICTION (1995) look like unmitigated horror classic, and that's not saying much since I almost slept through that one, too.
Oh just about every vampire film since the early 1970's!
I won't describe the plot since others did such a good job.
Everything in the narrative is sacrificed for the visual style and more often than not it's impossible to understand what the hell is going on since the picture fades to pixellated shots that are out of focus , cross fades , slow motion sound fade outs and other directorial tricks from Michael Almereyda .
In reality, however, these movies were completed since years already but they never got released immediately for whatever reason.
The concept is actually similar to such films as Jacques Tourneur's "I walked with a Zombie" or "White Zombie", since the living dead serve as slaves to work in the fields.
Later we find that the girl who has been whipped to death has died as a human sacrifice, although it's not clear how, since the blood on her dead face has nothing to do with the whipping.
I haven't been through such cinematic agony since my attempt to watch an uncut version of "Manos the Hands of Fate".
One would have to be the biggest computer geek going to understand even half of what the characters are doing at any given time in this film, though it scarcely matters since the story itself is so distressingly hackneyed that one is already watching the screen with an eye half-cocked to one's watch anyway.
Way too many filmmakers have milked this plot line (Ron Howard, Mel Gibson, Schwartzenggar) to exhaustion, since it's fresh debut in DeathWish (way back in the 1700s) and it's become the action-adventure genre's tiresome, defacto plot line: and judging from the success of these look-alike products, apparently it's the only volition straight audiences can fathom.
It's been fourteen years since, "Patriot Games", in which Ford played a man that seemed over the hill then, and here he is today in the same situations.
It has been some time since I saw the series, but I remember vividly how it was able to affect me each week.
OK, the first movie wasn't THAT good, but it was a 'heapload' better than the sequel, which IMHO should never have been made, I mean...they can't even use "We needed to make money" as an excuse, because I'm sure even the caterers who worked on this film have never been able to find work since.
I have been a big fan of MK since the beginning, although I must admit I lost interest in the game series after part III.
And since Ball got such great creative advice from the top and the bottom throughout the course of the show, it might have been a better choice to have someone else write the Six Feet Under finale.
Not to say that NU:A doesn't have moments of sporadic entertainment (especially since the titular menace behaves in an eerily similar fashion as the "sentient" tornadoes in the movie Twister), it's just that the package as a whole is bland and uninteresting, much like the snow-covered wastes that make up most of the scenery.
The idea that a buried behemoth sparked all life on Earth and has been gradually altering the DNA of man ever since sounded promising, but ridiculous logic, conclusions reached without any logical explanation and a flat, cop-out of an ending really kept this one firmly in the "watchable but fairly drab" category.
Since the time of The Day The Earth Stood Still, when all Klaatu wanted to do was give the Earth leaders a groovy gift and got thanked by having it shot out of his hand, and in a multitude of other films since, Hollywood has taught us that when we are confronted with something of superior intellect, or of mysterious origins, if we don't understand it, if it doesn't look like a fluffy kittie, we are to shoot first, and ask questions later.
It's been a long time since Love Story, for sure.
And since the device could wipe out a civilisation just a few years before it was able to deactivate the artifact, surely that would be counter-productive (to whatever motive the aliens had in the first place).
I've wanted to see this film ever since I watched the trailer, which made me believe it was a lot like Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, or Severance.
And in fact, to persons of normal morality, he does deserve to hang, since he murdered three people for nothing but money.
Sinatra was close to perfect for Joey Evans--although certainly no better than Gene Kelly would've been; both Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak were equally attractive, although since the only musical number that Rita has to put across is "Zip," in an incredibly bowdlerized version (robbed of its intellectual heart) I wonder why her voice had to be dubbed.
Now, as a writer, I understand that ideas are a dime a dozen, but I also know that we've been out of ideas pretty much since we've had the ability to HAVE ideas.
Caroline Munro surely looked better already, since her haircut makes her look like a badger.
We see a scene with what looked like a herd of sheep but I think it is cattle since we later find out they were eaten by the locust.
All right: I still own it, and I even pre ordered this, since I'm a giant fan.
It certainly appears that space travel has vastly improved since 1953, since the spaceship's crew is using office desks and chairs.
I can see why Sonny Tufts was in this movie, since he appeared in quite a few substandard films in the 40s and 50s.
Over the two generations since Rocket to the Moon was released, films of this genre have gradually changed their intended appeal by becoming primarily skinflicks rather than Sci-Fi thrillers.
Anybody could make a machine, destroy it, blame his neighbor for making him destroy it and then go into a 40 year rage about how it was the best invention since the beginning of time and they were robbed...but people would think he's a fool.
Action films tend to waste him and since then the good roles have somewhat dried up compared to his golden period in his Spike Lee collaborations, in White Men Can't Jump, New Jack City and King Of New York.
Wesley Snipes used a stunt man to perform a kick, since when does he use a stunt man to kick, I know Wesley isn't that old.
I watched the first four episodes, because I wanted to like it, especially since Queer as Folk has yet to find a worthy replacement at the gay drama throne.
The gang members refer to themselves as "Destruction Inc" which is quite the apt name since they surely like to break all kinds of stuff, varying from people's mailboxes, living rooms, snack bars, boats and even baby-carriages.
This is an indulgence I will (reluctantly) respect since the movie, in my opinion, has a much more serious and grating problem.
Indeed one questions the approach taken with Redemption, since it aims for a police drama like Cop Land but ends up more like a hack version of clichÃ©s that repeat over and over again.
Somehow we're meant to sympathize (since Sylvia does), but it's impossible to feel sorry for a silly fool's grand gesture over a cheap floozy who's not attractive or interesting enough to inspire such passion in the first place.
I have no idea--especially since they don't appear to have much talent.
This didn't have a whole lot of impact on my ability to understand the plot, since the plot was very ripe.
But in the four years since I saw the movie in a theater, I've read no more from those three men.
The worst kind of film is not one with bad acting, or bad direction, since these can be campy and unintentionally funny.
The worst kind of film is not a style over substance summer blockbuster, since these at least provide a temporary cheap thrill.
If You Want It" by making it the film's tagline irritated me, especially since the film wasn't supposed to be about war!
We made a load of spare cash too, since the movie makers were exploiting the currency exchange rate at the time and paid pretty well (for us at the time anyway).
These aren't even B grade films-they're more like Z-grade for the most part, although most of them do have the laugh factor going for them, since they're pure Italian cheese of the stinkiest kind.
I want to blame John Milius and Arnold Schwarzenegger for this mess, since it came out in 1989, but in actuality it was probably just another piece of product grunted out by the "Sword and Sandals" division of the Italian film industry/sausage factory, and it (or something very similar to it) would probably have been made even if "Conan" had never existed.
The strange thing is that the humor is so unintentional since the actors really play their roles so seriously!
There's also the baffling instances of being able to hear the wind blow against the mike & since certain scenes were probably shot over a certain period of time the wind from one shot to the next in the same scene has different levels of this noisy blowing wind.
This may be the most unconvincing portrayal any actor has given in a role since Freddie Prinze Jr. played a fighter pilot in "Wing Commander."
No woman has gone as far as she has on looks alone since Pamela Anderson made her meteoric rise to the middle.
But this doesn't stop other massive plot holes like the police not checking for DNA when the victim of a car crash is found at the end of the movie   AP2:AAG is yet another cynical attempt to sell a stupid movie as a " Black comedy " but this is done in an even more cynical manner since it's a serial killer screenplay marketed as the sequel to a totally unrelated movie .
And the killing of the lunatic lawyer, well, gee, an "apparent suicide" for overdose would include an examination of his stomach contents, which, surprise, would not have included all those pills since his killers injected him with the drugs that kill him.
The 'twists' are all pretty predictable, if you've seen any movies within the last ten years, and the few somewhat interesting parts (wherein someone utilizes context clues to make a decision) are few and lack much punch, since the 'secret' has already been shown before these clues are explained.
I've been on the lookout for this film for over 25 years, since it was given the honor of inclusion on the first (and at the time, only) bad movie book, Harry Medved's The Fifty Worst etc.
They are laughing convulsively--a real problem since the film is a romantic drama!
I guess I can understand trying something new (since Laurel and Hardy made 15 billion movies and shorts) but the results were often sub-par and they were usually much better in shorts.
As clearly evident here, the lead flubs lines and ad-libs a lot to the already awful dialog, but since he's also the director/editor/craft service and everything, he can do what he wants.
I do not refer to this as a "film" since it was shot on video and run through the "film look" software (like Magic Bullet) which only makes your video look like grainy video (although some of the cinematography on the outside stuff is done really well - I'll give them that).
The "bullets" part is up for debate as well since there's not much in the way of gun play going on.
Nothing scary happens and I was hoping the movie had more of a diabolical evil feel to it { since it involves cards, evil, the devil, selling ones soul, etc..} .
I am a movie buff (in production/writing) who has screened horror since it began.
The first 45 minutes of this was great, thanks to some wonderful cinematography, which is no surprise since it is directed by one of the best ever: David Lean.
It has been quite a while since I have seen a film that was this beautifully crafted and nearly flawless.
Also, the plot with her stepfather was completely ridiculous, as was her going blind, since both those plots went absolutely NOWHERE!!!
Unless you want to mock it, like me and my friends, in which case go right ahead, and rent it for a long time, since you'll want to watch it over and over again, you'll be laughing so hard at it!
Rita Wilson shows up in a sentimental cameo as Irv's deceased wife since she and husband Tom Hanks served as executive producers (same as they did with "My Big, Fat Greek Wedding").
Vardalos' track is charming but marred by long pauses since she seems to miss someone prompting her to speak, while Petrie's is understandably more technical in nature.
I wonder why this film was a box office hit in Greece, where I live, since it is such a terrible, anachronistic insult to the country and its people.
wow...since Batman started this whole "re-boot" thing a few years back, everyone's going "re-boot" crazy if not "re-make" crazy...  Short and sweet, it's another slasher film...nothing is elaborated on in reference to the previous canon, which is probably the biggest disappointment.
Absurd was the plot point of Jason holding the girl hostage (for reasons that were never truly made clear)-- since when has Jason EVER done anything like that?
But I'm sure we'll have another awful remake (or sequel to a remake), since this crap hit it big at the box office.
The black guy had a slight variation though since he's black.
Just think of all the terrible films made of classic novels ever since the cinema began.
The viewer can also see just where this man is coming from, since the tax system in Japan is painted as any Republican's worst nightmare.
The Danny Freemont character tries so hard to fill Indiana Jones' shoes that it basically ruins the whole movie, since Freemont could never be Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) and everyone watching is painfully aware of this to the point of frustration.
OK at least Casper Van Dien attempts his best with the shoddy script and frivolous dialogue but he too fails to conjure up any sort of character traits since character development is obviously overlooked in the script.
This alone was enough to ruin the movie for me, since Besson proceeds to build a case that all of Joan's actions and her descent into insanity were caused by the horrific death of her sister.
A group of guys who sang together in a college a Capella group reunite 15 years later to perform at a friend's wedding and discover how their lives have progressed -- and in some cases regressed -- since their college heyday, an idea that seems dated and the lack of face-value, disappoints all the way.
I forced myself to sit through half of the first disk, since I pad good money for it, but that was it.
It's been a long time since I have seen such poor performances.
Though, its hard to call it a monster since it's a ordinary sized lizard 'slowly' knocking over model sets and toy figurines.
I couldn't help myself from gawking at their mouth since it was terribly bad.
It is almost impossible to say which part of the film is the worst, since screenplay, direction, and performances are all so reprehensibly bad.
As for the representation of academic life, it's more than a little absurd, which is actually fine with me since academic life is even more absurd than this film could hope to capture.
Overall, I was terribly disappointed, since I was hoping this would be good candy for the academic set.  
It sort of ends with Hal driving away with his two new friends and a police broadcast proclaiming that since neither Phil nor Al seem to know where the money is they are both going to jail for a long time.
The Doctor was, however, just as abusive, dismissive, selfish and manipulative, not helping her, but in a different way, being maybe worse, since appearing to be what she wanted in a man.
Someone said this is the best Farrelly's movie since "There's Something About Mary".
Fact is the Farrelly's haven't done much since ".. About Mary" except for "Shallow Hal" which at least had a decent story and good acting.
Almost immediately, Cher gives Walt a job, but their relationship is soon tested as they continue to live in L.A.  As I said earlier, the Farrellys don't know what to do with all of their material that isn't offensive, and since the essence of them is in their ability to offend people, they don't have anything up their sleeves to show us.
Ray Bradbury's "Martian Chronicles" always had a special lure to me since I am very interested in planetary astronomy and have always enjoyed a writers interpretation of what our future in space may hold.
I recommend this movie: "matando cabos" It's a very funny movie, you will forget your problems because you will be laughing since the movie start to the end.
first of all, since when is it okay to have sex with adopted family?
... actually, come to think of it, the gummy panties would probably be better, since there's the possibility of things like variety in flavors and kinds of underwear - maybe a nifty little thong too.
You would think the lead could do a better job of acting since he's just playing himself, for God's sake, and you would think a movie with this title would not put you to sleep.
It's been more than 48 hours since I watched this pitiful exercise in ego masturbation disguised as film, and I still can not erase that truly vile scene of the narrator receiving oral sex, out of my mind.
This was the worst portrayal of college life since Higher Learning.
I won't waste any time on how idiotic the picture is since others have already explained it well--but I did want to comment on a "technique" so badly executed that I had to pinch myself to confirm what I was seeing and hearing.
Midway though the film, for what seems like 20-30 minutes, there are passages of dialogue and voice-over narration that are accompanied by the actors talking, or mouthing words since you can't actually hear them--you can only hear the voiceovers.
Sheedy's career had hit a high note in 1998 with the fascinating "High Art" and I thought she deserved an Oscar nod for her tough performance but ever since then she has slowly slid back down to crap like this.
The scene where Jeff Goldblum says "since you've touched me...I've made better love than I have in years" really freaked me out.
I'll add a couple comments more since IMDb asks me to do so... although I think that it's boring and unnecessary to say that the actors are as charming as a brick is; that the movie is interrupted by a stupid "amateur home musical video clip" in order to promote the latest (Chilean maybe?
This film can EASILY be trimmed of material since it is very loose already but I don't think it would be worth it.
This movie's comedy leans heavily on Dreyfus' new relapse, a subplot that was getting tired ever since they disintegrated him in "Strikes Back" Just when it seems that the movie is going to start moving again, it does.
It doesn't matter since this is all just an excuse to watch one of the worst actors ever butcher dialog as if he were running a deli.
Don Wilson's complete lack of charisma is the film's biggest flaw since one just doesn't like the guy, he's too goody-goody, his voice is too high pitched and doesn't look very impressive in the action sequences.
I have watched this movie on and off since it started playing about 1 hour ago, and i have to say, thats an hour of my life i wasted and will not be getting back, The acting is crap and the scripts need a serious look at, and whoever wrote them needs to be slapped, perhaps the TV will explode and put me out of my misery.....
Having watched all of the Star Trek TV series episodes many times each since the 1960s, most being quite good to superb, and only very few being mediocre, my opinion is that this one is the worst of all.
The 1962 screenplay is more faithful to the original Broadway play, which is understandable since William Gibson wrote both.
it didn't start out to bad at the beginning since there were yakuzas acting sort of funny but then it went downhill from when the main characters went into the factory.
I can't believe this film had two costume designers in the credits since there are only three items, one bra, one pair of panties and one pair of men's underwear in the entire film.
No one has seen Kristy for since the accident and the cops are thinking that foul play was involved and Trevor is their main suspect.
And yet again, since the character decides to keep dreaming the whole darn movie, the people that die are alive in the next scene.
Especially for me, being that I've been looking forward to this movie since they began talking about it.
But, ever since Hellraiser 3, untalented directors wear out the name and use the villain-icon Pinhead as a marketing instrument to tell lame and inferior horror stories.
I am Spanish, and since Paz Vega has rapidly become in the last few years one of my country's most popular actresses, I couldn't help but wish that her jump to Hollywood would be successful.
First, poor Tea Leoni is the most hideous, narcissistic mother seen on film since the 1930's.
Her husband is a wuss of monumental proportions and this couple, supposedly together since high school, communicate in nothing but Westside L.A. feel good code: They need their "space;" they "validate" feelings.
But this will not happen since that would actually be taking a risk in the politically correct circles that Dino is presumably a part of.
Hey, heres a funny show idea, since there have been Christian bashing shows on the air since SNL started in the 70's and its been 30 years now, why not bash Muslim's?
Maybe the small insert of real music by Gene Rodgers is enough to search for that scene (about 9:40 in), where he plays a nice stride or similar style piano, though probably not miked while filming, since the fingerwork doesn't match up.
And how come, since much of the action revolves around moving the animals to pasture, we never once not once see a sheep or a cow or a camel EAT anything?
We figured From Hell would be good since we all were familiar with the story so there wouldn't be any surprises.
I have been a fan of Randolph Scott westerns since childhood and enjoy most of his work, but this movie plods along so slowly that you wish that everyone would shoot each other early and end the misery.
Also since it is supposed to be in `English', no subtitles were provided.
However, as a caveat, there are so many odd little idiosyncrasies that I've never seen in any film before or since it's got to be worth a look for sheer car crash value alone.
And since horror has been a widely accepted genre.
What someone with half a brain who has read any SF will be asking themselves for most of the running time is, since these time travellers from the future have nifty stun guns able to gently render anyone unconscious at a touch of a button why, when presented with a situation where they have to prevent someone from being in a particular place at a particular time, don't they just stun the poor sod till it's safe for them for him to wake up?
Its the type of movie you watch and wonder why anyone thought to make since its neither good nor bad, it just sort of is.
You would never guess it from the film itself, since they are some of the most tepid you could imagine.
There has no tension since much of the spooky action consists of the characters stumbling around looking scared while in the dark amusement park with nothing scary happening.
Stay away from this, even as a rental.I picked this up in Chinatown for five bucks on DVD and feel I was over charged (and ripped off since the DVD only had one set of 3-D glasses in it- then again the 3-D didn't always work) 3 out of 10.
There's been a lot of yada yada yada about the "Seinfeld" curse, so-called, because none of the cast of that beloved show have found successful vehicles since it ended.
It seems that all of the "Seinfeld" cast have made bad career moves since the show ended.
In addition to consistent scares, there were several elements that have been prevalent in most horror films ever since.
Rather, it set the stage for numerous films that came after, and it may not resonate with younger audiences who are more accustomed to the films that have been made since.
These people seem to think that she's some kind of 'White Goddess', which is weird since they call the two meaty, wooden white guys who appear to rescue her white devils.
The acting wasn't stellar, since the material sucked so much.
There hasn't been anything done like it since.
Even so they end up going to the same uni and that's where they become friends, but as Jennifer can pick any guy she still continues not to be satisfied and where Ryan was concerned he seemed like the perfect guy she could talk to since he wasn't interested in getting involved with anyone there were no problems between them.
Their friends believe they are somewhat in love with each other and soon things get out of hand causing their perfect friendship to be in trouble since both are not after the same thing...
The 'Good 'ol ways' represented by the homicidal Sawyer clan as a nightmare parody of the American bible-belt family are obviously the villains, but the 'new' generation, itself dying out since '68, isn't presented as any more desirable.
Also, since I am German, I didn't really appreciate the use of a nazi propaganda song from world war II.
I'd a rather Napier played him since Napier's role was mainly at the beginning and then the end as the crazed cop.
Finally, the movie is simply dragging since there is really nothing happening.
It's basically a road movie, since the vast majority of the film takes place during a classic car drive to and from Brighton in England.
So what we are left with is many cheap jokes about camels, since Chase and Aykroyd are dropped in the Middle East, we get lot of innuendos from Chase when trying to bag Aykroyd's wife and finally we get lots and lots of images of rockets in space.
He made a few good movies, "Animal House," "Coming to America," and one great one, "Trading Places," and a whole bunch of shlock in between and since.
Heather Grahm has done much better things since.
The fact that the remake's target teen audience (well, at least some of them) appeared to lap it up is just a sad reflection of how far standards have fallen since the heyday of the horror film in the 70's.
In the 29 years since `The Texas chainsaw Massacre' hit theaters, there have been countless imitators and four additional films in the franchise, three of them remakes.
There was no tension present over the whole length of 102 minutes, since the story just drags on an on without ever catching the audience's interest.
And, most significantly, since it completely fails to conjure any magic to the screen, CGI might have helped to create at least a visual spectacle - like many other mediocre movies do.
I can't believe Maury has been on since 1991.
The movie has a weak, though functional storyline, one that has since became the staple for slasher movies; a group of teenagers get lost, stumble across evil and get stalked and killed.
We all know the woman fool around with another man, and the man that they're giving the DNA test to, isn't probably the baby's father since DNA tests don't lie.
These women have not changed since high school and still have low self esteem and I can't believe he supports them and then tells these other women on other shows that acting like that is wrong.
And I also find his boot camp strategies as retarded since really bad treatment by drill sergeants does not automatically lead to new found respect for yourselves or your body.
These people go back to their old ways since they know they are not coming back.
While at first I thought I would miss Ginger, I realized her parts in this were pretty superfluous and could've been left out, since Bridgette was very capable of handling the film on her own.
But since the remake was made in the 1990s, Carpenter could throw in grueling childbirth scenes, boiling arms, barbecuing heads, a grisly shootout, an alien baby that looks like one of those 1960s troll dolls in a bottle, and of course, the option of abortion for parents who don't want to go through with their strange pregnancies.
the children all wear matching clothes which, in the original, was logical since in England children do indeed wear school uniforms.
I see no one has reviewed this flick here since 2007.
My humble expectations were not reached, however, since the film features hardly any sleaze and the gore is existent, but not to an extent that would make the movie worthwhile.
Though BLACK for the most part, segregated, spit upon by other soldiers, looked down upon they held their heads high and fought bravely during every conflict the USA had to deal with since their inception in 1868.
Perhaps Columbia simply felt entitled, since this studio released both films.
I don't remember all of it, since I am trying to forget about this disaster.
We have the UN becoming a leading world authority by picking up members at a rapid pace, and the Cold War has been over for a few years, leaving the US with a superior economic and military power(Political scientist dub this a "Hegemonic" or "Unilateral" distribution of power, where there is a clear leader, as opposed to the "Bilateral" distribution between the Cold War superpowers, or the "Multilateral" distribution of the many warring countries prior to the modern age) This argument is a weaker one though, since people didn't commonly hate the US until this decade, where we start using that power in the middle east.
Oh, Japan had been feeling heat from the US congress in the form of trade barriers, threats of tariffs and whatnot since the 80's, so that could spark a theme against overwhelming economic power.
The acting is uninspired, the action scenes do keep your interest and the scene at the windmill is a hoot since all of the nefarious parties become conglomerated like a row of pins that get knocked over in succession.
This film is for the videohounds only, since you never know what you are going to find.
F.Y.I Never select an old movie title with two recognizable actors in it on the basis of the title since it RARELY has a connection with the film but is usually a loose translation of the original title name that is stylized to entice the American audience!
And, since they chose to call these guys SEALS, which makes one think they're highly trained, why do they never aim their weapons at anything?
Heck, to call some of this animation is a joke--it was more like a fast slide show since the frame rates of 24 fps were reduced in half or worse!
But, since all those powers were shitty, many characters actually didn't care to react at them(Will's Sister,Brother) or he was willing to keep them has a secret(Let me tell you a Secret...I have Super Powers).
Completely the worst adaptation since One Flew over the Cuckoos Nest " The Musical ".
The saddest thing is this could have been a good franchise - maybe even a great one - since in my opinion the Dark is Rising series is at lest as good as the CS Lewis stuff.
The fact that this organization gave this film any kind of award can only indicate some kind of financial interest, since there is clearly no merit whatsoever evident in this film.
If you have been a fan of Susan Cooper's beloved book series since you were a kid, saw the preview and thought "Maybe it won't be as bad as it seems...", then I weep for your broken childhood love.
Otherwise the acting is not even a subject to be brought up, since cardboard cutouts don't require much effort to portray.
He gives his best performance since Twelve O'Clock High a decade earlier.
and since the movie started i knew he was going to die..and what was that whole slavery was a good thing??
This was the worst independent film I've seen since Clerks.
Why oh why give vegeta a hair cut, since saiyans hair stays the same from when they were born, vegeta's hair was so awesome in DBZ, unlike DBGT.
While dragon ball and dragon ball z are two of the best animes ever created the pitiful ending that it was given doesn't do it any justice.Dragon Ball GT was clearly poorly written while it was some what entertaining it is a utter disgrace to previous dragon ball sagas.The fact that is was canceled was shame enough.The creators should have just ended it with Dragon Ball Z as the original plan was.Another thing,Goku in his super saiyan 4 form is as cocky as Vegeta since when Goku has the cockiness of Vegeta.All he is babbling about is what he is capable of when really there doesn't seem to be much strength in that form.Its Super Saiyan 4 for God sakes at Super Saiyan level 1 he seemed to had more power.How the hell you could get trashed so much at level 4?Very disappointed in this stupid end to a brilliant anime saga.
However since no-one likes that, then this film is not suited to anyone.
When I heard there was a movie out I decided to check it out online since Singapore doesn't show it.
City Limits is so mind boggling since it can't make it's mind up if it's an apocalypse/biker/romance/comedy.
I guess the producers are making money on this one, since it did air on HBO.
Muddled movie by Roberta Findlay appears to have been shot about the same time as her film Lurkers since it has many of the same locations and much of the same casts.
Watchable in a bad movie sort of way, its the sort of thing that is best seen only when going through a multiple film set since its not worth the time or the effort to see a film like this as a stand alone.
This last sub plot is actually the most hilarious, since Sister Angela is hardly ever mentioned anymore after her initiation rites.
OK I am not one to hate on independent Horror especially since some surpass Main Stream big budget horrors, but I have to take the time to say that this Movie is dire.
Discerning viewers should be warned: not only is the film an attempt to justify heresies the church has known and rejected for valid reasons since the dawn of Christianity (as well as some new-fangled ones), but it fails even in its heretical intent - the whole film is a series of loose threads leading nowhere.
It was and still easier to concentrate on doing war movies against the Japan and Germany since we won those wars.
I won't bother with the story or character details, since they don't make much sense anyway.
The intention is not simply to entertain like so many awful films of the past ten years, which is a good thing, since "The End of St. Petersberg" is great without actually being entertaining.
I couldn't buy the character's peril in Dark Ride since I knew that the door keeping them locked in was mere plywood and if even one of the girls put a boot to it, it would have disintegrated and that would have been the end.
I have a suspicion that Lions Gate would have originally just released this as a DTV title, but since they were going to be involved releasing the After Dark titles, they forced Dark Ride into the bunch (notice how "A Lions Gate Film" was on the beginning of the credits, while basically the other After Dark titles didn't).
The three cars travel across the long winding roads & encounter a dirty blue truck which Carl gets involved in a road rage incident with which turns out to be a bad idea since the driver of the truck then decides to go after the friends & kill them one-by-one...
I've not seen acting this bad since ... Well, if I'm frank I've NEVER seen acting this bad.
Frankly, that was enough for me, and I have since used that episode as the lowest end of the scale by which I judge Sci-Fi.
Not since Crash has a movie so enraged me.
Most of the gags had been done before and better in other films and on TV by the time this was made so it was like watching reruns of reruns.3 Chairs for Lefty, which stars Bill Murray is rife with the sort of prison jokes that have been around since the 1930's,including giving Lefty a roast to cook when he finally goes to the chair.
There is no reason that this film needed to be almost two hours long since tighter cutting could have made this a classic.
Worth seeing if you run across it on cable and you're in the mood for a very uneven comedy.It would be also okay to get in the bargain bin at the 99 cent store (which is how I got my copy) since its not worth more than a dollar.
I really hope that people read The Mists of Avalon (the film couldn't hold the story since it was Hollywood- produced, rather than British) to counteract the bizarre way the stories of Merlin, Arthur, Guinevere, Morgan and the gang are drawn in over-simplified black and white in this 2-part film.
Jane Campion has not made a watchable movie since Sweetie.
Since we don't care about, or even understand, the characters we are cut off from their personal rapture at the landing; since the aliens' plans or general purpose is never articulated (or even suggested), there is no tension generated by wondering what they are going to do when they get here; and since the entire movie has been so deliberately slow and ponderous, this scene has to be even slower - you know, to show how important and climactic it is.
Arguably the most famous filmmaker since Hitchcock (in terms of public recognition), Spielberg is responsible for some of the greatest films ever made.
Then, audiences savored the F/X because they were the best since Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" (even the trailer advertisements claimed this was so, in order to entice viewers).
Apparently these were syndicated to TV stations to use as "fillers" since the network feeds weren't available (or the station didn't want to pay) during certain hours, including the after-school--i.e.
since i live right across the street from it i walk there.
since a few other people were watching it i left it on, i decided to watch it some other day and never did and they were selling tapes and somebody else bought it and i'm gonna buy it soon.
I'm pretty sure that all the actors and filmmakers themselves can do better as well, since they are pretty talented individually, just apparently bad collectively.
Really bad movie about a guy on campus who is about to be thrown out of school since he can't pay his tuition bill.
I discovered this movie on HBO in the early 90s, and have loved its awfulness ever since.
this is probably the worst excuse of a film i've ever seen since Freddy Got Fingered.
It's now nearly 20 years since it was made, but my two daughters can still recite the entire dialog, and we still "crack-up" when we think about it!!!
I kept comparing this movie with "The Outlaw Josey Wales" since both were replete with Comancheros, captives, and killings.
I haven't seen him in anything since his days of playing high school nerds.
Anyone wanting to know how Reagan went on to win two landslide elections need only watch this film to understand why, since it was this mindset he was running against.
Its been awhile since i saw it but the one repeated thing that comes to mind is the character's inability to accept that no matter how little milk he puts in his cereal there is always some left when he's done eating.
The best excuse that I can make for this complete waste of time is that it was obviously low budget, since there are only about 50 minutes of unique footage, with the other 42 minutes being flashbacks of previous scenes (exaggeration?
It has been a while since I have see Mantan Moreland yelling "Feets don't fail me now," but I certainly expected it to come out of the mouth of Dayana Jamine, who played the sister of one of the Black gang members like Moreland.
why they called this movie "Mary Shelley's" Frankenstein, i don't know, since it veers off so wildly from the original book, it will make any literature fan's head spin.
This just didn't seem very funny at all and even though it's been a number of years since I've seen it, it still reminds the standard against which I measure how bad a movie is.
Moore has since "graduated" to creating fictional movies disguised as documentaries in order to profit from the suffering of others (Columbine, 9/11).
Being born here, I have lived with "humourous" portrayals of Canadians on TV and in movies since I was born.
The effects are the worst thing I have seen since Big Trouble in little China Town.
The movie makes him act more than he usually does, and that's a failure since he can't act.
Daniels might be the next Bruce Lee for all I know, and PROBABLY knows his moves since he's been a pro, but in this movie he's worst than most C grade Hong Kong movies.
I'm sorry, but to be honest with you, I have simply lost interest in the short Hollywood movie format since having discovered the joy of long-term anime!
After an incident which is probably not hallucinatory -- but which the film leaves deliberately ambiguous, since Brigitte has just o.d.
Not since 1982's "The Verdict", with Paul Newman, has he given the world a solid success.
And that's not true by a long shot, since I'm here.
His obsession had taken him over, and since he was willing to risk it all to find out what happened to Saskia, then he had to lose it all.
It's been a couple of years now since I saw this astounding film for the first (only) time; actually, I don't think I'll ever quite recover from the experience.
At has been a long time since I cried....
I saw it in 1991 and I have not seen it since.
Cities stand almost intact after a thousand years since the collapse of human civilisation !
Schneider seems to be here mostly so she can stand and/or lounge in lingerie, but even that appetizing opportunity goes underexploited since, as a self-respecting Trotskyite gal, she doesn't wear any make-up.
There are several "characters" in this movie who in any normal film would have speaking parts, but since they never did settle the matter of what language they were shooting in, these people just stand there looking stupid and not saying anything.
Of course wife recognizes Radha the Realtor and has to say hello where she of course recognizes the shirt since it happened to be a birthday gift from her to her cheatin' husband.
i haven't seen a kiss that awkward since i was in the sixth grade and my boy friend barney (yeah, who am i to talk?)
I haven't really read any of the books since they were aimed at little children.
(since, chances are, NOTHING will be happening on screen.)
After i couldn't get a ticket for Clerks2 or Silent hill because of the age problem( i am still not 15, not long to go though) so instead i bought a ticket for this film since all the other movies looked quite stupid.
***This review includes spoilers***  This dark, brilliant film has been much-talked about since its release in 1988, and for good reason: only a few films have such immutable power, leaving you with mental images that stay with you for months or even years.
Regardless, I cannot in good conscience give a full review of this film, since it was so horrid that i turned it off 40 minutes in to watch Meerkat Manor...because it has better acting and a better story.
Fourth, the Asian woman who steals Ben's journal - every time the agency folk meet this woman, she (A) HAPPENS to have the journal in her purse (which would be the stupidest thing in the world to carry to a meeting with them) and (B) they STEAL it from her and run in a merry Keystone Cops-like chase that's completely absurd and unnecessary since...IT'S NOT HERS TO BEGIN WITH.
I rented this joke in a moment of insanity and regretted it ever since.
After, Singing Rock calls on the spirits of wind, trees, and just nature in general, his circle of dust surrounding Karen's bed seems destined for crossing since that thing growing in her back emerges from the skin as a Native American midget with a vile visage.
For years, I've read of this soft-porn parody of Flash Gordon since it was advertised as one of several midnight movies listed as being at the (now defunct) Cinema 8 at the (also folded) Bon Marche Mall.
Here's hoping the season takes a turn for the better since John Carpenter is coming up with his take.
I won't bother to describe the plot, since it it so thin that even a short description would mean writing a spoiler.
Not since Manos: The Hands of Fate, back in the Mystery Science Theater 3000 days, has Comedy Central fielded such garbage.
It however also means that the movie starts to become more and more predictable, since everything is done very formulaic.
It's the reason why the movie feels messy, since it makes it seem that the makers and actors had no idea what direction to head to with this movie.
Myers raises a few smiles as a lazy-eyed air crew trainer,but it is still baffling how this eclectic cast felt there was any mileage from a minor potboiler such as this,especially Oscar winner Paltrow (who has since described the film as 'terrible' in a subsequent UK newspaper interview).Gwynnie is a fine actress,and has ability in light comedy (as proved by her AA triumph in 'Shakespeare IN LOVE'),but she can do little with the feeble,uninspiring part she has taken on here (though she does look lovely in the numerous,if rather tacky outfits she wears),as is the case with other cast members such as Ruffalo and Applegate.There are also some rather pointless cameos from Rob Lowe and George Kennedy (recalling his Joe Patrone character from the AIRPORT series,which are actually rather funnier than this film),and the short running time (around 80 minutes) also indicates that much re-cutting and deletion took place beforehand (it sadly didn't improve the quality).
VIEW FROM THE TOP is not particularly offensive but a considerable disappointment considering the talent involved,and La Paltrow's career since her Oscar nearly a decade back has not really developed as it should've done,not surprising when she takes on roles as trivial as this.Maybe she's being punished for that notorious acceptance speech..........
But taking ideas from other films shouldn't come as a surprise for this series since the first two "Urban Legends" were ripoffs of "Scream" and "Scream 2" (what's next?
That wasn't entirely a bad thing since out of the dozens of "Scream" ripoffs, the UL films were the only good ones.
She could have left, indignant by their behaviour, since she really some megalomania issues in the latter seasons.
I'll have to second the other reviewers' acrimonious bashing of this film, and offer the following additions:  Fans of horror movies quickly become inured to bad movies, since bad movie makers all too often start out in this genre.
Especially since it's the first few comments.
And the Derick character is the most annoying thing since "The Jersey Shore"   STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE!!
9 years have passed since the original "Children of the Corn" appeared in theaters, but it looks as if this movie had been done the same year.
We see a scene with what looked like a herd of sheep but I think it is cattle since we later find out they were eaten by the locust.
I don't understand why the 1984 movie needed a sequel or sequelS I should say since there are seven of these movies.
I've seen this film about 20 times since I was a kid and it would play on cable and I still couldn't tell you what it's "about."
So, as she sits in jail she spends all her energy thinking about how to hurt this one particular man--which makes no sense since they never even met in the film.
This is especially true since being drunk is a legitimate reason to nullify the wedding--at which point they would have found out that the new wedding was a hoax.
How such a cretin like Clark could become a good and decent lady by the end of the film makes no sense--especially since she worked so long and so hard to destroy Bellamy!!
This is quite possibly the worst film I've seen since the last worst film I saw, seriously though Swamp Zombies has made it into my prestigious worst ever films list & boy have I seen some stinkers in my time, to gain a place on this list a film has to have certain qualities, a certain type of badness, it has to be a so mind-numbingly bad film as to make me want to me poke my eyes out & Swamp Zombies has those unique, hard to achieve qualities.
A sappy testament to the power of love, the director (John Laing) had a perfect story for the Lifetime channel, especially since it was based on a true story.
I wanted to watch this movie, since I saw the categorization "Genre: Thriller / Mystery / Sci-Fi", and a decent 5.8 rating and thought it might be good.
By the one-hour mark, I just didn't care about any of the characters and (since I knew what the underlying plot point was) I just sort of gave up.
I have been waiting for this since February.
The local police are a bit suspicious of Mottram since he's suspected of being involved in two different murders of women who were known to him and ended up savagely mutilated, and in one case burned to a crisps, and found floating in the Thames River.
I understand that since Pulp Fiction, anything gross is supposed to be cool.
And since one character dies in garbage, maybe that is the best description of it.
But since the characters are mostly lowlife criminals, why am I supposed to care about them?
Considering that this film was directed by the famed German director, Ernst Lubitsch, starred the great Emil Jannings AND it's title talks about Mummies, I was certain that I would love this film--especially since I love silent films.
It shouldve been better since we have improved with special effects over the years.
This is annoying since the audience knows that it is a ghost killing people.
He should have written a version of it get George Clooney and Julia back and get rid of Danny Trejo's character since he died in the first one and then he would of had a sequel worth seeing in the theater and not video or DVD.
I thought since it had Robert Patrick and Bruce Cambell, that it might have potential.
I'm a real dusk till dawn fan, since I first watched it on the big screen.
I do wanna know why all of those people were taken and why they were changed, but it wouldn't be a disaster if I never find out (which will be the case, since the show has been canceled...).
Billy Zane, Billy Zane, Billy Zane what can i say, you do have Kelly Brook but yet since this has happened Jason Stathams career has gone higher and higher and i don't think you can go any lower.
Worst war film I've watched since 'We were Soldiers'.
on a level not seen since "Cool As Ice".
Regarding Elizabeth Hurley, let me just first say that when I first heard that Tomb Raider was going to be made into a movie, Hurley was the ONLY actress I saw playing the role, since, a) she looks exactly LIKE Lara Croft AND b) she's ALREADY English!
Nothing like seeing a blatantly politicized and inaccurate film presented in "documentary" form... the worst since Farenheit 9/11.
If they were going for a dramatic and edgy feel, it failed miserably since all it leads to is a headache.
The ending is about as satisfying as sucking liquid feces through a straw, but I won't spoil it since I'll let viewers take it all in for themselves.
But then, he/she's likely to have long since tipped his hand by continually denigrating all that questions Marxist/socialist dogma.
It is not necessarily the director's fault that "We All Scream For Ice Cream" doesn't work, however, since the script and the whole idea are just so plain stupid that only a genius could have made something decent out of it.
I usually don't mind movies being silly, since I can enjoy them as long as they're entertaining.
Figuring this one was worth checking out since director Tom Holland ("Child's Play" & "Fright Night") is credible enough and William Forsythe is always cool - but unfortunately this thing is just downright derivative and dull.
It seems out of place in this story, since it's not used to advance the plot.
It had personal sentiment for me as my mother's day was "Adeline" and I had high regard for Irene Dunne ever since I saw her star in "I Remember Maman."
Chuck is back and still after Andy is now placed in a foster home after the tragic events of the first film since his mother was committed.
Chucky did not deserve to have a horror series because in my opinion he's one of the worst horror icons since the evil killer Leprechaun.
OK, I know this isn't much of a review as I haven't actually watched it all, but this isn't much of a film either and unless its got the biggest midway change since 'The Jazz Singer' then I can safely say don't watch this film.
Funny, none of these actors BROKE OUT since this made a splash in 1994.
And since when can a sheriff and detective reveal evidence about a case to their families?
Normally, I never watch sequels before I saw the originals but since I had already paid for it I continued watching.
This guy became immortal in my eyes since he played the leading character in my all time favorite movie Hellraiser.
Of course, the film does contain one dramatic highlight that caused considerable controversy at the time, but has since proved revealingÂthe intentional shelling of civilian refugees by American forces.
Now, that was really a pretty gutsy move on somebody's part since the war was still going on when the movie was released in 1952.
Apparently studio honcho Howard Hughes had high hopes for the production since his name appears above the title.
Dennis Hooper gives some life to this film with his so-of-him and characteristic acting (the one he has been giving us every since "Texas Chainsaw Massacre II") but it makes it seem rather funny than scary or thrilling at some points.
Since the plot and writing credits have been hashed out already, I wont go into them, except to say I haven't seen so many people frothing at the mouth over a movie since they announced Michael Keaton was playing BATMAN way back in 1989.
This has to be one of the most contrived plots for a movie since Star Trek 3, the Search for Spock.
I'm getting really tired of people simply thinking since this show (and others of its ilk) polarise people, that automatically makes its art.
It's been a really long time since I've wanted to stop a movie mid-way through and bring it to the store to demand my money back.
Not since Alex Cox's "Straight to Hell" have I had such a shoddy, amateurish work put before me by a director whose work I otherwise like.
This is a guy who just entered the eighties after being somewhat dead since the 1800s and he has a liberal left wing bent.
The empty "rebirth symbolism" of the construction of the tower is an appropriate reflection of the empty film itself; is the film's soullessness symptomatic of the soullessness of the country's "rebirth" since the destruction of 60 years ago?
I have since checked their posting history, and none of them have much background - each of them wrote one to three reviews total, each was active as a "reviewer" for a single day.
I suppose this isn't the worst film I've seen--since I did stay with it till the end, but it ranks pretty low.
OK, first off there may be a SPOILER here since i don't know what constitutes giving out too much information.
So these guys are GOING to a sports game (i forget which, though likely the Bulls or the White Sox since they're near the oh-so-scary ghetto), yet they can't even make it down the freeway without having an onboard viewing command center that would put ESPN to shame.
movies because since they do not have the budget for big explosions and special effects, they spend time making movies that make you think, movies with soul, movies worth watching and remembering.
The gardener then kills all the kids who are too ****ing dumb to use the golf clubs they have to bludgeon the killer from a distance OR to stick together so he couldn't possibly stand a chance since he, like this movie, sucks really bad.
We'll call her No Name, since I don't know or care what her name is.
Even if I didn't know the story The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor, "The Eligible Bachelor" would've had me confused, since it is just all over the place.
I suppose it could be one of those films you have to see more than once to appreciate--that's happened to me before and could happen to me again; and since I like Chaplin usually, I would be more than willing to give this another shot.
A Vin Diesel movie always show great action at least you say ,well....Not this time who ever filmed most of the fights must have been on some form of medication since the cuts are so fast it made for painful watching, At times i felt motion sickness set in.To bad that this movie that could have gotten a solid 8 instead of a 4 was not better put together.
Direct discussion of the point of the whole story could hardly be a spoiler, since the final success or failure f this point is left for readers to discover, if they are still interested.
In a world where you have to be a strong person to survive, this girl is something special, with her protector, Rebeka, Toorop leads them to New York discovering that the girl, Aurora, is pregnant with twins that are going to save the world, but they can't discover who to trust since everyone is pulling them in different directions on who will kill her or who wants her alive.
It doesn't take a genius to realise that Landau may not be too happy at being held at gunpoint and threatened especially since this guy has no worries about mincing dead bodies up as cat food which Caleb knows about!
At Least Riget actually exists in real life (the Hospital in Copenhagen is Nicknamed "Riget" which Means "Kingdom", Due to it's Extreme size) And to round it all off, maybe Stephen could have continued the series instead of remaking it, since two actors died after making the second one (hence why there isn't gonna be a third).
The humor of the original is lost in King's remake, which is too bad since it was the humor and not the ghost story that made the original so great to begin with.
I'm glad that Gene was lucky enough to come up with Star Trek since a lot of his other ideas are crap.
It's a drama to see that it isn't a comedy and you'll probably get romantic with the audience, since watching the screen will ruin one and a half hour of your life.
Second the animators are not the same, the director is not the same, actually quite a lot isn't the same as the first one, which is a bad thing, since this second fritz movie doesn't have a proper story line, or a good script, actually it doesn't have anything of the things that made the first movie so wonderful.
Janemba is more like, "hey I just came out of nowhere, but since I am a threat to the universe I might as well destroy all natural order, hey who are these guys, woops Im dead" Its such a dumb story!
I'm not even too sure "Snapshot" fully qualifies as horror, since the film barely features any genuine moments of fright.
Angela is very enthusiast and moves in with her photographer, especially since she's tired of her domineering mother and dead-end job at the hair dresser salon.
It's a mess of 70's clichÃ©s, which, since it came out in 1981 (although it might have been on the shelf for a while), you've got to believe were stale, even then.
Unfortunately, since this film is captained by Josh Becker, the director of the awful "If I Had A Hammer", the passable "Running Time", and the execrable "Lunatics - A Love Story", the execution is flawed.
What you get is a movie that comes off as disingenuous at best since all of the "facts" (gun-facts, single-mom facts, modern day high school student-facts) feel like they came from cursory research from magazines or books of the week.
I'm willing to guess the latter since there is ample evidence in this movie of their ignorance of the subject they have chosen to give the Haggis-treatment.
Few highlights include Robin Williams in his mime school scene, and the scene where the clowns beat up the mimes (which is mostly funny since most people hate mimes).
I haven't seen Shakespeare handled this badly since high school.
There is no discussion on Israeli human rights abuses, the numerous terrorist attacks carried out by Zionists in the decades prior to Israel's foundation, the attacks by Israeli extremists since then (such as the massacre of dozens of worshipers at Hebron's mosque by a Jewish settler), the routine killings of Palestinian civilians by Israeli snipers, etc.
Having sat through the two episodes at my brother's house, since I can't bring myself to pay for USA's Monk - the only watchable show on television today - I can breath easy, knowing that I am not missing anything worthwhile on the tube.
Sad, since I think the director, with more accurate material could have produced a great film...tragedies such as these were more his forte.
I've been reading about Brian Cleveland's "Fingerprints" ever since late 2005, but due to continuous release push-backs, I hadn't had the opportunity to actually check it out.
First of all, let me say that I'm a 25 year old guy (with bad taste) who's been a fan of Scooby Doo since I was born.
I've anxiously been awaiting this film since Mike Myers began working on scripts for it years back.
It combined comedy with intense straight up action and still works today despite having its conventions replicated in a thousand films since 1982.
Of course, my beliefs had changed since first viewing "Sister Act."
The insurgency that would have followed would have lasted decades, especially since we intended to make the Mexican people slaves.
Ruling counties like the British Empire did is one thing and could very well have worked (since the British didn't turn the people into slaves), but when you enslave the people, you fuel the embers that heat the fire insurgency.
It started out with a George Bernard Shaw quote which gave me really high expectations since Shaw is just brilliant.
With regard to the latter, I think it did succeed since that was probably one of the writers' goals.
It sounds like a recipe for disaster; and since a disaster resulted from it, I guess that's exactly what it was.
As a TV show, it must have had some viewers, since it was around for at least two seasons.
Then you learn that not only did your best friend go through the windshield and die, but he had advanced AIDS and since he bled all over you, now you do too.
There are some entertaining gags during three days of feast (thanks to excellent actors) but that can not save the movie since there is no storyline!
I can still feel this film in my blood, though it must be 20 years since I last saw it.
When he tells his teammates at the beginning of the second half `forget what I said earlier' it's no problem for the audience since we didn't hear this kid make any speech.
Of course since the Code just came in it is abundantly clear this will be platonic and annulled the nano- second after Romero's capture.
What they're living on since The Swan is no longer a pub, I never figured out, but with this delusional mess, it doesn't much matter.
They bothered me the entire movie, especially since they were used to manipulate the audience and advance the plot.
It is possible I may be confused by what the title is referring to, however, since this movie is placed in a mental ward and the characters are taking such things as Tegretol and Depakote, I leaned towards the bipolar disorder basis before I even rented the movie.
since this is an Australian film, don't expect any great shakes in the cinematography department.
It's a shame, really, since they had such a fine cast and crew to work with (with the exception of the overzealous boom operator who seems to have a predilection for seeing his/her handiwork on celluloid).
It's hard to say what is the biggest problem and failure of the movie, since there are so many little things present in this movie, which all combined makes this movie a failed attempt.
Perhaps I shouldn't have expected the same physical unattractiveness for Mr. Hyde as in other versions of the story, since Mary Reilly clearly found something to attract her, but I didn't see much difference between the good doctor and the evil beast.
Ever since, it has been attached to me like a parasite (along with Home and Away).
Well...It has past eleven years since this movie was made and I decided to comment it now.
Despite knowing full well at this point Burke is an undercover police officer, rather than simply kill him they decide to resurrect the most homosexual super villain since the 1960's "The Joker" to do the job for them.
Opportunity 3: Evil guard, who has been begging for a fight since the beginning of the movie enters the room with a shotgun and begins goading Burke into a fight.
Nineteen seasons later, with two seasons a piece per year since 2000.
Worse still in a fit of angst and guilt it was this led to Dorian's grandfather killing himself and his daughter " Who'd have thought that the smallest thing in creation would kill the most number of people " Hmmmm well since the film ignores any sense of time and setting I think it's only fair neutrinos are smaller than atoms whilst firearms have killed far more people than atomic bombs .
The most unlucky cast member though is Ms Judd who hasn't made any more movies since this one .
Thrown in is possibly the worst bit of dialog I've seen since the Star Wars Prequels where for some reason Daniel goes on a ridiculous rant rejecting Claudia Black's character's sexual advances towards him.
Tom was annoying and so was Ian, and Caryn, and Gregg, and Jenn, and everyone else who wasn't Steph, so but since Tom won everything, it was boring.
Basically it's been three years since the previous events, the family are happily living in San Francisco heading for a vacation to Canada.
The animals seem to meander around the city mindlessly, dodging two very thick men working for illegal testing labs and two incredibly irritating strays (one of whom dubiously has a voice uncannily similar to Mike Tyson), team up with a gang of other misanthrope strays now and again (even more insufferable with some of the awful garbagy lines spouted out), and in general, the film doesn't seem to know what to do with itself, because as we all know, since these animals successfully navigated an entire wilderness for miles and miles last time, a city would be pretty small potatoes!
It is understandable, since it resembles a TV show more then a serious film.
There's a stonewalling government official played by George Martin who bulges his eyes and sneers at every question and gives us an obvious central villain since the budget is too cheap to show us much of the monsters.
Fourth, none of the characters rises much above stereotype, since the story is driven by situation, not characters.
Not since "Mission to Mars" have I hated a movie so much.
That wouldn't create the required rotational force, since there would be no rotational force due to symmetry.
Wells wouldn't roll on his grave with this since it is wonderfully fashioned, but it definitely not a classic like the first one, "The Island of Lost Souls", has become, but definitely worth a look for some fine performances, exotic locations and fine creature make-up.
These are simply a small handful of technical gaffes which in my mind take the film even lower, since there isn't much of a plot to look at so YOU HAVE TO WATCH THE TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE!
These are simply a small handful of technical gaffes which in my mind take the film even lower, since there isn't much of a plot to look at so YOU HAVE TO WATCH THE TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE!
Comedy shows from television have since put a stamp on this kind of bungling silliness...but were over-the-top, frazzled-nerves-slapstick ever really fresh?
I have very little to say about this "movie" since I understand very little of what went on.
As a matter of fact it's more for 9 year olds since the best character in the film is Jack Frost played by Martin Short.
It stinks I can't give this less then 1-star but since I can't this will have to do even though it deserves a -10.
Or better yet, since I had to buy 3 tickets, I'd have rented it on DVD and been able to pause it to use the bathroom, because the treacles sweetness made my tummy queasy.
An accountant with connections managed to score directing a film, a dream he's had ever since he was so influenced by seeing Fate of the Dolphin III as a teenager.
If they were going for a dramatic and edgy feel, it failed miserably since all it leads to is a headache.
The ending is about as satisfying as sucking liquid feces through a straw, but I won't spoil it since I'll let viewers take it all in for themselves.
I probably haven't seen this much drug content involving teens since I saw the film "Kids".
You feel a bit different about Heather Grahm after seeing this movie, since 9/10 of her screen time she is having sex with Ryan Phillipe.
This is all I really wanted to say about the film, however, since I need more lines, I'll just say certain aspects of the movie are alternately funny, sad, strange and still relevant today.
I was a bit undecided whether I should give Cobra Force a 1 or a 10, but since this film is only unintentionally funny, I'm compelled to give it a 1.
Other than the few statements that Nannie made about Janie's mother, we really don't get a since of what Janie's childhood like and what Nannie really taught her about life--black women are the mules.
Having watched all of Berry's performances since 1989, I can truly say this is the worst performance of her career.
The film sank without a trace, but I understand it has since become an underground art-house classic and that my performance has been lauded by everyone who's seen it.
And it most certainly was MUCH BETTER than Meet the Spartans and Disaster Movie, and I thought it was going to be worse since it was a Direct-to-DVD.
This was one of the choices on IFC in Theaters cable service and since I'm a huge theater fan as well as a fan of most of the people involved I figured I would give the film a shot.
It's loaded with actual Evel interviews and tons of footage of jumps that I hadn't seen since they aired in the 70's.
This overwrought over-zealous over-polished Faux attempt at the famed British whodunit genre would have swept the house at Hollywood's Razi awards but since it's Bollywood, an industry that does not (well at least at the time of this review) have an award show that gives out accolades for the worst performances like Hollywood does the night before the Oscars.
But since it is a cheap, lower quality version of the original classic, why bother?
Though you never forget it's Hollywood -- Jim Cavaziel, the primary reason I went to see it, has the saddest face since Emmett Kelly, so when he suddenly smiles you think "Gosh, what a beautiful smile!"
I also thought it about time that since "Selena" Lopez is finally playing a character with Latina roots.
- Sorry to only answer your posting now, but I've only recently become aware of all this 'stuff' on "Kill and Kill Again," on which I was the cinematographer and helped get the martial artists for the movie, since i knew them all.... You are right.
that looks like it belongs in Wrong Turn (2003) or something & since DeCoteau like to fill his films with homo-erotic vibes (out of four main character's three of them are young fit blokes & only one lady) the leading man at the end takes all his clothes off expect his boxer shorts for reasons that are flimsy at best.
And since Mommy Bear is a law-abiding specimen, she wants justice.
We start thinking maybe this is going to be a parody on blond jokes since the sweetie is the only one for sticking to the plan.
And you will too if you see this, since the bear is probably the best actor, followed by the bear cub (and he was dead).
It's revealed that since the death of his family Noah has lived his life without touching another human being, and so spends his days playing with his tools.
Only problem is, their rooster buddy has now discovered a new talent for harmonising Elvis Presley-type rock tunes, and his new manager won't let him go because the old miser has been rolling it in cold hard cash ever since.
I haven't been happy with the man since The Land Before Time (Though I briefly smiled for Anastasia.
Published during the Second World War it has never gone out of print since and rightly so.
I've never seen colonial Boston come to life so well since, largely due to an absence of Revolutionary War films.
I watched this movie back to back with "Monster a Go-Go," and haven't been functioning on all brain cylinders since.
It means more to us now since the passing of Richard!!
Its poor quality sneaks up on you, since there's minimal dialogue before the first extended action sequence (though said dialogue does include the news that this Iraq company will be heading home inside of a week, which anyone who has ever seen a cop movie knows is a sure sign of impending death and destruction).
I know he's a tough guy (since he'll never shut up about how many times he's been shot), so I'm sure he can take the criticism he'll receive for his performance in this film.
Clearly Kurosawa (who co-wrote the script) is making some social commentary particular to scandal-mongering in post war Japan, but also returning to a familiar theme, that of urging individuals to step out, speak out, to identify injustice and corruption and oppose it, even if this results in social or personal discord, since often the consequence of not doing so is a silent but soul-destroying evil.
I wouldn't recommend anyone buying it since I think it's a waste of resources clogging up a DVD or VHS-cassette with it.
hi folks,  thats the worst piece of movie since ... well i cant remember, i havent seen such dirt for a long, long time.
Emily obviously would not protect Steven at that point since she not only didn't love him anymore but also had a reasonable belief that the thug was hired by her husband to kill her for her inheritance.
Strange the title actually makes no sense, since we're talking about rattlesnakes here.
If the first two hours of "Virus" were simply boring, the last 30 minutes is downright tedious, despite a whole 7 minutes of mild action, the first since the first half hour.
It has been years since my experience but it is still a vivid memory.
There`s other anachronistic details when the action ( Inaction more like - This is a boring movie ) tranfers to England which I won`t bore you with since you`ll be bored enough without my help .
Oh and Britain was the first country to abolish slavery in the early 19th century , just thought I`d point this out since A WARRIOR`S TALE really does seem to think all the evil in the world began and ended with The British empire even if in 1620 Britain as a country didn`t exist as such   A word about the acting - It`s totally variable .
Production design is strange, scenes are shot from very few angles, in some sequences there is only one single camera used, but since it contributes to entire film's not so dynamic & fast pace, it can be considered decent.
The writing, since the first two films, has taken a turn for the worse, something I didn't think possible before watching this tripe.
Madolyn Smith is not bad as his wife, and itÂ´s rather surprising that she hasnÂ´t done any acting since 1994.
Too bad since the acting was okay and the general theme wasn't bad.
Second question: since you have no inkling of how to build suspense, can't you admit that to yourself and give yourself an education; couldn't you at least hunker down with a dozen Hitchcock films and study how a master does it?
This brings me to question three: why not make it a silent picture since you have no ear for dialogue or how people actually speak and act in dramatic situations?
Not surprisingly, since this studio-bound Columbia Pictures release is based on Rafael Sabatini's swashbuckling novel "Captain Blood Returns," Hayward reprises his role as heroic Captain Peter Blood.
Mary O'Hara's trilogy, "My Friend Flicka," "Thunderhead," and "Green Grass of Wyoming" have been a treasured part of my life since I was a child.
The comedy attempts failed miserably and the Playboyish scenes with half naked latinas are just pathetic since they have nothing to do with the plot.
Well, the first one was full of clichÃ©s and the killer Santa wasn't that scary, but I give it the benefit of the doubt since they were trying to explore deep childhood fears that some of us may have had!
To begin with, if you see the 2 movies one after the other like i did, you'll save a lot of your valuable time playing it in fast forward, since this Part 2 has about 40 minutes with footage from the first one.
Which is quite baffling, since he was only young and wasn't in it much, but he can go into so much detail.
The scene has since become a viral video hit, garnering hundreds of thousands of views on sites like Youtube.
*** SPOILERS (I think) ***  So not since Vampire Assassin have I come across something so....Vampire Assassin-ish.
He was just such a lovable goof, which was semi-sad since he was a cop in the film, but I got past that part pretty much since he has been a goof from the first Beverly Hills Cop movie.
We can sense an inclination of talent involved with this production since the performances are fair and the set designs believable.
My favourite part is when a terrorist starts babbling in Czech, and Jennifer Beals offers to try and interpret since she learned a few words of Polish from her Grandmother as a child.
It doesn't even cut it as a rather flat documentary, since the director freely admits taking liberties with what Mitterrand really said and did.
I've been a fan of Crash since I was 7 and when I was 13 and saw this game I thought it was going to be a breath of fresh air ever since Naughty Dog no longer was in production of this game.
This game is really not for kids due to the adult references it make sometimes but most of the dialogue is stupid tedious retarded bathroom and cheesy pop culture references which you sometimes HAVE to sit watch since they won't let you click off it.
The CG itself is exceptional, but I can't say it's the best I've ever seen since Spirits Within had much more detail on the characters, although I must admit that Advent Children's characters moved much more naturally.
The effects are bad, but you won't notice since the big bugs only appear in a cameo role at best...they're there in the beginning once or twice, then disappear until the "action-packed" finale.
Certainly since the film was made, like with the remains of Space Lab, that type of thing has happened.
alienates him from everyone who loves him, especially his best friend Dennis, with whom he has shared his life since they were babies.
The film can also be especially appealing at this time since it deals with losing someone in the war.
(I recommend this film to any serious balletomane for that reason)  It's when he has to talk that the film runs into trouble, and since he's the entire film, it's major trouble.
And since the kids did not really bond with me, that is, I never had the feeling of "knowing them" I never really cared.
Has been such a LOOOOOOONG time since I have seen a good Bollywood movie (Bollywood- as opposed to maybe entertaining- but uninspired unBollywood 'Hollywood-inspired' movies) that Saathiya felt like the best Bollywood I have ever seen.
Signing Sigourney Weaver was a blessing but also a problem since she's taller than most leading men but fortunately, so is Michael Caine.
I knew I was in trouble when all the actors were wearing the cleanest, neatly pressed dirty clothes I ever seen in a western since 1934.
Too bad they haven't noticeably changed for the humanitarian good of Americans since.
The film has been released on DVD by BCI Eclipse but, since I canât say that Iâve been all that impressed by the starâs outings so far, I donât own any of them in this format: in fact, VENGEANCE OF THE ZOMBIES itself came via a full-frame English-dubbed edition sourced from a damaged VHS and accompanied by forced Finnish subtitles!
A Frenchman directing mostly Germans speaking awkward phonetic English--that's just one of the problems here, but it's a big one, since so many of the actors here stiltedly handle dialogue that would be problematic under ideal circumstances.
I hate everything about this decrepit series, and have hated everything about since I saw it in my childhood.
Add to that a population that has increased in size 4 fold since the 1950s, and the problems in food sufficiency and land erosion are obvious.
By the time the 3rd act rolls around and Armstrong starts throwing in title cards like "6 months later" and "1945: Peace" you've long since had enough and are only wanting to see one title card: The End.
Ali's direction is very good and is the best debutant director since Farhan Akhtar for Dil Chahta Hai.
To be honest though there's absolutely no reason for Pinhead and Co. to be in the movie since the villain is Lance Henriksen a father who is embittered about the death of his son   There's all the symbols , iconography , plotting and situations common in all teen slasher films .
His is the most assured debut since Farhan Akhtar's in Dil Chahta Hai.2002 will be remembered for two movies: Devdas and Saathiya.
In the eighteen years since its release, the cult status HELLRAISER as grown bigger and bigger.
The problem, you see, is the following: the first half of the series (yes, even the 4th installment which most people dislike) were monster-movies - a mysterious box, a couple of evil looking beings that came with it, and a lot of unlucky people who came in contact with them - while "Inferno" and the rest have been turned into mind game movies, where people see things which may, or may not, be related to the box...  What we have in "Hellworld" is a genuine mediocre teen slasher: 5 young people, who were once dedicated players of the Internet based game "Hellworld" but are taking it cooler since the suicide of their fellow player, get invited to a big party.
You would think this mask thing would play into the plot, especially since it's discussed in detail and used throughout the film, but it doesn't do anything except make the audience go, "Hey, that's kind of a neat idea for a party.".
I absolutely loved DEADER, and I feel that it's one of the strongest additions to the series since HELLBOUND.
Certainly, almost every installment since HELLBOUND has taken the franchise in a new direction (well... except maybe HELLSEEKER.)
This was the most POORLY CONCEALED looping I've seen since HELL ON EARTH's "S***!!!
It's fitting that Corben Bernsen portrays a lawyer in this movie, since that's what I knew him best as (from L.A. Law), but I think he does a fine job in this movie.
Director Tibor TakÃ¡cs might consider a late career change, as he hasn't accomplished anything special since the late 80's, when he made "The Gate" and "I, Madman".
--provided the movie with the most unintentionally campy scene since 'Showgirls.')
The court didn't believe her, in particular since they never got to see all the evidence, nor did they hear some key witnesses who could have defended Mata Hari.
She's a poster child for everyone who's come along since.
Now I wanted to see this because I was curious since I liked the original so much, it is such a classic that is very under rated.
NOT recommended, not even to the handful of teenage fans Joey Lawrence has left since starring in "Blossum".
This is the worst movie that I have seen since The Thin Red Line and Lost in Translation.
It's the skewed logic of a criminal mind that since they stole something then it is now theirs and they are justified in using any means to recover their property.
It's been thankfully a long time since I have seen a totally white cast in a film, but black people are conspicuous by there absence from the Baku.
Jack Armstrong, our protagonist, agrees to impregnate his ex-fiancÃ©e (Fatima, who has since come out as a lesbian) and her lover for money.
i guess we are supposed to assume that since they are lesbians they can't have STD's.
Christian Bale has been one of my favorite actors since American Psycho, with his battery of fine films including hits like Equilibrium, Batman Begins, and The Prestige.
The actors in this one, with the exception of JÃ¼rgen Prochnow (who isn't that great either, just merely adequate) and not counting the great Edward Fox since he's wasted in a pointless cameo, are all horrible.
well, since you're reading a review there's bound to be spoilers.
Kind of out of place, but since Paramount had the rights to it, they figured they had to use it.
I have been viewing the great detective on film as a progression, through the years, since the early part of the 20th century.
I'm sure it was fascinating for readers of the stories to watch our hero develop, and there have since been countless literary expositions on Holmes and anything accompanying him.
This hasn't really happened since 1970 when Don Shebib's landmark Canadian film "Going Down the Road" filled us with an extraordinary sense of pride in our Canadian culture.
For me this has been the worst and very annoying performance of Cate Blanchett since the Bandits, though she is one of my favorites.
This is especially bad since the film proudly boasts a host of martial arts stars and their accomplishments in the lead roles.
Then came the ending of the movie and OH MY GOD I was left in a state of confusion and relief (I've never been so happy to see credits roll since I sat through 'Pearl Harbour').
And since this group of childish amateurs is the elite crew selected from earths entire population in some future, we don't care a rats ass about that earth as well.
I wonder why Andrew Divoff keeps getting overlooked by the mainstream, since he's a hell of an actor.
However, in the context of the rest of the picture, it only makes the viewer realize that special effects don't mean as much as they once did, since any idiot with a computer can make a half realistic looking... anything.
Divoff has a chick by his side, Claire(MÃ²nica Van Campen, melts fervent heat right from the screen) always trying to seduce someone into robbing her master of his power since Lucifer's human shell is weakening(..I don't know, ask those who made this damn thing what the point is of Lucifer staying in a weak body when he should be able to invade many of those who worship him).
At the drop of a hat Harry Nilsson will burst in to song, which isn't a bad thing since the music is quite good.
This has been under constant examination since 1950, and Alan Turing's paper "Computing machinery and intelligence" (available on-line).
Of the five kids, only Rachael Leigh Cook has had a remotely notable role since (`She's All That,' almost three years later).
I have probably watched it once a year since then and I don't think its lost any impact.
If you are determined to stay with it until the end, and are searching for a way to maintain you sanity, you can focus on trying to figure out where the $1.5 Million budget went since none of it made it onto the screen.
Apparently he's the most famous Slovenian in the world which is surprising since I've never heard of him and I have heard of Milan Kucan .
Something that a director should not do since they are the ones who come to enjoy the movie.
Andrew Walker is very cute and sure there is a twist, but since you now know there is a twist you'll be looking for it and then it's not that surprising.
While the idea of someone using todays technology to stalk the object of their affection is scary, especially since we see how seemingly easy it is, I found the depiction of the story more miss than hit.
Normally I'll hang in there, especially when I'm watching a movie at home, since I can fast forward, but even that didn't seem like an option.
"Dice Rules" is one of the absolute lowest points in American motion pictures since they decided to let Burgess Meredith do a nude scene in "Such Good Friends".
Unfortunately, it became just another watered-down, bland sit-com full of the same tired sitcom plots and devices we've seen since the 1950s.
But face it, as far as originality goes, Dario Argento had been throwing girls through windows in slow motion since 1977 already.
Off Balance is more promising and potential than some other films of the giallo/slasher genre and since it's Italian, it could've been so much more than it now is.
I assume women will find this film ignorant and unrealistic and men will find this incredibly dull and unable to relate to any of the one dimensional male characters, so I'm not sure who will enjoy it (but what do I know about women since I'm just a man).
I actually kept watching the rest of the movie since I was expecting something bigger or more shocking.
I learned the hard way how sick mainline film critics are since they just loved the idea of a key character in the film turning out to be a transsexual.
Ultimately you couldn't careless what happened to Watts and company and I still don't know what happened since it became so excruciating that I called a halt to proceedings with less than 10 minutes to go.
Perhaps one of the weaknesses of the movie is the happy ending, I would have loved a darker ending, leaving something to think about, especially since there obviously is the problematic climax involved in the movie, there are some good side stories, especially the dramatic with John and Holly's marriage.
Times have certainly changed since then.
John McClane is a police officer who has taken his career very seriously, a little too seriously since his wife is about to divorce him and he's about to loose his children.
This is without a doubt the most exciting action movie since The Terminator.
Wrong, since Sylar uses his Telekenesis (didn't see that one coming either) to bounce the bullets back to Parkman.
All those valuable sword lessons by his father really payed off, since Hiro now understands that with a sword, the best fighting technique is to point the pointy end of the sword towards your opponent, and then run toward your enemy screaming until you impale him.
Scott looks like he is about 70 years old and has aged 16 years since Patton (1970).
As a point of fact, the ratings have been dropping through the floor since the premier episode, falling off an incredible 40%!
And as the story progresses, some cute basketball player moves into the trailer park that both Audrey and "Calista" were drooling over, but you know, since Calista was dying and everything, Audrey as her best friend backed off of the guy (not spoiling anything, it's made fairly obvious what's going on from the beginning).
It's a shame since I loved Beverly Hills Cop, Trading Places, and Coming to America.
But since the 80s, Murphy has offered only bad B movie comedies that will go down with such stinkers as Police Academy 4.
Horror wise there's not much to get excited about here, there's a few bloody corpses & what looks like a bamboo stick stuck through someone but not much else & there's not much in the way of scares since the less than impressive CGI computer effects have the opposite effect & make things almost laughable.
Normally I`d have a fit that an action blockbuster is well inside the IMDB top 250 but DIE HARD does deserve to be there since it`s the best movie of its type of its era .
The experiments that are restaged are the most boring ones, and they only include one from the first movie that was a real shocker, but since most of us have SEEN the first movie, it's not shocking.
This is the silliest movie I have seen since The Mummy.
Quite possibly the best modern action movie since the classic "Dirty Harry", "Die Hard" simply rocks.
But these were the 2 main issues which bugged me about the film since I saw it last night.
Meanwhile, a rival group wants to win the Spook Alley contest, so they decide to scare Carl and his friends out of using the mill, since everyone finds it scary in and of itself.
A roll of the dice later, Copping's brother inadvertently did a header off a water fall and has been in a catatonic state ever since.
Willis was a wild card - an unlikely choice for the role of our hero "John McClane" - since he didn't have any action credits on his resume' and let's face it: Bruce Willis just didn't have the bulging biceps required for a role like this.
Bruce Willis was the perfect actor for this performance, since he brings the wit and vulnerability to a role like this one.
Sure, she's a natural fit for playing a professional volleyball athlete, since she is one in real life.
But the problem comes when she expresses her objection to strippers playing volleyball, since that would bring the wrong kind of exposure to the sport.
Maybe Fellini had had a great satisfaction in this tribute since the theme was his childhood obsession; however I found it extremely painful to hear and watch after thirty minutes.
There are many examples of this seamy genre, particularly prevalent since the late 1980s, the film under discussion here being perhaps the most financially rewarding, earning more than 30 million dollars above its production cost of $750,000, but only a rabid fan of this cinematic category may consider it to be an artistic success, as well.
The only audience this will appeal to is the kiddies, since it's done on their level anyway.
Karate Cop is a title that makes little sense, since while Richard Marchini knows martial arts and is a futuristic law enforcer, being that there is obviously no law in this phony futuristic scenario, can one still be considered a police officer, if you no longer have a public to serve?
And since this movie is so much better than "Death Machines", if his acting and roles had continued and kept improving, I estimate he might have eventually been as as Don "The Dragon" Wilson.
Mikels certainly has improved his style since the 60's in that his newer films are much more briskly-paced, more entertaining, and action-packed (he has a funny cameo which cleverly incorporates his earlier cameos).
The film has been released on DVD by BCI Eclipse but, since I canât say that Iâve been all that impressed by the starâs outings so far, I donât own any of them in this format: in fact, VENGEANCE OF THE ZOMBIES itself came via a full-frame English-dubbed edition sourced from a damaged VHS and accompanied by forced Finnish subtitles!
I had bought this movie on video before I watched it because since I had liked his other movies I assumed I would also like this but I didn't like it and I learned a lesson that I should watch a movie first before I buy it!
Usually, I give movies what they deserve, but since Shore never made a good movie, I have to give him credit.
Since Watson has to carry much of the drama, this keeps us at arm's length from involvement, especially since Matt Day is such a dull Baskerville.
And the less said about the shoddily animated CGi hound the better - despite the impressively populated London street scenes, it's hard to believe that this is probably the biggest budgeted version since Rathbone and Bruce strode the Moor.
Tsukamoto's revisions allow-for much more by the survival of the brother (Yukio), and is more realist since the Sutekichi would have to learn all the medical-knowledge Yukio knows.
Not that this programme needs ruining since it did it, itself.
I also thought the point about the "quacks" was interesting because it's harder today to figure out if a doctor is a quack since we have such a high rate of suing for malpractice.
But actually, if the presentation wasn't so corny and outmoded, one would be hard pressed to consider whether anything's been learned since the film was made, as the toll in human lives to STD's worldwide is at epidemic proportions.
Which is a fitting description since that's exactly what it is.
In this case, blues and greens take over, but since the action takes place on a tropical island, it generally works OK.
Aliens who have been observing and studying us since the dawn of mankind.
I'm giving this 2 stars (rather than 1) since it is so bad that it bounced off the bottom of the scale and began heading towards the entertaining end of the spectrum again.
Linda Blair has undergone quite an amazing transformation since the first "Exorcist", but this inconsequential, goofy, utterly predictable comedy is easily forgotten a few hours after it's over, because it has no plot and no weight whatsoever.
The spoof movie was started in the hilarious AIRPLANE!, the trend continued with THE NAKED GUN and TOP SECRET, those were funny movies, it has since turned itself into a horrible, money controlled scheme to take peoples hard earned cash.
This movie may be funny to you, if you liked Date Movie, since both films are pretty much the same in cast and script quality.
It doesn't take a genius to recommend that you save your box-office ticket money, and if you're interested, wait for the DVD, since this isn't an essential big screen movie.
Anyhow, since I've told you that this is a copy of Scream, you should already know the plot.
And why did the people involved in this even think about a video with this plot, especially since he's supposed to appeal to a young audience?
I can still feel this film in my blood, though it must be 20 years since I last saw it.
I don't think 'Slacker' is a celebration of that type of character either, since most of the people in the movie, at least to me, come off as giant idiots.
Which does make a depressing kind of sense, since it's a racing movie; what makes no sense at all, especially given some promising set-ups, is the total absence of kinetics or pyrotechnics.
first off, those endless, obnoxious scenes of children playing, crying, laughing, running, hugging; I haven't seen an example of such shameless propaganda since the newsreels from Nazi Germany!
Yes, I rated this a 7 out of a 10....I only gave it a 7 because I haven't seen it since I was 7 years old......don't know if it's the 10 I used to think it was hee hee I loved Roller Boogie hee hee...I must have watched that movie a million times when I was a kid.
The script really tries hard to uphold the mystery and to keep the real killer's identity secret, but it doesn't matter all that much since we're just watching the film for the murders anyway.
"Cutting Class" definitely wasn't Pitt's breakthrough role since this "horror" movie is littered with dull moments of teen drama and ridiculous, unfunny humor.
What the audience is treated to up to this point are endless scenes of Skeet Ulrich's character meeting people he once knew and providing conflicting stories as to his whereabouts since leaving home.
These people have NO imagination at all, the plot is just plain stupid; just think about this: it's been 2 months since the nuclear bombing and nobody knows what's outside their own town - Jericho, almost every scene is indoors and the characters don't do anything but to talk and then talk some more.
Most of the gags had been done before and better in other films and on TV by the time this was made so it was like watching reruns of reruns.3 Chairs for Lefty, which stars Bill Murray is rife with the sort of prison jokes that have been around since the 1930's,including giving Lefty a roast to cook when he finally goes to the chair.
There is no reason that this film needed to be almost two hours long since tighter cutting could have made this a classic.
Worth seeing if you run across it on cable and you're in the mood for a very uneven comedy.It would be also okay to get in the bargain bin at the 99 cent store (which is how I got my copy) since its not worth more than a dollar.
The DVD has the original trailer and that's it, since I'm sure no one wanted to sit down and do a commentary on this wonderful little slice of 1979.
Furthermore the accounts of former Panamanian officials are a little dubious since the people removed from power might actually not be telling the whole truth either.
I enjoyed it immensely and hope others did to - wish they would write their comments - however - my only concern is - haven't seen it since mid 1950's - have never forgotten it.
You've gotta see it to believe just how far Borgnine fell since his Oscar-winning performance starring in MARTY!
MPB eventually realises this, and the two team up against THE REAL THREAT towards the end, a guy who has the most disturbing smile I've seen since Tony Blair shuffled his way out of 10 Downing St.  7.
It's a real shame that the supporting cast, production values, direction etc are all so high, since the film itself is so thoroughly worthless.
That's just as well since all the dialogue form this movie seems to be stolen from other, better movies and TV shows.
This film could also have been called, "Drink Booze" since almost every other scene involves people drinking.
(Note: I'm basing the above comments on a movie I probably haven't seen since 1968.
Way to go, Nickelodeon, for ruining a once great show that I've enjoyed since the very beginning.
I know you people are going to flame me, but I had to review this since I've been bombarded with the show's overratedness.
Ever since I was 12, I fell in love with SpongeBob, and could imitate his voice very well and liked the show for years.
You would think that since they are in England they would be able to find an all English cast.
And although Jean Reno is one of my favorites ever since Le Grand Bleu, his character was just plain weird here.
Langdom and Sophie Neveu become involved into complex resolution of strange crimes that lead since France until England.
At first I thought it might be a comedy, since the characters are written in such broad terms.
No luck there, since a drama would require some form of plot.
And as you also can obviously guess,he's done nothing since then...that we know of that adds to much of his resume.
I'm a big Marjorie White fan,but as a young actress, on the stage since childhood, and already a big hit in Sunny Side Up, why she agreed to take the part in this one, along with Charles Farrell and Janet Gaynor, I'll never know.
  After Seeing the other works of the directors (Coneheads & The Last Unicorn) I didn't really expect much in this movie, since its older and the directors might not have done better earlier in their career.
I have been a history buff on the sinking of the RMS TITANIC ever since September of 1966 with the opening episode of the ABC-TV IRWIN ALLEN SCI-FI SHOW "THE TIME TUNNEL" where time travelers Tony Newman and Doug Philllps (Jimmy Darren & Robert Colbert) went on the first of many journeys to this ship just hours before she struck the iceberg sinking carrying 1,502 men, women and children to their untimely death's in 28 degree water.
I hadn't seen THE PAPER CHASE since I was fourteen years old or so and mostly remembered it as being boring and a little dull.
I picked up the Versache Murder DVD at Big Lots for $3.50... since my wife is a fan of cheesy TV docudramas and true crime books, it seemed perfect, and it was indeed worth every penny.
I can understand why Russell Manzatt hasn't written a movie script since 2001.
The movie was real muddled some parts made since but others didn't.
Some parts of the story were really kinda silly and didn't make much since.
For example, the President refuses to take the antidote provided by the terrorist cause he does not believe in it, the nurse tells Dr. Landis to tell her daughter she was "the light of her life" before she dies, and randomly the screen shows what hour it is since the virus was shot into the President.
The screenplay is somewhat confusing since the settings of the flashbacks in the movie are not sufficiently different between the periods to provide the sharp contrast that aid the viewer in following the story.
They are also somewhat unnecessary since they are based on Wilberforce narrating his life while pursuing a late-life romance that never existed in reality.
Even at a mere 46 minutes, the film is mostly a drag Â since the comedy is generally forced, thus unfunny, and the quality of the animation extremely poor when compared to the dazzling imagination displayed by the form in its heyday.
In Brief, theologists have their work cut-out for them since they have to explain how any higher power could have allowed Bratz.
So, normally I would probably never watch a cheap, superficial movie based on a line of anatomical incorrect dolls, but, since the particular child that I was babysitting a few weeks ago loves the movie, I pretty much had to.
I normally don't comment on films I haven't seen all the way through, but since I currently work in a cinema and have had to endure snippets of this rubbish for the last couple of days I feel I have seen more than enough to comment on it.
They can't even be referred to as wooden, since the term "wooden actor" at least implies some ability, however dismal.
I haven't cried for any reason since I was 12, and this movie brought me to tears.
Nation High School (which is more than appropriate since I wanted to take a hatchet to the projection room during this preview) and immediately clash with uptight beauty queen, Meredith (Chelsea Staub) and her group of "Heathers" wannabes.
Truly one of the worst movie-going experiences since "Are We Done Yet?"
And since when is a guy being a hunk criteria for granting a movie a positive review?
Deanna Troi adds early mystery since she senses nothing from Kosinski's assistant as if he is like empty space.
The Traveler finds Wesley fascinating since he sees the signs of Traveler type abilities and knowledge in him.
These are perhaps dangerous thoughts since thoughts have power and our clumsy human minds are not ready to use such power.
Most of the acting was actually fine, but the story line and some of the editing choices kept this movie from ever achieving any real since of rhythm.
- When asked why she adapted this novel, Bertrand said when she first read the book, she couldn't stop, and had all these images in her head, which was unusual since the atmosphere in the book is not European.
Unfortunately, though, since these are new creatures the filmmakers spend most of the movie explaining to us who they are, their history, their likes and dislikes, how they live, how they die, etc.
Especially since whoever was in charge of editing trailers for each of the entries was making them look like "Must See" events.
I would rate it in the same class as Schindler's list, but a contrast in story, since here it is a small kid helping himself and others, at the same time standing his ground in the worst circumstances.
I don't really know why I should go on writing in detail about such trash (especially since most of you probably won't ever have the chance to see this for yourselves) but, then again, why not?
Im surprised he hasn't done anything before or since as he played a brilliant part, even if his accent is a little dodgy.
Although it's been a long time since i actually saw this movie, i have not forgotten the "plot."
And why, since the film is originally from 2001, would he or she want to send it out on DVD again in 2005!
The supposedly "sinister" couple are straight from an amateur dramatics company with the least threatening villain since the con man from "Bodger and Badger" (the gun up the bottom scene raises many unintentional laughs) making threats in a totally wooden delivery.
In the end this continued attention is utterly frustrating, since the ending manages to further let one down and, indeed, the rest of the film.
I thought that Adrian Paul could improve his chances at the movies since he did a superb job of acting in the Highlander Series, unfortunately I was wrong.
This movie is the worst thing I've seen since I watched Barney.
My girls don't really understand much of the Tales, but they watch them anyway, since they recognize the ponies.
Mathius Hues makes the most ham-fisted portrayal of dying since Jim Carrey's Mask.
The fact that much of this comes from elite american jewish organizations reeks a bit of hypocrisy, since historically American jews haven't suffered at all at least compared to native and afro americans (and to even suggest to the contrary would be a joke).
And naturally, since the plot demands it, the most virginal female character just *must* "fall in love" with him, even though she recognizes his purely evil nature.
You can't root for Cinderella to win the prince since that is certainly no bargain for her.
Face it-- "Cinderella" has been worn out since the day it was conceived.
And since, the world has never forgotten this disgustingly sentimental heap of molly-wash. Julie Andrews gives a non-memorable performance in the title role-- where is the interest with which she has played every other part before and since?
I saw this movie again on Sky One last night, I had not seen it since it first came out on video (did it even get a cinema release?).
The title for this should be "Zombies" since most of the characters look and act like that.
If you care to find out the ending read on (you wont be upset if you watch the movie afterward since its going to be hard enough to hate it more than you can).
At one point, towards the end, the black thug kid shows up for the ball room dancing competition still in his thug clothes, and he decided he must dance with the girl who's brother shot his brother, but they have since resolved their differences through dance, so Antonio takes off his jacket and gives it to him.
I was watching it a while ago and I just couldn't stop laughing out loud during the whole thing, since it's just unbelievable the amount of nonsense and common places just one single film can come up with.
well... i expected much of this film, since i think Antonio Banderas is a great actor, too bad the other actors, director and editors were horrible.
I was transfixed by this show since my first viewing.
In a way this reduces the tension, since we know he will be saved at a predetermined time.
So then my complaints really are minor and perhaps frivolous, since this remains among my favorite shows on TV.
night diet,( she suspects her husband is gay since he'd rather do almost anything instead of sex with her (not a bright bulb), she wants a child, she loves phallic paintings, she hates Bach, she's dangerous with a microwave.
It's really difficult to be constructive when criticizing this feature, since it doesn't really give a serious impression.
If they do make a Rocky VI, which i highly doubt since Sylvester Stallone is 60 now i think, i will watch it just to see how it is.
After returning home he meets up with his son who seems to have grown by more than five years of age since the last time they saw him.
However Rocky re opens the old boxing gym since Mickey willed it over to Rocky Jr. Now living in the old neighborhood Rocky Jr. begins school and is immediately beaten up by bullies.
After winning the title Gunn is hassled by reporters who argue that him winning the belt is meaningless since he never beat Rocky to obtain it and because Caine was a paper champion.
And since Paulie is supposedly the reason for them losing so much they STILL LET HIM LIVE WITH THEM!!!!
This would almost certainly have been network TV, since we didn't have cable.
How can you go back and enjoy the first seasons of the show knowing that most of the actions by key characters are lies and completely illogical since you now know they are cylons.
Albeit modern forensic science has advanced out of sight since the 1950's, initial proceedings were surely much the same then as they are now.
I was excited when I saw that VH1 was going to air this movie, and kept an open mind while watching, knowing that no biopic ever gets it all right, and since I know more about the subject than the average viewer, I didn't want to judge too harshly.
My score for Cemetery of Terror: 4/10: Below Average, with alittle more thought about what kind of movie they wanted, Satanic Killer, Zombie, or Scooby Doo(mainly do to the kiddie sequences) flick this could have at least been mildly entertaining however, since the movie bounced all over the place I cannot recommend this as a have to see film, maybe a rental at best.
How true these words ring, since I can't even count the number of times supervillains used mad science to make me doubt my faith in God when I was a kid.
I've been anticipating this film for a while, ever since it got such buzz at SXSW 2007 (and I missed the screening).
Hanks plays himself, doing his best Robin Williams impression of Tom Hanks playing a dramatic role, occasionally raising his voice just like he's been doing since Bosom Buddies.
I have been a huge fan of horror films and fiction since I was a young kid, and so did not expect to be remotely frightened by anything in the horror portion of the festival.
It is hard to tell that the movie fails, since it simply never aims very high, but even within its own low-budget gay comedy genre, it's one of the more lackluster efforts.
She's Emily Hands, and you haven't seen this raspy a performance since Elizabeth Berkley in Showgirls.
This is the worst gay comedy I've seen since All Over the Guy.
I think the only character that was remotely interesting was Tiffany (the dildo-wielding gal) since we could understand why she had to be over the top.
In fact you could be forgiven for calling this a soft core Ben Dover since the director Steve Perry went on to create the Ben Dover series and this plays exactly like a Ben Dover film.
Masturbating Woman vehemently protests, but only verbally since any physical struggle would have required more camera setups than Franco had time to shoot.
Again, Masturbating Woman protests, but only verbally since any physical struggle would have interfered with Franco's epic 2-day shooting schedule.
THE SEXUAL STORY OF O is, for my money, one of Franco's top 10 movies, and that's saying a lot since he made nearly 200 features.
At least the title was somewhat accurate since this bomb of a movie could only hold your attention for 13 seconds.
I couldn't even tell you what it is about since I only watch 5 minutes, and my husband, thinking it would get better, watched 10 minutes of it.
I should have, since it is a rip off they have that kind of "movies" to rent.
DO NOT WATCH this movie unless you want to waste 5 min of your life (I say 5 minutes since you wont get further than that).
I always hate it when I see people that say this about a movie, since with all the movies in the world, I find it hard to believe that so and so could be the worst movie ever made, but honestly, I promise you, believe me, for the love of God listen to me, this is the worst movie I have ever seen.
I do have to commend the "director/writer" for being able to dupe people into seeing it, since I found it in Blockbuster that means he was able to make some money off the movie.
Guess The Police don't want to turn off their fans since they have re-stoked their machine and are milking it once again.
Which is odd, since it's like watching a slasher film with no blood.
It may have been a better film had they simply stayed in the agency and made it all about Jamie Kennedy's character, since the least interesting character in the whole film is the title character.
Ever since I first saw the Drew Carey roast that kicked off the tradition of airing the Friar's Club Roasts on television, I knew that no matter who was being roasted, the comedians could make it funny.
I saw them again for the first time since then around two years ago and i have been hooked ever since.
I probably haven't seen such a bad movie since Kull the Conqueror.
I will not forget his name since every character said it about 20 times.
It was a good idea to make a film about teens being brain-washed but I guess the producers assumed that since Katie Holmes was in the movie there was no need to actually put some work into the script.
If you want a movie about the Indian American Experience try American Chai, American Desi, The Namesake, or Leela, but this is on the level of Fillum Star, Banana Brothers, and other similar movies long since forgotten.
So it takes itself rather seriously by flinging about inspirational speeches and critical symbols and messages that are hard to overlook and since the actual context is absurd, it needed a bit more humour to soften it.
Ever since seeing it when first released I have waited to find a worse film.
Indeed, since your intellectual mind will not be any the poorer if you put off watching Penzance, give this movie a miss until your child or neighbor's kid puts on "Penzance" at the local high school.
I mean don't get me wrong i have nothing against lesbians since i myself am bi, but you don't have to be touching your girlfriend every 5 secs.
The locals are outwardly hostile, since they hated her aunt and know the house is haunted.
And Roeg has hardly been worth watching since he went to the States.
There are flashbacks that don't really help since they just sort of pop up out of nowhere.
And since it's all so poorly directed, acted and written, it's not the least bit disturbing or horrific either.
Or I guess they could be werewolves since the full moon sets them off and they growl every once in awhile.
Oh, yeah since when does Sebastain have a heart?????
I wasn't clear until I read the IMDB that this movie was meant to be a prequel, especially since the title includes a number "2," I expected a sequel, but then determined that it must be a companion piece.
It just seems like something that would happen too fast (Sebastian becoming the male version of Katharyn) and I just don't know where they would go with the next episode, since it wouldn't be leading to the 1999 Film (Which the newer ending is directed right towards.)
The plot is a cheap rehash of the first, which is weird, since it's supposed to be a prequel, not a sequel.
It is hard to laugh at their misfortune, since anyone who lives in Israel is surrounded with millions of these people.
Philip Haas has not made a decent movie since his 1995 `Angels and Insects.'
Please don't waste your time with this turkey, especially since the PBS version is available on DVD.
Remember, it was only three years since "Star Wars" and "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" had revitalized screen science fiction, until then very much in the doldrums.
My uncle recommended this movie to me recently and since we often share tastes I thought I would try it--I like Bonnie Bedelia and Delta Burke so I thought it would be interesting.
There is a good deal of comic relief, such as the sub-plot about Hatton's hard-drinking friend Rusty, who finds himself getting involved as the only male member of an otherwise all-female temperance movement, and the singing duel between Confederates and Unionists which leads into the famous bar-room brawl scene, a scene which has been imitated in numerous Westerns ever since, and even in non-Westerns such as "Brannigan", a film set in London.
After twenty minutes, I really gave up watching it since I really could not believe it could improve.
3,50 is not much, especially when it's says: The most funniest comedy since "There's something about Mary" starring: Ben Stiller, Janeane Garofalo, Mike Meyers, Alanna Ubach and many others... Alanna Ubach is the hot number from "Meet the Fockers" and Janeane Garofalo (which i personally like as well) known for her work with Ben Stiller on "Reality Bites", "Mystery Men" and lot's of other projects.
There probably was no way to do the multi-leveled story lines justice except maybe in a ten-hour miniseries, but even so, what can account for Mandy Patemkin's daughter never growing older even though he has made three successful films since the start of the movie?
However, since there are many different story lines in the novel, making a film would be difficult.
Hard as it was to watch him be such a jerk to his girl, she was probably ideal for him, since she let him treat her poorly, run off when he needed to, he screwed up- she apologized.
You end up sympathizing with everyone in the movie but him, a problem since the movie is really about him alone.
I always knew Bob Saget was destined to make a god-awful parody movie, ever since his early days on Full House.
It was definitely eye-opening for me, since I had no clue how rough those penguins had it!
However, this spoof of the 2005 hit documentary on the lives of emperor penguins in their frigid habitat is still pretty lame, and it's probably a good thing it wasn't played in theatres, since that probably would have given it more undeserved attention.
But since a major thrust of the plot is Lola's attempted seduction of Joe, and she's just so awfully homely, the plot is weakened.
Written for the screen by Jo Swerling from the novel by Vicente Blasco Ibanez it was directed with a certain amount of flair, it has to be said, by Rouben Mamoulian who just the previous year had had his greatest success with Tyrone Power when he directed him in the classic "Mark Of Zorro"  BLOOD & SAND recounts the story of a young, ambitious and quite naive bullfighter Juan Gallardo (Power) who falls under the spell of a beauteous and attractive socialite (Rita Hayworth) wrecking his relationship with Carmen (Linda Darnell) the girl who has always loved him since childhood.
It's simple psychology since we are now being told a story decades down the road from what they claim happened.
The dialogue is some of the worst I've heard since the Nixon tapes aired.
(my comments are based on the unrated director's cut which runs 12 minutes longer than the R-rated theatrical cut)  call it Basic Instinct part 2, since it's by the same writer and basically the exact same movie for the most part just with different actors.
This was probably the worst card since King of the Ring 95 and that event was just inferior to this one.
OK back in 90whatever in the UK,the episodes of different series were not shown a year apart in order to catch up with the years and also since I didn't have a TV for most of 94/95 I ended up seeing episodes either on video or in whatever order they were on TV,so I saw them in totally the wrong order and never knew which ones were series 1,2,3 or 4 until 10 years later when I found an episode guide online.
Its the only one that ever scared me during and especially after,for...OK weeks.The eye effects have been used in things since but at the time they did freak me out.The child abuse stuff is damaging.The satanic ritual stuff,even though its been the reason it seems that oh so Christian Americans like to believe that true evil in their country exists for the last few centuries and is thus THE stereotypical scapegoat,and even though it's as unbelievable as any other religion,well it is scary anyway.After all it's TV so a level of disbelief must be maintained.I think a major reason it scared me was the concepts,if they were true just feel more fear inducing than an individual who kills with electricity (DPO) or inbreds(Home) or any of the many reincarnation ones.
I saw "Nukie" as a child; my father had rented it and has since been convicted by the Hague.
Having since looked into it, the episode becomes a lot more powerful, and a lot more interesting.
Or maybe it's the welter of teenage horror since then that makes these things seems light.
No, you can't, since the military could ask for billions of dollars more in budget if they could show evidence of aliens, so we have the most ludicrous idea since those idiots who thought Leonardo da Vinci met Jesus Christ and knew his lineage.)
But since NASA is the only space agency in the U.S., that's what it has to be.
I liked the way they introduced the Vanishing Cabinet, different from the book, but since I knew they would never include a 5 minute dialogue between Dumbledore and Draco anyway, I liked the idea.
Overall, this movie just continues the downward spiral these movies have been in since at least the second or third film, and is easily the worst yet.
But unnecessary since it didn't happen in the book.
I get the sense that they might have run out of time while making this episode and had to cut things out, since a lot of plot threads are abandoned.
Seeing this movie after many since it hit the screens, I can only say that I am glad I did not pay to go and see it in the cinema - caught it on a free DVD recently!
This overly long film was based on one of Jack Higgins first novels, He has written many books since & nearly all of them have been far better.
I thought I might give it a 2 since they obviously had no budget at all, but it's just to bad for a 2.
They all wanted to make a movie, none of them had any talent or even any clue how to begin filming and since they couldn't decide what to focus on, they simply processed every imaginable exploitation theme into the film.
(Unfairly so, since many films of the '30s were deservedly praised).
BHD piles on the gore, mostly for dramatic effect, but since the characters are such cliches, it becomes pure shock value...gore for gore's sake.
Instead - and since September 11 this has become a familiar theme - the attempt to capture Aideed's lieutenants was a battle between good and evil, civilisation and barbarism.
And we have the oldest clichÃ© in the book of Bond at odds with his superior, blah blah, done in every cop film since the dawn of time.
The cartoon credit sequence is the poorest graphics since Dr No, simply boring with no imagination or wow factor.
I was going to wait until a second viewing of CASINO ROYALE before writing a comment for it since my opinion on a film occasionally does change the second time around, but I am absolutely stunned at the positive rating of the picture so I feel I must get my two cents out while my grips are fresh in my mind.
Since there are so many of them, the following will read more as a complaint this than a coherent review, which is appropriate since coherency is definitely not something that CASINO ROYAL has, surprising given the ridiculous two and a half hour running time.
We know he's the villain since his left eye bleeds once in a while and he acts like everything is fine.
The latter appears to be true, since Neanderthals didn't live at the same time as dinosaurs.
I guess I just felt let down because the T-Rex as a villain has been done before in the 16 years since "Jurassic Park" was released.
I don't understand why they didn't have a gay rape scene in it since it is obvious that these young astronauts (or whatever they are suppose to be) have no interest in women.
A minor quibble is that some of the quiet lines were hard to hear and understand (though it could've been bad audio compression artifacts since I watched it on Netflix instant watch so it was not full DVD quality).
husband, who she doesn't want much to do with initially, and who can blame her, since this guy's an even worse actor than she is!
I have held a grudge against Sunn International Pictures ever since.
Robert Vaughn, who hasn't looked this good since "Teenage Caveman", plays the White House aide who thinks the government needs to keep Collins away from the UFO since the president's re-election is on the line.
I've never read the manga, but since Death Note was so hyped in Japan I thought I'd give it a chance.
After having read that the girlfriend doesn't exist in the manga I don't really see the need to have added her to the movie since her character is completely insipid.
The acting was mediocre, but I place blame on the director for that since the directing is just plain bad.
Apparently they have done well enough that some studio finally snagged this sci-fi time travel flick that has been sitting on the shelf since completion in 2003.
He has directed 4 films since RETROGRADE and the three I've seen have been infinitely more entertaining than this.
L for me, was an interesting character, however, I was very skeptic to how this movie could possibly work, since a super-weird character like him usually only work in smaller roles, and the mysteriousness was the underlying charm of L in those two movies.
I loved the final scene where L attempts to stand up straight since he found a new hope in life and wanted to live longer, and I can tell Matsuyama Kenichi tried really hard in this movie.
The only decent film he's done since THEY LIVE (1987) is VAMPIRES.
She had many chances to kill the vampire hunters since it shows her having lighting like reflexes.
At the same time, the crew of the Enterprise is worried since they lost contact with Kirk and the officials on the planet say they have no idea where he is but also obviously hinder the investigation.
Kirk beams down to the planet Gideon and finds himself on an exact duplicate of the Enterprise but doesn't realise this since the 'set up' is so convincing--even though he meets Odona, its lone occupant.
Only for Diamond fans since Amick really doesn't shine much!
(SPOILER/ It says hey look we took this amount of time to tell this story and since we have no resolution whatsoever with the characters or the story we are just going to kill the lead off.
I have been watching Jackie chan's film since I was small.
In his only stint as director of a feature, Steve Railsback, although a charismatic actor, obviously lacks those skills requisite for guiding other players, since he merely turns Russell and Glenn loose to fish for whatever they might find of worth within a sloppily written screenplay and as these two happen to benefit from a strong director, their mannered performances must rate at the bottom of their portfolios.
The rest of the plot really doesn't matter, since none of it makes any sense and "The Ring Two" is easily one of the most boring movies I have ever seen.
Unfortunately, since "The Ring Two" is rated PG-13, there should be no expectations that she will do any of the stuff she did in "Mulholland Dr.," even though she does tease all the guys in the audience by asking her son if he wants her to get in the tub with him.
Save your money... it would have been a better flick if more answers had been given about samora or however you spell her name.. OK i'm trying to fill up space since i Must write a minimum of 10 lines of text.. the only good thing about the movie was i liked the view of the harbor from her house.. and the faces of the dead people reminded me of the movie Scream for goodness sakes.. there really was no suspense.. everything was predictable.. as i said sequels are rarely good.. i'm sure i'm making a mess on this review.. i just had to say why i gave it a rating of 1.
Not since The Blair Witch Project 2 has there been such a predictably terrible horror movie.
Not since Nightmare on Elm Street 2 has there been a more disappointing sequel than this one.
The beast is a rather tragic figure, really, since it's some poor schmuck in a gorilla suit with some kind of rigid ugly mask.
This movie was also a lost opportunity for Hollywood to make some self-sarcasm of itself, since it is a powerful "system" and the Dukes could have taken some yeeehaaas against it.
It's a man who dies, and his spirit runs through the scenarios that could of prevented his death, but his ego, spared relevant memories to realize the consequences of escaping his own death, leads the ego to act in order of what actually happened, and this could be said to be in spite of the true nature of his spirit, leaving the spirit to accept that death is the order the ego would take over living, since living with the consequences of escaping death would not satisfy the ego.
The jellyfish is perfect and hasn't needed to evolve since the seas were first poured out, the hapless bears, however, have come to rely on the ice that us selfish humans are now using to chill our Budweiser.
National Geographic and Paramount start out filming the cutest little polar bear since Knut.
Second: (Usual since 10 years as well): It's only because of you male punks (Car-drivers, electricity-users and so on) that these cuddly (female) creatures won't be able to live (hunt???)
I have always thought of Daniels as a superior actor since I saw him as Shirley MacLaine's son-in-law in the memorable "Terms of Endearment."
I was quite surprised to see that the writer/director of The Lookout has quite an established career as a Hollywood writer, since this film offers nothing new (then again, maybe that's a key to longevity in Hollywood).
Not since John Wayne's THE GREEN BERETS (1968) have I seen a film so amazingly biased.
It replaced intelligence with obscurity since the writers only had the latter as a tool for plot development.
Less compelling are those moments involving Ariel and Emily of the NYPD, since their interest in each other strains credulity, not only because their backgrounds make it unlikely, but due to the lack of any chemistry between Eric Thal and Melanie Griffith.
I mean I can't believe that the Swedish language/accent hasn't change since 1150-2007Â The lines was empty and when the accents was so poor, this equaled in very low performance, and I sometimes felt that I was watching Swedish Big BrotherÂ I think this is because Swedish actors has not yet understood that acting is with whole body, eye moves, body-language, etc, not just standing there like a jukebox and saying your lines one after other.
In Arn, those kids didn't even have many scenes to play and most of their scenes where just the same, and lines so easy compared to Jakes, whom was the one character we've waited for since 1977!
And this turns out to be fatal, since he gets involved in a car crash with Claire (who is the classical blonde haired female character representing the "good") and dies just like everybody else.
I think a strong suggestion is being made here that it doesn't really matter which road you take, the "wrong" one or the "good" one, since either everything is predetermined OR the real "wrong" (the murder) has already taken place.
Which is hardly surprising, since my girlfriend and I literally dozed off watching the video last night-- and have no desire to try revivifying "Arn" again this evening.
But since the conclusion that there are only a dozen or two soldier extras around them, and an overview shot would have revealed the pathetic size of the battle scene, it just ruins the scene more: If you can't make a scene feel naturally epic, don't try to fake it with a clichÃ©!
But since this movie has - at least on paper - much more substance than that, it ends up being quite distracting and it indicates the level of confidence the director and producer had in their dramatic capability.
Godzilla just doesn't belong in America, especially since our government is stupid enough to constantly loose a gigantic lizard in NEW YORK CITY!
And to a lesser extent, MEMENTO, which is fun on the first watch, but bored me on the second, since no new clues are revealed.
Never seen anything like it, since.
I regret and feel sorry, since this movie could have been a masterpiece of the genre.
Of course, since this was a low-budget film made in the early seventies, all the lines are incredibly cheesy and bad.
All of this is unknown to Simon, since he has amnesia (or so his doctor thinks) and now believes he has lost two years of his life.
I have been watching the Star Wars movies religiously ever since I was a youngling and I know when someone does credit to the Star Wars Universe (Even if Episodes I and II didn't, lol) and this movie does not.
The rich started taking advantage of the poor since the 16th century, when is agreed that capitalism was born (I would like to know what brilliant economic system ruled before that).
Unfortunately I found the DVD was not the version I had gotten used to and despite having Eric Sykes and Jimmy Edwards repeating their TV roles, this DVD seems to be aimed at a cinema audience with an IQ of zero since the film Tittles are accompanied by a stupid laughter sound track which is both overbearing and unnecessary but seems to have been added in case people didn't know they were about to watch a comedy.
Waldemar is now infected with the 'curse of the beast', since when did being bitten by a Vampire turn you into a Werewolf?
If anything, all scenes should be shot in nighttime 99% of the time since darkness relatively symbolizes desperation and grim moments.
Ever since number one, I noticed the quality of movies, instead of going up, it was going down by a landslide.
And that means a lot, since starship troopers 1 wasn't exactly the best movie on earth.
Obviously the makers found that a problem too, since the emphasis is overdone.
And thats good for Rico, since he joined up in a hanging party, which have become in vogue.
I honestly don't think I've seen that done since the 70's!
These 3 bank robbers forsake an easy escape to chase after the most nefarious outlaw since Black Pete of Micky Mouse fame whose spurned girlfriend, who's part of the gang, vows to kill the poor young captive widow.
This movie is a credit to Farhan Akhtar who has since directed the spectacular movie "Lakshya".He is a true talent to contend with in Bollywood,and certain more experienced directors, can take a leaf off his book.
I have since watch other films to see if DCH was a fluke but for me there still was that Bollywood magic.
There are a few half hearted attempts at humor (which were far from funny) There were a few "touching moments" (which never worked in the slightest, since the characters were so one dimentional)  A perfect example is the love story between Carolyn and Pumpkin.
Given that I found the book to have such objectionable themes, I probably should have stayed away from the film, but since movies have a long history of "free adaptations" of novels, I though that perhaps the film version of "The Bostonians" might give some form and direction to James' sometimes overwritten, anti-feminist jeremiad.
And while Warbeck does his usual tough-guy shtick, the real amusement of "Panic" is the pair of tight-binding white jeans he wears during the last act...never has a bulge been so shamelessly exploited since David Bowie donned tights in "Labyrinth"...but aside from that dubious curiosity, there's really nothing here worth seeing.
It'll be worth it, since the bloke looks like rotting pepperoni-pizza.
How original is that you might say, well I'd say it is very original since the approach taken to handle these issues is very unique.
episode really stands out, particularly since Natalie is a cloyingly quirky character that no real person would stand working with).
Unfortunately since third season everything started to go bad - the cases are less and less interesting, the Monk's dead wife became the most important character, the plot really weak...
When I see Monk now I really feel sorry for the creators - they are literally killing their own brilliant idea for the show - everything about Monk became pretty predictable and since usually there are 1-2 people outside the regular cast in each episode it isn't much challenge for the viewers to point the murderer without Monk's help, and constant repeating of "I solved the case" started to remind me of Scooby-doo mysteries...
The few episodes I've caught since then don't seem to have made significant changes.
In fact until this movie and since I don't think he has.
I would not even bother to give a plot summary, since I do not recommend anyone see this anyway.
In the end, though, racism is a minor point, since everything else has been mishandled to such a spectacular degree.
Disney just isn't the same since Disney died of course.
I have been a Martian Manhunter fan since the early sixties, and have looked forward to seeing the character portrayed on screen.
I watch this short a lot since MST3K watched on their "Space Children" episode.
Rahul accompanies the commando squad since he knows how to diffuse the weapons .
So this film might if anything be somewhat important in terms of Brennan's filmography, since he basically proves here that he's even better than Gabby Hayes.
But it still retains the same passion and romanticism that has become a Bollywood staple ever since the beginning, thus making DCH a thousand times better than other "Hollywood-wannabees".
OK so since they had a really old joke about Pauline Hanson in the movie i guess i can just use that famous old pauline line...
(Even the Amityville Horror series had the decency to leave the damn house eventually) To make matters worse we have had approximately 100 white screeching ghost chicks with black hair Asian horror films since the first one.
Turiqistan is obviously Iraq, or Afghanistan, or any other number of countries the US has f**ked with since the 50s.
I am not a fan on Hindi movies at all, but since I decided to study in India, learn a little Hindi and whatever else, I have expanded my Hindi film repertoire from just Lagaan and Amar Prem to include Dil Chata Hai.
High marks for this film since it beat the Bollywood standard of being completely incoherent and inane, although still sticking to the three plus hours.
In fact have a song that parodies the 'running around trees' segment that every other Hindi film since the 1950s has had and that the guys at school used to kid about.
The romance came out flat (which didn't help since the character of Priyanka wasn't very likable, you begin to think: why would I want the hero to end up with her?).
I think he meant to say "Trunky," since it looks like an elephant.
The "pod people" or pod person, since there is only one, besides Trumpy, the lovable (not really) pod kid, goes around looking for its child (Trumpy) but you can only see its legs for most of the movie and when you do see it in its entirety, you see that it is very short and lame, almost looks like Alf.
While most of the adult cast gives a mediocre to decent performance, the only acting criteria for Culkin apparently is to look as cute as possible; which is ironic, since most of the time I felt like chokeslamming him off a skyscraper.
The second time this movie played here, it was the replacement for some sailing-contest, so I thought there was no hope on getting the name of the movie, since they don't show the name of the replacement-movies in the newspaper.
What a bogus effect, especially since you can still see the guy's flame thrower in the background and the little tiny flame on the tip!!!
I've read it since and could not erase the image of a truly terrible performance from Anna 'Beth Jordache' Friel as Maddy.
Actually at least one other actor has also been deprived since Mohamed Al Fayed the owner of Harrods also appears in a walk on part .
Anna Friel spends the movie with an entirely unconvincing Aussie accent while Joanna Lumley is abysmal since she recreates her role as Patsy Stone from ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS   The supporting cast I will reserve judgement on because I've a feeling that the director Sara Sugarman is more to blame than the actors themselves .
But since the parasites got to the Mayor who else is being controlled?
Utterly routine 'erotic thriller', the kind of low-grade rubbish thats been gathering dust in video stores ever since the release of BASIC INSTINCT (1992).
Like THE GREEN BERETS there`s no racism involved since the point is made - And it`s as subtle as hitting someone over the head with a sledgehammer - that we shouldn`t judge people on the colour of their skin only on the colour of their politics .
Not a bad movie, but since it is made by Americans, there is a lot of USA born Chinese trying to speak Chinese without much success, and it turns out to be goobledegook.
The acting is pretty good, but the relentless patriotic claptrap makes for a boring diatribe, especially since there's never really much clarity about what the Crusaders are doing and how or why they have political power.
I happened upon this short movie while flipping around channels and since it was so short, I decided to see just what it had to offer.
This may well be true, but since the stated intention of the film was to speak to non-believers in a meaningful way, I'd say this film fails miserably.
It has been one whole year since the capers in Home Alone!
Just not since he started looking like a late-career Ben Kingsley and started acting like an @$$hole I guess.
I'm not saying a lady's man can't be struck dumb now and again, but we've got to have some since of why that would be the case.
First of all, that accent is sexy, don't get me wrong, but are we really supposed to believe that a well-educated 24 year-old who's been in the U.S. since she was 11 still talks like that?
They even had to dub his voice, since he wasn't able to speak up good enough anymore.
I am a long time Star Wars fan but I am not willing to say that anything George Lucas cranks out is the best thing since sliced bread.
Lucas has said numerous times that he detests directing (this was the first film he's directed in over 20 years since the original Star Wars film), and his contempt for directing shows.
I'd call Jake Lloyd a terrible actor if it weren't for what the great sci-fi writer Orson Scott Card, who personally knows Lloyd, observed: "Jake Lloyd's a good actor, and it's a pity you didn't get to see that on-screen, since he had no direction or screenplay.
I happens more often then they want to admit, and they never want to admit it's rude, especially since they know English.
and a performance by Alexander Godunov that doesn't seem connected to the same movie adds up to a mishmash the likes I've not seen since my Community College film class days.
I loved that movie very much since I was a little kid.
Best (or worst) of all this movie boasts the worst disguise since Jane March in 'Color of Night' - if you don't spot it within the first 10 seconds and then work out the whole plot, then shame on you, you're no movie buff.
to Prince Nuada as if it's some sort of witty insult, rather than something that nobody has said since fifth grade.
Angelo Rossito had been around since the silents, playing menacing dwarfs but only gets to run around in circles within the house in this one.
He is then caught by the bumbling cop and the inept reporter wearing a dress (yes, absolutely no reason is given WHY he was wearing a dress, since he had not been seen any time previously in the movie AND it was pretty obvious he was a man in a dress.)
And apparently she is correct in her assumption since the film is narrated by her fresh corpse on a morgue slab.
I have not seen it since because I hated it then.
And apparently that's the answer to every single question in the film, as none of the characters gets any development, not that we care about what happens to them since they are all worth hating, but at least we expect something to occur.
I think that our subtitles weren't right, which is odd, since we rent it from a normal video shop.
Oh, I almost forgot, I will give Martel this: speaking from the somewhat limited experience as the son of a pathologist and a nurse, Martel DOES manage to capture how deliriously boring and maimingly monotonous a medical convention can be (otorhinolaryngologists no less, their motto would rightly be "fun with phlegm"), particularly when held in a craphole motel (think Leaving Las Vegas' witty "The Whole Year Inn"-cum-"The Hole You're In") and further exacerbated by a tediously planned dramatization of how to conduct a patient interview (a device Martel must have found brilliant since she devotes exponentially more time to this than anything else).
I've had a long standing grudge with Stiller ever since I was snubbed for the lead role in Heavyweights.
Its been a while since I saw a movie that infuriated me like this one.
I'm a big fan of "so-bad-they're good" movies, since they are at least enjoyable on the level of invoking laughter from the unintentional humor; however, this one does not even achieve enjoyable camp status.
Oh, and there's some irritating, synthesized noises in the soundtrack to tell you that something happens (since it doesn't happen on the screen, like it would in other movies).
In the fifteen years since I saw it I have retained not only the broad plot, but some incidentals as well.
I had never seen a movie, and don't remember many since, that have strong male and female leads where it is the female that gets the glory moment at the end of taking down the protagonist.
And since seeing it, I've seen more and more things in everyday life that bring the show to mind, convincing me that it really has captured the zeitgeist, from the nightmare of finding a decent job in suburban America, to the stupidity and pretentiousness of local news programming and advertising in general.
He played Brad the tennis pro who raped his sister-in-law, the ex-prostitute, played by Judith Light...which is weird, since she's so involved in the Gay Rights Movement.
The name of Jackie Chan in the credits is only to attract his fans and sell the movie, since he has a very short participation of a few minutes.
Bad enough that Natalie has just got married but the relationship goes beyond adultery since Richard is Natalie's brother .
The main aspect of these types of films that ultimately make or breaks them is the partnership, here it's a quick talking wise cracking Philadelphia cop with a blatant disregard for police procedure who gets teamed up with a quiet respectful native American Indian & it just doesn't come off since there's virtually no humour or memorable interplay between the two.
Actually, I have seen it a few times since the theater and it does get quite better.
10 years have passed since Phantom Menace.
Excuse me, but since when has Star Wars been a soap opera instead of an adventure?
There used to be a time when Star Wars was the best thing since sliced bread.
I've been seriously thinking; since there isn't a whole great deal of brilliant comedies being released these days, why not set out for foreign lands, why not plough the uncharted territory, where weed like "Gaslight" is growing a plenty, rip it up with its roots, and scour it for any signs of laughter-gas.
But of course, this would have been a project for the absolute madman, since laugher soon enough would have given way to overwhelming nausea, and the urgent need to see what food in acid looks like.
Of course, she can't get a word in edgewise when she contacts her daughter (Reva Rose, who had just come off of playing Lucy in Off-Broadway's "Your a Good Man Charlie Brown") since the phone man disconnects her.
The acting is so bad that even the killer robot is unconvincing - something I found suprising since the other actors were so robotically wooden.
The grandmother was supposed to be a ghost, and since the mother was the only one who could see her that seemed semi-obvious, except that she was opening doors, closets and chests and constantly grabbing the mother.
The complications that separate the two seems a bit overly long making one impatient since we all know everything will end up all right.
McCarthy has been on a leave of absence ever since that night.
Extremely disappointing film with the most horrible 'happy ending' I've seen since the Kindred (1987) in which even the family's pet cat comes back to life and survives!
'Tagline: Not since Dogme95 has passion felt this real.'
Can you name another memorable role Richard Gere has played since?
Well you'd expect that, since they are relatively the same subject matter.
Australian films have come a long way since Gallipoli, Strictly Ballroom and even the recent Shine.
Out of Allen's entire filmography, including the movies he has made since this terrible episode, he has never made a pretentious film, but strangely the aim he claims with an indifferent attitude are behind his creative process are admittedly self-indulgent.
And, since Karloff is a bit touched, he feels strange impulses towards Klatt.
But on the night before the marriage she vanished, and he - broken hearted (apparently) - has returned every night ever since as though waiting for her.
I had been excited about this one since it was first announced... especially with this amazing list of guest stars.
The fact is that since the 1950's the UMWA (the Union in the film) has been steadily losing ground in a very quiet war against non-union coal producers.
Known under the title Blood Wars on DVD in the US this was co-produced & directed by Tom Shell & I had a quick look through the IMDb user comments section & a couple of external reviews & I can't really find anyone who says anything good about The Thirst: Blood War which isn't too surprising since it's awful on every conceivable level.
There's these Monks as well who total three & are able to shoot blue 'stuff' out of their fingers for no apparent reason, we are never really sure if there are more or not or where they came from or the story behind them & we are never really sure if Julien is head Vampire in the world or just his clan & there are other clans out there & apart from sit in a room he doesn't seem to do anything else & he has no plans or ideas & we don't really know if a Vampire bite turns you into a Vampire or kills you since at the start a bite will turn you into a Vampire but at the end it kills you so it's hard to care about anything as it doesn't make much sense, there's no threat or grand plan or anything to keep you watching really & I do not count three Monks & about half a dozen Vampires as a war, maybe I'm being too tough here but I just don't.
I like Ms. Sheedy no matter what film she's in, ever since I first saw her in War Games.
I have seen it 3 times since, a few different edits and I like it more and more each time.
I really enjoyed Why We Had to Kill Bitch, perhaps I am a bit biased since I saw it with someone who was in the movie.
Saw it tonight; my take:  Casting: About the best I have seen of Ferrell since Minority Report.
Everything in this program has since been debunked by far more knowledgeable sources.
I'm surprised they got away with this since the Hays Code was still very much in effect in 1952.
Dialogue, bad effects, movie genres, and by far the most god-awful acting since "Laserblast".
However, now that his comments have made it to the back of the queue, and since I just saw this movie AGAIN on TV (on the Action Channel) a few days ago, I thought I'd chime in.
SO dumb that it's no wonder you've heard nothing about any of the people involved in it since.
Although Â"killing spree" might be a bit exaggerated since he chases a girl in a car most of the time.
I first saw 'bitch' at a film festival in Oklahoma last year, and I must admit, I've enjoyed this movie over and over since that day.
I am lucky enough to have this privilege since I own it on DVD!
I have since moved to Georgia and I made sure to bring 'bitch' along with me!
There's even the rather inexplicable addition of a police lab robot which acts as a comic-relief (although we don't really need it since the film has enough comedy), even reading comics & being interested in a colleague's fries.
You know where you stand right from the beginning, where you can spot the most ludicrously mismatched day-and-night shots since "Plan 9 From Outer Space".
But, since such topics could not generally get past the censor boards of each state, they were marketed as "educational" and shown to adults-only audiences.
While this is pretty cheesy since the Chinese guy obviously ISN'T, the way they demonstrate opium and the paraphernalia is surprisingly accurate compared to the information you usually get in such films.
Apart from one scene in a toilet where our fairly derivative "monster" does the business (and briefly woke me up), this film is the most pretentious, woodenly acted drivel I have witnessed since - well, not that long ago...
I love movies, especially since TV is so dumbed down it's rarely worth turning it on other than for the news or a documentary of any kind which I believe we are exceptionally great at.
I didn't bother going to see it, since I hadn't seen the original, but planned to eventually watch them both when I got around to it.
If the film was around, I don't know, half an hour/45 minutes shorter than it is, I would probably rate it 5/10, but since the flaws in the film continue for so long, never stopping until it's over, I think even an average rating would be a tad too generous!
I did laugh at a lot of the death scenes though since they were done so poorly.
Oh and the ending is hysterical since there's no reason or justification for it whatsoever.
second of all, i thought this was a slasher, since when do slashers not have any blood/gore?
The original video games have their visuals and story so a director trying to make a movie based off of one might feel cheated since he/she won't really have to imagine much, just recreate and transpose onto the screen.
I must say that since the first time i saw it I have bought it on tape and when I got a dvd player i bought it for that too.
2) Especially since the government is willing to covertly murder civilians to protect the project.
Let's review the original 70's movie (since i haven't read the book, which i'm gonna read after this): An infectious but nouvelle agent menacing mankind, a special team with the ultimate technology gathered to solve the problem, the US government eager to finish it the fast (and not always)the smart way.
I hear tell that Shannon Doherty was pretty good in the earlier episodes (I'll bet she was, since she's a witch in real life too).
This is way cool, since she's one of the shows producers, too.
The last season left a taste of I want plus, since the end was half vague.
Of course, I was also younger when I started watching, and my tastes have developed a good deal since then.
let me sum up the first 7 years, since i haven't seen the 8th one yet (but ill watch it just so i know how the story finished)  I hate being a witch I love being a witch I hate being a witch I love being a witch I hate being a witch I love being a witch "maybe this is an innocent we just cant save" i love you *insert overly attractive male stars name here*, but i cant be with you because I'm a witch.
Brooke Shields is a spoiled little rich girl who decides she wants to enter a desert automobile race and since whatever Brookie wants, Brookie gets....  Streaking across the sand dunes in her favourite sand-colored scarf and cute little goggles with the wind blowing sand in her beautiful brown hair, Brooke gets kidnapped by a handsome sheik with a GQ beard who whisks her away to his pad and ties her up while Brooke pretends she doesn't like it.
Okay, if this contains any spoilers at all they won't be too extensive since I have to admit that I could only stomach just over 30 minutes of this dross.
**spoilers**  There obviously must be something wrong with me since everyone is saying this is the best comic book movie ever but I just didn't like it.
Additionally, since this is its pedigree, captioning and a high quality print are also absent.
So overall, it's probably one to skip since even with the missing chunk in place (which it isn't), it's still not a great movie by any stretch.
I also found the special affects really good for this movie since it was made so long ago.
Now, bearing in mind that Doug had shot down dozens of evil, nasty non-American pilots in the first film, and that was without any training, he would now be an even better pilot, since he'd joined the US air force.
Before you know it, it's the best thing since the hot dog and everyone is eaten the stuff in gallons.
There's plenty to make this an unconvincing story, but I'm sure that viewers will mostly be interested in its nostalgic factor, particularly since it's young stars include pre-fame Stephen Dorff and 80s mischief comedy regular, Ami Dolenz.
(Not surprised to learn he has done porn in the past; that's not my being dumb, just haven't been that interested in him since "Rambo".)
The sex-scene in the shower exposed his backside, no bubble-butt, guys....  Let's face it, Stone hasn't done anything good since "Basic Instinct."
Eric Roberts is his usual menacing "or-I-'ll-kill-ya" self, and his character hasn't aged a day since he killed Stone's parents some decades ago (a scene which is shown as a flashback a couple of times), or are they implying that the nearly middle-aged Stone is eighteen in this movie?
I also hate The Specialist as well, luckily after both this & Anaconda tanked at the box-office & were critically torn to pieces Llosa hasn't been allowed to make an American film since, there is a god after all...
Director Llosa is an awful director & it's no surprise no respectable studio has let him go anywhere near a film camera since this & Anaconda, there are so many scenes in The Specialist which are played straight & meant to generate tension & excitement but are so poorly & ineptly handled they come across as laughable.
I never had an interest to see Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III, because it looked so horrible, but my friend said it was pretty cute and to give it a shot, so I did since it was a free rental and at least I finished the sequels.
Basically, this is going to be such a short paragraph since the plot is really very simple, but here it goes, the turtles now have a time stick thing-a-ma-jig, so when April accidentally steps into it, she goes back to the 17th century in China switching places with the king's son, the turtles must go back and help April.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III however didn't belong to be in the theaters or be watched since it lost all the darkness of the original and concentrated on cuteness and having children involved.
And since the most serious fans would all be at least twenty years old by now, well, let us just say this film has its work cut out for it pleasing even that audience.
Even though it was a bit corny, he quickly ran through all of the lines the Tall Man said in the "Phantasm" films, and since most of his dialogue in these movies is so memorable it was great to hear him say them in character.
Of course, it is slightly better since you can still use items, unlike part VIII(But at least 8 was still good)  Don't get me started on the characters.
Every big con movie since the "Sting" is a convoluted set of plots in which there are a bunch of good guys among the bad guys, and visa versa.
It's not so much about his acting skills, since there are none, but his chesthair does a lot of talking.
Also, there's no KITT hanging out in this series, which is good, since Mr Hasselhoff told in an interview, that he always thought KITT was gay.
If they don't eat their victims, what are they eating since the grocery stores are intact.
What I received was a reminder that Oscars are given primarily for bold moves in the film industry (now no longer bold) and acting has come a long way since the 50s.
It is one of the earliest horror films I remember seeing and really jump-started my lifelong love and fascination for things that have since poisoned my once innocent little mind and turned me into the crazed fanatic I am today.
But, since his research in medicine is so important, Mr. Karloff is permitted to continue experimenting, in a laboratory behind bars.
He's never matched it since and all the sequels really suck...but this stands alone as a classic.
In a day and age where you get prosaic, banal and myopic efforts like ( take your pick of most of the horror that has "graced" our screens since the Scream and Blair Witch craze) and you compare them to films like Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Phantasm, you quickly realize that the 70's and early 80's was the genesis of the horror film.
In the Car, are we expected to believe that this machine has been running unmanned since time?, was it the work of a sinister force?, or was it driven by a midget, peeping unnoticed over the steering wheel?.
NB.Another version was made at about the same time "the great Riviera bank robbery" starring Ian McShane.The two versions were drastically different since that one showed the hero's paramilitary activities.
This was so obviously a lame excuse since the cost of attracting so much attention to himself far outweighed the benefits.
It should have been reclassified as a work of fiction or standard movie fare since it is no legitimate documentary.
This is a sad fact since it was nominated for an award at the time it was released but failed to receive that award when the truth came out.
Like I previously stated, the idea behind the film is good and since this is one of Spadaccini's first efforts, I give him credit.
The result however isn't much good, since it makes the movie unnecessarily difficult to follow, especially toward the end, when twists and false twists follow each other rapidly.
I bought this DVD without any previous reference and only based on its creepy cover, since I love zombie movies.
This seems to work, since there soon arrives a man who handles in liquor and girls, an undertaker and a shopkeeper.
He's about the worst villain on screen since Liberty Valance, without any redeeming characteristics.
I think it is also good for the kids to watch since it contains very little violence.
This film was made at the height of popularity of Eastwood's spaghetti westerns, so my guess is that it was a major flop, since most people can't identify with the sort of arrogant quasi-hippy gobbledygook that movies like this espouse.
This film's worth catching for fans of the Stooges, since it's their feature film debut and historically interesting.
Unfortunately, there's a bit of a culture clash between the lovers, since muses aren't supposed to fall in love, but it all works out in the end.
Because Thomas the Tank engine has been a part of my youth since I was a baby!
And since I like trains naturally, this was perfect.
And oh yes, the programme makers seem to think that the parents of Hindley and Brady's victims are also boors, since the only time we ever hear a peep out of them is when they talk about wanting to kill Hindley and Brady for revenge.
You could say that the programme shows him wrestling with his conscience, as to whether he should or shouldn't help Myra...and you would be wrong, since Longford walks away from and shuts down every opportunity he's given to actually think about what he's doing.
He is drinking too much whiskey due to his guilty complex since he had a love affair with a woman when Carol left home, and he has frequent blackouts, forgetting what he has done in the previous drinking night.
Figures since the film is only self distributed, meaning you get ripped off of fifteen dollars and some "filmmaker" ships you a DVD from his parents' basement.
And speaking of parents' basements, is that where this film was shot, since it features some of the worst sets I have ever seen.
I have liked Cain since his `Lois & Clark' days, but he along (I was not too familiar with de Rossi and am now not interested in being familiar with her) wasn't going to get me to see a suspense thriller.
Not that it really helps, since the final moments make the whole of `The Glow' pretty dim-witted.
However, I do NOT recommend that Kim Jong-Il see the film--he might be tempted to nuke South Korea, since they were responsible for this atrocity of a movie!
I've loved Thomas since I was a kid and I don't know why the movie gets a bad reputation.
It was nice to see Alec Baldwin & Anthony Hopkins again together since their excellent yet not much people have seen "The Edge."
A lawyer makes more sense since he ends up representing Jabez Stone against the devil him/herself (he was a man in the story, but was a woman in the movie) in a trial where both of their souls are on the line.
I was especially surprised since this group of actors usually is pretty picky about what they sign up for.
I was in the video store the other day and figured on renting it,since I'd just finished the 1st,but something told me not to waste my precious money,and just view it online instead.
I do hope they make more movies about Thomas and his friends, since it was a wonderful TV show, and the spin off is great too.
They haven't been in anything since.
Production design, style, and unity are apparently unknown elements to director Damon Santostefano (unsuccessfully seeking work since making this movie) and the whole thing seems randomly thrown together.
Ever since seeing her in 10 Things I Hate About You, I've been anxiously awaiting Julia Stiles' next film.
The script by David S. Goyer who has since gone on to write massive Hollywood films such as Blade (1998), Blade II (2002), Blade: Trinity (2004), Dark City (1998), Batman Begins (2005) & the upcoming Ghost Rider (2006) film was amongst his first & after this it's a wonder he was ever let near any of those films.
This is the funniest movie I've seen since Shaun of the Dead, unfortunately that movie was trying to be funny.
However David Wilson,Damon Jones,and David Oren Ward gave the best performances.Sadly I just learned actor David Oren Ward died tragically which is a shame since he was both talented and very handsome.
The shocking rape scene was really well done but I didn't like how she treated her boyfriend afterwords since he was helpless to save her.And then to kill herself afterwards was cowardly and not believable.Yes it was traumatic but I have never heard of rape victims taking their own life because of it.What the skinheads did was rotten,but then so was what the group of black men did to her and her boyfriend.And then later the same group of blacks targeted the white girls.I am sure it probably happens a lot also,but they don't seem to be depicted as bad guys which is a total double standard.At that point I was waiting for the skinhead group to get even with them for shooting an innocent kid who was only lured into it because he was mentally challenged.And they were also protecting their female members from being nearly assaulted which any gang would do no matter who they are.
It has been 6-7 years since this movie came out and I wonder why another attempt at a Thomas movie hasn't been made.
I suspect that Gary Sinise's character was meant to be a joke, but since I have heard it a million times already from people who are far too stupid to be making films, it fell flat.
All The Rage gets a two out of ten for me (which is even more damning than a one, since I often give ones to films that are so bad they're funny).
But this was obviously not true, since there were no more hints made after the first season.
Well, shouldn't the others' human spirits also be able to resist Brother Blood, since they're all human?
The "actors" are most likely friends of the director who had no acting experience whatsoever before, and probably none since.
The film is clueless, since the makers had no vision.
Like when they find the body that hasn't decomposed like it you'd think it would have having been buried in a 120 year old cemetery, the police would be called since it was obviously just buried.
I could have used less talk and more music, since this is what the documentary is ultimately about; well beside their lives and the creative process.
would be 20 years old since she was 5 when that happened and not only is she married to someone who looks 30ish but also has a kid who looks around 7 and 10!
This was Penelope Miller's screen debut & has gone on to appear in many films & TV show's since.
About the only really good original imagery in the film is long takes of the Italian countryside, but even those aren't technically necessary... especially since Fellini and some of the others in the movie discuss how sometimes sets are more preferable anyway.
Â is Edie Stone, who went to high school with Arthur and has been yearning for him ever since.
The premise appealed to me, since it sounded like a deviant and exploitative variation on the "Mad Love" and "Hands of Orlac" concept.
It is the fact that he has since been cemented as one of the biggest movie stars of all time, and this is where he started.
I am a big Arnie fan, have been since I was old enough to operate a V.C.R and I will defend him as charismatic Actor who has been in some brilliant films.
Aarnold Swarzenager stars in it, but they dub his voice to make him sound American, which is especially awesome since he's Hurcules who would have been Greek.
This may on one hand actually well be the worst movie I've seen, on regular movie basis that is, because on the other hand it's also the funniest movie I've stumbled across since I saw "Monty Python and the quest for the holy grail".
I had a really hard time understanding whether he was supposed to resemble a retard or a tree, either way he did a fine job, since it all seemed perfectly natural.
The old fool Samson is a part for himself, since he doesn't even seem understand he's from the Bible and has nothing to do with Greek mythology.
I have only listed a few of the errors in this movie here, since I won't spend the entire day of writing this review but I think the fact that Arnold Scwarzenegger actually managed to not only have a movie career but also got elected as a senator has to rate as the biggest of the lot.
I don't blame him, though, since the script is so godawful.
<---here is that spoiler but since u should really skip this film u might as well just read it--->  Plot twist/ending: They tried to have one, but hopelessly failed and again I can not believe someone actually wrote that it had an unexpected twist at the end.
I've been a big fan of Parker Posey ever since DAZED AND CONFUSED, and while I haven't been able to see all her films, I consistently enjoy her work.
I can't evaluate the script since it was impossible to understand.
This documentary, directed by Mark Cerulli (who hasn't directed since), is only interesting if one is looking for a comparison of just how comprehensive DVD documentaries have become over the past five years.
I'm giving it 4/10, since it slightly better than the average fluff piece.
When Sara tells that her fiancÃ© is coming to London, Mark decides to end his affair since he loves his family.
These are nice people who are clearly not above telling their friends to spam this board, since the only two negative posts got modded down to the bottom of the list.
I found it disturbing and horrifyingly sickening given the status of the multinational in India since the disdain it has shown for the people of Kerala.
And then, since God was not the only perfect entity (man joining him in that elite club) anymore, they both got together and created woman.
This is all unfortunate, since Rules of Engagement was made by a lot of people who should know better.
I regret throwing away the Blockbuster receipt, since now I have no hope of returning this little slice of pointlessness.
It better be since it is the most expensive film in Chinese history with a budget of $35 million.
The film was started post HAHK(even the title was HUM AAPKE HAI SANAM that time) and it took 8 years to complete  When the promo was shown i was shocked considering SRK and Salman haven't shared screenspace since KARAN ARJUN and suddenly a film with them and Madz comes   The movie is regressive, outdated and could be better in 90's  The back story of Madz- Salman is so cringeworthy even there is too much sermonising  But there is one plus point and that is SRK in this film, well normally he overdoes his scenes here he is in full control and plays his role with a straight face and brings a lot of fun in the movie  Sadly the film never manages to sustain the tempo and we have tripe like GALE MEIN LAAL TIE.etc  Also it's funny to see the appearances of actors Salman suddenly in 1 scene looks straight out of JUDWAA days with his medium sized hair and with his overacting but lively acting and then he comes to 2001 days where he looks dead The dubbing too is inconsistent and also his acting which goes from amateurish and then to dead acting SRK too suddenly has short hair, long hair and also his looks keep changing and so his dubbing and acting Madz too, in 1 scene she has brown hair and then the ponytailed black hair look  The film also has the late Laxmikant Berde who wasn't much seen in 2002 Also we see Atul Agnihotri who was rejected post 1998 i feel and was just seen as an extra   Direction by KS Abdiyamaan is outdated though good in parts Music is okay, most songs sound old Cinematography is inconsistent  Acting SRK though looks inconsistent yet he delivers a wonderful performance and rarely hams which is a relief Madz is as usual, she does a good job but her role is too regressive Salman khan is inconsistent, at times lively and at times dead below average overall Laxmikant Berde is okay Alok Nath is okay in a small role Atul Agnihotri is a reject and he annoys
This has been my favorite movie ever since I saw it in the late 1940's.
***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** For some reason I decided to pick up this film to rent and have totally and completely regretted it ever since!!!
Let's hope Mr. Brooks has, since the completion of this mess, found his Muse.
Albert Brooks still knows how to spin off a great one-liner but something has happened to this man since the great "Defending Your Life".
It's shame too since everyone who was in the theater for BLUE CRUSH missed a fun, exciting, and hilarious sci-fi adventure.
Add to it some of the lamest jokes ever exposed to celluloid since Carrot-Top and many eye-gouging, sleep-inducing twists and we have here a total disaster.
This is not inappropriate, since the focus is on Charley Davis' (Garfield) struggles outside the arena, both to win the woman he loves and against the mobster who wants to control him.
He has proved he can carry a film (Beverly Hills Cop, 48 Hours, Trading Places), but it has been a long time since he has appeared in anything decent.
This must be seen as further critique of the director, since he seemed to have all the necessary tools at hand.
Luckily, with the POV technique, we don't have to see him, since he looks even less authentic.
My friends and I, aspiring filmmakers ourselves, rented this thinking it sounded good, and since it was an indie film with a distribution deal, it might make for a learning experience.
the premise of the film is that they trained together since pre-pubescence.
I guess being part of an elite anti terrorist has its benefits since they all obviously have access to elite dental treatment - Is this why the movie is called ELITE ?
Also, the acting and production values are so-so, but I guess I shouldn't expect much from an evangelist(since it was produced by one).
I think at times the director was intentionally using jump-cuts to create a sense of disorientation, but I can't be sure, since at certain times it simply looked like he was re-doing a take and not bothering to edit to a different POV to cover it up.
This is probably the worst movie I have seen since another Italian 'masterpiece': Nonhosonno by director Dario Argento.
This fact renders the knowledge that Racette is none other than Sutherland's own wife in real life as well almost impossible to believe, since this is hardly borne by their interaction here Â least of all during a fragmentary sex scene that ludicrously apes Nicolas Roeg's DON'T LOOK NOW (1973) which, of course, also starred Sutherland!
Not only did it not stick to historical facts (which would be understandable since Gregory didn't either), but it also completely changed the plot of the novel.
The most impressive is Ana Torent, the Spanish actress who has been a favourite of true cineastes since she played a 12-year-old in 'El Nido' (1980).
For 200 years, since it was introduced to England by RichardII's queen, Anne of Bohemia.
OK, I will admit that since I am descended from Mary Boleyn (and most likely, Henry VIII),I do have a bit of family honor at stake here....
I've been anticipating this movie for over 2 years now, ever since I first heard it was in production.
No Tudor movie since then has gotten close in accuracy or sheer entertainment since then.
It did have a couple of cool flashback moments, and Christine Moore is easy on the eyes, however, I was struggling to pay attention, since nothing happens!.I got this on a 8 horror movie 2 disc set.
John Woo was a brilliant filmmaker in his Hong Kong days, with great titles such as "A Better Tomorrow", "The Killer" or "Bullet In The Head", but at the latest since after the passable "Face/Off", his name is connected with blockbusters that barely reach mediocrity, such as "The Big Hit".
Much like every other film playing at multiplexes nowadays, it just has to have a pop song in each scene (they even dig through the '80s a bit, since teens these days act like they know what '80s culture was like), idiotic postmodern outfits like girls wearing loose-fitting ties over tank tops (wow, how sexy), and of course the obligatory lesbian element that has to permeate everything aimed at the young demographic.
Last but not least, they excavate the tar pits with a multi-ethnic cast since you simply have to do that nowadays to show false camaraderie between people that given the chance would otherwise destroy each other.
Matthew McConaughey as Tripp is off-putting to watch, and his accent so thick it is often difficult to understand what he is saying Â and baffling, since no one else in the film, including his parents, share his accent.
As it is, it is very confusing how she is so successful since she utterly fails in every aspect of her job with Tripp.
It's a believable reaction, but since everything else in the movie is so unbelievable, it's just awkward and does not fit.
I did not laugh once during the entire film, which is surprising especially since Greg Proops is involved.
I suppose if this has been a big box office hit they could have continued the franchise and gone on to bigger and better movies together... but, this tanked with audiences and I don't think they two have worked together since.
I have since discredited everything told to me by this individual after seeing this movie.
The audio commentary was useless since it's a skin flick but even then that was bad too.
Embarrassingly inept propaganda film that seems to have been hidden away from the public for almost 60 years, since it's release back in 1942, until the miracle of the DVD disc brought it back to be seen by a new, and stunned, generation of movie goers.
The direction and writing by Eric Schaeffer is wonderful, there is a supporting performance by Bill Duke that soars, and for dessert there is the single funniest slapstick comedy sequence since the days of silent films.
But that was the worst I've seen since Black Beauty.
It is incredible since the Novel by Massimo Carlotto was so good.
I am really upset since I love the "noir" and we could have a good chance.......
Sorry but I really did not like It, the screenplay has so many problems and some scenes makes you laugh since they are almost ridicule.
They moved to Sicily and ... since then the movie can be summarized in four words: Sicily = hell Finland = paradise  Sicily is not the perfect world and Finland is an indeed very nice country.
The plot trudges along through double-crosses and betrayals involving various police officers, mobsters, and the obligatory love interest (Kathryn Harrold, given little do since, even though his wife is awful to him and he's technically dead, he's still a dutiful married man).
I won't spoil where and how he shows up, but let's just say it's twelve hours since I watched it and my ribs still feel a little sore from laughing.
How is it possible for a white girl to kill an Asian assassin, who has been trained since god know how many years?
If you want to see a good Tarrantino movie do not look to this one, if you want to see a good anime movie do not go here, if you want to see a decent kung fu movie simply watch a Bruce Lee movie - since most of the ideas were blatantly taken from these things anyway.
If you like this movie you need your head examining since it is by far the worst movie I have seen all year.
Scary, since how old was he?
Given that it's the 1-dimensional Keitel, you can rightly assume that he is a slimy scumbag sociopath (that's pretty much all he's played since) and he wants to score with Farrah.
and, even if I knew it was no great shakes, some sequences from it (Kirk Douglas' nude fight with Harvey Keitel and the climax, for instance) have stayed with me ever since!
It looks the BBC are trying to infiltrate the entire country because it's the first success they've had on a Saturday night since Strictly Come Dancing (and no I'm not going to mention Robin Hood).
The film only lasts about 80 minutes but it's a fairly torturous experience with an amateur feel as the camera shakes around all over the place & the entire narrative is told through little snippets of footage that some cameraman or other has shot, the character's are very thin with no sort of background & various character's just disappear without trace or word of what has happened to them & it's hard to point to a single leading character that stays the distance since there isn't one.
Watch George A. Romero's zombie flick Diary of the Dead (2007) instead since it's much, much better.
I must say that it's probably a pretty good piece of acting, since Lee is every man's nightmare--needy, self centered, manipulative, cruel (her office behavior would get her fired at any decent firm--of course the character is an HR person, and so there is a drop of reality there), and completely loathsome.
If the script were good, I wouldn't even notice the poor visual quality, but since it wasn't, I was able to notice it and as a result it hampered the film.
There is some arrogant smell in the air that I felt heavily since I saw for the first time Mr. Soderbergh old fashion sort of feminine style glasses frames and it was strongly confirmed by watching this movie.
Well, maybe not gold, since metals don't break as easily as these hearts.
I'm glad to see since watching it that the ratings have come down slightly, better reflecting the quality of the film.
With the latest revival in horror flicks, you would at least expect decent movies, since they make a lot of money these days.
another improvement, since it saved me from actually having to watch the people onscreen.
Which he can, since he's the one telling it to turn people into Chicken of the Sea.
He discovers Lombardi's little scam, saves the girl(again, we're not sure how, since he's a total puss), and there's an end shot on the beach with an 'invisible' monster that only the researcher can see(saving on special effects, I see).
since I saw it almost 20 years ago, the memory of it is not very clear, but I do remember that the characters to be more developed than the movie version, and therefore getting me more attached to them.
They needed to find an extra to play a skangy barfly, and well, since he was hanging around the set and making out with Rose anyway.
I don't like this movie since it marked the beginning of the millennium in which all women on a screen look, dress, and act like the skanks in this pathetic teen crap fest!
We have come a long way since 1968!
So much more of a pity, since there will never be another chance to ask them.
I've owned this movie ever since I was a little girl.
This is the worst film I've seen since Antz... and that was animated!
No genre ages more quickly and more badly than the "big con" movie, since the whole satisfaction of the viewer hinges on the big final scene - which we know from every "con artist" movie from "The Sting" to Mamet's "House of Games" and which, inevitably, recurs in every familiar detail as the big closing scene of "Criminal" - in which all the characters who have been presented to us throughout the film as having no connection with one another - street-robbers, cops, "mark"s etc.
In a sense, that scene has been "used up" and dramaturgically useless since "The Sting", and all the subsequent "big con" movies of the 80's and 90's, have had to add some very special extra ingredient - such as Mamet's plumbing of the sexual and psychological abysses beneath the "con/mark" relation - in order to be movies of any even limited note.
Hardly, since it is hard to imagine a simpler way for the mark to find out that the note he was buying WAS indeed a fake than to send the currency expert along with just such an offer?
The idea is ridiculous, since it would clearly involve running the risk of there happening what actually does happen at the bank in the penultimate scene.
His reputation as a hard man has long since gone.
See it if you possibly can, although since it was broadcast on PBS at least ten years ago it's probably hard to find .
Maybe this has something to do with Ben Stiller, since he was in both films.
That might be the case, since I did like Bottle Rocket and Rushmore.
I would not expect a woman to be so easy during the beheading scene, since it would be that she would fight for her life and struggle or at least cry during the process.
I never thought their love-making provided the right amount of erotic heat which is surprising since chains get thrown into the mix and blue light(..often quite an effective tool for erotica)within night scenes never quite elicits fireworks.
A terrorist thug named Josef (Ice T), his tough-as-nails girlfriend, Max (Claudia Christian) and his gang are on board, too, to steal the jewels and artwork that some of the passengers put in the ship's safe, since they couldn't sail off without their Van Goghs!
Linkin Park has been my favorite band since I was about 10.
It's interesting that this idea has since been used in other film productions.
Ever since I was a little boy, I was a big fan of the Three Stooges.
Clive Owen, who appears to be on a crusade to beef up his action credentials ever since taking the lead role in 2007s ludicrously violent Shoot 'em up, adds espionage skills to his leading-man repertoire in Tom Tykwer's globe-trotting thriller The International.
The robots are less convincing and harder to work with than humans would have been; and they offer neither privacy to the client nor monetary savings to the entrepreneur, since there appears to be an army of human operators watching everything from behind the scenes.
And I'm not going to let it off the hook even if I agreed, since it ignores basic nuts and bolts.
The decision to shoot on a soundstage is particularly disastrous, since it never looks like anything but a soundstage, and this despite having a good cinematographer (Tony Pierce-Roberts).
Many elements of the movie that I found distracting is that since the house brings all the mental patients together under one leader, why are they not inflicting pain on each other as well?
It also bugs me that they must walk into a person's office when they're lost, especially since they know where it is and in spite of a few of them being killed along the way.
Chris Kattan from Saturday Night Live makes an appearance, and this brought my hopes up thinking he would provide some sound comic relief, but instead he spends the whole movie ranting about how "the house is alive," something we have known since the first five minutes.
Not since Bolo has a lead character had so few lines, both with merit.
for me,this is easily the worst disaster movie i have watched to date.i didn't find it compelling at all,and the special effects were not believable.the movie was not exciting.usually,acting is not a big concern in these types of movies.however,in this movie the acting was the worst i have seen so far in the genre.i nearly quit watching before the end,but i decided to give it a chance.regrettably,it did not improve and i lost close to 90 minutes of my life.in my personal opinion,i would avoid this movie,as it is painfully tedious.i also felt embarrassed for the actors at times.the movie was directed by Tibor Takaks,who also directed,"The Gate" another movie i hated.he has directed other things since"The Gate",but i haven't seen any of them.anyway,I'd have to give "Nature Unleashed:Earthquake a dismal 1* star.
(But then it couldn't be, since it was made in 1953 and precedes most of the films I would think it satirizes by several years.)
Especially since that OL episode also has the same level of scientific misinformation and technobabble.
Until tragedy brings everyone together, the characters are fairly exasperating--and, since the characters also function as gags, the "comedy" is rather mean-spirited.
I have been a fan of Michael Ende since childhood and, although this interpretation of the Neverending Story strays from the plot of the book, I still found it delightful to watch.
The catch is that the more people log in to watch, the faster the person goes, which is supposed to show how cruel the common people are - since when you are dying under excruciating pain, you want it to last longer.
Another really bad part was where they did the filming, you could tell that it was filmed out in the desert out in Utah, because since when did the Gobi Desert have small plants and cliffs and rugged terrain in it?!
On the other hand Walter Huston's attitude was to laugh uproariously at the awful dialog he had to spout and said since Howard's check cleared the bank he'd say any words in the script.
to be honest ever since highlander 2 the highlander series has been slowly declining in quality.
But what made it most incredulous was the editing; since the story is filled with many a clichÃ© (dying man gives his long monologue to teary-eyed hero, longer monologue from a disgusting creature about what is to come in the rest of the story, sex scene between hero and girl after a heart-to-heart, final duel, et all), the editing should at least try for professionalism of some sort.
But he became a straight to video kinda guy and some of the films he's churned out since have been unwatchable!
I have been a fan of the highlander franchise since the original movie came out, and this movie is blasphemy!
I hope no one else has to sit through this, and the only thing I lost is time, since I Tivo'd it from SciFi.
Highlander had been that much redeemed since Highlander II that I didn't even consider the possibility that it would be a bomb.
However, "The Source", which has been in the vaults of Lionsgate since late 2006 is a bitter disappointment.
But Philip's announcement precipitates a crisis that he cannot imagine: his own father Owen (Brian Cox) is homosexual, a secret he has concealed from wife Rose (Eileen Atkins) since their marriage.
Known under the title Blood Wars on DVD in the US this was co-produced & directed by Tom Shell & I had a quick look through the IMDb user comments section & a couple of external reviews & I can't really find anyone who says anything good about The Thirst: Blood War which isn't too surprising since it's awful on every conceivable level.
There's these Monks as well who total three & are able to shoot blue 'stuff' out of their fingers for no apparent reason, we are never really sure if there are more or not or where they came from or the story behind them & we are never really sure if Julien is head Vampire in the world or just his clan & there are other clans out there & apart from sit in a room he doesn't seem to do anything else & he has no plans or ideas & we don't really know if a Vampire bite turns you into a Vampire or kills you since at the start a bite will turn you into a Vampire but at the end it kills you so it's hard to care about anything as it doesn't make much sense, there's no threat or grand plan or anything to keep you watching really & I do not count three Monks & about half a dozen Vampires as a war, maybe I'm being too tough here but I just don't.
I have never laughed harder at a movie since watching this.
I thought this had potential since it was really stylized.
Especially since he plays the same character in every movie: the anime badass who is annoyed all the time and says "Urusei!"
Fans of a good Gothic fantasy set in ancient Japan will be disappointed since the filmmakers only implied a plot without coming up with one.
Action connoisseurs will be very disappointed since the fight choreography is uninteresting and repetitive 90% of the time.
Okay,I admit,I do like silly movies.Let's see,I sat and giggled, through "Esupai"(ESPY).I grinned at "Dakaiju Baran".Yes,I also sat smiling throughout "Godzilla vs. Hedora".But "Nostradamus' Fearful Prediction" is Toho's biggest,most fattest folly since "Godzilla's Leverage".
But since I'm bothering to write this, I should go into more detail than that, right?
"License to Wed" might as well have been called "Meet the Minister," since all the film does is to recycle the nightmare-before-marriage scenario from "Meet the Parents" - albeit with one crucial deviation.
Obviously again noting since that this Camera "captures the death of a moment" that would make sense because the children should have a life instead of slowly dying like the old man.
It's been 15 years since I saw this movie yet it lingers in my mind like the taste of spoiled milk glibly drunk in the middle of the night right out of the carton.
i mean, even in the best, most patriotic movies they don't do that, especially since this wasn't even a WAR where the USA won against another country...
The ending isn't surprising at all since it falls under the standard giallo clichÃ© of copying Alfred Hitchcock from the 1960s.
This added greatly to the humor value for me personally, since the dubbed voice sounded nothing at all like the extra.
Especially since the boy calls him 'Master' all the time...
This is the most stereotypical movie to come out since "Birth Of A Nation" but yet it's embraced by the black community for one and Hollywood seems to be OK with it.
Why they call this film 'Untamed Youth' I don't know since most of these kids seemed really drab and half-asleep most of the time???
Rounding this out this cast was a woman whose purpose I wasn't really sure about and whose sex was indeterminate, since she looked like Greg Brady in a dress and wig.
I don't know who their intended audience was since I'm fairly sure none of the targeted teen types would have gone to see them.
I'm guessing that I'll be the very small minority on my next statement since everyone but me loves this show but the only show I can compare it to is How I Met Your Mother.
Throw in a couple exotic Oriental types, John Lone, galaxies removed from the greatness of his starring role in The Last Emperor, and a non-acting actress who is tossed in merely to provide eye candy and to establish Rourke's characters bona fides as a non-racist, since he demonstrates that he is willing to sleep with some of them.
Introduced to this show through a sibling who devoured R. L. Stine's books, I found I initially couldn't form my opinion of it since the first handful of episodes I saw happened to be based on the books I hadn't read (why is it the books you most want to read are the hardest to find?
Also, since fewer action scenes were shown in most of the single-episode simpler stories, special effects were severely limited; I never found the antagonists as terrifying as they could be in imagination.
The whole subplot about De Niro's peeping-tom habits are disturbing and make us dislike his character - which is a problem since the sequel (HI, MOM!
The audience is able to identify with many of the characters since common human strengths and faults are expressed in this film.
Plus they are the wimpiest fascists since the Italians in WW 2, they can't seem to plan or execute anything right.
And since I am a Vegetarian and completely against (and opposed to) animal cruelty in real life, I find it even more disturbing that someone would want to do it for their art...its completely inexcusable and literally boils my anger.
Especially since it was obviously shot with a home movie camera and the sound track consisted of mostly choppy clips of random tunes strung together--some exceptional (such as the jazzy or early rock pieces) and some banal (such as "Pomp and Circumstance") and some oddly ironic (such as "See Ya Later Alligator") that dominated the images.
And it has brief full-frontal male nudity by an unknown actor at the beginning, worth a look alone since it happens so rarely in American films.
Godzilla began as a powerful, heart-shredding dramatic allegorical monster movie and has since made many turns in his career from other powerful films to campy fun movies.
Containing the first real metaphorical monster and the first human death scenes since the first Godzilla film, this could have been a return to the glory days.
When he arrives, he tells her not to loose words but to come to the core of the defense immediately, since it is clear to him that she did not kill her husband.
The whole idea will go over the kids since they won't be familiar with it so the film relies on cheap gags for laughs.
Adults and teens will probably not be pleased with the humor since it's very obvious and stupid.
When I first heard about this movie, I wasn't sure what I would think about it, but since I watch lifetime movies like they are a religion, I decided to.
But in all fairness, Malcolm (especially since, save a bit role and a made-for-TV production, he has no acting experience whatsoever - at least in film) is okay.
Then when I saw that tonight TCM was highlighting Danny Kaye movies and that "Wonder Man" was on next, I rushed over to IMDb.com to read the reviews on it since I had never seen or heard of this Danny Kaye movie before.
An interesting tactic, since Buzzy is supposedly counting on Edwin to avenge his murder by testifying against a gangster.
I have been a fan of his films since the beginning and have every one of them on video, laserdisc or DVD.
Its been some time since I read the book by Gaston LeRoux, but I do not recall the Phantom having a perfectly fine face.
I have loved this story since I was a child and as an adult I would still like to have it in my memory as a good story, not some type of killer film.
What a total let-down!What a huge disappointment!I still can't believe that Dario Argento was responsible for this Hollywood-influenced piece of garbage.It's simply a romance with some splashy gore thrown in.All of Argento's trademarks are gone here:no cool camera angles,no Goblin music,no playing with colors,no black-gloved killer,no bizarre dreamlike sequences,and worse of all,absolutely no suspense.The direction is very flat,the acting is horrible and the characters are not interesting at all.The gore scenes are well-done,but the film is extremely boring.All in all,"Phantom of the Opera" is pretty hard to sit through since it is so lame and unscary.I wouldn't be able to watch this trash again.I only hope that Argento's next horror project "I Can't Sleep" will be really worth watching.Avoid "Il Fantasma dell'opera" like the plague.Better watch "Suspiria" or "Deep Red" again.Not recommended.
This movie might contain spoilers, but since Im sure you're not going to watch another forgotten cult flick by infamous Ray Dennis Steckler, I won't hold up with spoilers (like there is anything to spoil!).
You might think that you are watching the same scenes repeat over and over since all the killing in this movie are done in exact same way and all events are just repeated with different actors or actress.
(since Steckler didn't want to waste all that used movie track he had) Why am I not telling anything about plot?
He looks at most of the women he meets as tramps and prostitutes, and since he is in Hollywood he does see many of them on the street corners.
Later, when Steve Zahn finally returns to help the guys out with their Day Care, does the audience finally chuckle for the first time since they sat down to watch this turkey.
There was something revealed, if not quite a twist as such, and it was feasible but by that time I didn't care, it was all too stupid and horrible and my eyes had long since glazed over.
At the start, I felt like I was just coming in at the middle since so much had apparently already happened that wasn't shown.
This is the most awful movie I've seen since Hope Springs.
I found myself waiting desperately for the dog to return, since his acting outshone that of any of the human actors.
This mystified me, since the show was created in 2004.
This book would have been a daunting adaptation for any movie maker, since most of the important stuff going on is unseen and unspoken.
I have been a film buff since I paid $.25 to get into the Ritz theater as a little girl.
She did this in 1999 and they have been married since 1992.
I had some higher expectations, since this was on the Sci-fi top 100 on IMDb.
It's been awhile since I last posted one of these user comments - and what a winner I've returned with.
This portrayal of women is surprising since Eduoardo Ponti's mother is the vivacious Sophia Loren.
But that's a big deal, since I've never even thought about giving a Troma film anything higher than a 1.
However, since Spencer is so full of crap, he tries to look big in his wife's eyes by compulsively buying her lots of stuff--so much that he bankrupts them despite her trying to reform him.
The soundtrack may sound annoying too, but it adds nicely to the atmosphere and it becomes clear that things inside Lisa's head are not as they should, but since nothing is explained further and nothing else is this interesting, it cannot raise this film too much higher and the element can be appreciated only as a single succesful piece in a very flawed work.
A lot of Slice of Life movies since the late forties seem to me to be rather pointless, rather tragic - or worse - both!
Quentin Tarantino must have seen it since he cast both of them in "Pulp Fiction."
Ever since Something Awful went from funny but financially unsound to lazy, unfunny, and bloated by the contributions of cliquish forum nerds desperate to join some "elitist" society of half a million other nerds, SA's contributions to mainstream wit have become crippled half-thoughts not worthy of attention.
For years, Cannibal Terror was believed by many to be the work of horror/sleaze director Jess Franco, a reasonable assumption since the film bears what seem to be most of the prolific Spaniard's hallmarks, most notably a dreadful script, unconvincing locales, inept direction, terrible acting, and endless meandering shots of nothing much in particular (and I guess, for some, it was also hard to believe that there might be another person out there who could make films quite as bad as Franco).
True, there are a pair of okay jokes, but that''s not hard to make, since it's all "toilet humour".
There are many times where you will guess EXACTLY what the actors will do because it is clichÃ©, and other times where you will wonder how anyone could make a character act that way in certain situations, since it makes no sense at all.
And, since I have seen all the films of Waters that are available (a couple very early ones aren't), it seems natural I'd give Anger's films a try.
I recently rented this film having been a fan of Sam Bottoms ever since Apocalypse Now but what terrible mistake I made.
What was really funny was once she got into the job, and she took her job seriously since this is what an honest person would do, regardless of the job, not to mention she was really good at it, and thus she began to make her workplace more homey.
Ever since she was a little girl, Chun-Li's sole ambition in life has been to become a world-class concert pianist.
So one would think that this movie would be more accurate to the video games and Anime movies since Capcom had direct hands in this.
But since Gen hasn't been such a staple character like say most of the SF2 characters, it isn't as obvious.
Gen....poor Robin Shou, a great fighter, but hasn't gotten a decent role since Mortal Kombat Annihilation utterly destroyed his career.
It's been ages since I have seen a film of such poor quality, so much so that the many parts of the whole have come together to form a movie so insipid, so completely devoid of merit that only a team of evil geniuses, locked away in an isolated mountain fortress, driven mad by loneliness, despair, and bad TV sitcoms could have ever created such an atrocity.
More than that, though, since Shore has been out of the A-list spotlight for a decade now, you never know how much of this movie is fact or fiction.
Sam Garbarski delivers one of the most authentic descriptions of everyday-life since Ken Loachs "Ladybird,Ladybird"(1994) and Mike Leighs " Secrets and Lies"(1996).
It was interesting to see an early Simon Baker, however it looks as if he has since had a nose job.
I won't bother to write a whole synopsis since that has been covered by earlier posts.
Seems that some folks watched this movie in the expectation of riveting sex scenes, and while I thought that the whole ending sequence was very contrived, the sex scene did work to make sense of the movie, which was just as well since the rest of it was kind of ludicrous.
Unfortunately, they don't seem to have noticed that 37 years have passed since this tale had some merit, and the results are distinctly musty.
Ugh...I can't even keep writing this, since thinking about the movie makes me want to vomit all over my keyboard.
Though billed as a hybrid giallo/erotic thriller, there are few thrills to be had in this plodding mess of a whodunnit, and with only a few unimpressive scenes that feature any sort of horror element, the spaghetti splatter here is closer to Stauffer's lasagna (although such a comparison is actually insulting to Stauffer's, since their lasagna is loaded with taste, while this film has none).
I consider this merely because the only audience this film seems aimed at are fans of graphically displayed and unabashedly lewd sex acts, yet since this film doesn't quite go the XXX distance, it seems silly that anyone in that demographic would seek this out instead of opting for a purely pornographic offering.
However, this also works against Ursula, because since this is a relatively polished piece of film making, it doesn't even have the unintentional humor of ineptness that gives many trashy movies such as this cult following appeal.
Even the murderer's choice of a giant phallus as a weapon isn't too novel, since while reading up on Ursula I learned that there was another Italian film made before this with a killer that employed the same noteworthy instrument of death.
And since we've already established that there's no suspense (the killer practically has the word "psychotic" carved on their forehead), fans of classic thrillers won't find a winner here.
However, you can see the same performance every week on "The Norm Show", since its essentially the same character.
Those days are long since gone and yet some people feel compelled to keep the "exotic Asia" myth alive in film and literature and this film is one such example.
That director should be ashamed-especially since I loved the Red Violin.
Amazingly the director also directed 'The Red Violin', a first rate film in almost every way - he must have been drinking himself into a coma every day since then or had a nasty accident that damaged his brain.
Very quickly I didn't find it entertaining (the initial allure of Lauren Jones' looks wore off rather fast), but since it was the premier episode I decided I would give it a chance and stick with the show for the entire half hour.
The reviews of the film were terrible, but within weeks, journalist friends informed me that a phenomenon had taken place--the movie had become an instant camp classic, with audience-participation unrivalled since "The Rocky Horror Picture Show."
She must have known that there was no other way to play it since this was doomed to be a turkey.
Dunaway has been paying the price ever since.
Ever since accidentally buying "Ninja Terminator", I've become somewhat of a fan of Godfrey Ho, because his movies are just so mind blowingly terrible and disjointed they cause hilarity, albeit unintentionally.
First of all I have to say I saw this movie on video, since it didn't come out here in the cinema.
Ultimately, the photog turns out to be every bit as bad as he promises, and perhaps a little better since he's principled enough to send her away when it's at the point where the relationship can do nothing but drag her down.
It could have been a lot better if attention had been focused on the story and the characters rather than a bizarre twist that you end up waiting for, in the hope that the film can regain the energy that it has gradually lost since it began.
Then, all of a sudden he has to leave to be with his wife, who no one in his family has seen since the explosion.
Arkham is also the hot spot for zombie activity since Dr. Xander (Christopher Slade) had already used his blood sample to turn a female student who tried to blackmail him into a zombie.
He's been making no budget movies like this since the mid 1980s, but sadly doesn't seem to have improved much over the past two decades.
And by the way, since when was it "bold" and "edgy" to say the same bad things about the president that everyone else is saying?
I for one have never really been a big fan of animated cartoon type movies, that is since I'm now an adult but in my past as a kid I treasured them.
They followed it up with the Boost Mobile episode and it hasn't been the same since.
Ever since I heard about a feature film coming out three years ago, I couldn't wait for this day to come.
But since the director Steve Miner had a place on all horror movie lovers' memory by directing "Friday the 13th" 2 and 3, I want to say a few words.
Calling all zombie fans....  One user has said this is the best zombie film since Planet Terror.
Might be right as there has not been another since Planet Terror has there?
The movie is more of an 'urban drama' than an all-out horror film, which is fine, though the characters were just far too one-dimensional and it comes as no surprise this guy decides to run around with a deadly piece of hardware since there is absolutely no change in his demeanor to indicate exactly WHEN he has officially lost his mind.
Will be remembered as the debut feature of director Ferrara, who has since never been afraid to court controversy with films like Ms. 45 and Bad Lieutenant; and probably as one of the films that sparked off the 'Video Nasty' hysteria in the UK in the 1980's; but for little else.
This footage is extra since the 1999 re-release and it looks like Ferrara wanted to supply his film with some kind of spiritual depth.
As usual I thought I was in for a great movie since Jackie Chan was in it.
So I watched it anyways thinking that it can't be all that bad since I like some of his other films.
Have been a great fan of Benigni for years since "Down By Law".
It as since remained one of my favourite films that I have seen again.
all in all the worst comedy I have seen since Charlies Angels 2 or Muriels Wedding
Fart jokes haven't worked since Blazing Saddles, and even there it was just a device used by Mel Brooks to see how much the censors would let him get away with.
More than ninety years old, it serves as a reminder that movies has both changed and not changed since that time.
Plus, I assumed since the film is titled "Sorority House Massacre," it would be about a bunch of GIRLS being stalked by a psychotic killer, and not a bunch of girls AND THEIR BOYFRIENDS!
It's clear to anyone who studies history that this is not just the way America works, but the entire world has functioned this way since the dawn of civilization.
And this, of course, is not good since as a fact he then becomes Moore.
I've never been able to enjoy any of them since.
Although the movie's Islamic flavor is kept tastefully toned down, you cannot miss the message, since you will get hammered by it from beginning to end, for the whole of the movie's seemingly interminable 116 minutes.
You will not get that impression from the movie, however, since they did keep her appearance mercifully short.
Sterne agrees to look into Weiss's claims but eventually admits there is nothing he can do, especially after Weiss gives him some newspaper cuttings from 1944 which appear to show Olivier but since the paper is over 30 years old and Olivier would now be in his 60' or 70's and the guy on T.V.
I get the idea that that's what the creators, writers, and directors did, since the supposed "insight" into Mulder's character is completely irrelevant for the rest an otherwise excellent series.
I also thought that Mandy will be singing in the film, but since she didn't, a prettier, more proportioned actress would have been more fit for the role.
Clare Kilner did a poor job of directing since it was kind of hard to see what was the real story.
I felt bad for the Halley's friend since her boyfriend died and she got pregnant but pretty much just her.
I've been looking forward to see this movie, since I'm interested in the history of Japanese occupation, korean resistance and korean history in general.
camera-work was interesting, so if you are a film-student it may be worth a look - but since I've not seen a korean movie with bad camera you might be better of viewing any other korean movie
But since its sci-fi, I can't go into much detail because at the end it's just not real even though some sci-fi films seem more believable than this.
Must of watched the film a million and nine times since and never tire from watching what was the sweetest ,funniest and atmospheric film with the greatest soundtrack ever.
With a tendency to repeat himself, Wenders has been a consistent disappointment ever since he hit it big with 'Paris Texas'.
After listening to the commentary on the DVD I have to temper my criticism of the film since its clear that the scenes from the original heist film were actually really good.
The film as it stands now seems to be about four films blended together, which is about right since the heist, the cops, the zombie and what ever else all seem to be in different films made at different times.
I saw this film over 20 years ago and still remember it as the worst ever - without having seen it since.
I'm unsure as to why a mummy movie needs any cutesy moments, but since this is meant for families, writer and director Stephen Sommers made this both violent and cutesy and comedic, so it never fully works as anything (though it does work much better as an action movie than anything else).
Hope and Cosby were great in their time but it's long since passed.
I'm not sure why, since I was eventually hoping someone would smack Jackson upside the head & shut him up.
Not that this programme needs ruining since it did it, itself.
Mrs. Lacy is an old coot who keeps telling herself that's she's incredibly lonely since her old man was the victim of an unfortunate 'accident' (an axe to the head!).
And since teenagers are still building their personality, this is symbolized with rapid, successive changes of clothes.
Additionally, since this film is brought to us by Alpha Video, you can safely assume the print will be terrible--which it definitely is.
I've always been a fan of Cheryl Ladd since her Charlie's Angels days, and she certainly proves herself an actress of all genres.
If you wanted you could probably kid yourself into thinking this was an art-house film since its foreign and attempts to deal with "issues" in societies, which it does rather clumsily, otherwise just watch it and laugh.
Not since Hudson Hawk have I seen a film with a potentially amusing idea go so badly wrong.
The movie never adequately explains the rationale behind their actions, since their actions are completely self-defeating.
In the novel, Islamic terrorists were the bad guys, which makes sense since they don't care if they live or die and because the Middle East would be relatively unaffected by a nuclear war between Russia and the US.
They were smart to do so since there was nothing to gain but scorn for having any part in this horrible, horrible movie.
I've since re-read it several times.
I guess that's so we can understand these men are serious and mean "business"  Oh and on the subject of business, since the typical european Neo-Nazi is young, skinheaded, devoted, but not terribly affluent these Nazis were conveniently well-to-do businessmen with the financial assets and experience to put their scheme in motion.
However the dreams & visions won't go away & Jake discovers that those he has tattooed are dying is mysteriously circumstances & strangely their tattoos have grown, Jake finally comes to the conclusion that an evil Samoan spirit is using him to kill those Jake has tattooed & since Jake tattooed the love of his life Sina she will be next unless the evil spirit can be stopped...
The climax is totally implausible since it contradicts with everything the script attempted to make us believe earlier on, but hey, at least the VHS cover art wasn't a lie.
There's no suspense to the film, since aside from the Russian soldier in the beginning there are NO human deaths, just a lot of animal cruelty.
He's controlled by a half-ling Â a vampire who can stand daylight Â and together, they search for the last ascendant of Count Dracula since they need a new master.
Best line since "Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn".
Which leaves us with a bunch of actors who laugh, dance and make crazy noises all the time, no story and the most unrealistic action sequences since Moses went through the Red Sea.
"The Amazing Mr. No Legs" is extremely violent, but never actually shocking since the effects and stunts aren't exactly convincing.
I don't know why Morgan Brittany was in this though since her character didn't really do anything of any importance.
Which is interesting, since 'Norman' was supposed to be a 'brilliant' scientist.
It had been a while since I had last watched it and I had an easier time remembering the elevator death than what the actual story was about.
This is the worst movie I've seen in 5 years, probably since 'The Avengers'.
And yes, the scenery is majestic, I do forget sometimes since it's in my backyard and I see it every day.
I haven't seen most of the cast and crew since, but I still think about all, OK -- some, of you occasionally.
Sylvia when finally confronted by her long lost lover Gatanebo was anything but trilled in going back with him, to Nigeria, since he was anything but likable or even interesting to her.
I wont write a lot about this movie since its a comedy except to say that probably most original(well not original but perfectly acted with great chemistry between actors) since meet my parents, most comedies have been pretty stupid.
He states repeatedly that a man who lives off his wife's earnings is no better than a rat, and after he's killed her he complains that since he's become a "man" once more it's entirely unfair to punish him for it!
The Animal Liberation Front of Teryl (Teryl is my fictional country, I made it since I was in 4th grade, I'm in 12th grade now!)
The sequel, however, is a vast disappointment for a Horror fan like myself, since it doesn't really deliver any creepiness or suspense.
It's been a while since i laughed so much while watching a romantic comedy.
This is especially odd, since up until then he never acted crazy or hot-headed (just the opposite in fact).
I saw it when it came out in 1967, but not since.
After some martial arts training, she and her newfound karate cohorts decide to bring their own brand of justice to these hoodlums since the police won't do anything about them.
But, since she's who she is, however unfortunate that may be for all of us, we'll go on seeing her again and again, silicon-blown lips and breasts and, oh, what's the use?
"The Day the World Ended" and "Earth's Final Fury" are alternate titles, and both are fraudulent, since the story is about a volcanic island which threatens to overwhelm a Fantasy Island resort, not Planet Earth.
Yes, they are special: they are special as the cheapest special effects ever seen in a disaster film since "Plan 9 From Outer Space".
How have I managed to keep missing it ever since?
Gilmore is openly disapproving of Spangler, since he suspects that Spangler has only married his daughter, Nikki (Veronica Hammel), in order to become his business partner, and get his money.
Berova may be a highly beautiful woman but her acting ability is almost nil, so immediately the film is faced with an uphill struggle since her character is so crucial to all that's going on.
Even so, since I'm hopelessly in love with Nick Stahl, I have watched Lover's Prayer many times (for whatever reason it on TV a lot!)
I won't give you an overview of the storyline, since that's been covered in this database entry.
I know Subiha way back since Eighties.
What annoyed me even more was that the producers seemed to think that selling the sense of the stereotypical "mysterious China" would be sufficient, probably thinking that "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" succeeded solely on this (which it did not since Crouching Tiger was a good film based on a good, albeit decade-old, plot and strong characters).
The audience is, as asked of the leading characters in the film, "believe", since the actors themselves certainly failed to deliver any sense of goodness or badness.
Which is completely sad since Yeoh, Chaplin, and Roxburgh are capable of being so much more, as they have shown in other films, and are victims of a daft directing and an even worse story.
Then (since they rounded up a lot of prostitutes off of the Sunset Strip), there is that problem where too many characters look alike - white, dumb and blond.
You quickly become confused as to which dumb blond is getting hacked on now, but you resign yourself to not really caring since the movie is just so bad.
There is no Good versus Evil, since everyone in the movie is evil; so does it really matter which evil wins?
It is easily the worst film Brooks has made and it is no wonder (at this date) he has not made a film since.
In some ways (none of them good), this movie has haunted me ever since.
I did not have high expectations for "Paganini Horror" as fellow Horror lovers had already warned me about how ridiculously bad it was, yet I somehow wished I was in for a positive surprise, since director Luigi Cozzi is generally a gifted man, as films like his highly unusual, but equally highly memorable Giallo "The Killer Must Kill Again" (1975) prove.
"Paganini Horror", however has nothing to recommend it for, which is too bad, since a Satanic Horror film about Paganini could have become something good, or at least highly entertaining, if someone had put a little more heart into it.
The situation of Daniel is incoherent, since his niece is left in a school for troubled youths, and only when she vanishes, he seeks information about the place where she was living.
I don't know if Rosanna Arquette has any acting range or not, since I've never seen her play anything but slightly nutty, silly sluts - which is what she's stuck with again in this film.
she will not be able to be there for Angela's kids or meet them since they have grown up.
However, since it is the GREAT ALTMAN, none dare say the emperor has no clothes.
Also, the dirty jokes towards the end cracked us up (especially since it was the only bright spot of actual humor in the whole film).
I've been a fan of the show since Reagan was in office.
But you know, I actually thought this was part 3, because they released it on VHS under that title (since 3 and 4 were never released here).
Yet, if you think about it, you do GOOD work for someone you're saluting; not the worse, God-awful thing since Russell's 'Tougher Than Leather' fiasco.
since she's passed he's taken the baby to live in Bend with his parents who I think are evil people.
It all seems so high school, especially since they all talk about this, but are paralyzed to act on those feelings.
This looks like a Woody Allen parody,made by an unskilled director, totally unrealistic since X loves Y who loves Z who loves A and who in turn loves X to make the circle complete.
since he's French) but can't find him because he's always in the barn setting fires or strangling nymphomaniacs or whatever.
Very unnecessary since it is obvious who is going to live from the start...
Just think what Carpenter's HALLOWEEN hath wrought in the years since its release.
They should have called him Pizza-Face Jones, since a) Lynch's face has more holes in it than the Van Wyck Expressway, not far from where Lynch grew up in Brooklyn and, b) he acts like Harrison Ford on 'Ludes.
Next, Elwood visits Mother Mary Stigmata at the new orphanage, since the old one had long since been demolished.
Belushi's absence from this film is definitely noticeable, but I think it's good they made Elwood a more central character, since in the original it was obvious Jake was the central character.
Fortunately for us, David Bailey hasn't directed another feature-length film since!
I started watching this show by accident and have been watching it ever since.
Now of course, I was only 11 when I was watching the first season and I guess since it had grown up's in it, I assumed it was true to life.
"Classics" is obviously the operative word here since most of the titles I've never heard of and I suspect they're all in the public domain.
And since it was solely Burton and his monologues, along with Burton's campy directorial choices which ate up those tortuous 10 minutes...I would deem this film as Burton's, and only Burton's, rotten egg.
Basically, I have no idea what the main story is about, but it's a bit like Harry Potter (since the first movie, everyone begins to imitate J.K. Rowling's success, but nevertheless fails to generate everlasting appeal) and a dot of Winxclub (which seems of plagiarize the former, plus lots more from other original anime preferences), which results in a badly mixed barf bag which older audiences have to consume to imagine its horrible taste (think of one event in Fear Factor where contestants are required to pick up garbage from the road and eat it!).
Its a shame since it was filmed mainly on the beautiful island of Culebra (i know its beautiful because I've been there, if you judge it from watching the film..well..its just OK)   The photography is just average, no consistent efforts (filters, waiting for the best time of day) to produce nice colors.
The editing could be a lot lot better, since the movie doesn't "flow" well most of the time and the music could've used some help.
Which is a shame since its concept warranted a much much better treatment.
Odd that it has Greek Mythological power, since it's lurking in the Mid-East desert.
But if you're in the mood for some bad horror hijinks, "Basilisk: The Serpent King" (kind of a silly title, since toward the end of the movie the Basilisk was proved to be female) will fit the bill.
It's just exciting to imagine them thinking, "Well, since we are getting paid for this, let's make it look good!"
In all the years since then there has been nothing that Jane Fonda Turner has done other than marry a rich man.
The most eminent scientists from every race and from all corners of the world (this aspect is actually what makes the film special) combine their knowledge and promptly organize a large-scaled expedition to research why the intelligent life forms on Venus tried to reach for other planets and, more particularly, why they haven't tried again ever since.
The only difference is the ending, which has the pretty blue humanoids escorting humans to their Earth-bound ships at gunpoint, which I freely admit is a rather neat sight since my ancestors were American Indian, Irish, and Scot.
it's by far the most horrible storyline since Ed Woods' "plan 9 from outer space".
How the hell he keeps getting his movies green lit is perhaps the greatest mystery since "why Paris Hilton is famous".
Being in the tejano business, you know every band (since it is such a small market).
A funny, simple said story was something new for me since watching Earthlings.
I mean how could any of the tenants not recognise the gay character since he'd visited each and every one of them?!
I can understand why Connery would want to re-image himself, especially since his time as James Bond was approaching its end.
Throughout the movie, it seems as though everyone's being taped (thus, the title) - but to no end, since the tapes really end up playing no role whatsoever.
And let me make it very clear since the other reviews on this site neglected to give a sufficient description of the action.
That is nearly impossible since Woo's Hard Boiled is one of the best action movies ever made.
It's been best done in movies as various Robin Hoods, Zorros, and Lone Rangers, but has also served uncounted zero-budget "B" westerns, costume actioners, serials and cop pics since fiction film first unspooled, particularly during the pre-WWII period.
But since the film is mainly a horror film, the other stuff is just mentioned in passing and thus the imagery seems pretentious.
And along the way, Molly and Terry find out what parents have known since the beginning of time: Raising kids is no picnic.
- the alien ambassador just looks at some formulas on a black board and knows what it is and why it is wrong ... i study informatics and have a lot of math - you just can't know all the formulas and even if you do you won't always recognize them, since there are different ways to say the same.
Do we blame screenwriter David Scarpa for not knowing whether he should homage the original work, steal from multiple films that have come since, or create his own original idea?
I guess since it looks like it hurts when his face expresses human emotion, he's what the director needed.
The problem I have (apart from the fact that seeing this has made me realise I must have grown up from since when I used to go to rotten.com and impress my mates with just how sick a video or image I could find and mail them!)
Plus, the ending features some great witch slashings via an axe, which was a nice addition to the film since the majority of it is gore free.
Also, since this is a teen sex comedy, I should mention that there's almost no raunch and nudity at all.
i don't have an opinion about jackson in the issues raised on this document, since i can assure you I DON'T THINK I REALLY KNOW michael jackson after seeing this document.
I think that since he missed his youth, he's trying to catch up with that now, and if you see it from that point, have you never had a slumberparty with a friend when you were young?
Roger Moore, a Tory tax exile who should never have been cast as James Bond since he was already too old when he started, had no problems with funding apartheid throughout the 1970s.
I plan to read it since I think it will develop these points much better.
The plot (such as it was) was completely derivative, nicking ideas from just about every gangster film since "Brighton Rock."
I believe these users were hired by the production to promote this flick, since all of them coincidentally have only one short review in IMDb eulogizing "24 Hours in London".
I guess I shouldn't be too disappointed since the Greek contestant had the best legs and she won while Romania had the best cleavage and she came third with the Israeli motek also doing very well .
Norway does deserve some credit since they contributed an act that seemed very similar to a tribute band for Brit glam rockers The Darkness and Denmark's entry could easily have passed as a respectable POP IDOL contender .
One can only imagine that the film's creator is lampooning this idea as old fashioned, since nowhere in this production is there a hint that personal irresponsibility has played a role in the downfall of all the "victims" depicted herein.
One wonders why the film's blame doesn't extend to LBJ since Bank AmericaCard was introduced during his Administration.
You see the aggressive expansion of the credit market into areas where creditors wouldn't have pursued before, since they used to not be profitable, like college students, and people with generally low income.
After reading the other reviews, I don't agree that this is a movie that PETA would love since it portrays an animal rights activist as an embezzling, slightly deranged loner who mistreats the dogs in her care and has no life, no friends, etc.
Clay isn't much better since he seems to be reacting to a scene that is playing in his head and not what is going on in front of him.
To be honest I think the heading over the title should be changed from "A Clay Brothers Film" to "THE Clay Brothers Film" since I'm not sure that there will be another.
Other featured actors are the noted transvestite comedian Eddie Izzard, who's acting skills and presence haven't improved since the equally awful 'Avengers' and Edward Fox playing guess what?
I have since removed such so called creditable witnesses to movies from my friends list.
Her own name was changed by her father's adoption by another family since his own grandparents, aunts, and uncles--on both sides--Greenglass and Rosenberg-- would not take the two orphaned boys in.
Ever since, I kept an eye on movies with Alan Arkin in it -- his performance as John Singer, a deaf-mute, was sensitively delivered and commanded respect.
"Riddick" has got to be the worst science fiction film I've seen in a long time, at least since Travolta's "Battlefield Earth".
Especially since I don't think he was supposed to say those things originally.
A pity Locke was never given roles this meaty since then.
I proceeded at my own peril, especially since I have rather enjoyed some truly awful movies in the past.
Furthermore, the humour used in this movie is the worst ever, there were _several_ humourously intended phrases, which have been known to mankind ever since the internet was invented, can you believe they actually said things like "I'm not a vegetarian because I love animals, I'm a vegetarian because I hate plants."
The clincher for turning me off on this film was the anti-Christian bias, something prevalent since film began.
Unfortunately, since the characters have no motivation, and since the director seems entirely unwilling to let anything tragic have its due in the world, the movie skips past what could possibly be a beautiful and tragic ending and continues for another hour or so on tangents without importance or design.
I saw "Lonely Hunter" when it came out, and perhaps 2 or 3 times since then, and it has certainly stood the test of time.
It seems quite churlish to excuse a novice director's first feature-length outing (especially when you have not yet made one), and since this director, Marfield, was introduced at "Deepwater's" SIFF screening this past June, his direct and humble appearance made it a film you wanted to like.
Two guys, one being Leslie Neilson, are at odds since one wants out of this Project Control.
Guess what, that is called a dead virus since in 12 minutes it can't get very far.
THE FOLLOWING INCLUDES PLOT SPOILERS but since the movie is very predictable they don't spoil much.
War has become much more real since "Northwest Passage", both on the screen and off.
I wouldn't be surprised to learn that it has never been produced anywhere in the world since 1970 - and hopefully, the sun will grow cold before it is produced anywhere ever again.
Of course all of the above are exceptional films so you may not think it fair to compare them to Reyes' film, but I'm not since to do so would be ridiculous, I'm simply citing why the lack of morality fails to work in his film.
Meanwhile, since the Police have focused on the wrong person; the killer is walking the streets.
A shame since I was looking forward to seeing this.
They act as if they got married in high school and have been living sheltered lives ever since, clinging desperately to their marriage and spurning all advances.
One of the things you gotta love in Chinese martial arts movies is their low budget, since it is the reason behind funny special effects.
The Monster Musical has been a failed genre since the brave creation of "The Incredibly Strange Creatures..." Like almost every monster musical before and since it has the distinctive characteristic of being truly awful.
I didn't enjoy this film at all since it only has a few good moments and even those aren't highly memorable.
Which is really surprising since Roy Ward Baker did a few outstanding directing jobs in the past.
Fellow Gothic Horror enthusiast have warned me about the film, and so did several other reviews on this great page, but as an enthusiastic fan of even the cheesier kind of Gothic Tales, who loved the other Amicus Productions, I still decided to buy it cheaply, especially since Vincent Price is my all-time favorite actor.
The story centers in Alicia (for Alice in wonderland, played by TalancÃ³n), a candid woman whom has never been really understood since her childhood and that spends her life in a world of fantasy that she draws by and for herself.
And, since most real-life sources have stated that their contribution to the film was squelched to begin with, this comes across as a flashy, lopsided, expensive mess of a biopic.
Carrier based aircraft was still an unproven tactic for war, although aircraft carriers had been developed since the early twenties.
First, I have been an Hector Lavoe fan since early 70's and as a puertorican I agree with a lot of our artists that this movie is simply awful.
Also, you can clearly notice that this is a "Jennifer Lopez production" since a lot of the "actors" in the movie are blood relatives of J-Lo.
This is a low blow for these artists and I can believe Jenny to ride Marc's fame as much as she can since she can't sell a movie by herself, much less a singing career.
I was very disappointed in Marc and as a puertorican I can say that ever since he got together with J-Lo he has lost a lot of ground with us puertoricans and this travesty of a movie clearly shows it.
The flying footage -- and there's a lot of it -- is okay but somewhat pedestrian since it's mostly training and search-and-rescue stuff.
Anyone who likes this movie cannot care one toss about the plot, since in the end, the only thing we can be sure of is that Jeff Daniels thinks therefore he is.
In fact, at times it seemed as though she was in a different movie since she was so laid back and sane and the characters around her were so over the top and cartoonish.
4/10 since there were some funny moments albeit over the top just like the characters and the dialogue in this movie.
It turns out that the idiot researcher has managed to screw up the hooker's life even more than it was, since if the might-be witch lives instead of being executed, she'll not re-incarnate and none of her future lives will take place.
So on my scale with about 1400 films in the bag that would be a 4, since it at least progresses somewhat coherent and you get the overall idea.
This conclusion must be extrapolated, since it is nowhere stated in the film, the adapter not having troubled to stir in the muck she has tossed into the pot.
This is instantly forgettable stuff and I can't see it having much rewatchability value in the future...especially since Bela Lugosi turns out to be a good guy after all!
In the "Purple Rose of Cairo," Woody Allen finally stays behind the camera for the first time since 1978's "Interiors," stepping away from constantly playing these neurotic show- biz/writer characters to brings us more of a romantic comedy that celebrates film as a form of escapism rather than a form of art.
Some of the characters in this film are supposed to be American, some are German, but since the director did not choose to staple the character's passports to their foreheads and the screenplay only offers vague clues, international confusion rules.
It's been quite sometime since I've been to a movie and felt the need to advice people to stay away if possible.
But anyway, since you seem to be such a big fan of yourself and your own work, maybe YOU should keep your crappy movies to yourself, eh?
I wanted to like this movie, ever since I saw the trailer.
With the exception of Punch Drunk Love (an entirely different kind of role altogether) and to a lesser extent, Spanglish, I have yet to see Sandler actually pull off a massively hilarious or worthwhile comedy ever since.
Billy Madison was by far the funniest, and it's been downhill since then, with The Longest Yard being his worst comedy yet.
This is the most homo erotic movie to come out of Canada since Strange Brew.
So, since his shower was cut short, he returns to it, and begins to wash his abs once again, by this time I was quite flustered but enough about that, back to the movie.
Even as a travelogue, it doesn't work, since not enough of Savannah is shown and described.
Gene and Gale are the creepiest mother & son team since Sante and Kenneth Kimes.
Eventually, Gene escapes from prison and hides out in the nightclub to kill Deanna, because he assumes since she's working there, that she must be sleeping with all the patrons.
(And since, I'm a technological idiot most of the time, who likes nothing better than to blame computers for everything that goes wrong in my life, you can trust me when I say this episode gets a little heavy handed.)
It is more interested in selling tickets than being true to its own nature, an incredibly irresponsible approach since there are some who probably took the suggestions seriously.
Devito probably took this role because he hasn't had an on-screen kiss since Twins!
I pretty much grew up with MST3K since I was about 10.
I could go on forever, but since this has to be under 1000 words, I'm not going to.
In a sense this equivalence is apropos, since Wenders and Ray are both, at best, second tier filmic talents.
You know, for example, obscure post-apocalyptic cult flicks like "Holocaust 2000", "Escape 2000" and "Death Race 2000" were tremendous fun to watch, so I was fairly confident that this one would be cool too, especially since the title refers to a type of heavy machine gun.
I know they weren't trying to make "Schindler's List" or anything, but still the worst family comedy since "The Shaggy Dog.'
Not to try to make them real since you'll only end up hurt and disenchanted as well as detached from the real world by thinking that they are.
These realities confuse Tom since he never was in a movie like the world that he's in now.
After making motion pictures like The Graduate and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, he had slipped severely, making only a couple decent films since.
Ever since watching the Alien and Predator films from the 80s and 90s, I was expecting something like this.
For an indicator of how long I have been a fan of the series, I will tell you first off that I saw Aliens when it came out on video tape in the late 80s and saw Alien 3 in theaters, I obviously saw Alien after its mid-70's release, and it scared me like few movies have ever been able to do since.
Anyway, so when I finally shook myself out of it, there were people that were getting attacked by face-huggers that were bullet-timed a la the Matrix (and every other action movie since).
The execution wasn't very good though since its just not very exciting.
Most of the action scenes are boring and that's a problem since that's one of the main reasons why a person may watch this film.
The plot had so many holes in it, I thought it was that pair of socks you have that you wear everyday, and have worn them since 1994, because they are you're lucky socks.
Maybe that explains why i haven't seen any of the actors since.
What amazes me even more is that the director has since directed many more movies - you'd expect the studios to never want him on a set again.
This was starting to look more and more like a Steven Seagal flick (only worse this is a series) all the baddies are so generic they are either waiting to have their asses kicked or get hypnotized into giving up intel by Jennifer garner garner's hot body i can't say i am really surprised since the creator is none other than J.J Abrams THE SAME MAN RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST which like alias had a lot of potential but like its predecessor is bricking itself in by trying to overstretch a concept.
I was quite amused by the first series of Alias and am now ploughing through series 4, having seen the quality drop remorselessly since the opening.
I was interested to see what happened with Rambaldi but I think I realise now nothing ever will; we will just continue going round in circles since any form of conclusion will kill any form of suspense however minute.
I'd give it a 3 but since some shots are pretty enough, I'll go for a 4.
Lesser known Lawrence Kasdan, since he's mostly found behind the camera, is the father of "Orange County" director Jake Kasdan.
Chow Yun Fat is the best actor to come out of Asian cinema since Toshiro Mifune and Jo Shishido.
Lauren Holly as a hard line Republican US Senator maybe the most ridiculous bit of casting since Denise Richards was made a nuclear scientist in "The World Is Not Enough".
Overall, 4 stars and only because it's him - probably the worst best picture Oscar since "American Beauty".
Ever since I have seen Infernal Affairs (IA), I said to myself that Hollywood would not pass up on a story like this.
This, of course, is ironic, since Frank Zappa did not do drugs.
These episodes, the cream of the crop(since they were the ones ABC *chose* to air, there were two they didn'tÂwhat must they have been like)?
Luckily, the guest stars in the film didn't have much reputation to loose, since the product of their efforts is nothing short of a cataclysmic failure.
At one point in the film, Kennedy's character comments that his dancing crew is just a bunch of 30 year old guys acting like losers since they are stuck in a 13 year old mentality, This proves to be the most interesting moment in the film since the viewer is left to wonder whether the dialogue pertains to the plot only or is perhaps an introspective excursion for Kennedy himself.
It deserves that status, but isn't popular enough, so I implore all bad horror fans and good comedy fans alike to search out this film and give it an opportunity, since it will change the way you view films forever.
The first 45 minutes of 'The Laughing Dead' is very tedious viewing since they're presenting us a character drawing nobody really cares about.
This clever ruse helps Selleck effect entry since the Germans are expecting him.
A sub-plot that threatens to hi-jack the movie involves the young Rock promoter who brought Sinatra to Australia and a girl who had fancied him since they were kids.
I would try to make a judgement more univoo since this site were underestimated masterpieces by Di caprio Titanic and Charlton Heston.
It was done in Vistavision a process that gave a superior quality to the film on the screen, and unusually in black and white, since most of the films in Vistavision were in color.
I decided to pick this one up to see if it held up over the years, since I hadn't seen it since the theatrical.
"Four Rooms" has reportedly been substantially cut since its disastrous September 1995 screening at the Toronto Film Festival, but it's hard to imagine the film running any longer.
The actors were horrible, even Banderas, Hayek and Tarantino and it turned out to be the biggest disappointment since Underworld.
If you've never heard of this film, I'm not surprised since the film was barely released to theaters.
I bought it on DVD since I last saw it when I was a kid and I thought that it could make me laugh.
I want that to change though since hes outstanding and very underrated.
I haven't seen the second one, nor do I plan to since I watched the trailer for it since it was in the "Extras" section for SPM 1.
I figured this one would have been good since it seemed that'd it be much like the first one.
and John Dierkes (as a particularly vehement believer in the Jekyll 'legend' despite being in their employ - or, so it seems, since he's always hovering about the estate!)
I had been toying with the idea of purchasing the All Day DVD of this one ever since it was released; I'm glad I managed to catch up with it eventually without having to purchase the disc - being shown on late-night Italian TV, as part of a Jekyll & Hyde marathon which included snippets from a variety of films based on the venerable tale (I was especially gratified by the inclusion of a couple of scenes from Jean Renoir's THE TESTAMENT OF DR. CORDELIER [1959], which I've been yearning to see forever, and also ABBOTT & COSTELLO MEET DR. JEKYLL & MR. HYDE [1953], which I haven't watched in ages - I really ought to get down to purchasing either the R1 or R2 DVD releases of the films featuring the comic duo!
The idea sounds stupid, but it is well-meaning in some regards, since these are career prostitutes who've gotten pushed around for too long.
It sucks and it took me three trials to finish it since I kept falling asleep and having to restart it.
She reveals to him that she and her friends are in need of a pimp since their last one was murdered.
Of course you can say that since it is a satiric comedy primarily for adults, it does not have to be accurate.
Many have commented on Keaton's top-notch breakout performance -- and it truly is one of the funniest supporting performances since Matthau's Whiplash Willie Gingrich.
** IF POSSIBLE THERE ARE SPOILERS HERE **  Hanna has lived for four years alone with her kids since her husband went abroad to join a crusade (or something like it).
It's been at least a year since I have watched a film so annoying as "Proof".
The only faintly amusing scene is where Ray Liotta acts so frustratedly since the rest of the cast were so - duh - lifeless.
), but he does seems to be trying, and since he's a "newb", we can look trough his fingers...  Now, take a better look... Bosniak, Serb and Croat... and voilÃ , you have a generic ex-YU wannabe comedy... and that's it.
I wasn't all that interested in watching this movie, but I decided to anyway since it was one of the only ones that week there that I hadn't seen yet.
Sean Connery portrays the atypical mad genius character, which has been around since the dawn of movies, itself.
I've watched it 2 or 3 times since then and my opinion of it has improved, well, very slightly at any rate.
If you go to see Lethal Weapon 18, you expect F's and GD's galore, but it really took me by surprise in a romantic comedy, especially since there are so many GD's in the first 15 minutes of the movie.
Dormael seemed to have so much good stuff going on in this film, it's ashame he's only made one film since this, as any film buff who watches it will no doubt imagine a few more great films being pulled out of Dormael's magician's hat.
There appears to be irony in the title since THE LAUGHING POLICEMAN offers no laughs.
If they were trying to present the whole story through the eyes of the doctor, I would have understood a back-handed recounting since he wasn't at the creek, but the movie switched narratives multiple times, so the directing and editing and even storytelling decisions don't build any tension at all.
Than I suggest you watch the Previews for this movie, since I do believe they used them all in there.
The only way this is some what watchable for men is looking at the beautiful body of Jennifer Tilly, which has improved since her BULLETS OVER BROADWAY days.
People will get it confused with THE CELL, since they have the same count of letters.
The entire film is pretty awful since the story is lame and the acting is over dramatic.
Nothing as exciting as that happens in this film so I guess EDIE & PEN is a more accurate title since it doesn`t really conjure up anything   And nothing really happens in the movie either , it`s basically a low concept dialogue driven chick flick about two women who meet in a red neck bar , one of whom has a sort of relationship with a red neck and the two women swap life stories .
I gotta say, the two songs they use in this movie, especially the disco one, as cheesy-bad as they are, have been haunting me ever since.
The older gunman offers Lane the use of his hardware since our hero doesn't pack a pistol.
Meanwhile, Maria decides to lease Lane some land to run his steers on since he didn't tame the bronco.
Smith doesn't look like she has changed since their last collaboration on "San Antonio" except that her outfits aren't as flamboyant.
It's hard to do since they show about as much emotion as HAL in 2001.
It's unclear why there is any doubt, since the cannibals look like guys with animal headdresses and fall when they are stabbed.
Elliot Gould did M*A*S*H that same year, and built a well-deserved reputation as an excellent actor, even though he's had his cinematic ups-and-downs since then, like most actors.
Never repeated on BBC television, and only the first season available on video (and long since deleted), Tenko still holds strong and popular places in the memories of its audience.
But since Power didn't sing and Don Ameche always got sloppy seconds in roles at Fox, he got the part.
3,50 is not much, especially when it's says: The most funniest comedy since "There's something about Mary" starring: Ben Stiller, Janeane Garofalo, Mike Meyers, Alanna Ubach and many others... Alanna Ubach is the hot number from "Meet the Fockers" and Janeane Garofalo (which i personally like as well) known for her work with Ben Stiller on "Reality Bites", "Mystery Men" and lot's of other projects.
It was dreary beyond belief and  after two hours, my friend (who reached the same conclusion as I  did, but totally separately, since we do not talk during movies)  looked at me, we got up and made our escape.
After all, the idea that somehow convicting innocent people makes up for the ones who are guilty and weren't arrested is ignorant, but that seems to be the attitude of the police shows like this and in the minds of the average public, since shows like this teach them to be ignorant of the law.
Innocence hasn't become more guarded since we have already found the court system to be consistently wrong by a steady percentage.
Anyone in the court system admits the idea of having a lawyer appointed to one's self by the court has been proved to be a joke since most people in the public defenders offices are overbooked and they merely make a pretense of actually giving the defendant a defense.
It conforms perfectly to the feel-good foreign fluff that has flooded the market at least since _Cinema Paradisio_; that is, it embodies to a "t" the safe, lowest-common-denominator American conception of what a foreign film "should" be.
I was surprised at the fine quality of the movie, and the fact I had never heard of it before - since it was made 2 years ago.
It was a movie for all ages, since angels are of course ageless.
OK so here's the deal: Will Spanner returns, continuously since Witchcraft 2, with the delightful if too peroxide Delia Sheppard, here with his fiancÃ© Kelly Jordan who for the sake of the script has not met people she appeared with in previous films.
At the very least it has to be one of the most toxically self-indulgent train wrecks since "Lisztomania" - which is an achievement of sorts, I suppose.
I won't labour the details since I think most of the points I would make have already been made by others.
If you wanted you could probably kid yourself into thinking this was an art-house film since its foreign and attempts to deal with "issues" in societies, which it does rather clumsily, otherwise just watch it and laugh.
It's hardly his fault that he was warped by destiny as the plot would have it...the viewer can't help but root for him to succeed since he's the only one of any interest or appeal on scene.
Ever since the very funny Bad Santa, there have been a slew of Billy Bob Thorton plays an asshole type comedy.
Now, if you play this two movies one after another I guarantee you that you would not be able to tell which character was from which movie, since they are almost the exact same.
I was looking forward to seeing the flick, since I am a pretty big Billy Bob Thornton fan.
Woodcock, Billy Bob Thorton's gym teacher character is much too one dimensional to really work since he has one expression the whole time.
Actually the script just doesn't work since its so obvious where its going.
The name of Neve Campbell made me buy this DVD without any further reference, because I try to see her movies since "Scream".
Not that we really missed anything like "dialogue", since it was so poorly written and acted anyway.
but the seductress falls in love ("I'm mad about the boy") which is fine since the boy's also in love with her.
this is without a doubt the worst movie that i have seen since cabin fever.
Well, it's been a while since the 1995 release of Wally White's ode to self-absorption "Lie Down with Dogs," and the film still ranks as the worst gay movie devoted to celluloid, and an atrocity on all levels.
Despite Satinka's Native American heritage, she looks and moves like pretty much every Asian ghost you've seen in J-horror movies (and their American remakes) since The Eye, black hair hanging in her face, dark eyes, crawling in stutters and jerks across the forest floor, with the sound of snapped twigs accompanying her arrival.
A girl is raped and since her parents are Catholics they are represented as unreasonable.
Ever since the Ring I haven't been able to appreciate them anymore and it looks more and more like a cheap thrill device.
I gave it 2 out of 10 since they throw out votes of 1.
And this is supposedly the very same fallen angel that appeared at a convent back in the 1600's, and whose history you see a monk busily scribbling in black & white flashbacks (since apparently they didn't have color film in the 1600's?)
The biggest "star" in it, aside from Sorbo who's career has basically died since, is Tia Carerre playing a really stupid but typical female villain.
This is odd, because he seems to be a foreigner since he seems to know nothing of the local culture.
the King's relatives) so, since all the Kings direct heirs are dead, there is some confusion as to which one of the soldiers is the rightful heir.
Having said all that, while I found Ms. Bara's vamping pretty entertaining near the end, the first 30 minutes of A Fool There Was almost put me to sleep since that time mainly concerned the man she was fooling with's family.
And since when did dragons breathe ice?
And since he was the only one around, he must be the culprit.
Besides, there was, historically, nothing like Nero seen on the court of Caligula since Nero was born in Caligula's 4 year long reign (A.D. 37-41).
Style, substance and slit throat violence that I haven't seen done this good and chilling since the Untouchables, damn fine viewing.
The worst part of this film though is that the tragedy that took place in Haditha is still under investigation, it is only a few years since blood was spilled there.
Jessica Lange comes closest, as Big Edie, to a convincing portrayal, since she builds her character from the inside out and doesn't depend on impersonation, but still falls short because she holds back (as has always been her habit as an actress), especially in the later scenes.
Maybe one-fourth of the dialogue would have been worth listening to (or reading -- since I don't understand French) if the pseudo-profundity and pseudo-wittiness of the other three-fourths of the film were deleted.
I'll restrain myself from commenting on the horribly annoying acting since that was never an issue worth noting in such type of film.
This is the worst movie I've seen since Neighbors.
I was watching this movie and it came to a point where it had dragged on so long that I was anxious for it to be over, so I checked the time and only fifteen minutes had passed since the beginning of the movie.
A huge Troma nut since I was a kid, (thanks Dad!)
Soon, his captors become the captive since his evil and limitless abilities hold no bounds...
Of course since this is a murder story bad things happen.
However, you may not notice this since you are so busy laughing at the actors.
Certainly harmless in itself but overlong and not exactly rewarding in any way; strangely enough, the director had already tackled the story a decade earlier in GAWAIN AND THE GREEN KNIGHT (1973), which is yet another film that I haven't had the opportunity to catch up with since missing out on it on local TV in my childhood...though I can't say that I'm particularly looking forward to it now!
Despite the one very glowing review so far, it must be hard for readers to know what to make of the show since they only two reviews are polar opposites.
This new crop of directors following Moore are all about manufacturing images for themselves to no particular end since the topic has already been handled in full by Fahrenhype 911 previously.
There has no tension since much of the spooky action consists of the characters stumbling around looking scared while in the dark amusement park with nothing scary happening.
Stay away from this, even as a rental.I picked this up in Chinatown for five bucks on DVD and feel I was over charged (and ripped off since the DVD only had one set of 3-D glasses in it- then again the 3-D didn't always work) 3 out of 10.
Since I didn't watch the first part of this movie, I will probably sound stupid now, but was there some sort of an accident.... or several accidents all over the globe since all these people 'suddenly' died and left Ralph from America take over????
I think this movie can be summed up with the endless train scene in the beginning... its repetitive, its without any beauty, its not entertaining and everyone can put in his own interpretations since an endless shot of a train+windmills must have a meaning, doesn't it?
I don't care... watch irreversible, since that movie is shocking and has stunning cinematography and visuals and keeps your interest and massages your mind (although I think Noe has as little to say as Dumont, but he made a f***n MOVIE!).
And of course the story needs to feature a couple of teenagers in the main lead but oh well this always had been the case in these sort of genre movies since the '70's on.
The scare effects of the movie just don't work out and they try to enhance it by adding some gore but instead it works out all the more ridicules since it's just not very convincing looking.
Hence the absurd notion of an ancient Egyptian tomb in the middle of rural California which isn't where the silliness stops but since Legion of the Dead is just a low budget horror film I doubt anyone involved was aiming for authenticity, if you know what I mean.
She is mostly dreadful as the wicked would-be witch Selena, it certainly wasn't all Faye Dunaway's fault, since she just got stuck with a terribly written character, but she was over-the-top hamming and overplays outrageously.
She's come a long way (acting wise) since then.
The Utopian Argo city looks as limp as utopias have looked since Lost Horizon.
A friend told me about Odette Toulemonde and since she loves AmÃ©lie too, I got the DVD and just watched it.
Forgive my rave, but I expected something soooo different - especially since it tries so hard to "be" AmÃ©lie.
It seems like the movie is focused just as much on action and plot as it is humor (which I didn't really expect since the trailer portrayed it as mostly comedy).
This was the first Bud Spencer/Terence Hill movie I saw and it is probably the last.I just wanted to experience it since it is a very famous formula.The quality is inferior though.Everything that made the 80's such a terrible decade is in this movie.
What the Hell happened to network programming since then?
There could have been some humor thrown in to make this a good film...especially since the shrooms were supposed to make you laugh...but no.
Take a hint producers, next time you want to give a new starter a chance in the business, make sure the script isn't the largest pile of cow dung to come out since, well, hell I'll just say it, The Roost.
So I often looked at my watch since it seemed and eternity.
I might not have changed it even at my own home since pretty much every channel was airing some sort of "family" movies in the afternoon.
I won't bother with spoilers since there are none in this movie.
Bottom line: this is something that you can safely watch while doing something else, since should you miss something, the chances are, you've seen it in some other similar movie and therefore know what you missed.
Dyan Cannon comes closest to stealing the picture since she carries the biggest character arc as Alice.
It seems quaint to think of people discussing things like what they honestly think and feel about one another since we are much more socially advanced today (ha ha).
In fact revelatory acting especially by Natalie Wood since she probably had the most to lose by appearing in the film a la Brando in Last Tango.
The beginning truly captures the free and concept-expanding atmosphere that is the Esalen Institute, which itself has not changed much since then.
They have issues, since Sancho's wife Clara (Ãngela Molina) cheats on him, probably with David.
To tell you what happens would spoil a lot of things since AlmodÃ³var is a master with surprises here.
This man has been producing documentaries with strong political content since the 60s and you dare to consider him a bad copy of Michael Moore?
I have loved this movie ever since the first time I saw it years ago when I was a preteen.
if one were to guess the year, one is tempted to say early 60s--say, 1962 or 63. but the film is significant because it documents a solid, burgeoning beach culture which had been in place since the years immediately following W.W. 2. this film is a rich summation of what transpired on the beaches of southern California in the 1950s.
This film seems much more significant in hindsight; since, the Gidget character proved to be so enduring, and filmmakers discovered an audience for teenagers in swimsuits was ready for action.
Most of the movie is focussed on the character of Anthony, which is fine by me since he is played by Amitabh Bachchan - surely the most charismatic actor India has ever produced.
In this southern Gothic creeper, Roddy McDowall murders his wealthy uncle, but finds that enjoying his newfound inheritance is a bit difficult since a painting on the wall seems to suggest that Uncle is buried, but not dead.
Its interesting to watch the carnival scenes since its incredibly obvious that they are filming at an operating carnival since people are constantly looking at the actors in a puzzled manner.
By the time this show came out I was already a teenager and had long since pushed Transformers to the back of my memory.
I was a fan of anime and I thought since when did this start being animated by the Japanese?
I guess that would be my whole life since I was born in 81!
It was well acted, though to be honest I didn't think Kiera Knightley was that amazing in it, especially since she wasn't in it all the way through.
I was even luckier when I discovered a subtitled VHS copy of it, and it has since become one of my favourite animated movies of all-time.
The script abounds in throwaway lines that have no relation to anything else ("I haven't seen anything like this since the Bay of Pigs"), scraps of ridiculous dialogue (the history professor sees Ernest with a possibly valuable artifact: "Where did you get that?"
These interludes pretty much stop the movie dead since any of the momentum thats been built up comes crashing to a halt.
Schweiger has come a long way since DER BEWEGTE MANN ("Maybe, Maybe Not"), and in the process has single-handedly brought German cinema back to the masses after a half century of domination by the high brow author directors (Herzog, Fassbinder, Wenders) who made German cinema synonymous with boredom, and inaccessibility with the masses.
I had fairly high expectations for this movie, since Chris Roberts the creator of the original game series, spearheaded the project.
I had since Freddie Prinze Jr try to act before, and wouldn't exactly call myself a big fan of his, so I was slightly weary as to whether or not this film would be any good.
Incidentally, since when do you cast an actor with a French accent as thick as pea soup to play a character who was known in the early video games for having a Scottish accent so broad that it cemented the games reputation as a collection of stereotypes.
The fractured way that the story unfolds isn't satisfying either since we only have two versions and the second is the one that we know to be true.
While audiences left the cinema entranced by the glorious melodrama of "Imitation of Life" and "Written on the Wind", they would have left "There's Always Tomorrow" feeling a lot less secure about their own lives, since it's a film that touches on a fair amount of "dangerous" territory, calling into question the very foundations of the American family.
I haven't watched it since I was very young.
I will not write a lot about the story since so much is already said in the preceding comments.
This film played at the Toronto International Film Festival this past September but I gave it a miss, since I'd heard that Ken Loach's Sweet Sixteen (2002) was mining the same turf more effectively.
But again I am not sure since without the seemly depressing wandering "distractions", I might not be touched as deeply as I was.
His bleakest since Naked but perhaps better realised and more coherent.
The movie is in subtitles, which is fine by me, since many of my favorite war movies are foreign (i.e.
I watched Beverly Hills 90210 since I was in elementary school it has always been my favorite show.
Overall though it was a really bad movie - especially since the reference to the badly arranged sets of 1960'es B movies was probably unintentional.
Actually - the original story seemed to have been lost during this remaking-process, since This was merely a cheap action flick with no much meaning and props that looked so much plastic that it could be debated if the company bought them actually at a toy store.
It seems Stewart hasn't aged as much as Kyle has since the eighties.
But, since they find him (dead) with the key, he MUST be guilty.
c) the hole is abandoned since WW II, but there still is electricity.
I put myself in Billy's shoes and wonder if they knew that last time I saw them or if they've learned about it since then.
Maybe I shouldn't be too hard since Bill Forsyth has made a successful guerilla film , but I should point out to people reading this page before seeing the movie that Bill Forsyth is a very idiosyncratic film maker whose movies lack a universal appeal , that's probably why we hear so little from him these days
I have no idea if it has aged well or not because I haven't seen it in over 20 years but I will say this in it's favour/defence, "That Sinking Feeling" gave Glasgow a voice and a character that's rarely been heard before nor since!
I saw this 1978 "made-for-TV" film the first time it was aired, and once or twice since then (though not recently) and have never been able to forget it.
I saw this unforgettable movie more then 20 years ago and have never forgotton it.The movie, whos etitle I had forgotton until I found it on imdb is simply transfixing, it's to the movie's credit that with all the movies I've seen since this has been such an unforgettable one.
Not many spoilers since I saw the thing so long ago, I can't remember it scene by scene(except of corase for the FINAL scene!!)
It plays on my regular DVD player and I watched it last night (first time since 1978).
What a great movie and a great find since I hear/read it's a hard to get a hold of.
I don't mind a few stinkers, and I love the campiness of these late 70's/early 80's post-nuke films, but this is probably the worst film I've seen since Blair Witch 2.
I've been anticipating this film for a while since it is Thora Birch's first role since American Beauty.
I would make statements about the cinematography, but since it mostly consists of one person standing before the camera and speaking, there really aren't any opportunities to be creative in this department.
If so, than what is the point of it, since this movie shows and tells very little new or interesting.
I was extremely surprised not to see a vomiting scene in this, despite being probably the most famous scene in The Exorcist there's no recreation here which is odd since Exorcism: The Possession of Gail Bowers rips pretty much every other significant scene in The Exorcist off.
Really it started out as a decent 6, but melted down into a 2... 3 since I'm feeling generous.
Well worth watching, mostly since I doubt we'll see anything like this again, but don't go into it with high expectations.
I haven't seen it since it was on TV nearly 20 years ago and I can't forget it.
I've been waiting to see this movie ever since it won several awards at various film festivals.
I've been waiting to see this movie ever since it won several awards at various film festivals.
Indeed, the fact that both contain a transvestite is pretty much the only similarity between the two movies since the reasons behind the cross dressing serve very different purposes!).
I was gonna rate it a 8, however, since it only has a 3.1 i am gonna rate it a 10. it made me laugh so hard, and unlike some movies who make dirty jokes to make people laugh.
"The Skulls" is a well known film starring Paul Walker, and "The Skulls 2" was the worst explanatory sequel since "Highlander 2."
I've read the book and it would be hard to film it since it was a collection of short stories, however Merchant-Ivory pulled it off.
Ever since the frog jumped ship, it took some class with it.
...in a good role - best since Bob Roberts.
Big Wednesday does this in a very elaborate way, since it not only portrays the external behaviour of such generation (hair-style, surfing, music and so forth), but it also displays the internal values of such generation.
I first viewed this movie in my teens and have watched it on countless occasions since, it never tires, a fantastic movie that gives a great insight into the world of surfing, as well as making you want to learn to surf the moment it ends.
There is no real way to compare the two however since Endless Summer is a documentary that follows a couple of California surfers as they search out the perfect waves around the world.
It has such a feel good factor that I get it out and watch it at least three times a year and have done since I was kid, surfing with my friends in Cornwall in the early eighties.
I have loved this movie since the first day I saw it, at the drive-in theater.
All in all, a mediocre film about two personalities who deserve far better treatment, especially since both were, by all accounts, generally good people and acknowledged as such by those who worked with them.
It was also fascinating to see if Clark Gable really had a softer side in him, since he was probably the greatest leading man in the history of Hollywood and a symbol of American manhood during his time.
With the help of a recently orphaned girl named Katherine (Elisha Cuthbert), Ben attempts to unravel the mystery, leading to a confrontation between his grandfather and Katherine's great uncle (Ben Gazzara) over tragic events that transpired long ago and have affected their lives ever since.
Poke being put in charge over him since he's been compromised by taking graft from Johnson for years, that will only hamper finding the three hoods who ripped the Johnson/Mafia off.
Three hoods take out a Mafia racket in $300,000, but since they killed a couple of their kind as well.
However, it is recommended only to those with strong stomachs, since it is exceptionally violent and bloody.
The two lead characters try to solve this thing before it is too late, since the mafia is willing to use violent ways in order to get its money back..This is a premise for this classic film.
I really love the atmosphere in this film since it is something that totally lacks in most of today's films.
IMDb inexplicably lists 'Sentimental Romance' as a comedy short, which is odd since there isn't a trace of humour in sight.
You will be left speechless at the end of the movie, which has a twist of a magnitude unheard of since the Sixth Sense.
I do not regret to have rushed to see this movie without proper documentation, because I spent 119 minutes of pure joy, spoiled by an inexplainable ending (solved since).It is of course a testament, but I am only five years younger than Alain Resnais and I prefer to spend them without too much questions asked, about death mostly.
I first saw it on PBS back in 1972, I think, and it has haunted me ever since.
It's been a long time since I've heard a movie soundtrack where the bulk of the songs were not only performed by people born in the last 20 years, but they were performed well.
I fell in love with Akira (yes, I know, pronounced AHkih'rah, not Ah-KEEra) and found the subtitled version far superior, and I've been waiting ever since for something of equal maturity.
I had seen the 19-episode TV series on DVD, and I had been awaiting the movie since it was filmed in 2006.
Certainly, one of the most important characters in the movie is the city itself, since it is this very environment of poverty, hopelessness and violence that, in large measure, determines the kinds of lives these people will lead and the types of futures they will have.
this is very good movie about the wreck of titanic it is unscripted and the don't now Wat they are doing they test new robots name bot1 and bot2 later the changed their name into Jake and Elwood just like Blusebrothers and then they explore the ship in places that had never seen since 1912 i will give this movie 8 because i liked it wen the were telling the story about the ship and they show the rooms digital-ed in computer it is very cool.
If you want to find out about what happened to the ship since it sank I, would suggest the A&E movie "Titanic: Death of a dream" with Dr. Robert Ballard, Walter Lord, The living (at the time) survivors of the shipwreck and narrated by David McCallum.
Simple, I've studied this ship and dreamed of raising it since I, was a child in the 1960's of course these dreams were dashed when Dr. Ballard found the wreck in pieces.
I really like Patrick McGoohan's most other directed Columbo movies really much, since his directing style certainly give the movies something extra.
Though being a close personal friend of Peter Falk, he probably gave him a bit too much room though to do his comedy thing, since he definitely goes a bit over-the-top with it at times.
He deserved better, also since he seems really like an actor who is the right guy for playing these type of roles in these types of movies.
It combined comedy with intense straight up action and still works today despite having its conventions replicated in a thousand films since 1982.
"Columbo" fans will know something is up right away, since we see the cover-up but not the murder itself.
At the end, since Columbo didn't seem to care that much about catching the killer, I lost interest too.
October 15, 2003 was the day I became Born Again, and my life has gotten better and better ever since.
I haven't seen monkeys and humans bond this well, since "Gorillas in the Mist".
This one has been a favorite of mine ever since I first watched it on cable in the late 70's.
This movie is one of the best of all time, especially since it is a very different type of film for Greta Garbo.
I had not seen this flick since I was a lad renting any movie i could get my mitts on.
Gone entirely is his ex-girlfriend Ingrid, gone is the eerie recognition everyone around Claire has for Henry since he resembles the man she was occasionally seen with years earlier.
When the stranger Clare Abshire (Rachel McAdams) meets him in the library, she invites him to have dinner with her in his favorite restaurant Beau Thai where she confesses that she has been in love with him since she was six years old.
He doesn't know her but she has known him since she was 6 and has been waiting for him all her life and will do so the rest of her life...
Not since Christopher Reeve pined away forlornly for Jane Seymour in Somewhere in Time (1980, haunting theme by John Barry) has this theme been done so well in SF.
This movie had me near tears at the end, which is truly sad since I haven't cried since the movie Beaches.
Apparently, older Henry has been visiting Clare since she was 6 years old.
Kate Maberly delivers a wonderful performance as Mary Lennox, the spoiled little girl who is sent to live with her uncle, the reclusive Lord Craven, when her parents die of cholera in India, an event which never seems to affect her since her parents were always too busy for her anyway.
This is one of the only things that is fortunately subdued a little bit, since in the book the robin goes through a mating period and there is actually one chapter late in the novel where the robin and his mate have a conversation about Dickon and his strange friends, whom they're not too sure about.
The other thing that impressed me was how there was such careful attention to make sure that it remained true to the period, since this was set in England at the turn of the 20th century.
It has been an experience of its own since.
But I was looking at the five dollar bin at Wal Mart and found The Secret Garden, I figured since I hadn't seen it in a while that I could check it out once again and still I think I have a special love for this magical story about bringing life back into a dead world.
She is sent to England, to live in her uncle's mansion,since he is now her legal guardian.
But it's not an ordinary key, is the key from the secret garden, a garden who once was the place where her aunt always loved to stay and that now is locked since she died.
In the meanwhile, Mary meets her cousin Colin, a sick and spoiled boy who stayed all his life in bed, since everybody always believed he would die very young.
The "secret garden" really does seem to be a magical place (and I will say no more about it, since otherwise that would spoil things), and at the end I found myself wishing I could go and visit it first-hand.
I have never played the games, since I'm a chicken when it comes to horror games, and my brother had.
And since I have played all of them, at least part way through, so many scenes in these movies make more sense to me.
I haven't seen a good one since Mortal Kombat.
I decided to give the movie a try since it does deal with one of my favorite horror topics...zombies!
I wasn't waiting to see anything amazing when I started watching for this movie, since almost all the license movies have been terrible... Fortunately, my opinion was to change!
Not giving the fan-boys their favorite characters was a good choice since characters tend to get mangled in adaptation, and yet the fan-boys still complain.
Listening to Robert Quarry's recollections on the DVD release was very disappointing, since this movie - which I've been seeking for years - seems to have been an afterthought by everyone involved with it, a way to make a cheap buck, with no real love or ambition invested in it.
Except for one, Pico, who you suspect is wearing a wig held on by his headband since that never comes off.
.. the best polish comedy i ever seen (since Rejs) waiting for others comments ...  especially from people who don't understand polish ..  the film is a co-prod polish & french ...  myself i saw other polish comedy "Wesele" who is close to the concept of "Boys don't cry" ...  does somebody saw other polish comedy like that ??
Rarely does the camera technique look dated or technically primitive, and many scenes are as well done as any since.
I commenting Mega Man 2 after beating it a lot of years since I beat it the first time.
Laughs since the beginning until the end but was too short.
Ever since David Zucker took over the franchise it seems to have gotten less gross out funny and, well, less funny in general.
The Scary Movie parody wagon has been rolling since 2000, when the Wayans Brothers pooled their considerable comedic talents and came up with a kitchen sink flick that riffed on mainly horror movies Â with just a little Matrix thrown in.
Ever since he left the show, I haven't watched it as much.
I've watched the show on/off since the 1980's.
This film proves once more Roman Polansky as one of the greatest directors of our times, since he shows he is totally in control of every detail of direction (I enjoyed the increase of the speed together with the increase of intensity of the relationship among the couple).
`Bitter Moon' has been released in Brazil on DVD this week, and yesterday I watched it for the fifth or sixth time, since it is one of my favorites movies ever.
Why it didn't get greater exposure at the time or since baffles me, particularly as two of the principle characters have since become "famous" , Hugh Grant and Kristan Scott Thomas.
The biggest mystery is how Turner got top billing over Douglas, since he dominates practically every scene in the film and she only appears here and there.
Hollywood insider films have been made since the movie colony came out to the west coast.
I watched it on the telly just this afternoon and it had been a while since I had seen TBATB.
The movie portrays some people explaining how they used to be friends of producer Jonathan Shields (Kirk Douglas) but have since turned against him.
I know that we're all in total disbelief and are feeling furious and outraged since head writer, Hogan Sheffer, killed off John Black...speaking for myself, I never believed that DAYS would go through with this travesty and would actually fire Drake, but sadly, we can't undo something that has already been done.
Drake also talks about sleep deprivation since he found out that he is being forced to leave the show and how "It has been an incredibly difficult several weeks due to the disbelief, shock and then final acceptance and closure which is inevitable in any creative endeavor."
So much so, that 20 yrs since watching an episode when I saw the whole series on DVD for sale online I decided to order it.
I've been watching the show since 1987.
It has been too long since I have seen it!
And the camera work is nothing more than breathtaking, setting standards that have since become cliches.
I've been a fan of Days since the late 70's.
Everyone I know likes it, it was the first film I've seen since Notting Hill where you could sense the entire cinema were enjoying it (and people of all ages, colours, shapes and the like) and with a few more votes it should get some better marks & reviews.
I stumbled upon it by accident in 1999 on a school lunch break and have been hooked ever since!
Many of these folks are very recognizable because they've been the staple of English comedy since Shakespeare.
Well, definitely since the early cinema and the telly.
Anyway, since enjoying this show so much, I've put some time into the other Soaps, but this one seems in a higher class altogether.
(OK, sorry I haven't reviewed any movie for a really long time at IMDb--not since "Holes" last Independence season--but, here goes...)  In 2004, audiences were enchanted by one of the best animated sequels of all time, "Shrek 2", and later were wowed by the action-packed power of the superhero family, "The Incredibles"--and both were made in CGI.
This is a movie everyone should see, since it drives home only too clearly the lesson that freedom can never be taken for granted, that what happened in Nazi Germany or Fascist Italy could happen here too.
One of the friends is Giorgio (Lino Capolicchio) and he is in love with Micol Finzi-Contini (Dominique Sanda) and they have known each other since they both were kids but Micol does not love Giorgio.
There's just one hitch though-the FBI thinks Gus committed the crime, since they've no way of knowing that Gus has a twin brother.
I'd say this is probably one of the best episodes of the series - although, to be honest, still not even a patch on The Girl in the Fireplace, which is easily the best since the show was revived.
BUT since this is a PG-13 movie don't expect any nudity.
Where Jim has already confessed that he loves living at home since the accommodations are four star.
This could have been a wonderful impromptu, since Whaley is a natural riot, and Connely can hold her own.
And then there's Jennifer "Eternally Easy on the Eyes" Connelly who, yes, has her usual charms (both of them), but who manages to bring a degree of wit, grace and sincerity to the "girl next door anyone would die to get with" role that's rarely been matched since.
She is instantly caught off guard when Jim suggests a simple dance, one that he's been dreaming of since the 7th grade.
The plot has Joel McCrea in charge since all the officers have been killed and the men don't trust McCrea since he has such a deep hatred of the Indians, who killed his wife and kid.
The patrol movie has been a staple of cinema since its very early days and has cut across many genres including the war movie and ,as in this case,the Western.The setting is New Mexico in the late 1870's and a platoon of the US Cavalry is trying to make its way back to base under less than auspicious circumstances .Its officers are all dead ,killed in action by the Apache,and its leader,by default is Sergeant Vinson (Joel McCrae -cast in a rare unsympathetic role).Vinson is neither liked nor trusted by his men who believe that he is so embittered by the death of his wife at the hands of the Apache that his judgement is flawed and that he will risk their lives for his own revenge .His bellicose attitude seems to reinforce this belief as he orders an attack on a superior force of the enemy as they camp by a waterhole ,with heavy loss of life.This is not the only encounter with the enemy as he and his men take shelter at a seemingly abandoned adobe dwelling where he is besieged by the Apache.
It has been years since I have seen this movie and I have been looking for it for a long time.
I think he knew he was making a bad movie, and since it generally took him years and years to finish his films, by the time this one was near completion, he just didn't care anymore and wanted to finish it up.
(The letter "Uncle Forry" sent me has apparently been lost in the three-decade shuffle since, but it was one of my most prized possessions for years.)
That night, i fell in love with miss Regina Carrol and have been a fan of hers ever since as well as a fan of her husband, director, Al Adamson.
I first saw this movie three years ago and I have been in love with it (and Stanley Kubrick) ever since.
I must say, it's been quite a while since I saw something so full, spectacular, exhausting and powerful.
And honestly, at its worst, you can feel that old Haggis hackery popping up in Elah more than a few times, most notably in that final shot, which is the worst final shot of a film since John Sayles' Silver City.
This is a movie about, not the U.S. Army, but the Hollywood Army; that is, the Army as Hollywood has seen it since the 60's.
How much have the USA changed since the war in Iraq began?
He's an actor I've admired since Men in Black (really!
Loosely based on the story of Richard Davis who was killed by fellow soldiers in Columbus, Georgia after returning from Iraq in 2003, In the Valley of Elah, Paul Haggis' first feature since his Oscar winner Crash is a poignant reminder of how war robs people of their humanity.
He is has become such an empty shell that even his sensual nature has long since gone, such is the life of a Yakuza warlord.
Billy Crystal(not to my surprise)knew exactly what he was doing for the movie and made it to be the best baseball movie I've seen since Field of Dreams(no offense to Rookie of the Year,Little Big League or the first two Major League movies).
The Yankees were awesome that year, like I've never seen them before or since, not even the recent teams with Joe Torre as manager.
Ever since then his nurse Sharona Fleming,(played by Bitty Schram) has been taking care of him.....
It is the first Peanuts television special since 1993, and I was interested to see if it would be any good.
I found it odd that they made a Valentine's Day special, since there already was one, a good one, back in 1975.
Charles Schulz requested (though since he did not hold the copyright to Peanuts he could not demand) that no one create any new Peanuts stories after his death.
And since that young man was a famous hacker with an unhealthy interest in conspiracies, the movie has got to be about conspiracies, right?
It is a nice criminal detective comedy since all ends well that had started very grimly and so bad.
And since death is such a grim concept that everyone --- everyone, right?
There is a recurring set device of a closet that just won't stay closed which seems to have caused some confusion as to its meaning, and I have a feeling that, since there is never anything actually hidden in it, it is a metaphorical thing that points to one of the underlying themes of the film, that of guilt.
The movie just never becomes tense, also since you just simply couldn't care less for any of the characters, which is mostly due to the acting performances from its actors.
Sometimes I like Adam Baldwin in his roles but main problem with Baldwin (no relation to the Baldwin brothers) is that ever since his "Full Metal Jacket" he thinks he can just play a psycho in every movie and that he can get away with just everything.
It's also of course a fairly predictable movie, also since it just isn't the most renewing or original one around.
Richard Ruccolo is great as Michael Blake, and it was great to see him again since his show went off the air.
I've seen the miniseries at least five times since then, when it's be re-run on various cable channels.
I Watched it again for the first time since I saw it on TV, and was impressed.
I usually have higher tolerance with sequels since we both know how hard it is to make a good sequel,but this one is TOO AWFUL TO TOLERATE under any circumstances.
I actually felt bad for Luke Mably since he's such a hottie.
and since when all this drama's story based on power game and politics ?
He became known as the Werewolf Of Allariz because his defense against these charges was that he could not control his animal urges since he was in fact a werewolf.
One character in the film, Antonio, was never actually proved to have existed since he was never found.
Also, the ending merely provides a possible explanation since the truth of the matter is unknown to anyone.
Heather Graham, William Baldwin, Dominic Chianese and Victor Rasuk (who I have loved ever since Raising Victor Vargas) all give multi-dimensional performances.
I would summarize this movie as 'One guy fells in love with the one he took care since she was a baby and is lost in his daily live'.
Marcos, who may or may not be guilt-ridden about the infant's death (it's anybody's guess, since all the actors have clearly been directed to refrain from anything resembling emotional expression), tells Ana about the kidnapping and she encourages him to turn himself in to the police.
I watched this movie like months ago and have remembered it ever since I began to try and hunt down the actor that played Manuel!
Each time I see it, since 1986, I always get choked up.
i can't watch this movie without becoming totally entranced and still think about my lost love often...the music is just beautiful and so moving and joe brooks is funny and charming...shelley hack is very lovely and does a great job with her winning smile and poignant tears as she says goodbye instead of goodnight in LA...  well, i'm going back East in March and we'll see if maybe one can go back again...i may even move there, since i can't seem to get him out of my heart...it's been a part of me since i was 16 and the strangest thing is the movie came out a few months after i met him in Disneyland and i flew back to Boston to see him shortly thereafter...we've been trying ever since off and on...
Also it again pairs Truffaut with actress Lafont, the two hadn't worked together since his and her first film 13 years before.
Bernadette Lafont stars as Camille, the imprisoned woman who has had bad luck since childhood( and she does not help her causes along the way at the most inopportune times), shines and carried this movie the entire way.
It's been a while since I acquired a headache from a movie.
I've enjoyed every major computer animated Pixar and Dreamworks film that I've seen since, well, Toy Story.
)I was quite intrigued to see this,since this was a project that was going to be a combination of two elements that interest me:animation and Seinfeld(both the show and his stand-up).
This movie is by far the worst thing to come out since cats and dogs.
Her turn here is far superior to anything Oscar nominated this year and probably the best from an American actress since Hilary Swank in Million Dollar Baby.
Robbins comes home to a wife who wants a divorce and a son who needs $20,000 for college, Pena suffered a wound that has made him impotent and McAdams lost her friend and wants to find his family in order to return his guitar and live with them since she's lost any ties with her own.
I've loved old movie ever since I was a kid.
I'm assuming that this is a tale well known in Korea where this is from since this is at least the second version of the story and there is a note at the end about further outcome.
The great locations help a bit, but since Chuck Norris isn't' exactly "The Action Star", then this is definitely not "The Movie" (ha-ha).
I've been a fan of John Dye, since his performance in Touched By An Angel on TV and when Once Upon A Christmas first premiered on family channel it looked like a charming Christmas movie.
I bought the recording in 1956 and have been playing it every Christmas since.
This goes to such an extent that it has been repeatedly claimed that Feyder had intended an allegory of the Dutch's collaboration with the German occupier in WWI Â and from today's perspective, one is tempted to grant it visionary power as well, since substantial parts of the Flamish-speaking population of Belgium were eager supporters of Nazi rule.
training but don't quote me on that  The second dummy sequence is the bad guy's death (not that that can count as a spoiler since it was clearly going to happen, this is the 'Nature of Die Hard' for crying out loud!).
Another great but interesting thing about this game is how you never really communicate with Agro, but you somehow form a bond with him since he's really all that you have.
Also profiled is an interesting woman who won this tournament once but hasn't been close since.
'Wordplay' is the best documentary I have seen since 'The Fog of War' and this came as a complete surprise.
I haven't cheered out loud at a movie since I was a kid and allowed to do so in a theater.
At his post since 1993, he has dramatically transformed the puzzle from an often frustrating, intellectualized exercise full of obscure clues to a more broad-based challenge that embraced popular culture and word games.
Also, it appears the concept may have started off as a stage play since the action is mainly confined to Jeff & Nancy's dingy apartment.
At first it seems like Maria might be able to use this to her advantage, but since Torq is so psychotically religious that he thinks any human emotions are the work of Satan, things just get more complicated and intense from there.
I saw this for the first time when I was six or seven, and the memory of it really stuck with me, since we didn't have too many TV programs in Romania, back then.
The DVD comes with an excellent director's commentary(albeit sans Caro, since he does not care for them), two featurettes that I will review on their individual pages here on the site, a teaser, a trailer and a photo gallery.
Why must every Hong Kong film since CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON be compared to it?
I have just watched Miike Takashi' film Visitor Q, tonight, and i think that it is one of the most insane and disturbing films that i have ever seen, since Ichi The Killer another of Miike's films I almost found it too shocking to watch parts of it because of the film content.
Since this child abuse started when Judy was in her early teens, and since the U.S. government ALWAYS has applied censorship and kiddie porn laws RETROACTIVELY, the availability of Louie's exploitation films all over the internet (and even in the local "Family Video" store) makes a mockery of the American penal code.
Not only is he the finest character actor of his generation - perhaps even the finest since James Stewart - his Italian background which he has portrayed so well in films in the past such as his 2 Oscar winners, The Godfather Part 2 and Raging Bull, comes through excellently, and adds much credibility to the role.
The great nature vs. nurture debate gets a big vote for nature since Judy caught lightning in a bottle with her talent but her sisters never were close to her level.
Obviously, the Hollywood producers didn't trust the film-making skills of the "Blair Witch" creators, since, they both have been virtually inactive in the new millennium so far.
Thus, it also confirms my impression upon viewing the "The Blair Witch Project", namely, that its strength comes from its fraudulent direction, since, there was no direction at all.
And since none of the imagery, dialog or plot element is particularly engrossing, we can't take a "mind trip" as if this was a Lynch movie either, because use symbolism in this film is weak and immature.
"Believers" is an above average B-movie with a very intriguing story, but also flawed since there are some points that are not well-explained or developed.
The weird thing is that since things went belly-up in the cat house when the ghouls revealed what they were, the entire population of the town apart from the Sheriff has vanished.
Where did these people come from, since it started with a mere 7?
Unless I missed something, which is possible since I had no problem going to the fridge without pausing this waste of time, I only counted 2 mummies.
Although, drowning out the dialog may have been a good thing since the dialog itself was dull and repetitive.
Don't get me wrong, I'm a HUGE fan of horror and have been since near birth.
Love low-budget films since they nearly all contain the raw, gritty edge that Hollywood films almost always lack.
Oh and unsurprisingly the film gets comes to a halt which led me to believe the last ten minutes ended up on the cutting room floor   DOWNTIME is a very ironic film since its often revolves a lift .
Titling it, "The House of Usher" is appropriate since there is no Fall.
He and his sister Maddie, her best friend when the three of them were at college together, disappeared suddenly from her life several years ago and she had not heard from either of them since.
I think I found the movie and if I am right this take place on Christmas a boy was bothered and chased by boys from his class in school and they chaseed this boy into an abandon building while he found a stray cat and he took car of the cat by feeding it and taking care of the cat and then 1 day the kids from his class happen to do something to him at the cat and somehow at the end of this movie this boy ended up having a cat at his home  this movie i saw when I was a little boy in camp and I also saw it on hbo cinemax but I never knew the name and I been asking lots of people until now and I think this movie is the movie I been trying to look for years and I thought it came out in the 1970's since it is in color.
I have not seen it since it first aired and I was an 8 year old living a life similar to that boy in the movie.
I loved this movie since my family loves cats and I remember how it broke my heart when the kitty got killed.
I have not seen it since it first aired and I was an 8 year old living a life similar to that boy in the movie.
None of this films impact has been lost since I viewed it as a 10 yr old child.
I cried like a baby seeing it for the first time since 1969/70 The price is steep at $54.00 post paid,(VHS)no DVD available.
I remembered the main points though, the little boy who lived with his mother, nursing a homeless cat back to health in an abandoned building before and after school, the tragedy that happens, the saddest moment on TV since the Martins forced Timmy to give up Lassie to move to Australia in "Timmy and Lassie", (both of these tug at the heart strings and bring a tear to the eye) and the 'turn around' happy ending.
And Marisa Tomei, his long suffering girlfriend, creates a character so coarse, blunt, likable and drop dead gorgeous, I haven't seen her equal since.
"My Cousin Vinny" isn't the great court room drama because it's filled with things that are simply against the rules of court, but since the film is told in such tongue-and-check fashion, it simply adds to the great on-screen chemistry of the actors involved and themes of the film.
I'm not a big fan of comedies since the premise usually over stays it's welcome by at least half an hour , but screenwriter Dale Launer has crafted a very funny , well paced script that succeeds because of the amount of obstacles for the characters .
While Laurel and Hardy had begun to decline since hitting an-all time peak in 1937 (Way Out West), this was still only four years on, and just a year after the reasonably amusing A Chump At Oxford.
Marie and Fernando agree in letting them stay with them for a while, something that Anna doesn't appreciate since her cousin only speaks Spanish.
We have not read the novel which served as the basis of the film, which is misleading, since one expects to refer to a Cuban situation, when in reality, the DelaMesas work to help the regime of Chile's former president Allende.
ANALYZE THIS / (1999) ***    It has been a long time since I have seen a comic duo form a better shtick than Robert DeNiro and Billy Crystal in the mob comedy "Analyze This," a smart, amusing satire from director Harold Ramis ("Multiplicity," "Groundhog Day").
Ruffalo is a funny kind of brother for Bloom, since he's always rumpled-looking.
The Brothers Bloom is one of the best films to be released this year, which is a shame since it seems to have a limited release.
This helps since the characters all work with their respective players, more or less.
Less with Ruffalo, who grew on me as the film went on, mainly towards the end (his last scene, without spoiling much, is a keeper for his extended reel), since he's meant to be conniving and devilish but doesn't really fit in even as he's good at delivering the lines and countering Brody and Weisz.
The younger, Bloom, has been playing the roles written by Stephen since they were children, always embodying the character so easily because it allowed him to be that which was not himself.
I saw this movie by accident and i love it since.
The Walsh parents showed up at the very last second to remark how James Eckhouse lost his hair and to bellow how everyone grew up (like they didn't already know it since half the cast is still bumming around in showbiz).
Its hard to believe that its been ten years since Brandon, Brenda, Dylan, Kelly, Steve, Andrea, Donna and David graduated High School.
The plot is about as unoriginal as it gets and since there's virtually no dialogue, the director has to torture you with excruciatingly insipid new age music for the entire duration of the movie.
He picked her up when she was 10, and looked after her onboard ever since.
An Sixty year old man lives on a fishing boat in the middle of the sea with a young girl (Both characters are never named) who he has taken care of since she was six, and will soon turn sixteen.
The story centers around a man in his sixties who has been raising a young girl since childhood on a ship that floats unanchored off Korea's western coast.
It was the first feature film made entirely in Chicago since the Essanay era before WW1.
The game play is easy to pick up since their isn't any combos instead you press one button to punch and another for a different attack, Story mode has you playing as the Marvel heroes doing a number of missions.
(It was actually filmed in Southern Utah(Hurricane) - I went to the school they attended - its been torn down since) I was fascinated by the fact I had never HEARD of this movie.It was outstanding.
It is far better than "Stand By Me" since the boys in this movie are better role-models.
I brought my husband to see it since he has a non-commercial pilot's license.
Sizemore was the most likable wise guy since Tony "What's His Name."
It's been a while since I've seen a film done this well and how refreshing considering the garbage that they consider films nowadays.
I should have known it would be bad since it starred Hulk Hogan, but I was not prepared for just how bad it was.
Ever since I was a kid, I have loved this movie!
The Best Hulk Hogan Movie though, since he didn't give many good ones.
I won't summarize the movie, since other comments have dealt adequately with it.
It had been a while since I really saw him perform anything close to his Aikido moves.
"Mercenary for justice"- surely a candidate for oxymoron of the year -is the first Stephen Seagal movie I have seen since the excellent "The Foreigner" and I am disappointed to report that the dear boy has let his love for the folding green overcome his artistic sensibilities once more.What are you like,Steve?
Matt... uh, sorry, Luke Goss owns the few scenes that he's in, but there's just not enough of them to save this movie, and they're irrelevant anyway since Seagal is playing his usual immortal Myrmidon Let's give Goss the last word though: "This is unbelievable," he opines, and there's not much to disabuse that notion here.
Steven Seagal has come out with an array of DTV titles since 2003's The Foreigner and none since then have been very successful in winning over many action fans.
All in all, MFJ is an great, fun action movie and Steven Seagal's best since Into The Sun.
However, after slight improvements in the films "Into the Sun" and "Black Dawn" I have to say "Mercenary for Justice" is his best film since "Half Past Dead".
It had been a while since I really saw him perform anything close to his Aikido moves.
The plot is ridiculous and silly and most of it doesn't make a lick of sense, but since when did it have to in a Seagal movie?
"Beneath" is a horror flick released straight to video and marks the directorial debut of Dagen Merrill, co-written with Kevin Burke (who also wrote 2003's "Tahiti", an indie drama that earned some critical praise).Christy Wescot (Nora Zehetner, "Brick") is a 20-year-old pre-med student who cannot fully live her own life since her older sister Vanessa (Carly Pope, "Sandra Goes to Whistler") was killed in a car accident six years earlier, in which Christy was driving.
Now Christy's niece lives in the Locke family home with dad and her grandma, the ominous Mrs. Locke (Gabrielle Rose), whom her cute red-haired granddaughter calls a "weirdo", and she is indeed, since she disappears from the dinner table and prefers to eat alone in her place.
I'm pretty sure that helped my enjoyment of the film since I had no preconceived notions for it.
Exactly how this is possible is a mystery since you destroy the syndicate on your way to Mr. X, but never mind.
One thing about the movie that I noticed was the amount of smoking done in the movie, probably as much as any movie made since the fifites.
(It was hearing the Satie that triggered the comparison for me, since -- as above -- I've been using the absence of his music from Moulin Rouge as an indicator of the shallowness of its approach to its setting.)
she's only in the film about 25 minutes but those scenes radiate an eroticism that has been unmatched by any film since.
But again, this can't be counted against the film since its focus is Anais.
Historically, this film was the first with that rating-- the MPAA created the rating specifically for this film since they deemed it to risquÃ© for an R. By today's standards, this film is an R. If you're looking for softcore, watch "Emmanuelle" or something.
she's only in the film about 25 minutes but those scenes radiate an eroticism that has been unmatched by any film since.
Oddly bland are the romantic leads, although their characters put them at a disadvantage, since every one else is over the top.
Writer/director, Kevin Jordan based his film upon his real family that has been in the seafood business in New York since 1938.
Frank Giorgio, the owner of a lobster place in Brooklyn is facing the possible loss of the business that has been in the family since the 1930s.
It's a story written and directed by Kevin Jordan, who evidently knows what he is talking about, since it appears it has some biographical slant to it.
I don't know why Danny Aiello hasn't had more leading roles before this, and I was impressed by Jane Curtain in a drama since she's really only been in comedies, like SNL.
I have seen this show when I was growing up and I liked it very much  Here in my country, the most of TV series of America came in under some format almost without any delay since decades ago.
The very premise of the film is fascinating, and though we've seen the "old-time hero in the modern world" premise before and since, this is one effort that really delves into the potential of that idea.
A welcome surprise is the appearance of veteran Hollywood star Mel Ferrer (as Gastoni's wheelchair-bound cynic of a husband) who adds some much needed dignity to the proceedings; while he had been appearing sporadically in Italian films since 1954, interestingly, his role here does not feel like a mere "meal ticket" Â unlike some of his other Italian film work of the period, namely THE ANTICHRIST (1974), THE VIOLENT PROFESSIONALS (1975), etc.
I do suggest to get this movie and to enjoy it since it's really a nice touch in our collection.
We haven't spoken since," Gilda tells George, who begins to pout.
kind of sad klaus koch hasn't made another movie since.
Of course nothing wrong with this, since it definitely makes the movie an entertaining and bit of adventurous one.
But in this case the approach doesn't really work out, since it also obviously is a movie that wants to be taken seriously and has a clear message in it.
I found that I had long since forgotten all the flashy aspects of the plot (the cannibals, the machine gun and the sex slavers), but remembered the courtship ritual very clearly.
It seems that since that is all they had to eat at times, they were somehow "infected" with a need to continue with this bad habit.
Well since I doubt many have an uncut version on VHS lets talk about the DVD it is loaded with the European trailer Japanese Teaser.
There were more outlets for frustration and rage in 1980, and horror went-to-bat, since catharsis is one of its best-features.
Unfortunately, since the infected aim to kill and eat their victims, opportunities to spread the disease are rare, and the outbreak burns itself out quicker than you can say "Ebola."
As usual with Hammer, the production values are low; but usually it doesn't matter as you can forgive the film for it, and even like it, depending on the film; but here, since the rest of the film is so bad; it's hard to forgive the bad production values.
My mother stumbled across it some time ago and recorded it for me claiming she had watched it over a decade ago and it stuck with her since.
The room has not been opened since.
And since the movie is based on a mystery written by Hugh Wheeler (under the pseudonym of Patrick Quentin), we have a story of uncomfortable psychological possibilities with at least two believable murder suspects and a story that, to my way of thinking, is satisfying and a bit sad.
She's not even in the list of suspects, since she was thousands of miles away from New York during the whole murder affair.
Does anyone really remember that its initial premise was the awakening of a young man who had been in a coma since his late teens?
However, the plot is the least important feature in this series, since it's mostly based on its humor.
Javier CÃ¡mara and Guillermo Toledo are sorely missed since they decided to leave the series, but new faces like Santi MillÃ¡n or Santi Rodriguez have managed to keep viewers stuck to their TVs.
It provides the movie with some tense sequences between the killer and Lt. Columbo, since Columbo is obviously somewhat reluctant at first of making accusations against such an highly respected man, that also above all things is his wives favorite candidate.
So, this is all looking very weird, and the local sheriff, Loomis (Randy Quaid)is not really concerned, since it seems that it's only Packard's gang this killer is hitting.
Essentially a revved-up sci-fi version of High Plains Drifter with 80s teens and the cute young spirit of vengeance driving the Mad Max Interceptor instead of riding into town on a horse, The Wraith is one I've remembered fondly since first seeing it on Monstervision with Joe Bob Briggs in the 90s.
I have loved this movie since the first day I saw it.
You would expect that, after time, my enthusiasm would diminish, especially since I have no interest in ever visiting the Amazon!
This movie is totally innovative, nothing like it before or since and there are a lot of techniques used in this movie that I haven't seen bettered since.
Then I watched "Dead Life" and realized that may just be the biggest crock since the "Weaopns of Mass Destruction" excuse.
What instead happens is the viewer gets attacked by flaming egos not seen since "Brown Bunny," I can only assume the script writing process involved asking a depressed 15 year old to recant what he would of done in his moments of social failure, whilst mixing in lines rejected from "Mall Rats".
Ganryu even goes so far to point out Kung Pow had a $10,000,000 budget and Ninja Bachelor Party did not - which is ironic since this was my entire point in the first place - Kung Pow was annoying to begin with, so just imagine how much more annoying seeing the same thing is on a shoestring budget.
The plot needn't detain us - the one about the babe magnet who either wagers himself or else his colleagues wager on his behalf that he can seduce (in the early 40s and The Fleet's In, the GI only had to KISS the girl to win the bet) a girl selected at random by a given date has been around since they were writing with papyrus - because it's Style not Content we've come to see and we don't go away frustrated.
Early cinematic psychological study about the mind and it's deepest secrets and how they come to the surface when we least expect them to Which makes the movie "Strange illusions" a unique movie for it's time, 1945, and as far as I know has never been duplicated since.
The dialogue and connection which Pablo and Malena established together magnetizes the full attention from the viewer, since their body language and gestures were complementary with the screenplay.
I must say I've been at this since I was 10 years old...watching horror films...reading Fango...searching for those lost treasures...after years of seeing horror films everything starts to blur and become the same old thing...stories retold, murders recreated..scares duplicated...Basically, you realize that there is not much new or novel out there...ghosts, monsters, zombies...psychos...that's about all.
I picked this up at the rare video store on VHS since it seems it's not very well known or even on DVD.
The correspondent in Budapest Â Prof. Roth Â hasn't been heard of in a long time and, since his input is particularly fundamental, Alan is assigned to travel to Hungary and meet up with him.
Which is a pity since the young girl is showing signs of becoming a good actress.
The time period in which it was set ought to have clued in the filmmakers that a little dirt was in order, since people rarely to never bathed.
It has been at least fifteen years since I saw a movie so bad that I nearly walked out on it (I did, in fact, walk out on 'Short Circuit 2').
While watching this movie you just have to think and feel like a child again, since this is also the target group the movie got aimed towards.
I have no idea why anyone would like this on anything but a technical level since the plot, which I've finally been able to erase from my mind only thanks to years of very expensive therapy.
Its just a bit of a boring ride since there is really nothing exciting about the film.
Rob Minkoff seems to have lost his touch after making The Lion King since his last two kid films have been average at best.
I relaxed in front of the TV tonight, and started to watch "The Other Me", The idea of having an identical duplicate of the main character, that they only know about has been around since Disney first made "The Parent Trap".
As a result, this film will probably have more appeal to Long Islanders since Mendelsohn, was successful at giving it a genuine Long Island look and feel.
This entire movie just ticks me off, especially since it took money and good special effects people away from GOJIRA (1984).
Olivier Gruner (Finally I can go back to reviewing other movies, since this wraps up my turkey binge)stars as a gym instructor who's past jumps out of the bushes and bites him in the ass.
You bet we need'em in this,sometimes,too serious world being materialistic (and look where that did go since last year).
The sexual element is surprisingly minimal, not as much nudity as you'd think a film of this storyline would have, but since it's not really an exploitive film, having less breasts to gawk at works in its favor.
This upsets him a lot, since it's supposed to be his day off ("You know what the worst part is?
Especially since I rule.")
While the women's tolerance of their men's quirks is saintly, at least they are not portrayed as total bitches, though this is a somewhat cynical reunion for Pantoliano and Jennnifer Tilly since "Bound."
It is easy to understand why Denys McCoy dropped out of sight after "The Last Rebel," since he couldn't stage suspenseful action scenes.
This is the only surprising thing about "The Last Rebel," since the Pearl character had done nothing wrong.
I will not bother with a plot description of L'Iceberg, since that has been done adequately by a previous reviewer.
This was the first movie I saw with Kurt Russell, and have been a fan of him ever since.
It was my first encounter with Cronyn, and I've been a fan ever since.
Yes, since the plot *absolutely*required* that the female lead wander about the castle and its exterior in either a towel wrap, a negligee, or nothing at all.
I had been trying to get hold of this one ever since watching Renato Polselli's THE REINCARNATION OF ISABEL (1973) Â to which it has been compared in terms of sheer loopiness; in the meantime, I had actually checked out another Batzella movie i.e.
It also has a spider attack, which has to be the most laughably fake monster I've seen in a film since possibly "Horrors of Spider Island".
Even though the time since I watched this piece of cinematic history fades away I feel compelled to document my personal experience with the motion picture.
I have been looking for this film since I first saw it in 1989.
Amy's moronic friends think the coach is great since he buys them wine and lets them drive his truck...too bad, Amy!
The principal of Amy's school can't/won't do anything, since he's a limp noodle who doesn't want to get crosswise with the popular coach, and since the football team is more important than any girl who's being traumatized by a teacher....too bad, Amy!
The coach's wife must sleep like a hibernating bear, since the coach wanders his house at midnight and leads poor Amy off to some empty bedroom for some "extra credit".
This movie could have been A LOT better, since the subject deserves a better rendering.
I remembered Mr. Sewell vaguely from "Hamlet," and have longed to see Mr. Fiennes in a film since "Shakespeare in Love," but never remember seeing Ms. Potter in anything, and I am sure that I never seen Mr. Hollander before.

i was interested in this one since i dont' know a lot about John Lennon's early life, and now that the Beatles are all hype again, i made it a point to see this.
One can understand the teenage John Lennon's attitude towards society, especially since his love of rock 'n' roll fueled his political views.
I haven't seen so much running since Run Lola Run, however, in that movie there was a purpose to all that running.
The answer is the pretty mysterious case of bodybuilder Sam Pasco, who seem to have appeared out of nowhere and then disappeared (having never acted in a film since) even though he really isn't bad at all in this movie.
When this went out recently on tv I actually thought the scene with Moore addressing his troops was a clip from a Python movie that I had missed out on... if you think movies have not improved since the eighties have a good look at this turkey....
Actually since every rom-com follows that exact plot sketch, they are more derivative than Disturbia to Rear Window because Caruso takes a premise, updates it, and makes it his own.
I am a fan of Shia LaBeouf, ever since his "Even Stevens" days, and knew he could give it credibility.
It's his third run in with the law since his father died in a car accident a year earlier.
Somebody is wrong, and since nobody shares his opinion, he has to escape to Hongkong from the forced mental treatment.
Marc (Vincent Lindon) is a handsome middle aged man married to AgnÃ¨s (Emmanuelle Devos) for fifteen years and one morning, in what in retrospect is in response to a bit of relationship ennui, decides to shave off his mustache which has always been present since his marriage began.
These "dudes," who probably just graduated from Tisch, treat him like he is the greatest thing since sliced bread just cause his multiple personality disorder somehow gave him the vision to perpetuate complete excrement, which is considered to be artistic mastery by his cult following.
Maybe this is the flaw in the plot, since the guy indeed was a disgusting traitor of his country for money.
In timeline A he never grew one, in timeline B he always grew one since he could.
"Lake Mungo" is by far the best since "Blair Witch".
In their twisted way of thinking, they figured since they've eaten all the cheese they could eat, there is nothing left to live for, so they write a suicide note stating "Goodbye cruel world.
Directed by Gordon Flemyng this late 60's crime heist action thriller is unfairly rather obscure but is worth the effort to track a copy down, although you can compare The Split to The Italian Job (1969) since they are both 60's heist films The Split was made & released a year before.
The character's are also very good with each member of the gang having a distinct personality & getting at least a few minutes screen time to develop it although McClain is hard to like as the lead character since he only seems interested in serving himself.
RAIN was considered (in the early 1930s) the greatest stage play since Shakespeare's HAMLET.
The subject of her profession is handled tastefully, but frankly and with humor: in referring to a friend's marriage to a sister fille de joie, the quartermaster remarks that they initally met "illegally" and goes on to say that since they met seeing each other at their worst, they can appreciate seeing each other at their best.
I love the dark, disturbing settings of the dilapidated Victorian house (long since demolished).
I saw this about 14 years ago in a stroke of luck ( a local TV station had picked up a print, and my mother, horror buff that she is, decided to tape it), and the film has stuck with me ever since.
Set in an eerie graveyard lodgehouse and with Alan Webb as their grubby father this brilliant film has gained cult status since its release over 30 years ago and is the only film I can watch - and enjoy - repeatedly.
The scenes can be unsettling and a bit disturbing since you do not quite fully know if he is in his mind or in ours.
Architect Marc (Vincent Lindon) has had a moustache since he was knee high to a blueprint and it is, he feels, part of him, then he takes it into his head to speculate on just how much he is identified via the moustache.
He starts by asking his live-in lover Agnes (Manu Devos) whether she would still fancy him sans moustache; since she's only known him with it she can't answer.
My 9 year old hasn't been able to go to sleep in his own bedroom for the 2 nights in a row since seeing this movie.
My 7 yr old had some issues" with it as well the first night but has since resolved them after considering the whole of the film.
Welcome to this year's most abstruse film, and eventually the most challenging psychological experiment since 'The Machinist'.
This question mark is totally appropriate, since it clearly illustrates what kind of movie 'La Moustache' really is: namely a confusing, puzzling drama with an open ending and a number of unexplainable twists, flashbacks and mysterious appearances by characters when you least expect it.
Ever since he invested a couple million dollars in "Battle Beyond the Stars" he's been making zero budget sci-fi and action movies re-using the same footage.
Hello,I just wanted to say that I loved the movie,the ending with the duet song was just great,I cried.I love movies like that.I have been trying to find the movie to buy ever since I seen it,please tell me how I can order it.Thank you so much,God Bless.Naomi was just great in the movie and the young lady that sang with her has a great voice,I am surprised that I haven't seen a album out of her.It was as if it could be real life.All the actors and actress were just great.I have also seen Naomi in Touched by an Angel she does so good in movies like this.I cant wait to see more movies like this,thats what we need on TV more family stuff.
This is perhaps his best performance since "Never Cry Wolf" (1983).
Second of all, I don't know if there are branches of service in ST since they never mention it as far as I know, but a star base is basically territory.
On arrival the station's new commander, Benjamin Sisko, isn't too keen on his new assignment which is first since he lost his ship and his wife in a battle with the Borg three years previously.
Based on a space station near a stable wormhole leading through an inhabited inter-dimensional gateway into a different quadrant of the galaxy millions of light years away, DS9's aliens were REALLY alien, it's stories ranged from near-universal to personal in scope, and its characters and their relationships to one another were more intimately explored than before or since.
I must have seen at least 250 sci-fi movies since I was a child, ranging from old classics like Metropolis to '50s B-movies like Angry Red Planet to more modern post-2001 efforts like Star Wars, Aliens and The Fifth Element.
Ever since the first time I saw this movie, I have loved it.
I have loved this film since my childhood, and recently was on the verge of tears during one particular scene.
The story, the way it looks, the characters (especially how they've developed since the "main" Pan story), the feeling.
With the writing staff and cast of the excellent Animated Series, Batman: Mask of the Phantasm became the first Batman movie where Batman was not overshadowed by the villains since the Adam West era.
This Batman is the one from my childhood however it's been a long time since I don't watch an episode from the animated series and frankly I don't remember a lot of it.
This one does feel like a feature film; very soon there's a new problem for our Dark Knight since Chuckie Sol, a crime boss, has been killed and our hero is the one everybody is blaming of that killing.
Here we see again why Batman is quite unique since we see another person similar to Bruce Wayne.
I feel like I should write something more about it, there's definitely a lot of stuff I forgot since seeing it, but this was definitely an overlooked movie.
Omar ends up making excuses for Samir so he gets byÂbut the screenwriters cannot help but continually remind us (in the character of Samir) that the majority of Muslims reject violence (whether you agree or not with that idea, it just feels the point is made ad infinitum throughout the film perhaps in order to 'soften the blow' or 'balance things out' since the films' antagonists are indeed Islamic terrorists!).
A highly underrated actor who has hardly put a foot wrong since his days in the extremely naff Australian Soap Opera "Neighbours".
As usual with Coen Brothers films, it is brilliantly made, since they are a pair of dark geniuses who flicker eerily like a couple of coal fires glowing side by side in the half-light, chuckling impishly, perhaps devilishly, to themselves.
The Coen brothers seem to be the kings of Hollywood Indies, since they directed half of the ones I can name off the top of my head.
Burn After Reading will most likely be counted among the lesser of the Coen Brothers films, and rightly so since it does seem to lack the aesthetic appeal of their previous films, but I don't think this film should be counted as one of the their funnier films.
Yet the Invisible Pigeon Holeing Society must assign these films a genre, and since their not weird enough to be labeled surrealist or experimental, they get the title comedies simply because a few people in the theater may giggle a few of the "Jokes" in the film.
Actually this shouldn't come as a great surprise since he was equally hilarious as Mickey in Snatch and also as Jeffrey in Twelve Monkeys but this time he's funny in a completely different way.
As their first feature since "No Country for Old Men, "Burn After Reading" radiates barely a modicum of the customary Coen luminosity.
Anderson isn't totally convincing in the role, since some of his ghetto slang pops up even when he's not playing the part of a stereotypical black man from the hood, but he's still very funny.
However, I don't understand why Bo Derek took the role of his wife, since she barely has anything to do.
to whom this may concern ; i've seen the annihilator movie many time since it's release in 1986 .
Definitely should have been followed up, since we never learned if Chapman's girlfriend was alive (played by Catharine Mary Stuart) or how he would manage to convince the human race of the threats posed by the aliens.
I love it when the mice,the birds and the Fairy Godmother throw a party for Cinderella and The Prince, since it's the anniversary of when Cinderella put on the glass slipper, and married The Prince.
And, since the Fairy Godmother is frozen at the beginning of the movie, she must battle Tremaine's magic with nothing but her own wits.
I'm surprised Cher got an Oscar nomination for this, since I didn't really think her part was that great.
Apparently, when "Silkwood" came out, Mike Nichols hadn't released a notable movie since "The Fortune" nearly killed his career eight years earlier.
I have learnt a lot about Karen Silkwood and her life since the film, and along with Princess Diana, she is one of my heroines.
I've loved this movie since its first airing back in 1980.
I've been a Sleepy Hollow affectionado ever since i saw the animated Disney classic as a kid, and I suppose I've seen pretty much every version from TV, movies, and cartoons since the 1950's.
Ever since I saw this on tv many years ago, it has been my favorite Sleepy Hollow.
I have since purchased the video and watched it two or three more times, still loving it each time.
I had to give it a "10", and I hope you do too, since it is so much better than some of the films on the "top 250" list.
It has been quite a long time since I have viewed a film that told such a wonderful story so beautifully & in such a touching way.
I would really love a copy of it, I have been searching for a copy since my parents threw out the beta.
This movie was one of the best Aussie movies that I have ever seen and I have been looking for a copy of it ever since I was in a teenager but with no success, now I know why.
The film did make viewing on Channel 10 several years ago courtesy of movie host Bill Collins, and I was fortunate to dub a second copy.I have not seen it since.
:)  I've enjoyed watching it many times in the years since, & it remains one of my many coveted irreplaceable VHS tapes.
His mom does not approve, since she is just a country girl, so the love becomes forbidden love.
To be sure, films like this have been done since film began, but this is a great one.
Then at least the ones of us who have been trying to find this movie (I have been trying to find it since I saw it on TV) on VHS or DVD.
This person has since passed on , and now his family who retain the rights have declined to allow reproduction of this truly Aussie Icon Film.
After all, it has been 31 years since Woodstock.
i mean, since the sixties our society has bandaged itself up and learned some lessons about radical politics, and our country is still full of idiots.
I love it when they interview the people in this movie since it's a trip listening to them.
Nothing quite like it has ever been attempted since, and it may be the moon and stars may never line up quite the same way again.
I saw this in the theater during it's initial release more than once and have seen it at least a dozen times since.
This definitely is what music documentaries have used as the measuring stick to define themselves ever since.
As I have seen this many times since it first came out on in the theater and then on VHS, I now just fast-forward chapters on the DVD to the music, enjoying my favorite performances in this epic documentary of the most famous rock concert of all time.
The man who has said nothing but Hello since 1977, comes alive in what is without question, the funniest 'crazy' character to come out of the silver screen, .er...ever.
The camera canÂ´t get enough of Nastassja Kinski which is understandable since she is gorgeous.
But since I'd never seen an Australian film & I like Australian accents, I figured it would be a decent way to kill an hour & a half.
Followed his career since his first movie "Class" - lots of sex scenes in that movie!!!!!
ever since that show finished there's been a much need of something that measures even halfway.
My friends have talked about this show since it was on, but I figured since i missed the first season it would be hard to get into it, but I was wrong.
Dennis O'Keefe is a wonderful lead as the sleuth figure; in fact, the film is actually more of a thriller since the murders do not have a basis in the supernatural (as was the case with the previous two Lewton/Tourneur collaborations).
These delightful economies, however, may have more to do with RKO than Mr. Lewton, since Julia Dean's Victorian chairs may also be spotted in the non Lewton productions, "Beware My Lovely" and "Experiment Perilous."
While being well paced (since it just clocks over the hour mark), it plays more like separate little stories or set pieces to the bigger picture.
If you're watching for the second reason you'll be bitterly disappointed since there's very little on screen sex but if you're watching for the sensible reason you'll still be as disappointed as the voyeurs .
To be honest there maybe a bit too much of these building scenes since the film seems to slow down too much around the half hour mark.
Fair as some may say, several other directors have approached the matter increasingly (and) specially since the acclaimed '28 days later' by Danny Boyle and Zack Snyder's remake of 'Dawn of the dead'.
I absolutely loved this movie, it was one of the best apocalyptic movies since 28 Week Later, and furthermore, it was more of an isolated incident than a major epidemic.
I really haven't been this freaked out by a movie since The Shining (albeit I only first saw The Shining only a couple years ago, but still...)   Not to say there weren't some parts that could've been better.
But now I know why since this is a John Huges film.
that soundtrack is better than the movie itself in many ways, since the moral statement of the film, about the power of art to distort reality gets lost in the spectacle of the movie.
Out of many "disturbing" scenes, there was one scene that I found so profound that it has not left my mind since I watched this film last night.
But the set designs are the real star, not since Del Toro have I seen sets to beautiful.
Being his second film since the short animation that got Gil Kenan his career, and being such a step up from that, I am hugely excited to see what this fledgling director will be coming out with next.
The woman is acting so badly, that it can only be a parody of the clichÃ©s of porn too, since, Arraki surely knows how to get good actors and know how to direct them.
In fact, Noonan showed that he was a fine actor by stealing the last scene from Judy Garland in A Star Is Born when he tells her how pitiful she's behaving since Norman Maine had committed suicide, but there is one person in the line-dancers that's had a history that no one knows about.
These interludes pretty much stop the movie dead since any of the momentum thats been built up comes crashing to a halt.
I saw the film because a friend has recommended it very much to me six weeks ago and since that time she convinced me to see it.
Early scenes with therapists not wanting to let their patient out on his 18th birthday seem strange since there's no indication that the kid has been anything other than a model resident of the youth home.
I won't refer to the story or the subjects it's about, since none of that is necessary here.
Kyle's dad Michael Hunter, Andy Garcia,who should have known his problems and how serious they were since he's a collage professor in psychology, as well as threats people like Kyle all the time is so devastated by his son's death that he ends up leaving his wife Penny and daughter Selly, Chelsea Fields & Linda Cardellini,to live by himself since he couldn't face them anymore.
Hesitant at first Michael agrees to talk to Tommy who's about to be released since he's doing so well, psychology and is about to reach his 18th birthday,at the school.
Ever since being witness to this sleepfest, I've lost all faith in stuff on the Movie Network unless I've heard of it or sussed it out on this website before hand.
I haven't seen this film since 1982 but I still remember it fondly.
I had been hyping myself up a great deal for Lust, Caution ever since I first heard of the project, so I'm glad to say that it did not disappoint.
It's a true leading performance since she carries most of the film being in just about every minute of it.
Reportedly five years in the making, this enchanted, inspired production is perhaps not quite on the level of Disney's first-tier masterpieces (Pinocchio, Dumbo, Snow White and Fantasia), but a strong case could be made for it being the best film the studio has released since its 1991 premiere.
In the Disney cartoon/video game "Kingdom Hearts" series, Belle, Beast (now voiced by Robby Benson since "Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas" and "Belle's Magical World", even with a little help of some equipment and devices that they used in the 1996 film "Ransom" which starred Mel Gibson), Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, Chip, Wardrobe, and Prince (appearing at the "Kingdom Hearts II" end credits) cope with Sora, Donald Duck, and Goofy as Sora, Donald, and Goofy battle the Heartless, Nobodies, and the Orginization 13.
But for me the true version is the one I know since 1991.
This 1991 film, based on a Madame LePrince De Beaumont novel, is an absolute delight and marks a high point in Disney animation unmatched since the days of Dumbo and Pinocchio.
Even with all of the animated films that have come since the release of Beauty, I am struck by the polished clarity of the animation in that the background and its objects remain completely in focus in proportion to the objects in the forefront, as critics are still astounded today that young Charles Foster Kane playing in the snow is able to remain in focus through a window in proportion to Agnes Moorhead in 'Citizen Kane.'
I have watched it twice since.
The Beatles are still a very popular act (even though they haven't really performed together since 1970) and this movie helps to debunk the moptop myth and shows two and a half very creative musicians creating songs still that people still enjoy listening to.
I've been looking for this movie since I became a Beatles fan in the early 90's.
It's a great, funny, energetic scene that has since passed into legend, and rightfully so.
Michael Arlen's radio-serial detective returns for another movie mystery (actually, it's the Falcon's brother this time, with George Sanders having since exited from the role and his real-life sibling Tom Conway assuming his duties).
The Beatles almost on their own created intelligent pop/rock music, which imho has not moved on since 1969 where they left it.
There have been many excellent innovative and intelligent rock bands that have come and gone since, many borrowing and adapting from the Beatles back catalogue Â however I don't count the many cash-in rip-off bands such as Oasis.
Has anyone since not ripped them off at some point?
Apart from the quantum leaps in sound technology since then nothing of any lasting musical value has been added Â there has been no progression.
And for-by much is made of Paul and George's spat (with John acting as unlikely peace-maker) and the at times tired and dishevelled appearance of the guys themselves, there are many other revealing and rewarding vignettes, even before director Michael Lindsay-Hogg, corrals the band for three assured in-studio video performances (all, significantly, of Macca tracks) and then the great idea (since aped by the Stones and U2) of playing their new stuff live on Apple's roof, on a biting cold Jamuary day.
Having never seen any VHS copies of this last Beatles movie and since it will probably be a very long time before it gets on DVD, I was stoked when I found out YouTube had this uploaded since the later part of summer 2007 and it was still there.
It was a long time since I saw a movie showing how it could be for real by being a member of a subculture and actually I think the last time I was really OK with it's coverage must have been "Romper stomper" from 1994.
(Yes, I still have a copy of it on beta format) It is also kind of prophetic since the advancements in computer animation.
However, this man isn't easy to bring down, and since Betti is receiving no help from his fellow townsmen, the task of ending crime in Naples is left to our leading man.
Ever since then, I've watched his show almost every night.
In fact I am always checking to see if it comes on again but unfortunately I haven't been able to find it since.
Since the first time I ever watched LYC it has remained very special in my memory, so much so that since the recent re-run on UK TV I have come to write my first ever review regarding viewing or reading material.
'I've been doing nothing else since we first met.'
A typical low budget thriller/horror movie with a cast that doesn't bring much excitement to an experienced viewer, but then again not that bad either since none of them gave me the creeps.
The computer graphics did nothing for the film and the producer really didn't think it through, i mean the scale of the shark was just ridiculous and most of the film was in computer graphics i think in total there was bout half an hour that wasn't done by computer.You could only just tell the shark was swimming in the water and it kept blinking while it was "swimming" so since when did fish start to blink, and it was poorly made, i mean come on its the 21st century all the technology there is these days the director and the producer could have made it much better that even the shark in jaws looked more real then the Megolodon did!
It's probably more fruitful to see the movie as essentially a filmed play, since there are very few cinematic tricks and since all of these events and character development can be seen in "theater time."
There's a month since a basically mysterious guy named Joe comes daily at a bar, stays all day, drinks champagne and spends money on all sorts of whims; and in that bar, I say, in that particular bar, he happens to meet all sorts of peopleÂthe bar fauna, they all seem to like him, or at least respect and obey him.
It has been years since I saw the series on television but I remember it became the highlight of my week.
These really are some of the most disturbing notions made in any horror film i have ever seen since 'Alien'.
There never has been a movie like this before and there will never be one again, since the way of movie-making and story telling is so brilliantly unique of this movie.
We also get to see undoubtedly Jeff Goldblum's best performance playing Seth Brundle in not a too dissimilar way that Tom Baker played The Doctor in DOCTOR WHO though it's fairly obvious that when Brundle does gymnastics it's a body double since the camera never focuses on Brundle's face .
Why is it this film that will always be his REAL 'breakout', and not any of the others before or since?
It's been over 20 years since this movie was made, but the special effects are still amazing and the story is an entertaining - and disgusting - as ever!
Its central situation - that of a stranded group of people fighting the elements (in this case, the plague) and a dangerous enemy (the vampire-like Vorvoloka who saps their energies) - has been done to death since, but at the time it was still relatively fresh (and may well have been inspired by John Ford's classic Western STAGECOACH [1939], especially in the way the heroine is shunned by some members for her 'corrupting influence').
It keeps changing gears so that you never know what to expect - some viewers will be put off by this since it doesn't follow the rules of the majority of films.
It has stayed with me ever since.
I can't think of any other films that have done that before or since.
an American reporter covering the war and a Greek general (since he doesn't have an interpreter, MIGHT he not have some knowledge of the language?
But for some reason, I'm not too keen on Zac Efron, although all my friends think he's the best thing since Jesse McCartney.
The copy I have is old so the sound is really bad and since the movie was made in the late 1980s the video quality looks sort of fuzzy and out of focus compared to new DVDs.
I couldn't believe that it was so expensive to purchase since it is out of print for 5 years, but my husband had spoiled me this Christmas, after hearing my nostalgic story.
But it is funny, since you can see some references to HP's books.
But I haven't been able to find it since I was about ten years old, which was eight years ago.
I have seen this movie three times since its release, but if I'm to be honest the last two times were mostly because of miss Beckinsale.
This works out since he is able to vicariously experience her sexually and she is able to thereby serve the man she loves.
The best russian crime-ralate flick since Banditskij Piter!
Ever since the holiday special "A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving",first aired on CBS-TV in November of 1973,this was one of many "Peanuts" inspired specials that brings out the kid in all of us,but at the same time have a message in between the lines.
Every Thanksgiving they would show this at night time, since I was around 6-9 years old I couldn't stay up late to watch cartoons.
It is the most hilarious movie since THE BIG LEBOWSKY.
There's not much going on here, since both of them are like a lone functional character.
It's as though life has really ceased to have meaning for the Champ ever since he lost his championship status.
The script does not lose anything in the 70 plus years since its release.
And yet, I know what Paris is like, since I live in that city.
he's not a bad father by any chance, in fact he loves her daughter more than anything in the world, but he just dosen't know how to express his love for her properly so he becomes a bit distant from him This leads to Amelie having to retreat into her imagination to find people to talk to since her dad won't.
Compared to most other films "Amelie" (and I will stick to "Amelie" since "Le Fabuleux destin d'AmÃ©lie Poulain" is a bit long to write) is based on a rather ordinary and plain story everyone can relate to, but it is given to us in a very special kind of way, mixed with wonderful little subplots and an almost chaotic amount of details.
Some people I spoke to before seeing "Amelie" criticized it for being too childish and unrealistic, but I believe it is an essential part of the movie since Amelie herself is a very childish and imaginative young girl.
Jewel-like performances by such thespians as Barbara Everest as Madeleine's mother, Jean Cadell as Mrs. Jenkins the careworn landlady, Kynaston Reeves as a lugubrious Dr. Penny, Amy Veness as the sympathetic police matron Miss Aiken, John Laurie as the hypocritical Bible-spouting religious maniac and fanatic Divine rabble-rouser exhorting the crowd to condemn Madeleine, Edward Chapman as the worried Dr. Thompson, Moyra Fraser(more than HALF A CENTURY later, 55 years to be exact, in Dame Judi Dench and Geoffrey Palmer's "As Time Goes By" latest 2005 episode as one of the regulars, bumptious Penny, a role since 1993) as a spirited Highland dancer!
It's the best pick-me-up since Bounty (or, you know, whatever).
Miss Moore needs to find a way into the country since she doesn't have permission to enter the states.
I loved the trailer for this movie because it looked interesting and funny.I really liked the 2 leads Nick Nolte and Trevor Morgan.They work really well together and I could easily see them working together in other movies.I liked the relationship they built.Ray was estranged from his own son for reasons we don't know and David looked to Ray as a father figure since his own dad couldn't be there for him because of a disability.It isn't uncommon for males to bond this way whether it be platonic or not.Throughout history older men have often had younger male companions.Unfortunately society nowadays has to put their ugly spin on it and make assumptions.Even in the movie David's younger friends ridiculed him about spending time with the older ump even though there was nothing happening except they were developing a friendship and Dave was like a son to Ray, and I think Dave looked up to Ray and respected him and later obviously really cared about him.The only problem with this movie I had was their relationship was over as quick as it began, and it seemed there was way too much more that had to be done and said.I agree with what another person said about why even mention Dave's mother since she wasn't even in the movie period.None of her absence made sense and wasn't explained well or explored at all.Also the 2 kids turned out remarkably well for having a disabled dad and being abandoned by their mother.I didn't find that believable.And then there was this whole back story about Ray's past that got thrown in and also not explored.If these missing characters were in the movie it would be easier to understand the characters better and understand how they ended up being so broken.I mean for Chris'sakes!
I wish he had more than 23 days to shoot, since some of the photography is marginal, but some shots are just beautiful, especially the close-ups of the actors' faces.
Having greatly anticipating seeing this film since I'd first heard about it over a year ago, and knowing a bit about the story as well as the cast and crew, my expectations were admittedly a bit higher than usual.
The sound track is to die for, especially since it is an original score.
Because this movie was directed by a woman,this was a light screwball comedy..the story was simple,the comedy tame,lot of silly clichÃ©'s(especially for Sofi'a)and the acting was OK,though I was surprised at Sofi'a's comedy timing,since she never had any training at acting!
I donÂ´t think so, since almost every person of it speaks none other language but spanish (and I know it, because I've lived in California).
All characters were obviously very well written as a script , the actors ,all of them gave an outstanding performance, Adel Imam , radiant , witty & funny as ever;Nour el Sheriff made a come back..... it's been a while since I've seen him perform so well on the silver screen; Hend Sabry was lovely; Yousra just Radiant; Esaad Younes more than superb; Ahmed Bedier Wow.... he had the Egyptian Coptic genera nailed to the T; Ahmed Rateb as usual a gr8 performance although the part was too small for such a talent;Khaled Saleh a monster of acting A+ ; Soumaya el khashab a small role but with a lot of soul put into it.
Yakobean building was built by Hagoub Yakobean the greatest of the Armenians in Egypt in 1937, since then, different kinds and cultures of people lived in that building, Princes and Princesses, bashas, Rich and Tycons, foreigners, Officers of revolution, Ordinary people and even Jews.
BBC One actually transmitted this at 11 PM, since they believed that The Peacemaker was a film more deserving of the 9:00 slot.
Fifty years of living since seeing it -- no doubt -- will make it a different viewing experience.
It's been a few years since I checked to see if it's available now in any format.
A solemn, sombre echo from an era since long lost, which after the forgetful ravages of time still can like the bird of Phoenix rise from the ashes of oblivion to once again let its plumage shine with unprecedented respectability.
One assumes the part was created to afford a little feminine light relief, since the central character is -- inconveniently for the standard narrative curve -- already happily married as a young man when we first meet him, and omits to look elsewhere... At any rate, Niven-as-narrator is a charming scamp, and refreshingly the plot refrains from taking the obvious path of marrying him off to his 'snapdragon', R.J.Mitchell's formidable secretary Miss Harper.
The enclosing narrative device is clever in that Mitchell's fate is left carefully ambiguous at the start; since neither the contemporary audience nor modern viewers are likely to be familiar with the history of this 'back-room' figure, the ultimate outcome remains 'up for grabs', as it were, and the hero's choice an active one until the end.
Yet despite opposition he fought against not only the bureaucrats but a serious and life-threatening illness to design and build, what has been regarded since as the greatest fighter aircraft of all time, in preparation for a war he knew was coming and a crisis the rest of Britain chose to ignore.
Also since there is a crisis going on much of the dialog is actually news reports...
It's one of the most creative and bizarre ideas since "Becoming John Malkovich".
I need to comment on this movie since reading all of the other comments and knowing how many times I've seen this movie...I should say something.
(which is important when it comes to construction of the Twin Towers since they were unlike any other building that they are compared to when they talk about fires in steel buildings) We are only given statements, usually one line from someone, we don't know anything about other than a title, about things they may or may not know about.
Ever since i saw a conspiracy-Mockumentary, by a french director, named "Operation Lune".
It takes a couple of free-thinking college kids to put together such a video, since the media gets paid to divert our attention from real facts with inane terrorist warnings, "muscle" hijacker tales, bogus pancake theories and other heroic schlock.
You wont get bored, since this a very interesting presentation of another point of view of the events of 9/11.
I would recommend this film, since you can watch it for free from different sources through the internet.
In fact Yul Brynner's pirate captain Jonathan Kongre is the most unredeemable villain we've seen on screen since Lee Marvin as Liberty Valance.
Obviously no-one believes Luke but when Bobby Johnson (Mark Trottier) is found dead under mysterious circumstances Luke is convinced the alien babes are behind it & since he is blamed for Bobby's murder after having a fight with him earlier in the evening Luke has even more reason to expose the alien menace on campus....
But for most of the action sequences the creatures are CGI but even though it's easy to tell, it still looks good since they move so fast.
I don't see how one could really like this film, since it lacks so much.
Well Gwennie turns around and mentions she hasn't been forbidden to do something since she was a teenager.
Not getting the hint that he was a total wash out, in him not having what it takes to be a good Nazi, from his beloved Nazi Germany Emil ,because of him being brainwashed since he could barley walk, still thinks that he's a full fledged Nazi Superman and goes so far as to parade around the house, this in 1944 when the US was at war with Nazi Germany, with his Nazi or Hitler Youth uniform.
Though it's now been 24 years since I saw it, I still remember thinking that I should have walked out of the theater.. No one in the audience laughed even once.
The child, Emil, is the least sympathetic character I have seen since, "The Good Son."
This setting, however, is very appealing since it's an island with only an ancient lighthouse on it and the people are survivors of a sunk prison ship.
My VHS copy is falling apart, but I'm lucky since Swedish National Television airs Ivanhoe every Christmas....
I am actually a bit embarrassed to admit that I was actually looking forward to seeing this since I tend to like movies that deal with plot lines centered on investing/stock trading (of which there was very little in this movie) and gambling (the main focus).
There were a few somewhat notable actors in this film though which causes me to wonder what they were thinking since there is no way this job landed them a big, fat paycheck.
Of course, since this movie was made during the early 90's, GenCorp is an Evil Corporation and they've managed to destroy the future.
The movie was incredible, ever since I saw it in 1977 I told my wife she had to see it, it was really funny.
It premiered on TV for the 1st time since its theatrical release in 1927.
