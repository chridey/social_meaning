The circumstances involved a dying wealthy man who sought treatment for his ailment, but the man's hysterical son believes that Kravaal is taking advantage of a terminal case to make money and the authorities force Kravaal to take him to his island so that they can see what he has done.
Unfortunately, the same chemicals that he resorted to so that he could take them hostage works on him and he collapses and is frozen until Mason and Judith thaw him out.
The film is perfectly paced, with the exact right amount of time spent at the beginning introducing the characters and making sure the audience is firmly rooted in Laura's character so that we experience everything with her as the film progresses.
The children's' father is dead; the family chauffeur, played by a hateful Clark Gable, is running things, and he wants the children to die so that he can collect the trust money that was intended for them.
When Adolf Hitler solidified his hold on Germany he asked Germans to give up little things so that he could make them stronger.
This movie is fast paced enough to please action fans but also skillfully creates suspense by keeping their stalker in the shadows so that the predator feels ever present and is just cautiously eyeing and selecting it's prey.
They say he actually drove an ice cream truck for awhile in NY, so that part must be true.
And there's no nude or sex scenes involving Julie Warner so that was disappointing too, she's cute.
), so much so that I went out and bought the S/T, which I still listen to (yes kids, on vinyl).
The film demonstrates how expert witnesses are selected and coached so that the presentation to the jury becomes a calculated performance.
The way in which the alien functions is not made clear at all, perhaps deliberately to camouflage the inconsistencies in the plot, so that many events make no sense.
When Uncle Charlie(Christopher Shyer)tells Derek about how his father REALLY died(he was told by mama that he perished in a "hunting accident", but we see in the opening that it's a massive werewolf), Sam aides him by trying to seduce Mitch so that they can collect DNA samples from his hair..she's able to do so, but it has to be from his nether region!
And, the kids who get picked off at the end was merely put in the flick so that we could see more fresh meat for the werewolf.
First of all, the film is very well directed by Enzo Castellari so that already lifts it out of the typical spaghetti western doldrums.
This one plays more like an "Airplane" or "Naked Gun", so that helped it with me a bit as well.
And he does it so that he and his family and all Americans can have real hope for the future.
I'm glad that God touched during this movie so that I could forgive the good Bishop and be glad that I never bought the book.
Which brings me to the background musical score by Sandeep Chowta, there were some parts in the movie where background score was loud and annoying and I felt that some scenes would have turned out to be better without any background music just so that the scene can be simple just as its setting, by adding the background music made the look of those certain scene unrealistic and more of a fantasy, which is a total turn off.
On their wedding night, her grandfather kidnaps Pete so that Marsha thinks he's up to his old tricks.
There is no plot, and the whole disjointed mess needs to be edited down so that it can make sense.
There's a lot of nudity delivered in a very dark and nasty feeling style, so that's a plus for the film, but the whole film needed a writer and an editor.
Damn, I'm tired; think I'll just leave my shovel lying around here so that perverts have easier access to the corpses, not to mention so that chased criminals can use it in self-defense against tough cops...".
I guess that the director decided to provide almost raw material so that the spectator can come to her own feelings and conclusions.
This is how the Monks gave up everything so that they can be God's disciples.
The almost three hours, although slow, were needed so that one could immerse in those French Alps with those faithful Monks.
But as we watch, the pace of the film is slowed so that we enter this world and test our own thoughts about human contact as well as faith.
This was extremely well done, accompanied by an awesome and haunting score by Elmer Bernstein, the animation was done so that it looks like you're watching a living horror comic book on your TV.
As usual in the "Queen of Mystery"'s plots some events occur too coincidentally perfect so that impossible situations and alibis become possible for the story's sake, but this was Miss Christie's trade mark and no doubt that she had a great imagination and skill to make most interesting and "catching" plots in the genre.
Just so that no one is surprised the murders are very grisly even by todays standard, but the scenery is breathtaking and the sets and costumes transported me to Egypt and I loved every minute of it.
And also the FBI wants to get Mardukas so that they can use him to get his boss, so they warn Walsh not to get in their way.
The camera utterly adores actress Virginie Ledoyen (who portrays Valerie with raw vibrance), which is perhaps why there is never a dull moment in a film that was shot in real time so that viewers could get a glimpse of even the most trivial of daily tasks that Valerie undertakes.
Later on, largely due to her performance in this film, she would become a big star and continued to be in the limelight and even played alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in THE BEACH (2000), so that's probably why I kept remembering her role in LA SEULE FILLE.
If you like movies in which the actors wear timeless, well-cut clothes, move in a well-appointed chÃ¢teau with a seascape thrown in for good measure and behave in obligatory mysterious ways so that an eventual murder has been long anticipated then you won't be disappointed.
The movie shows us just enough to get by and then throws a new twist so that we forget we haven't really been told anything.
Arrogance becomes the word of the moment as Hollywood has become so much so that they decide they know what's best for the country, churning out mindless action, brainwashing society into feeling that any movie that asks for thought is just boring.
A possible exception is the Mortal Kombat parody that does goes on for a bit but it is pretty funny nevertheless, and it occurs early enough in the film so that it fades to the background by the two-thirds mark.
As an attractive actress and a popular commercial model, it's so far-out seeing her dressed-down and wearing plain makeup to portray this hopelessly out-of-luck, clumsy girl, who has to learn English so that she could communicate with western customers who arrive at her office with their problems when it comes to their monthly bills.
Elvis also has problems of his own, because his interest in learning English is to better communicate with his long-lost sister, who was given up for adoption in America due to his poor family finances many years before...  You can totally tell that this film is the first, and probably the only one of its kind in South Korea, highlighting the recent English craze, where adults want to learn English to better improve their business English when it comes to international business, and students learning English through expensive English academies so that they could either study abroad/or live domestically and enter top-notch universities.
Their plan is for the humans to fornicate (yup, it must be a Roger Corman movie) so that their race will continue.
He has evil minds indeed, but he wishes to be a good guy, he wishes greater power will happen to him so that can save at least his girlfriend, and then if possible, save the world.
The build-up to the set-up so that his vehicle came round a bend and hit a parked lorry seemed to be well done and just how you would expect an "accident" to be pre-arranged.
These Germans were to be made to pay time and again for their collective sin, with a usurious rate of interest, so that punishment and retribution was to be their fate.
of the characters so that the number of danger points can lengthen the movie.
As a Major, he led the successful raid on the German radar station at Bruneval where radar specialist Sgt Cox (Sgt Box in this film) dismantled the German unit and brought it back to Britain along with some of the operators so that the British could understand the limits of the German radar system.
I wish 'The Red Beret' would release on disc so that once, and many times over, in the wee hours I could snuggle down on the sofa and enjoy it as I did when I was a teenager.
David Carradine is a drug-dealing pimp who operates a strip club and is tired of councilman Jan Michael Vincent, on a crusade against titty bars so that he can be elected mayor.
Jule also seems to have a rather selfish approach to being an 'Edukator', as she purely wants to cancel a debt so that maybe she could start a lucrative career herself.
And I know nothing about the country that hasn't been gleaned from Google searches, so that should give you a clue about how much he apparently knows.
Anyway all that aside and I have to say that the film transcends dumbness, Freddy wants to possess a boys body so that he can kill kids who are awake, a good idea,.
One additional benefit of the movie-making simplicity rules was that it kept the budget low, so that more good movies like this could be made.
One gaffer for example, so that it's as if you are there, the only one, inside the story, watching like a fly on the wall, enjoying the struggle through the confusion of life, as everyone.
If you can get your hands on the DVD, please, please throw it on the floor and stomp on it so that the rest of humanity doesn't have to suffer.
It is graphic and heart ripping, it is a movie EVERY teen should see so that they can relay the message of Never Again, because next time it may not be The Jews, it could be any culture.
He has to get the big machines in, so that drilling can begin- but the weather's shot to hell and Company-employed Environmentalist Hoffman won't sign the right papers.
The director keeps information from the audience, so that when we discover what the little girl discovers it's just as new and poignant for the viewer without being predictable.
You also don't get scripts better than this, the Granger version essentially used the same script so that as it ran I was quoting dialog and making my dad go "I thought you never saw this before".
I have just spent an hour searching for this film (as I'd forgotten the name) just so that I can buy it for myself, and I would recommend it to people.
The action scenes are cut so that you can't tell what's going on.
If action is all you care about, this show will only be good, but for the viewers who don't mind the talk, so that things can be explained such as why they're going to execute the plan and how, this will be great.
It's not that well known when great french films are discussed but this is a wonderful film, cunningly written and directed so that our expectations are constantly being changed.
VVD has a goldmine of a storyline here but he fails to mine it: we could have easily seen more of Big B's doubts about dharma, more of Saif Ali Khan's uneasy steps on the path of palace intrigue and treachery, more of Dutt's feeling as a scheduled caste DSP involved in outdated monarchical madness,more of Shroff's agitation as the king's younger brother - the story now is told in such a way that it leaves you guessing too much at what the characters would be going through, so that at the climax you recognize: this would have been a heart-breaking tragic scene of more then epic proportions, if only you would have felt more...  So,all in all, a good performance and a great visual tour of Rajastan - but not the brilliant movie you can easily understand it could have been.
Let me put it this way, he deliberately makes his actors be less theatrical so that the he can create drama through other means - music, camera, visuals, etc.
The only way the Candyman can exist is through the shedding of innocent blood so that the stories of him can continue to proliferate.
Visually the film is very well made: In the first 9 minutes we just watch Neville driving through LA and as a prime example of showing vs. telling without any dialogue we begin to understand what has happened so that the following flashback really is unnecessary and relatively crude for such a well made and well written film.
Ultimately, he sacrifices Himself for the good of humanity, so that the normal world, America, will be re-born.
He is, of course, also a soldier, one who is willing to lay down his life so that others might live.
This was actually the first movie I've seen where she did not play an obnoxious b*tch, so that was a new experience.
Gabe and Karen are like me and my Husband, so that is really great to see.
Chaykin makes a good effort as Wolfe; he isn't really BIG enough, so that his high-pitched tirades don't really do justice to Wolfe's bellowing.
What objects were destroyed so that the photos could become objects?
My only hope is that these problems I had were the result of an over-zealous editing team, and that if a DVD of the miniseries comes out, the scenes from the cutting-room floor can be picked up and re-attached so that some sense can be made out of the thing.
Sure, there probably are some basic truths suggested by the film but it's done with such a zest for showing those myths in a suggestive enough manner so that people are actually convinced that they have seen what the wreckage field really looked like, what the aliens really looked like, heard the threats made against the witnesses to stay silent or perpetuate some lie, and the finger of blame pointed squarely at the US government.
The protagonist has his detractors in the film also that he eventually wins over with his sincerity and goodness.
It's about a small town of people who make car accidents happen so that they can loot and what not.
Although the movie skims slightly upon cliches, that only helps to familiarise the audience with the plot so that they don't feel too alienated by the mystery of the twins.
But this one is just a plain teenage slashing movie, and just so that you won't think that my appreciation of the movie is due to my general taste in movies, I can tell you that compared to any "I know what you did last Summer", or "Halloween", or such, those movies are works of pure cinematic art compared to "Cruel World".
Don't worry, the film also provides the viewer with the token blonde "final girl" in Laura Ramsey(..one of the new horror "it girls", having starred in such recent flicks as "The Covenant", "Venom", and "The Ruins") so that all the slasher guidelines are fulfilled.
He unleashes her in the Sadie Hawkins Day race to stupefy men so that the women of Dogpatch can catch them.
It is more relevant than ever today, with Congress trying to pass a Constitutional Amendment, not only stating that some relationships are more valid than others, but making it so that no one can even be allowed to think otherwise!
He's a paint-by-numbers actor who manages to say everything so that, no matter what he says, it bores me to tears.
And not just emotional growth, as modern animation is often so limited to, but also that he is maturing in a natural/physical way, so that you can really imagine him becoming a strong and brave prince.
Rather, Hong has a tendency to shoot everyone in long-shot so that you can follow the characters reacting to each other.
As they have dinner in a restaurant, and Hong Sang-soo directs these two actors so that the painful awkwardness between them is realistically implacable, Tae-Boo talks Ji-Tae into fixing up a reunion between them and his old girlfriend, Seong Hyeon-ah.
It isn't so that the more you see it the less vague it becomes.
Nora and Jim travel to Ireland, so that their young son can meet the mother's ailing grandmother.
Mike's lecture to Tom concerning Tom's lack of heart and brain also gives pause, so that (if you agree with the filmmakers) one can define very simply the typical gangster's actions.
Okay, so that's not how Joan's big song goes, but nevertheless.
He uses his charm and the prospect of money to lure Nini to studying dancing so that she may go on the stage.
Okay, so that's a bit of a twistÂour heroine is a kleptomaniac.
The plot is a little outlandish, but if you don't take it literally (good-for-nothing artist meets waitress and a couple of hours later asks to be shot so that she can take a trip to France) but more figuratively (disillusioned man is willing to sacrifice everything so that someone he loves can fulfill her dreams) it is more poignant.
Squier must force the issue, so that "As long as I live, I'll be grateful to the Duke".
They are so well-to-do and modern, that it's totally unbelievable that at least the guy wouldn't have walked around with a cell in his pocket, so that they could have sent for help.
I love American genre films of the 70's so that is mainly why I started with this one, and it scored.
Having said that, the shorter film has a few scenes that aren't actually in the 134-minute cut, so why don't the powers-that-be re-edit it entirely so that a, let's say, 140-minute version was made available?
A new group bought controlling interest in Agatha Christie Ltd, so that explains the difference between previous and current productions.
This plot twist just doesn't make sense, Kirsten had managed to get the whole household suspicious of her, so much so that her fiancÃ© had asked her to leave the house, so why kill her?
So much so that many years later I named my second son REX!!!!
I watched Star Trek TOS everyday after elementary school in the 1970's, so much so that after a few years I had managed to see every episode but two.
OK now it's plot hole time, why couldn't they just phaser the time machine so that neither one could get through?
I think they should have found a way to make she and Charlie Brown meet sometimes, so that she and Snoopy had the chance to visit each other occasionally.
He contrasted his feisty village yokel role in "Lagaan" nicely with the glib, self-absorbed urban youth undone by love in "Dil Chahta Hai", so that in the same year, folks got to see two completely different Aamirs.
As well as killer sharks they had an alien plot and an assassin twist to it so that made the film the same as the others but also a little bit different at the same time.
And I really hope they get the money back, so that more "MEANING-FULL" films come up.
I am just saying that Movies like KAl ho na ho, Dilwale Dulhaniya are the PRIDE of Indian cinema...So the industry should not forget that...  and the even more BETTER thing about this movie is that You can watch this movie like GAZZILION times... every time i see it i love it... its funny and superbly written... Karan Johar is more of a BETTER Writer...... his dialogs are so FUNNY....... like the reference to Preety as MAA-mother.... and the emotional scenes..........how well written.......no matter how FIlmy...there were tears in my eyes so thats the BIG thing.......  the leading lady PREETY ZINTA proves herself as a BETTER actress... this is a ROLE she was born for...She is JUST way toooooo BRILLIANT... no one could have been better......and i mean NO-One...Thanks GOD kareena Refused this film...

Shah RUkh is a KEY to this movie....
Rebecca's mother/agent gets an idea to have Rebecca live on the set -- the house where the murders take place -- so that she can "get into character."
I hope this film will be embraced as a DVD so that studios will continue to make films of solid subject matter.
Moreover, it contributes to the overall hypocrisy of a movie meant to galvanize social reflection and reaction through the didactic speeches of its belligerent protagonist Nick (Clive Owen), while exhibiting remarkable indifference to the objectification of the nameless victims that suffer and die in the film so that our love is not for them, but for the named heroes who suffer and die out of pity.
At least this had an interesting story, but as befalls so many films in this mind-bending sci-fi genre (and "The Matrix" suffers from this as well, though it's a far better movie), the writers have set up such a cerebral concept that the movie grinds to a halt when it has to trudge through all the exposition just so that the audience can keep track of what's going on.
It's alien nonsense stuff about peoples' memories taken from them so that the aliens can learn enough about earth beings to eventually take over their souls because their own race is dying, blah, blah, blah.
The film begins with a bazillion feet of often grainy stock footage of Antarctica--so much so that I swear that the movie would be 15 minutes shorter without it.
You know right from the start that there is something dreadfully suspicious and exceedingly bizarre about the Glass couple, but you can never be too sure exactly what at first (that's the purpose of a thriller, to throw you a few hints and let your quick assumptions guide you into all the wrong paths so that you're--hopefully--pleasantly surprised when the real perpetrator and his motives are revealed).
But this is a Disney film so that's kind of a given.
The plot is very World War 2-inspired so that may be part of why it is overlooked.
Then it does a really bad job at setting the stage for the mystery: it never takes the time to clearly help the audience understand the lay-out of the house or where people are supposed to be so that when the murder happens, we really understands that there is clearly something unsolvable about the mystery which would help grad audience attention.
The vintage film-clips are cleverly inserted into the plot, so that we get a dream cast, their lines and actions woven even if tenuously into the narrative, although ironically the poorer film-quality of some of their scenes work against the glossier quality of the modern camera-work.
So much so that you kind of wish you could protect him from some of it.
(Ken smashes Nick's guitar so that he won't sing an embarrassing love ode to Lindsey.)
It would be great if local PBS stations would pick up this series and show it from time to time, so that interested viewers could at least tape it (the local museum of television history was the only place I could get access to it).
The remaining students are then sent letters by the villains instructing them to cut off their right arm so that their fathers and teachers may be released.
At times the picture jitters so that you may begin reaching for your VCR remote to adjust the tracking until you remember this is a DVD.
The same with Connery, simple explanations so that we can feel for this old time cop and then the scene is set to do battle with the invincible foe, who we don't get to know much about.
Let's make it so that he'll be out and about in the sea and completely defenseless, but instead they go pick on a jet plane and then be so kind as to leave him alone when he goes to save the mandatory hot female pilot.
I see that often in pilots and then the show gets better as time goes on so that could well have been the case here.
This may regarded as insidious socialization, but it was created and ran through the very liberal 70s, so that claim is paranoid anti-government nonsense.
Also that house they filmed it in, i've seen it before and it was my dream house, but now i'd be too scared to step into it so i guess the movie was somewhat effective.
Frank Langella is amusing as the aging diplomat caught in a late life crisis, who tries vainly to control Tina so that he may bask in her beauty, and is burned when he gets too close to the flame.
Having endured and witnessed all the crime he can tolerate, Bronson sets out to lure criminals into attacking him so that he can blow them away.
We know that this movie will be great from the beginning when Bronson cashes in a 20 dollar bill for two rolls of quarters so that he can stuff them in a sock and smash it across some dude's face.
For what it's worth, GPN (Godzilla Prediction Network) led by Yuuji Shinoda and his daughter Io, try to predict Godzilla's city attacks so that he can evacuate precious lives in advance.
), and starts draining info from the Internet so that it can find out more about Godzilla (it discovered that Godzilla has quick-regeneration process; Upon further study with Miyasaka, Shinoda calls it Organizer G1).
Then, it has an enjoyable varietyÂseveral forms of comedy (from sexÂcomedy to social satire), action, suspense, charming performances from the central group of actors (i.e., Connery, Sutherland and Mme Lesley-Anne DownÂso that it skillfully avoids all monotony.
Later Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton organize the woman's movement, so that after they both die in the early 1900s it grows until it achieves suffrage by Federal Constitutional Amendment in 1919.
Buscemi manages to play both the fragile patheticness of Seymour and his sweetness, so that we can see why Enid is drawn to him.
I'm not so sure... Well, I've ticked the spoiler box, so that's me covered!
In the hands of a greater director, it might have been an even more impressive film than it is, so that I'm unable to place it in the same class with the two films mentioned above.
That is why I remember Holocaust Memorial Day -- so that I will never forget -- and I can help work towards a time when such a hell will not occur in Europe, in Africa, in the Middle East, in the US, ... anywhere.
Riding on the cowcatcher, Buster hurls one railroad tie at another lying across the tracks, striking it precisely so that it flips out of the way.
I remember also that I was going to go see it again but it was gone.
It turns out that from each apartment there is a little space lacking, but so that these parts are connected by a steep stairwell in the wall of the house.
For Rosario, her character piece becomes like a showcase of the much generalized exploitation of illegal workers, as well as going through the usual aspirations of being a naturalized citizen so that she can finally bring her son over for reunification.
Despite the harsh conditions of her life, Rosario is saving as much money as she can so that eventually Carlitos will be able to come and live with her.
The kid had to get to where his mother was in a week so that way the mother will not start freaking out.
My only wish is that I was fluent in Spanish so that I could have appreciated the film as it was meant to be seen.

The opening premise is that gangster Vincent 'Vinnie' Antonelli (Steve Martin)'s garishly dressed wife joined Vinnie in Witness Protection so that Vinnie could get a house.
His co-star, Rick Moranis, plays just about the same character as in "Honey, I shrunk the kids" and its sequels, so that is not really interesting to watch either but I would rather see a whole movie with that character again and the rather lame love story between him and Joan Cusack than spend it watching Martin squint and squirm his way through every stereotypical mannerism we associate with Wise's.
First of all HE'S adorable, so that helps, but it's also just a cute little glimpse of his life.
He introduces fake basement-tape video reenactments (a device he has used before) to augment the visuals of the Abu Ghraib abuses--close-ups of "prisoners'" bodies, blood dripping on a uniform, keys going into a lock--so that after a while you aren't sure what is real and what is fake.
It leaves that to us, so that we can make up our own minds.
But in all fairness it's only the final twenty minutes or so that loose their footing in absurdity, with the main detraction being the role of the Army brat dictator kid, who's grip on the surviving populace is never fully explained.
This is fairly standard melodrama -- you have an impossible love between the aunt and the uncle; the conventions of melodrama (not to mention the PCA) will not allow him to escape punishment for his crimes, but his love for his wife is true so the writer allows him to make the "sacrifice" so that this conflict will resolve itself in a way that satisfies the audience.
Laughton is always tough to assess because he likes to play around so much and have so much fun inhabiting the role that it sometimes damages his performance, and he was a guy with a world of talent.... so much so that it seems like he gets bored with it and does other things, sometimes things that work and sometimes things that don't.
Typically in this film, a frame is tilted at an angle so that both vertical and horizontal points of reference are off-kilter.
The plot has become more expansive for this update, but the filmmakers have still managed to keep it tight so that the plot is focused mainly on the characters as opposed to the actual crime.
When his business affairs start to go awry, he decides to commit the perfect murder so that he can inherit his wife's trust fund.
The way that the hero (played by Christian Slater) narrowly escapes death from everything that comes his way is laughable to the point that by halfway through the movie I was hoping he would be killed so that the film would end.
But it must be said that without this film doing so well, Woo wouldn't have been able to make FACE/OFF, so that's in its favor.
Germans and Japanese have a lot in common so that makes the misunderstandings real rather than the usual "foreigners in Japan trying to make the Japanese seem like savage aliens".
She then gets to run around in a shirt that's been slit up the sides so that you still frequently catch views of her crotch and buttocks.
He constructs an ingenious lot of tricks, mostly to put Bruce in jail, so that he can play on Hildy's ego to come back to the paper and, maybe, to him too.
Hell, she can even do a dramatic scene here or there, or make it so that she's right on the level with another actor (i.e.
the one playing the death-row guy) so that comedy and drama come and go depending on the beat of the scene.
And it floored me as being somewhat unique, and it only takes itself so much seriously in the world its set in so that it's always entertaining.
Director Howard Hawks wanted to show the whirlwind pace of the newsroom in the criminal courts system so he had his actors overlap their lines -- so much so that at times it seems as though everyone is talking at once; it even gets difficult to understand all that is going on.
In Proud Valley, Robeson delivers an outstanding performance as a miner who makes the ultimate sacrifice so that others may live.
It made a big impression upon me so that I do remember the name but only some sketchy scenes.
If I say that there's a dragon who makes veiled allusions to Wittgenstein, that might convey something of the film's flavour; on the other hand, you might suspect this to be a sample of the kind of pointless eccentricity which film-makers (animators in particular) indulge in so that they won't be accused of being mainstream, and for no other reason.
TV became our religion, so that we reconstruct our world from, what we see and believe to be real a few people tell us so (not very normal people, who have much free time to do so).

It will take you through the journey of Joshua.. a mission he has embarked upon...to find God so that he can make sure his Grandpa is okay in heaven.
Besides the technical issues - the alarmingly regular appearance of boom mics, and the plot holes - the kid sean's inexplicable ability to point out Lauren Bacall as the Xmas Humbug, Birth's script is virtually non-existent and ponderous kubrick style tracking shots sap the very life blood out of the viewer so that they are lulled into a hypnotic half-slumber.
If ever there was a case where I would put my stamp of approval on the protest, censorship, banning, or outright incineration of a film into the stratosphere so that it may never be viewed by human eyesÂand I am usually against such thingsÂthis would be it.
Sometimes a movie will come out so that watching it will be like reading a good book.

When she and Musante kiss the camera moves so that she is no longer obscured by the net, referencing the lifting of the veil at a traditional wedding.
When he was romancing her mother, Butterworth was training Amanda Whurlitzer (Tatum O'Neill) on pitching and fielding, so that she is a powerhouse (though not as good as a hitter).

He engineers this perfect crime so that he can weasel his way back into the good graces of the department.
But he arranges for them to wear masks when they all meet (he is wearing one too) so that none of them know each other or him.

We both liked it and got something out of it, so that means they must have done something right.
Robert Redford is the leader of a team of experts who break into security systems so that institutions (such as banks) can see how good their system is.

It had potential, but it just seemed to have the need to sell in many markets so that it could pay its bills, rather than just to tell great stories.
Who among us, who has seen the series and accepted it for what it was without reservation, has not dreamed of riding shotgun with Alan Carter in the cockpit of an Eagle, lending a helping hand to Dr. Russell in the Medical Section, sitting in conference with Professor Bergman and Commander Koenig as they contemplate the mysteries and menaces of the unknown, or simply planting yourself at one of Moonbase Alpha's computer terminals and poring over its various databases, just so that you could broaden your own horizons?

The former is not quite as bad, and hence never really popped up on any Worst Of Lists, but it is that kind of 1980s dubious horror in that, despite the urgency of the situation (hideous monsters who "live so that others may die"), the characters carry on like it's just any other day.
In modern-day slapstick, it means one basic thing: gross out your audience, so that's what is attempted here.

Here you have this short lady telling the much taller adults and children to conserve their energy and air, so that escape seems all the more possible.
I don't want to give to many details, so that you may have a chance to watch for yourself, If you dare.
They find the doc dead, having locked himself in a room and left the window open so that he froze to death.
The performances in "Bulworth" entirely demonstrate that Warren Beatty is not only able to direct, write and produce well, but also that capable to lead an all star cast, including Don Cheadle, Oliver Platt, Isaiah Washington, and Christine Baranski, into an Oscar worthy overall appearance level.
I do recall that the week it was shown it was averaging about -20 where I was living so that made it interesting to watch this film and know how cold it felt for the two main characters.

I am a big Bette Midler fan so that didn't hurt.
The film is a presentation, albeit an occasionally funny one, of human's ugliest and basest instincts Â so much so that maybe even the humor is part of that cycle.
it inspired me n my friends so much so that as soon as we got into the parking lot we started 'krumpin' rite there on the spot!!
There are films for holding sticky hands in the back row, looking into each other's eyes; there are films for getting all excited with tons of special effects to bedazzle eyes and minds of onlookers; there are films for filling up the useless hours of television when only insomniacs are available; there are films hyped up to smash shattering box-office record sales with all those glorious glamorous Hollywood stars; there are films to put on at Christmas and Easter every year, supposedly to remind us what the heck we are celebrating; there are films for just dozing off; there are films for Saturday afternoon so that the kids won't go out.

Sometimes even the names of the actresses would be changed, so that the porn actresses could build up a resume in non-porn movies.
What started as a potentially entertaining critique of materialism and shallowness is revealed to be a poorly executed farce, with a succession of lame jokes instead of a plot (then again, one of the screenwriters is best known for performing on Saturday Night Live, where the skits have no connection whatsoever, so that may be an explanation) and two atrocious caricatures instead of leading ladies.
Overall i feel the film was a failure but is still worth watching so that there is some hope that GOAL III can impress and revive the disappointment of GOAL II.

Porky Pig and Sylvester the Cat find themselves in a spooky house where Sylvester sees dastardly mice planning an execution, needless to say Porky doesn't believe him for much of the short.I liked this cartoon, as Slvester is a favorite character of mine and tweety isn't in this at all, I could never really stand that bird so that's another reason I liked this one.

It has enough of a twist in the plot so that it is not predictable.
There are a few decent moments like the opening scene in the airplane with the snotty flight attendants who insist that Sandler is raising his voice, but nearly every comedy uses those jokes so that only generates laughs of recognition than great comedy.
), plays a pathetic old man desperately attempting to grasp a last thread of a possible dream, having had the only love of his life, an old dog, torn from him and shot, so that he is deprived of anything and everything, stripped bare, a naked, lost soul, as so many in this story are lost souls.
Jafar desires to be free so that he can get revenge on Aladdin and rule Agrabah, but needs Mal's co-operation to do this.
It's so that Duffy can have ridiculous scenes where Dafoe prances around crime scenes while listening to CDs on his portable disc player as if he were conducting an orchestra instead of gathering evidence.
In the end, Reeve manipulates events so that Fast Black gets killed, and one of Fast Black's minions gets busted.

Friz Freleng's 'Baseball Bugs' has become one of the most well known Bugs Bunny cartoons of all, so much so that it was referenced in hugely popular the sitcom 'Friends' in such a way that took for granted that the audience would recognise it.
The problem is the Inauguration was always held on March the 4th, that is until they changed the law in 1933, when the Inauguration was changed to be on January the 20th, so that there could be a quicker change of office.
Instead it falls in the same group of movies that sound like they were written by the same people who write telenovelas and latino sitcoms, thinking that they are funny, just because somebody in Televisa likes this crap and wants to keep Mexican people ignorant, so that they do not rebel against the governing status quo.
The film is perfectly balanced so that there is not a single boring scene in the picture.
Forty years ago a town in Spain was abandoned so that a dam could be built to create a lake.
I think it's best to start with Angus Bethune, the fat kid who just doesn't seem to get a break, until an age-old enemy, Rick, rigs an election so that Angus can dance with his long-time crush, Melissa.
As a cruel joke, Rick rigs the ballot box so that Angus is nominated for king of the winter ball.
His mother wants Angus to focus on his studies, so that he can get his ticket out of Owatonna High, thus he should not go.
They all average out in the end so that Ringu 2 earns an 8, or a "B", just as Rasen/Spiral did.

Nobody likes The Driller Killer, so that can't be it.
Marie earns her status as a gold digging, whiny opportunist, so that by the time she's attacked by an alligator, you wind up rooting for the reptile.
This is a different world, where the real action and thrill is in the eye of the beholder, where director is not expected or required to chew everything for us, so that, God forbid, the viewer doesn't choke on the plethora of meaning.
The series begins on a deceptively cheerful note when young Shuzo Matsutani--who refers to himself as Shu, so that's what I'll call him from now on--is making his way home from a kendo practice match when he sees -- wouldn't you know -- a mysterious, quiet girl sitting alone on a water tower.
His schtick is that he is a Swede who can't speak English well, so he is generally pretty quiet (Wayne can't muster the best Swedish accent, either, so that's kind of a good thing!).
In fact he is not appraised or if it is really Howar or a mask of characterized Howar of DrÃ¡cula, that yes, incredible the characterization... is had to do, and I would bet that he is the best one of all the DrÃ¡culas that I have seen, pity that Howar not between in action, surely rolled the planes a weekend in its house so that Jess inserted them in the film.
this film should be shown in schools all the time so that kids can grow up knowing what compassion, courage and true love are.
Where some directors would have piled the sentimentality on, David Lynch is economic; that's all it needs, so that's all it gets.
The sheer moral vacuum of Tanner is a depiction of the worst that can happen when location and money allow someone to construct a "reliaty" founded on self-image - kill a man so that no-one will have cause to wonder if I killed my lover's husband to grab her - I don't need to kill someone to take his woman - and a life is a small price to pay to make that clear.
In such a light, their spending habits are monumental and they even divide up the "color scheme" of their yearly wardrobes so that they don't duplicate any outfit between them.
He frequently changes our perspective so that we see a stage performer scream, say, at the same time someone offstage should be screaming.
I would love to see it come out in the mainstream theaters, I wish it already was so that I could see it again.

"Everything changes so that it can all stay the same" is a cynical saying you still often hear in Italy.
Few action movies can suck the viewer in like this does, so that we care about the characters and are not just watching vacantly.
Granted, as mentioned, Frank is no Maysles, so the camera-work sometimes looks amateurish (the sound guys occasionally tap the microphone just so that the editor probably knew where to cut) and, sadly, it's probably not too much of a wonder why he didn't work again outside of the lowest of low-budget art-house pictures and shorts.
Don't forget that this was made shortly after WWII ended, so that the theme of men returning from combat, and the constant threat of death, was something everyone was conscious of; it's almost as if Jeb has PTSD (the 'black dog riding his back'), and death follows him, through no fault of his own, throughout the movie.
First there is Dave Lister, who is a slob but is also a deep down very caring and compassionate guy and to the writers credit, they really make it so that just when you think Dave is just a useless slob they write an episode which reveals more about that character and how he is really a good guy.
The subtitles (the film is in French) are so out of sync with the film that they completely destroy the important conversations, so much so that many times the subtitles are finishing off a scene that is no longer on the screen!
In fact, I kept hoping they'd abduct me so that I wouldn't have to finish watching this horrible movie.
She was the girl in high school that everyone hates, and is completely obsessed with herself, saying that she's hot (she only rates a 5 on my scale), and publicly giving invites so that everyone knows who didn't get them (and inviting guys and not their girlfriends).
And gee, how many kids are BUGGING their parents RIGHT NOW to throw an over the top Sweet 16 party so that they can GET on MTV?!?!?!
They are robots struggling to re-enact the Laura storyline (from the classic movie released in 1944) so that they can learn about humanity.
The movie speaks of an island where one can change the course of one's life, an island that floats like a raft atop the sea, that is so full of caves as to be nearly hollow, so that each of the many holes you may fall into is really a tunnel that will take you somewhere else.
It's set up so that the player has to play an individual campaign of each species.
Jakob, then carries on the lie,and later is forced to carry on the lie, that he has a radio, to keep the hope alive, in the end dies , but doesn;t let go , just so that people already close to death under the Nazis, don't lose whatever hope that is left.
SPOILER ahead When Lina discovers that Jakob has no radio at all, she prolongs his lie, so that he can still believe in it too.
In Jakob the Liar, his comedic talents are restricted just enough so that he is able to function properly within the atmosphere of the movie, but is still allowed a scene or two in which his ability to get laughs can come out.
His skeptical friend doubts him, so Jakob quickly tells him that he has a radio so that he will believe the Russians will be there to save them all soon, and his friend's suicide is prevented.
It's the kind of film you might want to see by yourself so that there's no chance for comment or interruption.
Like the best movies, the script is cut to a minimum so that we may drink in how the characters are reacting rather than what they are saying.
Although the production values were that of television tape at that time, the performances are so strong that a vivid memory remains.I hope that a tape of this performance will surface someday so that the full intent of the production can be shared.
However, the actors in this movie are so good, and the character development is excellent so that its hard not to get swept up in the gorgeous filming and unfolding plot.
The colors in the film are also unique in that I'm sure they were chosen so that your eyes would not wear out because of so much life you see.
You will also see that a lot of the people in the American version are in the British version, and I enjoy that a lot, but I also get to see a lot of the talented and funny British comedians, too, so that is also great.
This is something that the best speakers have, the ability to move from one topic to the next so that the listener is not aware of the transition.
The making of footage on the flip side of the DVD is equally nifty, because seldom will a film include multiple agonizing takes of key scenes both action and non-action so that you might understand how excruciatingly demanding and exhausting film making can really be.
The events, the various parties and issues could easily have become hopelessly confused to a viewer --so much of the film's success is that its many interviews with people from all sides and a remarkable collection of footage from various sources, is edited so that it that manages to tell the story in a clear way.
I pray that somehow this moving, gentle, inspiring work of art will be re-issued, so that it can be enjoyed again by the many who love it and enrich the lives of those who have yet to see it.
Too bad also that the courtroom scenes are prolonged (probably to accommodate Bogart's starring role), since they amount to another key flaw.
His mother Olive (Stockard Channing) discovers his status, hears about AIDS patients' ability to cash in on life insurance early, and infects herself so that she can take advantage of the early insurance cash to provide a life of comfort in the small time they both now have for herself and her now fatherless son.
No scene or character is developed enough so that one could care about them.
To be honest some type of registry with the names of these terrible directors should be posted on the net so that myself and others will no longer have to be tortured by their vile trash that they try to pass off as movies.
Then, there is this disgruntled American, Todd (Josh Hamilton), who is being sent to India by his boss Dave so that he could train the new recruits on American society, culture and accent and tell them how much important those cheese-shaped hats are to them.
Beyond application to corporate, what the world needs now is people who can shift perspective in a nanosecond and change world views so that the assumptions are smoked out.
Curtiz's direction is marvelous and authentic, art direction and costumes are splendid, Korngold's music score is unique and the Cinematography Color is astonishingly beautiful so that deserved to be awarded.
I don't want to give away the ending so thats really all I can say as your are left to yourself to ponder your own meaning to the film.
I needed a stronger connection between these riveting scenes so that I could keep track in my mind the time that had passed.
The film brings together the South Korean/American Allies and the Communist North so that they saw eye to eye as human beings, due to the example of innocence radiating from the village.
They find the crocodile some spoilers happen, some people die, some people show their boobs, people die, animals die, people die, some crappy dialog his spoken that makes me embarrassed to be alive, some people die, some people die, some people die, then the movie is over, your soul is reaped, and you wish that you had a time machine so that you could go back in time and stop yourself from watching this movie.
I think I may be permanently scarred for the 60 minutes or so that I can never get back.
So much is left to the viewers politics and prejudices, it almost feels interactive (granted I grew up during this period, so that probably has a lot to do with it).
My only criticism would be that the film is not edited in a seamless way from beginning to end, so that at certain points in the film it abruptly goes to black until you select the next DVD chapter.
Chaney plays an unsympathetic character in this film, so much so that he doesn't evoke the usual audience pity that he had in other films.
The 3 protagonists are married to 3 sisters in the movie, so that has made these guys relatives.
I'm sure everyone has a theory of what was meant or implied by a lot of the events of Phantasm IV, and here's my personal take that I strongly believe in, so much so that when I watch part IV, it brings tears to my eyes, every time, without fail.
Ruben has been cooking the books he shows to Aunt Ada so that he can use the money to improve the farm.
The performances of the main four characters are simply outstanding and raw, so much so that you begin to wonder if this really IS a documentary.
Jackson" Bell along for the ride, so that's worth something.
These themes are used well, creating appropriate amounts of suspense and anticipation in the viewer, and Chabrol plays with his audience deftly, placing surprises and non-surprises in sequence so that we are every bit as nervy as Audran.
Most of the films shot around this time were shot with multiple cameras covering a variety of angles, but all running at the same time so that the scene could be played without stopping.
It's too bad it's never had a proper R1 DVD release so that more people might discover this movie.
The story, with a screenplay by Buck Henry, is mostly a picaresque sort of romp, with skits going on too long, so that the movie, despite its billing, is neither very sexy nor very funny.
the Matthau, but I laughed even as this absurd chapter came to a close...it's a product of an era when not only sex, but laughter and freedom, were celebrated and must be seen in that mindset...this is a movie that people who write certain modern movie guidebooks will never, ever, ever understand...for the simple reason that, in this era, as prurience increases, thus does narrowmindedness, so that we come to forget completely the now remote atmosphere in which such a film could be made.
Thankfully both stay in character, so that the unexpected ending fits into the movie without jarring the mood of the piece.
The CGI was beautifully woven into the film so that it did not take away from it, but rather created the water horse to fit beautifully with the surrounding images.
In fact, the main reason Richard even takes up the cross in the movie is so that he can get out of marrying King Philip's sister (as he heard a holy man say that all earthly oaths will be erased once a person takes up the cross) and he is only motivated to attack Acre and Jerusalem when his wife is taken by Saladin.
But Zhang Yimou can be forgiven for playing to the powers that be because he does it with subtle irony and for a purpose, the purpose being to give himself the celebrity and an international reputation so that he is able to make films that might in some way criticize the communist state while he maintains a position of loyalty to that state.
Ironically, however, it is the Boss who takes the little girl back so that she can grow into the next Bijou.

The story about a young man, Peter Vadassy (Mason), being framed for espionage seemed to me a bit weak, at the outset: the local gendarmerie allow him to go free so that he can help trap the real spy, after he proves, sort of, that he is not the guilty party.
It also wasn't offending to the Hearing people in my class, so that is a plus for any Hearing person looking at this movie.
What might have saved this (and what I was expecting all the way through) is Joyce's side of the story acted out on screen so that we could compare the stories and make our choice about who was telling the truth.
You pretty much know you're getting an heroic picture about Americans in battle when watching a war movie from 1943, so that helps set the stage up-front.
So, they realize they must erase the pilot's mind and steal the records of their being spotted (boy, this seemed really easy) so that time would not be affected.
I think also that it was a wise choice to let a relatively unknown actor play the part because in that way we have no preconceived notions about him.
Overall I would like to see more movies by this director.In fact world wars' horror are kept alive by superb movies based on that period.Partition of India, an equally momentous event which left behind a trail of human suffering should be depicted in more films of this type so that young people and people outside Indain subcontinent are sensitized that violence and religion never mix well.
Kirron Kher as Ayesha/Veero is stunning, so much so that one cannot imagine her as anyone else.
Khamosh Pani made me feel this pain for a few days; perhaps we need more reminders such as these so that we can experience the pain to forget.
Oh, and the use of a tank(..and how Owen provides a way for Bellucci and babe to enter in)for the use of protection so that the baby can remain safe, is just priceless.
Before she entered her house she wiped away her tears and pretended to be happy so that her mother wouldn't notice she couldn't fit in.
Having recently portrayed the role of Mr. Whiteside in a local civic theatre production, I was reluctant to view the movie beforehand, so that I might give the pompous "Babys Breath" my own take.
I kept wishing that someone would kill the happy couple so that I wouldn't have to do it myself.
The next guest at the Black Raven is a long-suffering, milquetoast bank employee, Horace Weatherby (a spectacled Bryon Foulger of "Sullivan's Travels") who has embezzled $50-thousand so that he can finally enjoy life to the hilt.
The next two guests are an unmarried couple, Allen Bentley (Robert Livingston of "The Lone Ranger Rides Again") and Tim Winfield's estranged, under-age daughter Lee (Wanda McKay of "Raiders of Ghost City"), who are trying to elope across the border into Canada so that they can get married.
Newfield likes to let one character speak and show another character's reaction so that he can throw you off the scent of the guilty party.
So much so that when he took her to court that I was ecstatic but unfortunately the idiot had to feel sympathy for this loathsome tramp and dropped the case.
Note also that FLORENCE HENDERSON was not able to make another film in Hollywood but went directly to television and stayed there for a very successful run on "The Brady Bunch".
Reyes finally agrees to go along with Doggett so that he's not completely alone.
The film shows the ongoing bloodshed committed by certain individuals who attack from behind so that they can gain the inheritance of prestigious land all to themselves.
It is quite possible that the script was already solid enough, so that only minimal adaptation was necessary.
The camera quality is very poor, but this is a low budget movie so that is be expected.
This leap from body to body continues, so that even the dubious merits of seeing a murderer in a hockey mask are discarded in favour of secondary actors with mascara hamming a "possessed", zombie-like pallor.
I recommend that EVERYONE watches this film so that they can say they have watched the worst film of all time.
Not only do the movie-makers want us to believe that Â as it seems Â the whole small town in which the heist takes place is turned into undead morons (which of course nobody seems to pay mind Â the place is all but deserted apart for the zombies), but also that the "great plan to eradicate them all" of Mr. Kane's character is, well, to shoot them all with handguns and stab them with knifes.
Maine meets Blodgett at a Hollywood party (she's actually the hired help) and takes an immediate romantic interest in the starry-eyed girl, so much so that he winds up getting her a studio contract on her sweet, winsome looks alone -- experience be damned!
And so that begins the fact that they now think that the three are gods and John the Pompous A** loves to cultivate this image.
This is a super-hit movie of horror genre with Superstar Rajesh Khanna in the lead.The song Sang mere nikle and other songs of the film became a big hit.Danny had once sang a Nepali folk song which when telecast in TV, R D Burman had heard casually and remembered this tune so that he could use it in Danny's own production and based on that tune he made beginning tune of Sang mere.This film is rarely telecast in TV channels.Rajesh Khanna's movies were not doing well between 1976-79 with 12 movies flopping of which 4 were classics and had only 3 super-hits during the period.He bounced back with box office hits Amardeep,Aanchal,Kudrat,Dard,Thodisi Bewafaii and unsuccessful Redrose.Phir Wohi Raat is a super-hit film which came after he regained his box office rating after which he had a good phase till 1991 as a main lead hero.
So this is Meadows introducing to us the villains in stages; the targets Richard must deal with if he is to get his revenge Â we are systematically told what Richard is up against but there is also that nice little touch of Richard showing up now and again with scare tactics.
The sound and lensing is very poor, so much so that the blurred effect of the projected image eventually gave me a headache.
We find that she looks very much like a blonde version of the dark haired beauty Blanche, so much so that they could be sisters, which is, of course, a miscast Jane, no matter how fine her performance.
Writing has never been the strong suit in these kinds of films, so that could be forgiven if the fan service is up and running.
Now, his doctor father has lured a band of suspects to his isolated house so that the comatose victim's telekinetic powers can reek some bloody revenge upon them.
Patrick's scientist father owns a villa with a lab in the basement where he conducts experiments to strengthen Patrick's mind powers so that he can one day seek revenge for his condition.
The locations chosen capture the actual places represented so that the whole has the verisimilitude of a documentary film, even while the spectator is drawn into the lives of the characters whose stories are being told.
The film starts off with a disclaimer stating that a true Buddist would sacrifice to live their life in hell so that another would be spared the same fate.
I didn't miss a single movie, and I say that with the proviso that I am not capable of understanding Chinese.
But make sure it's either a rental or you have it on TIVO so that you can just fast forward to his scenes......
At that time, I barely knew who the Twins were (I still haven't seen the Twins Effect, and I don't think I ever will), so that only made the whole thing more surreal.
I found myself praying for a "it was only a dream" sequence at the end, and I deeply loathe those, so that only goes to show how little I appreciated this film.
Third, it brings to focus, an era of vaudeville entertainment, that is no longer with us, so that we can only get a glimpse of what this was like from recreations and documentaries like this.
Globetrotters, par excellance, the travels of Sam and Fleming provide effective narrative ballast, and in particular, Fleming's adept narration carefully focuses our attention, so that we feel privy to the historical events Sam lived through during the early and mid 20th century.
First, Papillon wants to prostitute him to distract a guard so that he can escape: He lets Papillon know in no uncertain terms that he's "not a whore" and that "Between the two of us, I'm the one who's killed a man."
To continue to live, so that the legacy her daughter left behind lives on forever.
You do get ideas about how you'd like to have that much money so that you could live on a yacht without responsibility and the promise of toast after toast with your latest shag, but the continual slaughter of sharks, sea turtles and stingrays for a movie such as this leaves one filled with guilt.
The repetitious mÃ©nage-a'-trois situation results in some serious padding and a generally tedious film; that said, the shark scenes aren't very creatively handled either (apart from the gore) Â so that it can't hope to offer any real competition to the Spielberg classic it's imitating!
But he only has a wife so that the movie can show us that not all Southern whites are murdering racists.
Linda did this by getting Kelly to, sub-consciously, track down C.J and find his dad Sam Philips, Chris Hardwick; so that C.J can have someone to look after and care for him as he grows up into adulthood.
Katzin tells the story mostly from the POV of Page's character so that after a while the audience is actually identifying with her.
In addition to that, I enjoyed: 1) the timing--the movie consists of three shorts and I appreciate the order in which the three are presented; 2) sense of humor--the second short is quite charming and I thought well written from a child's point of view--it avoids being an adult pretending to be a child; 3) long dance scenes--there must be several three minute scenes with no editing cuts (the music is so strong that whenever I hear a piece by Faure, if it's not the piece in this one scene it reminds me of it, that I must stop a few seconds because the memory is so alive); 4) the deep exploration of "what is right" --I not only appreciate the presentation of the two sides of every decision presented in all of the shorts, but also that a quick Hollywood solution is resisted; and finally 5) a young Kirk Douglas--which is the old fashioned manly-man.
Arbuckle (in a car with right-hand drive) is lured to a remote location on a ruse, so that he'll be away when burglars invade his house.
This is one of those movies where the set pace of events are known to the audience, so that when it reaches it's conclusion we are aware that what we (the audience) might wish can happen for the two leads is not going to be possible.
I am also glad that they have begun to rerun it occasionally on Sunday nights, so that when we do miss a show, we can catch up.
Like his previous movie "The Passion of the Christ," Gibson lets the characters talk in their native tongue (here it's the dialect of the Mesoamericans) so that you have to put up with subtitles.
Well, it's a Mel Gibson movie after all, so that's a given.
And indeed he simply seems to float along the stream of life so that events occur TO him; rather than he be in control of his life.
I really enjoyed this film, I was not sure where it was going to go - so that just added to the suspense.
I wish more people would know this film so that the satirical line "Merci, Simca" would be a household word - to diffuse Regis' line "Is that your final answer".
How did they edit the film so that that particular effect worked?"
I still have the old VHS copy of the movie, but would like to find and purchase a newer copy so that someday my kids could enjoy it as well.
She rigged it so that whoever discovered the ship and reactivated it in the future would be stuck on it in a collision course with Earth.
Eventually Pascal, who claims to know everyone, offers to help out by delivering bandleader Louis Prima to Il Paradiso so that they will profit from the publicity.
But the film, though sweet, also establishes an undertone of such mournfulness that the viewer is not surprised when Prima never shows up, in fact, was never going to show up; it was a brutal trick by Pascal, who recognizes the brothers' abilities, so that they would be forced to close the restaurant and, he hopes, go to work for him.
When a friend of his is killed in a "death trap" flier called The Shenendoah, Billy sets himself up for a court martial so that he can bring his cause to the American public.
Peter Jackson and co narrate the story in a completely straight, documentary style, while the inclusion of interviews with real life industry figures such as Harvey Weinstein, Leonard Maltin and Sam Neil lends the film an air of absolute authenticity (so much so that, as the DVD making-of reveals, for 24 hours after the initial showing of the film on TV, New Zealand thought it had discovered a lost national hero).
Director Bahman Ghobadi was an enthusiastic show-up for the 3rd screening and gave many interesting tidbits during his Q&A such as info on the banning of female singing and musicians in present day Iran for the past 28 years, that his self-censorship on the film did not help it to get past Irani censors so that he may re-cut the film for the later general international release now anyway (restoring more scenes of female singing & playing) and that the whole 7 months of seeking for travel permits subplot in this film was a nod to the struggles he had to get his earlier "Turtles Can Fly" film made.
Its a movie that requires you go through it more than once so that you can see it fresh and peel away some of the layers each time you watch it.
The battle begins almost before we know anyone really so that there is this odd distance at the start.
Indeed for all three of the purported flag-raisers, the true heroes were those veterans who sacrificed their lives so that the flag could be raised on Iwo Jima.
I never missed an episode and would purposely stay at home between 6:30-7:00 PM on Sunday nights so that I could watch it.
who manage to get under the skin of his guest through humour so that we get to know more about them than another well-rehearsed anecdote.
Now the show's rules are being deliberately ignored so that 'voted-out' contestants can be brought back, resulting in understandable viewer fury.
In an effort to make up for a poor story and poor acting, the producers and directors give us a full serving of hot young bodies to stare at so that (they must hope) completely miss the fact that the movie is horrible.
Hey, I'm a sentimental guy, so that sounded good enough for me to spend a few bucks on the rental about a dozen years ago.
A psychiatrist, Dr. Marcus Collier who is the head of the Institute of Behavioral Studies, is having an affair with one of his patients and is using extreme methods to render information from her during hypnosis sessions so that he can write a revolutionary book.
When Forrester leaves the navigator to march on by himself, he doesn't move him under shelter so that he'll have shade when the sun comes up.
Years after watching it the first time round, I was delighted to have my hands on that "new" technology, the VCR, so that I could watch "I, Claudius" whenever I liked.
Whats more, the movie progresses in such a way so that because we are being gradually introduced more and more into her daily reality (caring for her brother, teaching, etc); the culmination of her expressing her opinion (that she is actually providing male clients with a worthwhile and much- needed service) never seems audacious.
Such is their dedication to capturing realism that they are willing to follow the killer around and allow the murders to happen so that they can capture it all on tape.
Another tip is make sure the anti hero has family issues like a long lost brother who he hates so that when he dies the tough macho anti hero starts weeping like a big girl .
It entertains the hell out of me so that's as perfect as it needs to be.
Starting off, let me tell you that I've never seen any of the previous Flash series before, so that might explain my openness.
Sam Elliott himself must have been instructed to stand side-on to the sun wherever possible so that his batch would stand gnomon-like and tell the time.
Veteran French actor Jean-Paul Roussillon provides humour as the drunken upstairs neighbour who must sneak cigarettes from Mr Zao so that his interfering wife doesn't know he is smoking.
By the way, it's a crime that this perfect gem hasn't yet been let loose into the world on DVD so that the digital generation can marvel at its horror.
In Escape From New York crime has risen to astronomic proportions, so much so that the entire island of Manhattan is now one big prison surrounded by the National Police Force.
that's overdoing it, well I hope by now I have written enough, so that my comment will be posted
I haven't seen Little Nicky yet, so that may be his best.
There wasn't much of a story line here, but its a comedy so thats not really a big problem.
One reason why the ending is so exciting is that the characters have been carefully developed so that you care about them at the end.
Wilbur indeed wants to kill himself, tries and tries again, so that you immediately understand from the onset that the point of the film will be his finding a reason not to.
Why he did this was partly because he was a nice person and part of this was so that he could rebuild his fortune and regain his old factory.
Why people vote so low ?,i cant see what i wrong on this movie ,i saw worse...,and you have to think also in the back of your head it is a TV movie so that means less money to make that film..,i think they forgot that ,so the film is about a virus that comes free on a plane cash and than you see the results if such thing can happen...,very realistic if you think of the real life now Anthrax ....and that kind of stuff...so...i think people rate it too low they underestimated the script,the crew also was good a few good actors and actresses.
The only skill the director and producer have is to lead you along so that just as you think it can't get much worse, it does.
I assume this side story of love was added to try and get some emotion from the audience so that the ending of the film could pull some tears out.
I think that everyone (who has an open mind) should go see this movie...and then go again and take someone who doesn't have an open mind so that it can be opened by the hilarious things said and done in this movie.
if anyone out there knows how i can obtain a copy of this fantastic, much overlooked classic, please please please can they get in touch with me at nikimeijei@aol.com and let me know so that i may finally finish a film i began watching sometime in the late nineties.
I wish someone would put warning labels on movies like this so that you do not waste your money or more importantly--your time.
It's such a brilliant mix of everything, personally I don't think there's anything wrong with it, I know I'm probably too old to like that sort of stuff but I watch anything me if the trailer looks good, I'm more into CGI/animation movies, there's soo much more that they can do compared to live-action and if Astro Boy had been live-action then it wouldn't have been as good because they wouldn't have been able to accomplish half the stuff they did in the CGI version, hell I don't even know how they managed with the live-action series back then :S But seriously, if this is your kind of movie, don't listen to what the bad reviews are telling you, experience it for yourself and just watch it, because it is a really fun/thrilling movie that can really make you smile, just as it did with me :)  Another good thing is that they haven't changed anything too drastically, normally when a movie is adapted from TV or a book they tend to change it, sometimes too much but I feel that they have changed it only slightly so that it appeals greater to our modern ages, the great thing though is that Astro is the same.. you know, same name, look, even the undies... but at least he's wearing clothes.. well up until the end... ha ha :D Although I'm not really sure what to think about the new characters apart from the RRF who are just hilarious, but I guess some of the others resemble or remind me of the old ones but the one in particular is Cora, who is mean't to be seen as a potential love interest for Astro (I think...) is just not needed really, I mean she's probably there just to fill up the space, I don't think there's an actual reason, I mean I can't see them getting together and stuff... but maybe that's just me.
Folks seem to like this film but then I've heard that IQ's have been dropping so that might say something as well.
But after watching it, I feel like this is a documentary that I could show my parents so that they can better understand the Open Source Community that I call myself a member of.
It is fairly nasty in a visceral sort of way but it's also derivative, (it's "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" in all but name), and appallingly acted, (look out, in particular, for the elderly European couple with the walking frame), so that any serious point it may be making is lost.
I think the people who don't like that should support movies like that, so that next time the film company will have enough money to make a movie with better graphics
Hurley is shown semi-nude briefly a couple of times, so that may either peak your interest or turn you off; not for younger viewers.
Also that is a great job on Inaritu's part being able to capture that emotion.
He eats at the same restaurant, sits at the same table, if someone is seating at his table he insults them to make them leave so that he has his table back, wants the same waiter Carol to wait on him, and takes forever to take a shower.
Anyway, we are now in the present and the recently awakened warlock uses his scarecrow body to kill various Goodmans(..and others in his path)looking to retrieve his magical book of spells and reunite with his bones so that he can return to fleshly form even more powerful than he is as a walking man of string.
But it seems the film has now drifted into public domain, and the result is incredibly dire: a very muddy soundtrack coupled to a picture that shudders and shakes so that you can barely stand to look at it.
I will look forward to seeing this feature film in more festivals, or perhaps on TV and DVD , so that more people will get to enjoy a time to be remembered.
Spike comes off as a big idiot who is only capable of sleeping and eating, his fighting abilities appear forced so that Mr. Watanabe wouldn't be stuck with the dumbest lead character since that (insert following curse word: combine the one which begins with "s" and ends with "t" + the British slang one which is "a" + "r" + "s" + "e") from DNA2.
He tries to collect more floating bottles in the sea than other orphan boys of his age so that he can earn more and buy magazines with colorful pictures of aircrafts.
He's the spoiled rich boy in a girl meets boy story striving for a Cinderella touch, since the girl is a poor waitress posing as the daughter of a rich couple so that they can mingle with high society.
No doubt also that Howard Keel and Kathryn Grayson sang beautifully together.
I thought also that the director was getting a little too experimental.
Who comes up with a plan on banning their men from having sex with them just so that they can keep their neighborhood drug free?
They're both recent Asian films offering tribute and parody of the same (outwardly) American genre, so that's understandable, but I think SWD is better compared and contrasted with "The Quick and the Dead".
Love, to me, isn't a "trait of personality" sufficient enough in a movie character so that I care about it.
This script should keep viewers interested throughout and I will definitely be renting this film so that I can savour it without interminable commercials.
She convinces an antique dealer Jurakuso (Fumio Okura) to give her money to pay off Furusawa so that Jurakuso can become Umekichi's patron, but she ends up pocketing half of the money herself.
When Bruce Dickinson re-enters the stage, the dramatic re-entrance is taken away, so that you can't see him!
I remember laughing into my pillow so that no one would hear me!
It's "episode 14" too, so that should tell you something.
It was yanked out of circulation so that a pair of bookends could be shot, in which the story becomes a kind of parable told by a wise old rector (Dana Andrews) to a younger priest undergoing a pastoral crisis.
The renegade time lord, Berusa, controls the mind of the fifth doctor, when he works out that Berusa is up to something, in attempt to gain immortality, so that he can be the Lord President of Gallifrey forever.
I have not read the novel this movie is based on, but judging the movie by itself, when the credits rolled, I was thinking: "Uh, so that was it??"
In this instance, a man is framed for the murder of his wife so that he will go to prison and participate in a "death race".
La Face cachÃ©e de la lune is a brilliant Canadian film which has human being's fascination for moon as its backdrop.It is for this purpose that we are taken to 1950s when efforts were being made to send a man to moon.We witness how two major scientific powers America and Russia do all that they can in order to outdo each other.All this is done by them so that somebody is able to establish supremacy in all matters related to travel on moon.
Faced with imminent starvation, the girl's mother decides to disguise her daughter as a boy, so that she will have an opportunity to work.
It shows the story of a young girl who is forced to disguise herself as a boy so that she can work and feed her hungry mother and grandmother.
One of the first scenes you see in the film is that of a rally of women all asking for jobs so that they could feed their families.
"Hope"...Osama, the girl forced to be transformed into a role as boy so that she can go unescorted to work in order to bring home a watermelon and a few scraps of meet for the family, is just so filled with this "hope" as she "embarks on a terrifying and confusing journey" to avoid detection from the taliban (this is not the journey you or i may take after paying five to tens of thousands of dollars to some guru to become enlightened)...NOT!!!
Stillman strikes just the right note in a story that touches on pains and fears that are genuinely daunting (divorce of parents, love unrequited, etc) as well as the comic value of his characters' earnestness and foibles, keeping just the right distance so that comedy keeps just ahead; all leading to the modest but charming triumph of the shy and virtuous protagonists.
She shows us the soul of her comic character so that we see her longings and disappointments - her angst.
Then, her budding love for Toby is hidden by her and Toby so that they can foster a publicity campaign that they are rivals.
It was somewhere in Judith Warner's blog at the NYT that I got my fist urge for '24' Â yeah I had heard about, it was on Fox, so that made watching it pretty much out of the question.
On second thought, let's just make the professionals as stupid as possible, so that we can insure more episodes and, thus, greater ad revenue.
I saw this film for the first time yesterday on the local Spanish channel which runs a series of classics in the original language, so that I saw it in French.
an emotional roller-coaster which leaves you staring at the credits in la la land long after you should have gotten up and fetched that other beer.....i find it strange that the most compelling story i have witnessed on film is not readily available on DVD..in NTSC format at least and also that adrenaline pumping ...Tyral Hicks scene.. which brings these riveting stories to their anti climax..or climax if you may..is hidden away in fine print in the cast listing by billing......is there anyone who can help me source the DVD in NTSC format.
The movie so moved me that I wanted to invite my sister and all of my women friends to share this amazing story with me, so that they, too, could experience the message behind the movie: no matter how entrenched or static a situation is, things can be changed with persistence and will; we really can make a difference.
He didn't use it as a central focus of the film (until the end), and used it sporadically so that it really didn't feel as if it was being used.
Some of the biggest fans are from 15-25, so that's where I'm guessing Rouge came from.
Much of the lesbian content was never filmed, and most of the rest landed on the cutting room floor -- so much so that you know there are missing pieces as you watch; it's often obvious you're seeing the second part of something without a preceding scene to establish it.
I loved how he took a nap by locking himself in one of his back jail cells--so that no one could sneak up on him!
When he is assigned to appear in a live TV show as guest star, his reputation for booze gets him assigned to the care of Benjy Stone (MARK LINN-BAKER), a Brooklyn kid whose job it is to protect O'Toole from further exploits with the bottle so that he can perform as scheduled before a live audience.
The movie is supposedly about a group of teen agers who are all pushing 26 or so that find themselves trapped in a web of terror & murder patterned after a movie script found in the basement of a house next to a studio.
Maybe someone will do a Lester retrospective (he also did the Beatles' first films)so that this masterpiece can finally find the audience it deserves.
If you think that earning money, and buying the right things, or saving so that you CAN buy the right things is something that people do without any troubles, then you have to watch this movie.
or maybe they were looking for at least 1 movie so that they could say "hey, we are also producing serious flicks!!"
People figure out and do things primarily because they need to--and fast--so that everything can arrive where it needs to arrive in less than 90 minutes.
In reality, Zohan deliberately fakes his death so that he can immigrate to New York City and realize his life-long dream of cutting hair for Paul Mitchell.
I disagree with Ebert's review, which said this was simply one of those ridiculous movies where "the whole world was a stage, and millions of people were fighting and dying so that these two goofballs could swap spit?"
There's also that stupid joking black guy who serves absolutely no purpose (except getting killed).
However, the way Mark and Martha little by little discover the origin of the doom in the house is very suspending: Valkos was very violent and mysterious so that could logically be declared that he caused most of the horror.
And if you really are determined to see it on the big screen, leave 30 minutes early so that you won't be disappointed with the ending.
So much so that I have always kept an eye out for anything by Lodge Kerrigan since.
Here is a film that says if you're not thin; not somewhat easy on the eye; not Caucasian or if you are somewhat physically deformed in some way, then there is absolutely neither no space nor no hope for you in this world; and if you DO NOT see to these 'flaws' immediately by way of 'correcting' them, then it's encouraged that you find some small space somewhere so that you may crawl up inside of it and die.
People lobby to get, what is to them, grotesque and disgusting films censored; banned; pulled; destroyed; locked away in a vault somewhere so that no one can find them Â but where are these people when Date Movie is released?
In all I counted about 4 scenes which made me laugh, I won't spoil them for you so that if you do happen to get dragged to this flick you will have some comic relief.
As always, I'm Johnny Betts, and I'm watching bad movies so that you don't have to.
So much so that I shed a little tear at the end.
I have called the Australian Television Association and requested numerous times to play it on TV so that I could record it, but I've had no luck.
I just pray that that show, the little of it that was recorded, becomes available on video so that I can buy it.
When Tommy put down the camera she unloaded the shotgun so that if the aliens did come within firing range, they would not get hurt.
The starship USS Enterprise is orbiting around the planet so that Kirk can give the two new food supplies and the ship's physician, Dr. Leonard "Bones" McCoy (DeForest Kelley), can check on their medical condition.
Momma never said nothing bout no hand trying to stab me so that jus didn't seem right.
Momma never said nothing bout no hand trying to stab me so that jus didn't seem right.
Jodha-Akbar is a motley of exceptional love,Terrific Action,Soulful music and splendid cinematography.It is one of the most uncommon films and a must see one if you want to witness something special.The film got combative stunts and it has everything to please everyone.But on the other side,the film is slow and lengthy.The first half of the film lasts more than 2 hrs yet the twists and turns will glue the audience to the cinema.Hrithik was awesome as Akbar and Aishwarya was majestic as Jodha.Direction was at the best.Ashutosh proved yet another blockbuster which falls in the same line of Lagaan and Swades.May be he need to concentrate on the duration of the film by chopping off few scenes.Jodha Akbar is basically a love story instead of calling it as a War based film.The film lacks pace and slow narration of few scenes and the frequent usage of Urdu language made the audience ambiguous and also boring.But at the other end,even though the film lasts for more than 3.30 min,it is gripping enough and very much bearable.The Director need to edit the film and make it as a 3 hrs film so that the audience will like this film even more.The huge star-cast of Hrithik-Ash playing as Akbar and Jodha might have evoked a lot of curiosity among the audience before the release but i must admit the film almost lived up to the expectations.The love part was dealt exceptionally well and it is the forte for the film.The film depicted the Legacy of Akbar.The film also shown that Akbar did lot good for Hindus.
Still, the story is different enough, so that "Gloomy Sunday" stands on its own as a wonderful movie.
Powell was an actor whose appearance didn't change from role to role, but he was able to internalize a character so that he always seemed different.
Meanwhile, the father is trying to court a rich bitch so that he won't be disinherited by an aunt (Angela Lansbury).
Though it is a children's movie, the script is written so that it can be enjoyed on an adult level.
Unlike most of today's films (which assume movie goers are idiots) it presents a story with a logical beginning, middle and ending, so that if you accept the world it creates, that world can be followed to its satisfying conclusion.
No mini-adults here, who are filled with all Macully Caulkin knowledge and wisdom so that if only--if only--the adults would just simply listen to them--why then, the world would be a perfect place where everyone would just get along so well together.
They are always avoided in the movie, and her whole life is unveiled slowly, so that we are led to believe her when she says that the city dumpster was the best thing in her life.
Also, how Woodley just changes the end of the storyline so that they get off the island safely.
), part epic adventure (even if the widescreen aspect ratio in the edition I watched wasn't quite the full 2.55:1 format of its original presentation), and part 'woman's picture' (despite Power's top billing, he's off-screen for long stretches at a time, so that Hayward emerges as the real protagonist Â given also that she's involved with three men and undergoes many a hardship during the course of the film).
This supposed 50s-style teen angst comedy is best viewed really late at night so that the rotten acting and putrid storyline can fight with the pathetic 50s music soundtrack in sending you to sleep.
Speaking with the firmness and controlled confidence of someone who has had to endure, Rose (Gisch) indicates that she has not only survived her father's alcoholism and abuse, but also that the quality of her life has progressed well beyond the one afforded by her parents' pathetic relationship.
But the only thing that annoyed me about this game was that if you where low on health and you try to return to a town just to get healed or buy medicine a monster or monsters may ambush you killing you so that you lost money as well as experience.
Her name is Norma and she is going to help Joe write her script so that she can make a comeback.
So God, please send your son down here so that he can do that Lazarus thing and bring back Billy.
I liked also that characters who were given little to to in the film were fleshed out nicely here-ie.
The characters designs and the story itself have to be toned down so that children (or stoners) can follow the story without becoming too freaked out by orcs.
The footage was then studied and brilliantly rotoscoped, so that it actually looks like there are citizens of Minas Tirith cheering on the coming of their King!
Because she did not play white characters, Fredi Washington had to darken her skin with makeup in films so that she could play blacks.
Oh well, I'll have to add this movie to my collection so that I can chuckle every time I think of a killer boob.
I'm in a good mood so that's why I'm not going to get into detail about it's flaws (oh, there are MANY).
(Though "Karaula" seems to be presenting Halid Beslic with an ironic distance, his appearance is essentially no different from "Tesna Koza" or "Zikina Dinastija" stopping the plot for 2 minutes so that Brena, Sneki, Zorica Brunclik or whomever can sing their little song.
He's a paint-by-numbers actor who manages to say everything so that, no matter what he says, it bores me to tears.
And not just emotional growth, as modern animation is often so limited to, but also that he is maturing in a natural/physical way, so that you can really imagine him becoming a strong and brave prince.
I just hope some network brings this series back one day so that I'll be able to see every episode.
Dick and Joanna leave the hustle and bustle of the big city to operate an historic inn in rural Vermont so that he could write his how-to books in peace and quiet.
The lovely performances by Banlop Lomnoi and Sakda Kaewbaudee, as the two men drawn into this surrealistic drama, help to ground the film enough in reality so that we go along with it even when we don't always understand it.
If someone knows a worse movie than this please let me know so that I can fulfill my revenge.
I wouldn't have minded if the characters had simply begun shooting themselves, just so that we'd all be put out of our misery.
Then there's the bit where Sid James shoots holes in the water refill tank and they need to find a new source of water - the river holds the apparent solution, so the drivers bang on the windows of the train and order all the passengers out so that they can help them (!)
The "Angela" aspect of the film is also played down quite a bit, so much so that this really could have been any typical camp slasher unrelated to the "Sleepaway Camp" series.
There's Ms. Puke-face who dates Mr. Lays-all-the-chicks who falls for Ms. Post-Meno-Mom, but wait Ms. Puke-face bows out so that the two STARS can romance each other and then along comes Dr. Do-right who ALSO bows out (talk about a non-Alpha-male type) in Paris (no less) so the Geritol-set couple can finally after two tedious hours ... who cares?
This corpse of a movie is best remained buried in an unmarked grave so that no-one will have to endure the feeling that they have not only wasted 97 minutes of their life, but leave the theatre knowing something has died deep within them.
Taj admits that he stole the test materials so that his pals can continue to compete in the tournament.
Exhibit A: the two younger brothers manage to keep a straight face and wait -- holding their fight stance -- for thirty seconds as the three bad guy adults struggle to get out of their costumes and dress up again so that the kids can yell "NINJAS!!!"
Stereotypical bad guys and Stereotypical good guys (the leader of the special forces team sent in to rescue the Vice President is a gung ho idiot so that the main film hero can take over - oh my god).
The movie is about 40 minutes long, so that is a plus because usually movies like this that are too long are hard to watch all the way through.
This one is one of his best and I am delighted to have now bought it on VHS so that I can watch it many times, which I plan on doing.
As the monastery's finances hit an all-time low, Nacho decides to join a wresting tournament so that he can win the prize money and provide good food for the monastery's orphanage.
Of course, Marins mastery of cinematic metaphysics throws all matter of logic and rationality to the dogs, so that what you get instead is a wild journey into the dark realms of the unconscious.
Word has it that production of this movie was rushed so that it could be released before The Ring came out.
You see little blood and nobody is squibbed so that bloody explosions erupt when they are shot or wounded.
This aggravates Nick so much so that his father's deputy Hap catches Nick taking a shotgun from the rifle rack.
The final sequence shows our hero freediving (he lowers his heart rate to 40bpm so that the sharks will not be afraid of him) in a banana sling with some sharks.
One can only hope the principals of this picture will learn something from this, and do two things with their next film -- slow it down to a brisk walk, so that the plot can develop, and hire an actor who can express nuances, and something emotional, besides disgust.
There, so that's why this movie is so so horrible!!!!
But this fake interview is so that Murphy's character can actually gain info about her boyfriend's exes so that she can find more out about him while also doing the background for a potential show about little black books, but then it turns out later she isn't going to do the story about the black books, but then we aren't really sure.
This is, unfortunately, simply a Til Schweiger (popular German heartthrob) delivery medium -- the story was written so that he wouldn't have to step outside of the same role he always plays: a smirky, semi-jerk who, in the end, proves he really does have a heart if everyone will just give him a (2nd) chance to show it.
Had I been in Donald's shoes, I would have made sure the house was more accessible, made it so that there was a phone near my wife's bed and didn't leave for London until Nurse Mary was in the house.
Camps are built in areas where clear fields of fire can be created so that daylight surprise attacks like the one depicted in the movie cannot happen.
The gory deaths are so horrifying that I think it's a good idea that they were cut out so that you don't just zone out and miss the next 20 seconds of intense action and suspense!
It's as if she is saying, "No, Mr Wyler, Laura will not pose naked but I will take lots of photos of Laura in erotic poses so that you can ogle her young naked body at your leisure."
Satanist Reed Weller (William Smith) need to get 103 children for sacrifice (the last one must be a virgin) so that he can become immortal.
Actually, I don't want to reflect too much on how bad the movie was, just try to warn others so that they might not suffer the same fate as me.
I hope that enough people are see this film so that Boll can keep doing what he enjoys and sharing it with people.
Problem #2 was the fragmented quality of the storytelling; we're constantly skipping backwards and forwards in time and cutting from one set of characters to another with just brief snatches of dialogue, so that no scene has a chance to build and it becomes extremely difficult to follow the complicated story.
Likewise the shots of cars behind Dennis, most Marathons keep the roads closed for at least 5 hours for slow runners & stragglers so that wouldn't just happen either.
Again, as this series has done so may times in the past, the murderer has been changed and the entire plot of the novel reworked so that even those murdered during the course of the book are changed.
Just to tell you one scene: the police are searching for Snipes, and they are surrounding the building with helicopters and cars, they are shooting around inside the building, but still they are whispering so that Snipes doesn't suspect a thing.

After watching Black, I wished I were blind and deaf so that I would never have had to endure this movie or its fantastic reviews.
If I could go back in time I would go back to the beginning of Conrad John's lineage and smite his ancestors so that he may never make a movie such that is this.
In addition to the dismal screenplay, the director can't even properly frame a shot, plus the DP armed with a low end camcorder screws up the color balance in each shot so that every scene has a sickly green tint to it.
There are a few decent bloody scenes, so that's why I'm rating it so generously with a three.
Many movies choose topics so that they can't be attacked or questioned: racism, the Holocaust, genocide, pederasty, the heroes of 911, Hitler, etc.
Also the guy playing the main Jeff character can't act worth garbage so that's another reason to cancel this travesty.
Too bad the director and producer weren't among the victims so that we could have been spared this travesty to film making.
We should pray for financial ruin to befall whoever financed this ridiculous twaddle so that these people can never make another film ever again.
An initial scene shows a process of repeatedly subcontracting a crime through a series of middle-men, each passing on the job for half of what he receives, so that the immediate perpetrator receives on 5% of the initial payment.
Under threat of death, the journalist is persuaded to summon the district attorney, so that the killers can dispatch them both.
Meanwhile, the highest official of the financial firm has learned of the fraud, and commits a murder-suicide so that insurance can repay the missing funds.
The film they screened was in pristine condition until the last two or three reels, when much of the color had faded so that everything had a pink tone.
But to look for logic in this screwed up mess of a movie is like looking for a needle in a hay-stack, with the difference that the hay-stack is covered with manure, so that it isn't even tempting to look for the needle.
My roommate and I rented three movies and this was one of them...We should have saved it for last so that we could watch something funny before we went to bed.
I started cheering for the monster to kill off everyone so that the stupid film would end already.
And the genius Viktor is so totally stupid that he just can't help pissing off the murderous creature and then putting his loved ones conveniently in its path and running off somewhere so that it can have an easy uninterrupted go of it.
Viktor even conveniently screams NOOOOOOOOOO instead of shooting at it so that it could run away and seek vengeance.
The director is childish to think she can direct, since any good director would change lines, direct actors to react a certain way and frame the shot so that is not in a constant 3-shot.
Originally added so that there would be a man who could "bail out" the Angels, he was really too stuffy for the show's fluff.
Maybe it was meant to just make the audience dumber from watching it so that they would think that it was good.
I do this so that I can get my 10 lines published because they won't publish it unless I submit 10 lines of commentary for publication.
There are many reasons why I don't like World of Warcraft:  1)World of Warcraft costs money per month  2)It is very evident that the game is constructed to be as slow as possible so that people never reach the ultimate end.
I thought horror movies were supposed to make feel nausea and scare so that sh*t in your pants.
This whole awful flick was produced by Tom so that simply makes this a 'Cruise-Mobile'.
I believe he told Buffy that she does not love him, just because he knew that he would die and he wanted her to leave so that she would not die as well.
My girlfriend talked about wanting to see this movie for months on end and so finally I gave in and got it for her so that we could watch it together.
The director needs to get a huge collection of DVD's so that he can get some inspirations of file making.
The fights in the movie are done pretty naive, but there is one definitely good thing: it lasts 1 hour and 15 mins, so that is good, one cannot get bored so much, but that is too short for a movie, because the story is cut to a bunch of scenes which go one after another without cohesion, well thats my personal opinion.
It's an idiot's guide, everything has been boiled down and battered and chewed up so that a younger and less patient audience can easily digest it.
and Rodney Dangerfeild should kick it so that we can remember how good he was doing stand up and in Caddyshack.
I'd personally love to see a silver screen version of this book so that more details of the story could be shown (there was a lot that couldn't be shown on t.v.
With a supposed budget of about $1,000,000 Grim Reaper was a reasonably well funded film & it show's with it's decent production values although as I have already said the film is terrible so that doesn't really matter.
I was thinking 'Was it the script' because so much of the dialog and interaction was so awkward; but a good director can work around that and fix it enough so that it doesn't turn out THIS bad.
They want Randy to come out of retirement and win enough games so that Feng will invite him to one of his illegal underground table tennis tournaments held once every five years.
Feng has designed an automatic pistol made of polymer so that it doesn't trip airport alarms.
I had thought in the past that they were just defecating cheap movie scripts so that they could make money and continue producing fine work on television.
Mutton dressed as lamb more like as the whole film seems to have been produced so that Joanie can appear in a scene dressed in her underwear .
I kept thinking that the screenplay would show us more about Buck so that viewers could come to care about him.
Maggie Smith's performance (and I am a fan of Maggie's) was just too loud, too dramatic, just way too over the top, so that when her sad side emerged, it came across as equally phony.
they are all really shallow and spoiled and whiny; kind of like those rich Disney girls must be in real life, so that is why i don't understand how the acting sucks so bad because probably they are just playing themselves anyways.
the music is nothing good or special but its so much easier to just cut into some dance video than have a script that is worth my time, so that's what happens in this movie.
Bright spot is Starr Andreeff as Stevens' beautiful love-interest who may possibly become a victim of the rampaging gargoyle..in the plot, the gargoyles rape and impregnate other human females so that their race may breed and grow;Sue, when attempting to assist her hurt lover, is captured and victimized by the rubber fiend.
It's a cheesy and minimally plotted 80's earthbound "Alien" imitation and it's produced by Roger Corman, so that ought to give you an immediate idea about the overall quality of this production.
If I tell you anymore, I end up telling you the ending, so that's enough of the synopsis.
It is best viewed when drinking or sick so that the pain can be numbed a little.
The biggest and most obvious problem are the voice actors--their voices are too mechanical and bigger than life--so much so that they seem nothing like real people at times.
RENT has the sort of timeless banality that is purposely built into TV sitcoms so that they can play eternally in reruns; if the dialogue didn't mention what year it takes place, it would be difficult to tell.
Director Chris Columbus makes little effort to experiment in staging or editing the musical numbers; when he isn't obviously copying A CHORUS LINE or HAIR, Columbus gives us an endless array of static shots of characters standing and singing; so much so that the rare inventive moment, such as Rapp and Tracie Thoms nicely doing "The Maureen Tango," seem strangely out of place.
A prologue announces the virtuous intention of depicting a moral scourge so that an informed public can combat it--but this is clearly just a CYA that allows the intriguingly-named "Personality Pictures" company to run this cheesy exploitation flick past the already toothless production code office.
There are only three goblin mask molds that they use on different midget or kid actors so that the goblins look inbred.
However, even they hated this movie and found it annoying, so that says something.
It is trying to retrieve the stupid looking crystals so that it can phone home.
I remember seeing this exact same premise on a Saved By the Bell episode where Zack and Screech plant audio subliminal messages in tapes of favorite rock group so that boys can present these tapes to the girls of their dreams hoping for a match.
While discussing her feelings the next day with her Psychiatrist Dr. Jeffery Rosenberg (Richard Benjamin) he finds out about the bite and says that she has been bitten by a Vampire & also that he is a descendant of infamous Vampire hunter Van Helsing.

so that he can make them confess that they are under the influence of Satan.
Women are treated as fodder to either slap around or grind up against (sometimes at the same time) all to a soundtrack of nameless rappers inserted at appropriate moments so that the white kids can know what its like to be African American.
Since the entire show could be put on under a big tree in the back yard, the words matter most here, so that the performances have characters to inhabit in telling their story.
I really think those men that get excited over movies like this should have a" I love tortured women" printed on their forehead, so that we know to keep our daughters and sisters away from your twisted selves.. :) LOL
Everything you could expect from a made-for-TV natural catastrophe movie is present and accounted for, so much so that even a few minor tweaks here-and-there still render it indistinguishable from the usual early Sunday-morning drivel.
Washed up, bloated, Ryan O'Neal is the star of this TV flick, so that should give you enough information to know just how bad "Epoch" is going to be.
A couple of scenes were close enough so that one could see a little depth, but not most of them.
What's worse is that it invokes a hefty glorification of gratuitous violence, so much so that it ruined the film (again IMAO).
If only there was a memorable villain, like Chucky or Jason, so that the kindergÃ¤rtners whose parents allow them to watch anything and everything, could remember something to talk about with their friends.
Yeah, so that was a lame above criticism, but it doesn't matter because this movie hits the pits pretty hard.
Sometimes i wish that i had a genie, so that i could wish that i had never seen this film.
or i could also wish that a voodoo doll came with the film, so that i could play with it and not watch the film.
It is a great movie to watch with the right people so that you can moan and groan together over the cheesy situations and classic predictable plot.
The story revolves around the bad guy in town named Bat Haines, who is fooling everybody and plotting two families against each other by stealing each other's calves and then setting it up so that each one blames the other.
I SO did not need to see that dwarf's butt cheeks the fifteen times or so that they showed them!
Her goal for the film, become William Shatner's teaching assistant so that she can get into Quantico and thus fulfilling her dreams to capture serial killers.
It's particularly annoying when characters are made stupid so that screenwriter get the story the way he wanted.
Why didn't Denzel try to contact ATF and just warn to abort that ferry travel so that they could safely dismantle the bomb, without risking all that people's life... Well i'll answer that, because screenwriter wanted to break people's heart after his death, just when love between he and "Claire" (Paula Patton) had been set.
And of course even more important was to make him appear once again, so that all people get happy again...
This is a Sunday's afternoon movie to watch with the family while pictionary is played, so that we don't take the movie too seriously.
The only requirement is that you be mindlessly horny (never question why the perfect 10 has to have you) and extremely naive so much so that it goes beyond belief.
Then these killers, generally speaking, develop a bond with these girls they abduct and do not kill while providing them everything so that they can break free and run, at times taking a hell of a beating at their hands yet doesn't kill.
It's almost like when you're in High School, bragging about how high you got, and the guy you're talking to lies so that he doesn't feel stupid for not partaking in substances like that: "Man, I got SOOOOoooo freaking high last night.
Other grievances: The pot-dealing redneck, who is only introduced so that he can be killed and Jason can find his hockey mask (a full HOUR into the film), is the single most disgusting character I've ever seen on-screen.
We get great gory close-ups of her slobbering kisses with some of the most disgusting men one has seen in a long time, one young blond fellow in particular whose mouth is larger than her face is wide, so that one wonders how she avoids being swallowed.
Miymato plays a recently-promoted tax auditor, and she is given the job of ferreting out his hidden income so that the proper tax is collected.
), so that those who don't like it can avoid it on time.
SPOILER ALERT: Worse still, the "killer" that is terrorizing the females (the detached penis of the protagonist), is never related psychologically to its owner, so that an opportunity for discussing male violence or a split between the civilized and savage parts of male desire, is missed.
so thats a huge mistake.
Well, the director, master craftsman Robert Anderson, who also has credits The Young Graduates and The Hoax (not the Richard Gere one, remember that for the exam), movies no one but his wife has probably seen, and so with Cindy and Donna, his first film, he puts everything he knows into his art... which means, basically, we get a scene like when Donna is totally 'doing it' with her pot dealer in the car at night, and Cindy is looking on but, you know, the angle of the car is so radical so that there's no way Cindy is looking in on the car that the angle of the camera is and... Maybe I'm getting ahead of myself, this is, after all, Grade-X trash that has basically no value; a Cinemax late-night flick probably has better production value, and maybe slightly worse music than the repetitive garage rock here.
Maybe people acted that way in 1943 (or MGM wanted people to think so, anyway), but it has this unreal, almost Wizard-of-Oz quality to it so that you can't really identify with or relate to any of the characters.
Most of the characters are unpleasant people, rude to each other and only in the expedition for money and publicity (except for Lance Hendrickson's character), so that it's impossible to care about what happens to them.
But the most frightening thing about Sasquatch is the number of missteps made: For some reason, Quastel thinks it's a good idea to chop up dialogue scenes that occur within minutes of each other in real time so that instead we see a few lines of scene A, then a few lines of scene B, then back to A, back to B, and so on.
I just managed to bear the movie as it got worse and worse and was thankful when it ended, which is when I realized that it didn't just feel long to me; it's also that the thing is way too long!
She changes law so that Sandler's character can marry her mother while still married to his own wife.
One wonders if the script actually said: 'At this point, the musical score will become hysterical, so that the audience knows someone is about to get killed.'
Shoot to Kill is entertaining, yes, and many with more consistent acting, but it clips along so that you just go with it.
The result is an unfinished painting, yet enough evidence is provided so that anyone with some imaginative sense can paint in the missing parts.
I recently saw this film at the Philadelphia Film Festival and reduced my expectations so that I was only going to enjoy the 3-D effects.
The old Seinfeld crew slowly piled up the dysfunctional quirks for most of the run of the show so that we got to LIKE the characters before their "quirks" became psychopathic.
It's very predictable how this movie ends, like all the other teen movies, so that the little girls can sleep well at night.
Who knows out of what strange game of fate or as if the universe conspired upon its creation and everything that came to pass did so that Tobe Hooper would make The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
Even when the sensory chaos is broken for a while so that our genre expectations can be fulfilled as the crippled guy Franklin mutters to a couple that leaves the abandoned house to make out "Yeah, see you in an hour or so" (followed by a drone in the score) and we just know he's never gonna see them again, a typically ominous foreshadowing common in slashers, that only lasts for seconds.
Nothing open-minded about it, It only guilts people into saying its good so that they feel smart of have an open mind, at least thats the only reason i can think of for someone to like this crap.
Oh, Japan had been feeling heat from the US congress in the form of trade barriers, threats of tariffs and whatnot since the 80's, so that could spark a theme against overwhelming economic power.
*EDIT: Also that last statement is untrue.
I was so mad when i realized the killer was not going to be a human, and also that the advertisements fooled my friends and i (probably as planned).
I know that I gave this movie a 4 and that I am complaining a lot about it, but the gore was pretty good and the sub-plot was pretty decent, so that's why it gets at least a 4.
Basically the story is about a car salesman who needs cash...fast, so he pays a couple of guys to kidnap his wife so that her rich father will pay the ransom, thereby getting him the cash he needs.
I would have liked to have her character developed more so that the impact of her abduction packs a bit more punch.
And John Rys-Davies is in this film, so that's good.
One good thing about it: it made me register at IMDb because I was so upset and wanted to write a review so that nobody else makes the mistake and spend a cent seeing this movie...
It's ironic that the novel Uncle Tom's Cabin was intended as an abolitionist work, and indeed did arouse sympathy for Blacks, (so much so that President Lincoln called its author, Harriet Beecher Stowe, "The little lady who started the Civil War") while this movie, in which Uncle Tom's Cabin plays a prominent part, is, by enlightened standards, crudely racist.
Maybe something does happen in the final 4 minutes or so that redeems the rest of the movie, but I rather doubt it and am willing to risk the loss, because like the movie itself, I just don't care.
These are the same people who think that if anything is weird or doesn't make sense, then it has some deeper meaning that they're missing, so they better pretend to see it so that they look smart.
This is one of the films which cause my wife to hide my remote from me, so that she doesn't have to endure any more of my weird movie selections.
Yet "Josey Wales" had rich moments of humor and warmth; so much so that I enjoy watching it every few years.
It isn't helped by the fact that the scriptwriters insist on changing the sequence of events in the movie so that they don't make sense like they did in the book.
Devgan is not only a builder but suddenly he is shown to be expert in every business so that he can send Kapoor to Thailand instead of Singapore for horticultural research.
I really can't even think of one nice thing to say about "Evicted" so that I don't sound totally negative.
If so please contact me at his_luv23@yahoo.com so that I may obtain a copy.
The director cleverly avoids flashbacks to the girl so that your memory of her appearance begins to fade.
And, not only did a flight simulator exist in the city, conveniently located so that genius and his pals can train to fly those jets, it's also powered and working after 1,000 years, electrically supplied by .... umm......dunno.

There were some good scenes and there may have been something worthwhile in the screenplay and some of the characters but ultimately the thing was edited to fit the formula so that that which may have been worthwhile was lost or left to sit shining alone with no beginning or resolution.
This is the kind of movie that makes one wish desperately for commercial breaks, so that one can have some kind of relief.
I will admit, it's something a little new with the zombie genre, but the fact is that it makes the zombies less threatening, so that sucks !
Okay so I laughed on and off throughout the entire picture, so that is why I gave it one step above a 1.
Some shots linger on for too long and are completely unnecessary, for instance a 1 or 2 minutes long shot of old whore Jasmine st Claire in the shower, it brings nothing to the film and doesn't join on to another scene, my guess is the male crew told Len it would make a good addition to the film and also that they should all watch.
Build a farmhouse out of a heap of timber, use the leftovers to glue a tower together with a propeller on it so that it vaguely resembles a windmill and... presto, we are in Holland!

The only movie that I have seen that is worse stars Susan Lucci, and she can't act her way out of a paperbag, so that isn't saying much (French Silk).
Very good for a made for TV movie, I just wish that I could get it on tape so that I could force all of my friends to watch it.
It seams that Sorbo fired writer and continued to create Andromeda so that he can look like a great hero.
Having said that however, I am glad that I finally saw this film so that I know what it was actually about, and I give the filmmakers a lot more credit for having created something that transcended novelty smut.
So we have this millionaire widow who's bank account is full of money they don't deserve and who can't keep her kids under control while spoon feeding them... and after all of that whacking it on TV so that the rest of the people on planet Earth know our lives will always be more meaningful...
I am off to ritually cleanse myself by watching Battlefield Earth and Tomb Raider so that my memories may no longer be tainted by such things as Sara Michelle Gellar trying to be anything other than Buffy.. or that nice pretty young thing she played in Cruel Intentions.  
And no, deliberately making the Confederates unrealistically expansionist so that the filmmakers could turn the Japanese (whose army murdered tens of millions of Asians before and during WWII) and the Central and South Americans (who have their own obsessions with skin color and racial ancestry) into blameless victims of Confederate aggression doesn't make the stereotypes any more palatable.

The boy starts reading "scary" stories so that she wont kill him, and the first one is about a mummy coming back to life and starts killing people and kind of making them mummy's too..
I'd like to get into the sheer horrors that this movie lays out there, but there is a one thousand word maximum, so that would be impossible.
If ever you're compelled to see this trash, press forward to the scene where Elvis runs amuck and smashes time and again a guy's skull with a tin can so that you'll realize how silly this awful flick is.

I rented this movie from my public library along with Beverly Hills cop 1 and 2.The first two were really great and when I was about to put it in I had a thought of 'how bad could it be'.Well the first 10 minutes were good but then all the comedy and good acting got taken away.I only became excited once when they had George Lucas has a cameo so thats not really saying much.
Even the music was redone so that only once in the films do we here it in its classic version.
Then, as the plane flies over the airport, he carefully and judiciously calculates wind speed, vector problems, and trajectory so that when he drops the poor sap, the body will rip into the Control Tower like a missile.
the graphics and animation are excellent and its nice to see the whole gang in CG form Sephiroth's still cool  now the reasons it only got a 4 well the characters feel like planks of wood with some of the worst voice acting I've ever seen(I've watched epic movie)  the movie just seems cloud orientated so much so that it make even the fans embarrassed with cloud this and cloud that.
This filming and editing effect is so subtly handled by both the highly experienced cinematographer and the editor so that the viewer's eyes move with the camera so effortlessly, and after a short while, get accustomed to it.
This is so much admired by Tamil speaking people around the world that it has been posted so many times as low resolution videos on both YouTube and GoogleVideo, so that you can watch it free in full as well as in parts.
Not a single African gets more than a superficial treatment in this movie, so that it seems that the principal characters are dreaming of an Africa without Africans.
In fact, I ached to have everyone machine-gunned halfway through the film so that I could go home!
The use of voice-over for Tilo's thoughts may have been necessary so that the audience could know about the different spices, but it just did not feel right.
Tone it down a little bit so that when you finally have that big makeover scene, there's a real reason to be impressed!
So, I held back from watching HELLWORLD so that I could have something to look forward to watching in the future (as I hadn't read ANY of the comments in this thread...) Finally, I decided to gave in and decided to watch it last night.
The dunderheads in helmets who rush by with fixed bayonets are unable to see legs showing behind false bushes, so that's all right, then.
The story is about a pair of overly-zealous FBI agents who die, get sent to hell and escape back to earth so that they can do some good deeds and earn a place in heaven.
Or it could have been done with an element of sex appeal to it, which doesn't even necessarily mean nudity, but something sexy about - and that would have been the better way to go with it so that it would at least get people talking about this scene, generate attention to at least one remotely memorable scene and as anybody knows (except for Ms. Vicky Hack-son) movies need a couple of very memorable - aspiring to iconic - scenes.
Thoughts: If you hire a physicist to act as a consultant on your film, and if your screenwriter concocts backstories for your characters, and if you house your actors in bare-bones student digs and send them up in airplanes that permit them to experience zero-g, all so that they feel like "real" astronauts, and if all that consulting and all those stories and all that experience don't end up on the screen-- i.e., if you expect us viewers to mine the film's websites for this science and these tales-- then you as a filmmaker (that means you, Mr. Boyle) haven't done your job.
Therefore we need more community support and more community organizations to help out in these troubled neighborhoods, so that our young men and women can have a future and move forward in life to accomplish their goals and dreams.
Still, the film itself is a bit of a mess anyway: Dracula Snr., depicted as a Max Schreck lookalike, is killed by Jonesâ Baron Frankenstein â the villain of the piece, with evil dwarf Skip Martin for an assistant; Price, on his last legs, turns up as Van Helsing (the film, in fact, was clearly shot in 1972 but released after his death) and Leigh is his luscious secretary â who attracts Nilssonâs amorous attentionsâ¦so much so that he decides to renounce his vampiric ways (except that with it goes his claim to immortality!
The crew of the submarine Lorelei believe that they are fighting for their homeland and the future of Japan and hence sacrifice themselves at the end of the movie by surfacing on the water (even though the area is surrounded by US fleets) so that they can take down the US airplane which was carrying the third atom bomb heading for another drop in Japan.
In fact Mr Zizek comes across as one of those people who if he were discussing films shouts down everyone else's opinions because " The lighting makes San Francisco look like Los Angeles so that's not the Golden Gate bridge in the background " You can't disagree with his arguments because you're not sure what he's talking about   And as a footnote Mr Zizek apparently makes a considerable living on touring seminars .
The murders are also pretty bloody & squirty, so that's a plus.
It was telegraphed way ahead of time, so that my reaction at the fateful moment was "is that all there is?".
manages to rewind the action when it is unfavorable, and alter it so that the husband is shot dead, and the wife is bound and dropped into the lake.
Haneke has basically made it so that native English speakers have their own version of his film.
Linda does not react with any feelings of betrayal, and in fact becomes his little assistant so that Ray can go from brain to brain and figure out who killed his wife.
The episode seems to be trying to make a kind of telenovela out of a chupacabra story and ends up throwing in too many stupid soap opera elements so that the actual story that could have been told gets completely lost.
I like Chief Dan George, so that was a plus right there.
Now tell me, how could any chemical substance alter a person so that he would be able to FLY?
This show does what I will call "reluctant killings" as they introduce character after character just for the "villain" to kill off so that they actually have a body count.
The Detectives where at the PD checking his moves by a satellite transmitter installed on his truck, and while the Detectives where talking the older one said they must let him go into Amber's so that he confessed to her his crimes, the younger one reply him and then suddenly the older one says they must caught him before he get her, contradicting himself previous parliament.
There is also a Marxist undertone from the gardener and general "hero" Mario, who is so heroic he has sex with the youngest daughter very quickly so that Dracula will not be interested in her!
I assume that the filmmakers deliberately reversed these incidents so that the couple's crimes would build up to the homicide that got them nicked.
They try to put some energy into it though so that helps, but most of the people in here just have little to no acting skills whatsoever.
I must say I'm not a great fan of opera, so that may have been quite good.
Having a slasher film set during the day, so that the killer cannot lurk in the darkness, is also a neat idea.
The one thing that does carry this film is by filling it with actors who do know what they are doing so that he can ride on their coat tails and stay in the minds of a tiny legion of fans blind to the truth.
A doctor today might push some unnecessary pills on you so that s/he will get some money from the drug company, but they would never go so far as to guarantee you are cured of syphilis and can now freely have sex with people when you actually weren't cured at all.
I'm probably being generous by giving this a 3 but it is in color and the people do speak on camera so that rates it higher than my all time low 1 of 10 standard, Beast of Yucca Flats.
Also that feathered hair does him NO favors!
The local roller rink is Jammer's and the owner Jammer Delaney (Sean McClory) is being hassled at gunpoint by some goons headed by the gangster Thatcher (Mark Goddard) who wants him to shut down the place so that a shopping mall can be built.
One sister wants the dad to be taken off life support soon so that he will die and she can collect all of his money.
First of all, the action doesn't even begin to start until about 30 minutes in, that alone wouldn't be cause for alarm, but this is an 80-minute B-movie, so that's more then 1/3rd of the film dedicated to lameness.True the girls remain topless for a good deal of the remaining film, but, aside from a good lengthy bubble bath scene, nothing you can't see in any other of their respective movies.
Unfortunately in addition to translating the dialog the narrator insists on telling us WHAT WE HAVE JUST SEEN, EACH AND EVERY TIME, so that the entire movie consists of the viewer watching things like: the girls gesture at the guys to pick up a dead panther, whereupon the narrator solemnly intones in his best pear-shaped tones: "and the women force the men to carry the panther back to their jungle home", which of course is WHAT WE WERE JUST LOOKING AT.
The dude playing the "seductive" vampire leader (Evan Stone) looks like a cross between Fabio and Quentin Tarantino... and he speaks his lines in a garbled whisper so that you can never tell what the heck he is actually saying.
Instead I encourage you to download it so that you can enjoy deleting it.
Jill, for reasons either best known to God, or in order to remove herself so that Paul and Ellen Can Be Happy Together, or just from terminal stupidity--a kind of Darwin moment--stands in the likely path of the tree and is squashed like an insect--a twittering insect.
However, that book wasn't half as controversial Ã³r interesting as the Da Vinci Code was, so that doesn't bode well for their next project.
The painting "Madonna on the Rocks" is actually entitled "Virgin on the Rock"; again, this was done so that Brown can create a convenient anagram.
But they are never really explored, so that idea falls through.
The bomb would have just pushed the disease further out so that would have never happened.
We get a whole new segment of story driven by the financial travails of only two of the previous five characters, who can't face being poor after having had the whole city to glean from and decide to freeze everybody again so that they can rob them.
The only interesting parts of this movie were those three kinky bits, and very few people are turned on by gauntlet cuffs ... so that leaves just two kinks, and I'm rating this snore-fest 2 out of 10.
He suggests she get a specimen of the shoes, so that her feet can be free, but she tells him she doesn't want them to be free.
A snotty and pampered pooch named Brandy and a brain dead rabbit named Mr. Whiskers who wears an orange jail outfit or so that's what it looks like.
That scene is pure trash, especially when George tells Reed that she would like to be a "darkie" so that he would come to her cabin and take her.
With Les and "Survivorman", you know the only footage you don't see is the endless footage of him selecting a vantage point for the tripod and camera so that he can effectively function as his own cameraman.
So much so that the film becomes predictable and you know what will inevitably happen.
Soon Dr.Cardan and Cap.Ancira begin to find the body, but this night is the Halloween so that five local kids go to the problematic cemetery for tests of their courage...
This film, of which total running time is 91 minutes, has only 8 minutes day-time scenes, and 90 per cent of the whole is night-time scenes with amateurishly poor lightning so that at least half of the film seems to be almost black-and-white.
Normally the editing process of a film patches the scenes together into a unified whole, so that the resulting film flows, but in this film nearly every scene opens and closes like its own little film, leaving little room for character development.
There're are a lot of things going on that point out the absurdity of modern teenage life, and the pressures we put kids under so that they achieve our goals.
Although I do come on this site a lot to check things out I never ever registered for an account, but after watching this movie I made an account just so that I could post this comment.
I am critiquing it so that no one else is fooled by what others are posting on this website.
The plot is obviously stolen from "Invasion of the Body Snatchers", only it's severely simplified so that fans of dud high-school shows like "Beverly Hills 90210" can get some thrills out of it.
My ultimate idea is that every disk of this movie should be destroyed in a fiery grave, so that no one will have to endure its torture ever again.
)....two go into the woods to smoke pot....that was about it for me......Just a bunch of crappy dialogue you cannot hear half of the time and crappy rap music with mexicans screaming/chanting over it........  Maybe the last 15 minutes or so that I did not see were kick ass.......Seriously doubt it.....AVOID AVOID AVOID......makes the acting in Children of the Living Dead seem like Oscar worthy performances.
He seems to serve as something of a springboard, so that we can see what George is thinking.
The plot is one that later became something of a clichÃ© in the Western, so much so that Mel Brooks chose to satirise it in "Blazing Saddles", the one about the stranger in town who leads the townsfolk in their fight against a gang of villains.
(Eg., he owned a house on Mulholland Drive with a glass ceiling in the guest bedroom so that he and his friends could creep into the attic and laugh at the goings on.)
Also I have no interest in bullfighting so that didn't help.
They both take place in San Francisco so that they can have a car chase over lots of hills and almost destroy both cars in the process.
As the movie attempts to ratchet up the suspense, Scott remains withdrawn and spaced-out so that sequences that should be nail-biting - as in the novel - almost pass by unnoticed.
I only wish he'd been more successful so that I could have laughed more than infrequently.
In this new scene, he goes up there with Ginny, so that she can hide the book for him.
One aspect of the script that works is how it keeps you at the edge of your seat so that you really do not know what is going to happen until the very end when it does happen.
Will Susan be treated to such a punishment as she pursues an escape route or will the kind orderly Ron(Richard Cox;who is actually an agent trying to infiltrate Fletcher's operation so that the lobotomies to innocent patients will end)be able to save her from a horrifying fate?
(OK, so that's not a complete stretch) Anyway, I digress.
There was no romance in this movie so you can really say, "Oh so that's how they fell in love!"
Other than chopping things up and presenting them out of order, so that what we think is going to happen isn't necessarily what does happen, this film really has very little going for it.
At least in "Hurcules in America" Arnold learned how to speak English before filming so that the dubbing, no matter how horrible, would be somewhat believable.
The Ricky-character for example is good for a few unintended laughs , but I think the director told him to say whatever words came to his mind, so that he could mumble through the film.
It seems that the wily Japanese want information about the Panama Canal so that they can shut down the canal and prevent the U.S. from shipping men, munitions, and ships through this important point.
The Japanese contact the wise-talking Eddie and he assures them that he was not only stationed in the Canal Zone during his six years in the Army but also that he knows a sergeant who can get him to the plans to the zone.
Overall "Pardon Us" is very out dated so it must be regarded as a nostalgic work that has not aged well; so much so that the MGM credit has been removed from the start of the film.
FAY BAINTER tries hard, as do BETTY LINLEY, TOM TULLY and others, but it's a hopeless mess, unfunny and irritatingly performed by the star duo so that one becomes impatient for that supposedly happy ending in which the two stars stop fighting long enough to exchange loving glances.
Again, there is an idea here: Whedon seems to want to posit a sort of eternal attraction between vampires and those who slay them, so that being the slayer according to the traditional rules simply confirms and strengthens the vampires' power.
Otherwise, from the opening scenes, this film is relentlessly nasty, gory, and really not very interesting--I fast forwarded through most of it so that I did not have to hear (or watch) the screaming.
(Banta was kind of hot, so that's why I'm a little more outraged about this scene.)
the movie portrayed godzilla as a crafty but mindless animal, so that when they finally killed him, the audience is saddened rather than happy about it.
The story is modified somewhat from the first episode so that now the source of the poltergeist unrest is attributed to the dead followers of a cult leader, as opposed to the dead disturbed by unscrupulous property developers.
The change has really only been made so that they can have a sequel to be perfectly honest, however, it does mean that the series is able to introduce the evil Reverend Kane.
(When I give a low score for this reason I always comment so that it's clear I'm not slamming the entire run of the show but only the later seasons.)
It's very versatile, it has funny scenes as well as more serious ones, so that DIl CHAHTA HAI makes you laugh on the one hand and on the other hand you'll start to think about ur life.
And unfortunately, very little of British television broadcasts or productions can be accessed in the United States, so that usually killed that option for me to be able to see him.
Rodya's character was forcibly twisted into a grotesque parody of "good guy" in the opening of the story, seemingly so that it could either serve as a vehicle for the young and painfully handsome Patrick Dempsey, or in the assumption that the American audience was too illiterate and stupid not to be able to understand the concept of "tragedy".
Now a grotesque cannibal lurking the underground sewer tunnels of the town of Newton, the powers-that-be are planning to drop nerve bombs if the monster isn't found and killed in time, so that the viral contagion Adams is currently carrying will be contained.
So much so that the review audience laughed all the way through and applauded at the end.
It takes place almost entirely indoors at night in sets of varying degrees of surreality, so that the New Zealand it is set is not one that any New Zealander will recognise, nor ever would have.
In 'Dr Rhythm', the banal plot and Bing's groaning are interrupted a couple of times so that Bea Lillie's specialities can get crowbarred into the movie.
Even a frothy story needs to keep us within the walls of the story, so that we can be lied to convincingly.
Just like any well-to-do Asian families, (I mean those in Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, Japan....) the old man of the family would send their children to their own overseas company to receive "wilderness training" so that later they can take over the family business.
Various other elements are brought into play, such as a society scandal, some incriminating photographs, a good cop, a corrupt cop, and an extremely powerful and wealthy society lady (who turns out to be behind the plot, her intention being to frame and ultimately kill Tom so that his paintings, many of which she owns, will rise in value).
At times I wished that I too had a whip so that I too could whip myself for renting this dreadful, horrifying, disturbing movie!!
Also, they failed to explain a lot of things about the movie, so that's another big disappointment.
The rest come up with the most contrived and unproductive reasons to make themselves unhappy so that they can hide their individual nature behind discussions about Filipino culture, which if you think about it isn't a very valuable way to approach it.
The plot though preposterous could have formed the basis of decent movie but one gets the impression that not enough time was put into tightening up the script so that the dialogue regularly lurches into the farcical.
So much so that after the first half-hour of the film, I was reading it again, trying to use the book to block out the TV screen.
There was promise in adding to Lemmon's original 'George' portrayal, but Martin does nothing to improve on the other actors previous comedic timings, and overall portrayal of a neurotic businessman bent on getting every Manhattanite's name down so that he can later sue them for whatever inconvenience he (or his wife) has been subjected to.
I really liked the character of Bill Raymond (played by Nat Pendleton), who was a detective sitting around a house waiting for someone to be murdered so that he could impress his superiors on the police force.
Also the guy playing the main Jeff character can't act worth garbage so that's another reason to cancel this travesty.
Thank God this movie didn't do much so that a sequel will come around.
Instead it's done in a style that elimintates the middle-man, or middle-martian, so that Ito (yes, a director called Ito, who in reality directed one of the worst films ever Monster-a-go-go) can get many shots of outside in the wilderness and so-so scripted fighting in the cabin.
Someone please start a petition to get this show canceled so that real animated productions can take its place!
So much so that I don't think I will even bother seeing part 3.
Things just fall into place too easily so that cause the conflict to be seen only in the surface, not deep enough to make it believable.
Basically we all know Anna and Johan will get back together, but first the plot has to be manipulated so that we can give some sex scenes to the roommate, to an different couple, to Anna with other people, and lets not forget the obligatory lesbian scene to say nothing of the big sex scene when they are finally reunited.
At every moment of the movie they remind you not just that it is a movie but also that it is a bad movie.
The plot became more preposterous as the film went on, so that by the end nothing that happens surprises the viewer.
So much so that I am amazed that I actually made it to the end.
He has been genetically enhanced so that he is immune to the gas.
You still get to see Jim Carrey do his quirky and funny impressions, so that's a plus.
is one of those films us Homo sapiens should put into a time capsule so that future generations/civilizations can witness a glorious achievement in 'film' which captures the zeitgeist of the nineteen eighties.
And a script that foolishly adds multiple, painfully obvious plot lines to the original story so that the taut and gripping plot of the novel is almost completely obscured.
Oh, so he's dealing stamps, he's still dealing with criminals, or people he must be smart enough to know are criminals, so that doesn't make it much better, does it?
Plot: Stallone is a 'specialist' (Oooh, so that's where they got the clever title from?)
I guess the writers thought hey maybe we should add one or two ridiculous elements so that the movie is cheesy enough to be at least enjoyable on some level.
In a nutshell so that you don't have to read the rest of my crap if you don't want to: Old story.
Tatum Adair's boobs - they have more scenes than several zombies....and no lines...so that's good.
Especially the movies threat, the gunfighter, is so exaggerated so that the threat seems just silly.
The whole sequence in which Christopher Reeve turns psycho and ultimately splits into two personas, having a big fight with himself, is the only reason the movie is worth seeing, and most people fail to acknowledge that Reeve actually did some truly good acting here, good enough so that the "bad Superman" is convincing and somewhat scary -- especially the scene where he is sitting in a bar, unkempt and unshaven, breaking holes in a mirror behind the bar while flicking peanuts at it (never mind that alcohol is not supposed to have any effect on Superman).
It's also a great film for Jeff Bridges, Jessica Lange or Dino De Laurentiis to watch so that they can see that by comparison, the poor 1976 KING KONG film is like a Merchant-Ivory production!
Maybe it's because some of the fights are so overdone so that everyone know that it isn't Mr.Seagal doing most of it anyway?
He listens to the people, watches at them, almost staring at them, so that the audience even gets the feeling of being a voyeur.
I saw this at the Sydney Fim Fest today and it was the third film in a row I saw, so that's maybe why I struggled to keep my eyes open :-) This film had such good ratings, especially all the 9's and 10's, that I decided to see it.
That first scene, in which he scares the crap out of an entire plane load of people just so that he can teach a 'lesson' to some Congressman just leaves you shaking your head in disgust.
The kidnapping takes place so that Hartman's character can stall his next flight long enough so that the bad guys can steal some gold, money, potatoes...who really cares?
Unless you want to see a version of the Plague that puts Oran in South America in 199..., changes the Rambert character to a woman who fingers herself in a cafe while checking for Buboes, changes Tarrou and Grand into giggling novelties, and replaces the enlightening separation theme from the second part of the novel and changes it so that the characters and merely horny, than this is for you.
Summary:-1000/1000 This is probably the only movie so that's so bad I'd think negatively of someone for enjoying it, so it gets a negative score.
OK, so that's typical movie logic, which you can easily explain away with "Well, she is terrified so she doesn't immediately think of that particular escape route.
The editing of a love scene too was uncalled for to get a PG rating, so that more audiences could fill the theatres.
She's experimenting with nerve gas and a way to deliver it in quantity so that they can turn New York, Boston, or Chicago, etc.
So the confused and insecure scriptwriter wastes his life savings so that the muse can reside in a luxurious hotel and be properly stocked with crystal and caviar.
And that scene at the mirror proves that Montgomery hadn't even the competence to master his gimmick, as it is plainly shot at an angle to hide the camera, so that the camera does not see Marlowe's reflection as he would have seen it.
Put it this way: about twenty minutes in, realizing that I was trapped in the middle of the row, I *willed myself to go to sleep so that the time would pass more quickly*.
It never took the time to properly explain anything so that if someone who nothing of the Tudor Era walked in to see it, they'd be left dumbfounded the entire 115 minutes.
So much so that Kevin Dobson's infidelity is totally understandable.
Everyone in the world should see this movie so that they would know how bad it is.
OK, he puts it into the blender, so that the plot unfolds in a non-linear order, but this doesn't add a damn thing to "Kill Bill" because there's no complexity.
First off - anime mixed in with real actors is not a new idea so that's one more idea that QT robbed.
Then it turns out that Newt has left all his millions to Hattie, with the proviso that she must leave her family in order to collect the dosh.
This was done, I suspect, so that this movie's "subtle" preachings were not to be done solely to the converted.
Also I look forward to the day it is released on DVD so that I can add it to my collection.
1st watched 3/28/2004 - 4 out of 10(Dir-Keith Snyder): Unique but slow moving drama about a detective who is only given one week to live and hires someone to kill him so that he won't go out slowly.
They have stooped to school child levels so that they can secure the attention of the young.
She was extremely intelligent,haughtily aware of her superiority though she never behaved in a condescending manner which would manifest her superior status -rather,she assumed it as a responsibility.She was ever judgemental of her own actions lest they should hurt another's feelings.A proud little soul, during her tribulations we repeatedly read in the pages of the book how her determined mind curbs a fit of pique, or accommodates her bodily wants and her emotional grievances through fanciful imaginings of better possibilities, so that destitute as she is she still gives freely from her heart , even if all she has to give are dreams and reveries, as we see in the successive visits she receives from Lottie and Ermengarde in her garret.It is the least a princess can do.
This story could have brought out much emotion(Wayne's character's father being murdered and him returning as a lawyer to do in the killer) but it's pretty much kept at bay so that we're presented with a flat and typical gun-shooting contest.
Anyway, we are now in the present and the recently awakened warlock uses his scarecrow body to kill various Goodmans(..and others in his path)looking to retrieve his magical book of spells and reunite with his bones so that he can return to fleshly form even more powerful than he is as a walking man of string.
Sorry but the SAS are taught to count their rounds to avoid this and he had loaded that weapon himself so that was NEVER going to happen, OK?
We watch as the "condemned" fight for survival, trying to outwit each other, as weapons are parachuted to McStarley, and his temporary Japanese partner Saiga(Masa Yamaguchi)purposely by Breckel so that they can gain an advantage as a strategy to make his show more thought-provoking and gripping.
The script here is most to blame - while 'professional' enough so that it's difficult to quote bad lines, it is a completely moronic story, utterly unbelievable - without knowing anything about the 'true story' this hypes itself as being 'based upon', I can guarantee that the one true thing you can say of this film is that it is not based on a true story.
"I delivered newspapers on this base for years buddy, so that corpse is my responsibility.
Unknown to anyone, this has altered the fish's plasma so that any living organism that comes into contact with it, either by ingestion or inhalation, reverts to its own primitive forebear.
He moves his wife and kids back to his home town in rural Ireland so that he can concentrate on writing a book.
I'm not sure why the prosecutor would even phrase so many arguments so that it would be constantly objected, given that she has all the legal training.  
(Which they most-assuredly were willing to return to us) If you think lying to the American people is bad, this movie was obviously made for FOREIGN CONSUMPTION, so that the miserable wretches who conspired to make and distribute this pile of of crap, could make money SELLING OUT America AND KILLING American BOYS.
Let's face it, this series was about a morally confused and charismatic vampire with perky tits who was great at throwing the look of worry and confusion around a lot so that she could suck in the Buffy and Angel fans.
The FBI special internet crimes division is on the job, but they are not only incapable of shutting down the site or blocking the access, but even of recording the transmission so that they can investigate closer - probably an attack on the Bush tax cuts.
Part of what makes the book wonderful is the frame narration by an outside source--so that Larry is always just a construction by another, a person we never really know, who remains as mysterious as his quest and his sense of enlightenment.
The character of Frank comes across as someone who enjoys tormenting young couples who just want to get married, and is not below employing children to do his dirty work so that he remains off the hook.
In this she seduced a shy guy and then preceded to assault him, biting his chest so that he required hospitilisation and stitches.
-I wonder how cheap the casting for the film must have been, well David Warner played both the villain and one of the main heroes, so that may be some indication as to how low the budget was.
Oil-hair boy has seduced the judge (a woman old enough to be his mother) into changing the city laws so that people can be arrested for even minor infractions such as jay-walking and then be sent to his cotton farm as free labor.
Or we really do not feel the loss when she's killed and yet the direction makes it so that it's like the most important thing in the entire film.
I specifically made several screen shots so that you could see that people with the most disgusting faces were selected for the roles of political officers.
You really don't care how it ends, just so that it ends.
Another man's hand is gnawed at by rats and he just leaves it there while the hungry little beasts go to work on it, just so that we can get a good look at it.
The Chinatown is made to seem as if it were literally over-run with villains, so that Wong's henchmen are to be found on every balcony and in most doorways.
They are hacking with gigabit connection, so that the nice animations of a broken fire walls and virtual rooms with databases and folders can load on their screens for the sake of the public.
There are two things, and ONLY two things that make this series tolerable enough so that I could sit through the full three hours.
If they give you a snappy script with funny dialogue, tolerable acting, characters you can care about, and enough humorous moments so that you don't miss that $8.50, then any film can make the grade.
Very early in this film they give us Jeff Garlin and Steve Zahn dressed as broccoli and a carrot, so that they can promote some kind of vegetable flavored cereal.
I think she is trying to play it in such a way so that we think it is campy enough for there to be humor in her performance.
The story is rushed unexplained and poorly thought out, the acting is below par, and the cinematography is annoying with its tilted angles and range so close to the action so that you can't see what is going on.
Characters that play very significent role in book(like Murtagh, Ajihad and Angela) are hardly even mentioned in the movie, so that it becomes centered on pretty much only 3 characters-Eragon, Saphira and Brom.
There are way too much "memorable quotes" in the movie, so that movie becomes kind of too much theatrical.Everybody, from director to actors failed, but still, I personally bealive that the biggest failure is Peter Buchman, screenwriter.
The abortion seems to be done so that GrÃ¼newald never knows it, which is impossible.
Frankly, I'd rather the film didn't make any money so that would teach Michael Keaton a lesson.
in very simple words   the worst computer animated movie of all time it was horrible beyond imagination it should be given a rating of R so that no child has to endure the pain of watching this movie  only 3 things happened!!
Then he thanks the star whom he had wished for doing something magic before the match so that the people could forgive him (sorry for not informing before) and his father too is proud of him.
When Antonio returns, he ties Mario to a tree and whistles so that a couple of nearby cannibals can come eat him (?!)
It's been ages since I have seen a film of such poor quality, so much so that the many parts of the whole have come together to form a movie so insipid, so completely devoid of merit that only a team of evil geniuses, locked away in an isolated mountain fortress, driven mad by loneliness, despair, and bad TV sitcoms could have ever created such an atrocity.
Cremaster 2 proves two points: that art and art films alike are not judged as works alone but run as a popularity contest by a small elite few and also that the less people understand something the more intellectual it must be.
To her surprise (and the surprise of Miki and Luisa) Maggie gains a loyal following of customers, so much so that she is given the name 'Irina Palm'.

Things would happen, then change in the drop of a hat, so much so that you'll find yourself thinking "what just happened here?"
I wouldn't attack the plot too much because after all it is called 'Ghostboat' and so you expect it to be a little far fetched/supernatural so that's fine BUT... at the end when the Navy and the Russian Navy (or whatever they're called in Russia) closed the case on the strange goings on, there was no mention of and never any mention of, all the other boats they blew up along the way...and as for the hostile German aircrafts...well I can only assume that they were imagined?

Nonetheless, filmmaker should learn what sports teams realize the hard way - you have to play hard and well the whole game - not just one half and this film's first half stunk enough so that at least one reviewer went home at halftime.
The plot is quite simple-minded: Dracula's dog (actually, this film's original title) revives sinister-looking but mute vampire acolyte Reggie Nalder so that they can go to America in search of their new master Â but the latter is actually determined to (pardon the pun) bury his past and, wisely, has changed his surname to Drake!
It's rather amusing to see a plethora of canines getting vampirized as opposed to people Â so much so that, at times, it feels like one's watching an antropomorphic rendition of the Bram Stoker chestnut!
Funny, instead of just plucking a stake from any number of skeletons in the tomb (which this movie proves is a surefire way to revive a staked vampire), instead they decide to take the long way around and seek out the last living Dracula descendant, plotting to vampirize him so that they will have a new master to serve.

A few Vampires are staked through the heart but they have green blood so that doesn't count, Countess Bathorly (like her obvious literary source) bathes in the blood of virgins to stay young but there is only one scene of her doing this & the blood is already in the bathtub so it just looks like red water.

Stockwell is really Caucasian but pretends to be Indian so that he can avoid school.

Other than that, "Eurovision" is nothing more than a fastuous pop concert, carefully rehearsed and re-rehearsed, so that in the end, it might be a good idea if a hearse carted it off to some out-of-city rubbish-dump and left it there unceremoniously and unprostituted for future generations.
