I also had the chance to visit the region, specifically Croatia, in 1999.
The mise-en-scene and colour gives it a disturbing sense of resembling ancient Rome, specifically in appearance; in all its rich, beautiful, robe-decked in-glory.
The dramatic story uses the romance and chemistry of two charismatic characters performed by IvÃ¡n FenyÃ¶ and the gorgeous Kata DobÃ³ associated to sports, more specifically water polo, and a magnificent team of actors, actresses and stunts, to disclose the foregoing historic events.
However, far from having to be persuaded to join the rescue attempts, Amundsen had immediately volunteered only for Mussolini to specifically insist he be excluded because of his earlier public disputes with Nobile in the aftermath of their previous expedition, leaving Amundsen to finance his rescue attempt privately.
Sublime to its very hushed core, Into Great Silence does take some getting used to, specifically because the monks hardly utter a word; the beginning of the film is a four minute opening shot of a monk praying in his solitary room.
The impact to the world, and specifically our nation, appears worse than global warming as we will be challenged to transport food to segments of the population far away from rural farms.
If I had to compare the movie to anything else, I'd probably say Wes Anderson's work, specifically BOTTLE ROCKET.
If you REALLY want to criticize a Herk Harvey film, why not write about his Carnival of Souls, the only movie of his he specifically filmed for wide release, and one of the all time classic atmospheric horror movies?
This 1999 version unfortunately goes off into gratuitous tangents specifically for an audience these days that expects or wants to see excess.
What makes Victor SjÃ¶strÃ¶m's film specifically Scandinavian is a sense of fatalism bordering on the mystical: we're told that no matter how fast a man can run, he can't escape his fate, and that is certainly the crux of the matter where the "outlaw" Berg-Ejvind is concerned.
I am amazed how such a gem of a movie was made specifically for TV.
Arias succeeds with his own programming, created specifically for such a task.
What happened in the room specifically???
Additionally, one of the major points of this film should be how many gay concentration camp victims were still treated as prisoners after the war, specifically because of Paragraph 175.
But I think most people missed this is also about the workplace, specifically the Alpha Male in the workplace, and how he got that way.
The cast chosen are all attractive, with athletic, toned bodies, their attitudes and mores appropriate for each stock character, represented by the actors / actresses without a hint of depth..they are designed specifically one-dimensional, representing the hunky bad boy, hick cowboy, Latina chick with an attitude, gay and slightly chubby goofball, shy Asian girl with martial arts skills, black intellectual(..his dialogue, particularly when he speaks "scholarly" is as artificial as it gets), hot beach bunny who comes from money and is easy to seduce, etc.
The score is still just as witty and romantic and features a wonderful new version of THE GLAMOROUS LIFE written specifically for the film.
Or more specifically, the thin line that separates the American Dream from pure hell.
The actor who plays Cagney's law-abiding brother seems to be in a different movie; specifically, a circa-1910 inspirational stage melodrama with a title like "The Road to Ruin, or, the Drunkard's Progress."
Jenny specifically asks for Tye to "entertain" that night--but Tye is "busy" (this INFURIATES her), so instead some gorgeous hot young black man with a honeyed-voice shows up and sings instead.
However, even if you swear by the original and know it by heart, I'd still like to encourage you to watch this version for the following reason: after about sixty minutes of sticking loyally to the original, Savini's "Night of the Living Dead" all of a sudden stops being a homage and NEW script-elements, either specifically added or recovered ideas that didn't made the final cut of the 1968 version, are brought in!
Okay, first off to really appreciate this episode you need to be a huge 'Supernatural' fan, or more specifically a Sam Winchester fan as nearly the entire episode centers around him.
My main gripe is I didn't like the ending: the parting scene specifically.
But it specifically deals with one woman's struggle to redeem herself against a reputation as a "Jezebel" during an era where certain things were considered "Taboo" and improper for a young lady of the south.
I am watching this movie now and beside myself at how poor the casting was in this film, it is terribly and terrificly acted by most with maybe the exception of Tina's sister, a virtually unknown actress, maybe the actors have no comedic timing, but Pare specifically makes on camera acting mistakes I haven't seen since on camera acting 101, she is unbelievably plastic and lacks any emotive qualities whatsoever, there are no layers or dimensions in her character structure whatsoever her likability is nil, I'm watching a train wreck by a director who should've taken more care with his film instead of just collecting a paycheck which is what this film looks like
On the lam they hold up with also ex-con Steve Lacey (decent leading man Gene Nelson) with his wife, but what they don't know is that he's already been tapped by the cops, specifically Sterling Hayden's Detective Sims, who is so hard-nosed he could cut through bricks with just a stare and some tough words.
Mrs. Sorvino was highly commended for her work in Woody Allen's 1995 movie, but her performance in The Grey Zone rises above her other work, that's the picture Mrs. Sorvino should be recognized and awarded for.The other members of the cast have my respect, but I wanted to specifically point the performances of Sorvino and Arquette as the picture's true highlight in terms of acting.
By specifically focusing on the beating and death of the taxi driver named Dilawar at the Bagram prison in Afghanistan Gibney showed much more detail than Morris about the specifics of one prisoner and the full extent of the physical brutality of US interrogators and guards.
Russell deliver's Hildy's lines so naturally it was as though MacArthur and Hecht wrote that dialog for her, specifically.
Director Howard Hawks' adaptation of The Front Page was the first time that lines were written specifically to be overlapped and Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell grab hold of those lines and never let go.
The duality was shown towards the end specifically when they were both shown taking portraits.
La cittÃ  delle donne is one of the most robust, unrepressed and rough-around-the-edges explorations of the specifically Latin nature of machismo, feminism, gender rivalry and sexual politics I have ever seen.

dirty jobs) to make sure such ops will be deniable if discovered; agents being betrayed by their own hierarchy for reasons of "higher national interest"; the dirty tricks spy agencies of yet allied countries do to each other; and more specifically to the DGSE, the rivalry between the military officers (represented by Cassel, Bellucci and the Colonel played by Andre Dussollier) and the civilian technocrats (represented by the no-name black-haired cigarette-smoking guy in his early forties played by Bruno Todeschini), the former ones having lost control of the agency to the latter over the years (the DGSE was originally run by the French military).
And yet, "White Rabbit" proves its value by laying the groundwork for a lot of the themes that will be dominant in the future: Jack's leader role; the Jack-Locke "man of science, man of faith" dynamic (the dialogue in this scene is particularly well-written); father-son relationship problems; ghostly manifestations on the island (already introduced in "Walkabout", but now made more clear), specifically connected to the characters; flashbacks that go back to the character's childhood; the realization that the survivors will probably have to stay there for a long time; etc.
It is "Amazing Grace" acted out before our eyes as this is self-help, bootstraps up through specifically African-American Christian culture that grew out of birthday party celebrations, going from clown dancing to crumping.

In some scenes, specifically the one in which Iago gets pinned against the wall with a watermelon, the animation is disturbingly unrealistic and fake.
1st watched 12/1/1997 - (Dir-Robert M. Young): Well put-together story of the cost that is paid for sin, more specifically adultery.
Clancy is sometimes critiqued for being so unapologetically pro-American and specifically pro-Military.
A cocky, jerky, hyper-active/rambunctious test pilot (Quaid) who never outgrew his high school jock phase is miniaturized with the intention of being injected inside a rabbit, but when things go awry due to terrorist interference, he gets injected inside a man instead, specifically a hapless grocery store clerk (Short).
It is nothing less than the systematic assertion of one culture at the expense of others, specifically Native Americans.
The CGI kills, specifically, are typically neither creative nor convincing.
I don't know what specifically director Frank Tashlin wanted to say here; he may have just intended it as a way to pass time.
; some of these were genuinely unsettling, to be sure Â but, while this practice may be forgiven when viewed in excessively dark prints (as some online reviewers have complained), it wasn't in the surprisingly clean edition that I came across only recentlyÂ   James Franciscus has the lead role here; for the record, he had played a villain in another Italian JAWS rip-off Â or, more specifically, PIRANHA (1978) Â i.e.
It is guilty of exactly what it criticizes the anti-ID camp for, specifically: (1) not really explaining exactly why it's ridiculous for ID to be taught in science class, and (2) arrogantly insulting the pro-ID side rather than respecting its dignity and engaging in reasonable debate.
When viewing a television story, she notices the house in her nightmare and the surrounding area, specifically a marsh where she keeps seeing and following this little girl.
It is a unique creation specifically originally made in non-sequential chapters for DVD (ie not a plot-linear movie transferred to digital format).
My only criticism is it's a bit over-respectful perhaps of specifically Hindi spirituality.
The raw style captures the lifestyle and heartbeat of the ozzie beach scene in sydney, or more specifically, Bondi beach.
The one thing I can specifically point out as a fault in this movie was the portrayal of Americans or the Allies troops.
As the Tall Man's history unfolds in a series of scene's from the original Phantasm, a majority of these scene's were cut from the original release of Phantasm and are being scene for the first time, other scene's are just scene's created specifically for this film.
Several actors did not appear to be of an age near the individual characters they portrayed; specifically, the mother and aunt of Mulroney's character.
"Le Boucher" though, is first and foremost quintessential Chabrol, and as such it's less concerned with plotting than either Clouzot or Hitchcock, another cinematic forebear, the focus more specifically being the interior psychological states of his protagonists.
Whatever your political stance, this is a film that can be appreciated for the questions it raises: questions about political strategy, specifically.
Unless it was specifically intended to go with the film, I always turn the sound off - don't let some arbitrary piece of music spoil your enjoyment.
If this movie (specifically these scenes) don't punch a hole in your chest than you aren't human.
The title is all that's needed to give this film perspective, to place it specifically and allow it to be what it is without reference to the frame that gives it meaning.

I will only mention one scene specifically: when she futilely attempts to telephone her lover, the Baron, in the middle of the night.
Trying to link vinyl chloride monomer, the stuff that's reacted to form PVC, and allegedly poor manufacturing processes from 30 yrs ago to DES, a pharmaceutical that was created specifically to interact with and was prescribed to people was a bit of a stretch.

I would recommend this to any fan of good movies, especially dramas, but more specifically to people who have divorced or divorcing parents.
One is a lot younger, more energetic and very much enjoys company, specifically of the male variety and specifically for the length of a single evening.
The film progresses into a final act that genuinely caught me unawares, specifically due to the way in which it branched out into a murder plot, something that Sarah herself is used to writing so successfully, only this time we do not see things play out from a detective's point of view.
The movie isn't that great unless you have worked in that field specifically as a creative or as an account executive.
I think the film's finest moments occur when Massaccesi shoots the use of candle-light at night through the darkened rooms of the French couple's home with Julie and Bodin's Daniel encountering a frightened innocent hiding from Eastman's monster, and specifically the Roman catacombs where Eastman's lair of eaten bodies is located(..this is very akin to the work of Lucio Fulci with the presence of remains, corpses, skulls, bones & red-eyed rats running about).
Before watching this show, my first impression was that it is wonderful that society has taken a proactive stance against people who hurt animals and made a division of law enforcement specifically to stop it.

What a difference a few episodes can make (specifically the "Til Death" episode).

Writer/director Moussa Sene Absa shows how modern day(1994) Senegal reacts to having French and American culture thrust upon the native Wolof people, specifically in Popenguine.
"Se7en" is also remarkable for its accurate description of the police world, more specifically the homicidal section.
The only drawback I feel this movie has is the somewhat out of place voice acting of some of the main characters, it seems that the producers wanted the film to be attached to some big name actors rather then finding voice actors that would suit the specific characters,specifically I felt that Bill Nighy voice was out of place as the Professor and perhaps Nic Cage could have brought more energy to the role.
Certainly not historically accurate, The Inglorious Bastards features a few elements that stand out as definitely not of the World War II era: side burns, long hair, and handlebar mustaches specifically did not often make it into the ranks of the United States Army in the 1940s.
Prime example, in the beginning after Lucy returned from Narnia as she re-entered the wardrobe, the character specifically knew that she had been gone for apparently hours, so as she re-enters, the first thing she does is to shout out to everyone who inevitably will be worried about her, that she's OK. After they question her, she then realistically asks, "wait, what?
I'm pointing this out because I can specifically think of other movies with analogous situations where the lines the character would've said would've been ALL wrong, and the intonation with which the actor delivers the line would've been so unrealistically understated.
No one specifically ever defined its limitations.
Certainly, if the movie carried a specifically designed tone to make the viewer's heads explode it would've been worse.
Not only are there no surprises here, we are also seeing another in a long line of films made specifically to showcase the talent of one of the stars looking for a new pocket of audience for their great success elsewhere.
very good chemistry between Spock and Scotty's (specifically the scene in the jeffries tube).
It would seem that this portion of the film presents the harshness of an authoritarian regime as misdirected and even naÃ¯ve rather than inherently evil, although it is equally likely (and, indeed, probably more so) that it is a message to those very regimes (specifically that of Franco) of the reality of their form of government.
Review: Rice Rhapsody (2004) By Ken Lee  Though director Kenneth Bi's _Rice Rhapsody_ (2004) generates much interest primarily of its homosexuality theme (that troubled the Singapore Board of Film Censorship inasmuch as its month-long deliberation for the film's wide release in the city state in which the film is set and made), it explores at its core generational conflict; specifically, how a single parent's inability to adapt to modern circumstances leads to disillusionment and more misunderstanding.
He's handed what can be coyly referred to as an ingenue role (the kind that does not demand much more than standing straight and looking pretty), more specifically, an American dilettante with scarcely any money to live on and no way to get home.
The 1982 comedy MY FAVORITE COMEDY was a lovingly made period piece that takes place during a wonderful time in entertainment history...the infancy of live television in the 1950's (or more specifically, YOUR SHOW OF SHOWS).
This film shows their unusual relationship, specifically how their differences bring them peculiarly closer because of this transfixing, overwhelming attraction that morphs into love.
Vadim specifically ordered the wardrobe department to dress the girls in micro skirts and tight fitting shirts.
The style actually has a little more than a bit to owe as part of a tradition in the small but captivating realm of Star Wars animation (most specifically from the Boba Fett segment from the much maligned Star Wars Holiday Special), and so Clone Wars can be seen as a kind of logical continuation of back-story getting a good hit of invention and visual surprise.
The show is about characterization, specifically that of Lookwell.
This series proposes a pair of arguments: That ( 1 ) the principles of Game Theory applied to domestic policy resulted in a loss of freedom and ( 2 ) the same principles applied to foreign policy, specifically in Iraq, caused Islamic extremism making the West a target for terrorists.

Predating the same mistake they made with Seinfeld's second season (specifically, the last four episodes) by 25 years, NBC aired the first episodes of Star Trek out of order (the approved pilot, Where No Man Has Gone Before, was broadcast as Episode 3).
In this short-film, Castro is grilled specifically on dissidents, and the moment of truth comes earlier on, when questioned on the 'closed trials' and why Castro did not allow the prisoners to see their families, Castro, in his unique orator voice asked of Stone, "Why is it that over 800 prisoners held by the United States at Guantanamo Bay have not been allowed to see their families for over two years?"
I was really young when The Jar was on TV, so I don't specifically remember all that much about it, other than it appeared to be very murky and curious.
There is significant historical value in Sobel's approach for anyone interested generally in US history or specifically in the JFK assassination.
My motivation for responding is due to an earlier opinion on this movie, specifically: "the central character of Delilah is the worst kind of racial stereotype; a relentlessly cheerful mammy, perfectly satisfied to spend her life tending to the needs of her white employer".
A former circus entertainer who was spared the gas chamber and is now stuck in a mental institution specifically for holocaust survivors?
Whereas the miniseries took place in England, the movie is set in the United States, specifically Chicago.
"Blood and Concrete" is a lame little low budget comedy about a small time hoodlum (Zane) who hooks up with a neurotic babe (Beals) and then learns they have something more in common than mutual admiration...specifically a drug called "Libido".
Unless you are specifically interested in seeing the the reasons previously mentioned, don't bother with this mess.
Set in Australia in the 1870s, specifically in Victoria we don't see as much as one kangaroo in Stingaree.
I'm positive you can see the horse's penis dangling between it's legs, not that I specifically look out for these things you understand...  Technically High Spirits is fine with decent production values.
This language was invented specifically for this film (not a new phenomenon in Hungary), so it cannot be honest in this sense either.
Several historical sources refer specifically Anne Boleyn's dark eyes, as they were rare in the English court during the 16th century.
specifically i mean the one that the sister turns into when they are in the car.
As the latter, she whoops and hollers and runs around, but to me, this makes her seem like a hyperactive child (of either sex), rather than specifically *male*.
The film is wonderfully lit, specifically in the torture chamber-scenes.
Hostel is, probably, made specifically for an American teen-audience, where drugs and naked women represent half of the movies pull.
There doesn't seem to have been many movies back then which were so specifically targeted at children.
Two: the writing; specifically, the dialogue.
The monster's "lair" had some nice production design, specifically the corpse decorations ala a more primitive Jeepers Creepers (2001).
I didn't notice the use of footage from Renny Harlin's movie, but I did notice the use of footage from "Narrow Margin", specifically the shootout at the cabin in the woods.
I specifically remember it becoming 'The film to sneak into' for kids.
The highlight of the film is the night the couples spend in Brighton - more specifically, the mildly entertaining musical item performed by one of the wives, who turns out to be quite an accomplished trumpeter.
Toni Collette's face is still in my memory - her terrified-to-do-or-say-the-wrong-thing rabbit eyes, her rapture at feeling connected to her 3 fellow temp workers (and specifically, seeing her nose crinkle the way it does when she smiles), the desolation of seeing their bond destroyed by wretched but inevitable bone-chilling office politics and fear.
That depends on your level and personal tastes within the horror genre, and specifically the slasher/serial murderer sub-genres.
Everything has been laid out for Dean Martin in this film - it is written specifically for him, constructed for his screen persona to allow him to capitalise on his strengths.
The Last Samurai is a movie about the fascination of Americans for Japanese culture, more specifically Japanese heroism.
Soon he faces them, is beaten and captured, but samurai leader Katsumoto, played by Ken Watanabe, spares his life and patiently lets him experience the Japanese lifestyle, specifically bushido, the samurai warrior code.
11 vignettes specifically designed to highlight the general public's inability to indulge in meaningful conversation (or basic communication for that matter), the dialogue is little more than moronic jabbering.
I think Dorothy Malone is a sex icon thanks to her work with Douglas Sirk, specifically her delicious nymphomaniac in "Written in the Wind", but is handed a terribly thankless(..practically meaningless, if the script hadn't made her son the one effected by the toxic waste) role in this steaming pile.
More specifically are those people who, when in reference to some of the recent animated features, say things like "Oh it's such a great film, because, not only do the kids love it, it's funny for adults as well!
There is NO Esperanto in this movie  I watched this movie specifically because IMDb lists Esperanto as one of the languages used.
With what is a bit heavy-handed symbolism, the film is specifically set in what I presume is a real amusement park called "The World" on the outskirts of Beijing that replicates landmarks in scaled miniature and focuses on the employees and their extended, inter-connected network of friends and family.
In these modern disaster movies, we are treated to scenarios in which garden variety pests (bees, bats, locusts and the like) become monsters created out of genetic engineering or toxic waste dumping, or the very planet itself rebels against its victimization at the hands of mankind, specifically, Greedy Evil Scientist guys and their investors.
However, the three films made from them vary widely in quality, meaning specifically to their relationships to the books upon which they are based.
It specifically says in the novel that he learned how to write/read in prison.

Tribes (meaning anything from bands of nomads to empires, but specifically in Kenya, the Kikuyu) were forces to pay taxes to the British and make way for any "settler" that wanted their land.
I'm assuming that the HELLWORLD script was written specifically for the franchise, and I have to tell you, this was far from a good story.

Where 'She Hate Me' specifically missteps is that the story is from the point of view of an unsympathetic character.
First off, to answer the previous person's question:  "Daybreak" was the only song Harry Nillson specifically wrote for this film.
However, one morning he picks up a stranger - or, more specifically, a criminal (Tom Arnold) who may or may not actually be such a bad guy after all.
Beau Bridges turns in the most interesting performance and does the best he can do with what he is given; specifically the nonsensical monologue he is given at the end of the film.
Probably it is specifically made for girls but my sister didn't even like it although she is a huge Bratz fan.
Haley, added Kent, "specifically asks for a story that will fit his predetermined American narrative."
There is a sequel, not so sure I'll give it a chance based on the huge flaw of this script that is specifically due to one character..a character that could be had by anyone after enough liquor on a Saturday night.
The song "If You Want To Sing Out, Sing Out" was written by Cat Stevens specifically for the film "Harold And Maude" (one of only two songs written for that film, the other being "Don't Be Shy").
For me, taking the kids to see a film specifically made for children is the only safe haven I have from vulgarity and lude acts that seem to filter through on the television.
Unbeknownst to Stone, the other members of the team are a stereotypically gung-ho, trigger-happy bunch of hillbilly yahoos specifically hired by St. John to bag the beast.
The one redeeming factor is in the visual effects area (specifically in the realm of CGI).
Cruz puts in a rather languid performance which is stronger than most of her acting due to the fact she is working with a Spanish (specifically, Catalan) director.
This leads me to think that perhaps this was a film specifically designed for those which have a great knowledge over the "X" saga, but I would have thought the directors would wish to be inclusive rather than exclusive (I refrained from using the inane 'X' pun).
The guide-dog would not run after the other dog, they are specifically trained not to.

I specifically made several screen shots so that you could see that people with the most disgusting faces were selected for the roles of political officers.

Klaatu manages to escape, and he soon finds himself eluding the authorities throughout northern New Jersey, specifically Newark and the forested Highlands, with Helen and her stepson Jacob.
The 2005 bill specifically targeted those peopleÂthe very same people "Maxed Out" entirely ignores.
It's hard to say because the segment is so short and unfocused that I wasn't really sure what the deal was, how long it lasted and why specifically it ended.
In fact, it's specifically stated in the book that Henry's persistence is due to Fanny's mildness and sweetness of manner, which makes her seem reluctant to refuse him.
I was even a little angry because I suspect that the movie's marketing is aimed specifically at "stoners" as evidenced by the box cover and the casting (Ferris and Danny Masterson who have appeared in films and shows that are popular in the pot culture).
WARNING, POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD...  First of all I thought some of the prison scenes were a little on the far fetched side and really strained my credulity - specifically one where Pedro and company confront a rival black gang leader and his crew in the cell block for several minutes with hoots and jeers and toilet paper flying all around.
I have been wanting to get all the above thoughts down somewhere where someone MAY read them, although as you begin reading and notice this is not about this film specifically but about J A, you may skip over this 'review.
It's not about it being bellow the standard grindhouse experience, the splattery violence is indeed present here, no it's about the presentation, specifically about the lack of such.
Moore's films have always been under extreme scrutiny, specifically Bowling For Columbine, Fahrenheit 9/11, and now Sicko.
Moore's films have always been under extreme scrutiny, specifically Bowling For Columbine, Fahrenheit 9/11, and now Sicko.
He's specifically interested in a section of the desert that is reputed to have some real nutjobs roaming around looking for trouble (a few of whom hail from the local Marine Corps base).
Instead, I have a real problem with the cast - specifically Mimsy Farmer as the female lead.
VotD girl gnaws on a mushroom that the Irish-but-British guy specifically said not to eat because it's poisonous.

Two ugly English (natch) play scientists who are specifically there to die.
In fact, much of the movie is centered specifically around this topic.
The direction and, specifically, the editing of the piece show years of creative experience in the field.
(specifically Christianity).
I read one comment that pans her Yorkshire accent; well, I attended it with an Englishwoman who is very familiar with such an accent and she specifically told me that her accent never slipped, so I've no idea where that comment came from.
Finally, one thing I want to specifically mention is the dialogue found in The Trouble with Harry.
But for anyone that's seen any of Anderson's films, specifically Bottle Rocket and Rushmore and Life Aquatic, this is that kind of speedy intro that includes very precise pans and movements with the camera and facial expressions that mark this as something, well, "different".
Historically, this film was the first with that rating-- the MPAA created the rating specifically for this film since they deemed it to risquÃ© for an R. By today's standards, this film is an R. If you're looking for softcore, watch "Emmanuelle" or something.
Through the life of Harry Bridges I learned so much about the beginnings of worker rights (longshoremen specifically) and labor history; unionization.
As with many direct-to-video projects, Blockbuster cuts out some nudity in versions manufactured specifically for them.
Wouldn't you think that if you were part of a movie and people were specifically asking for that movie to re-released then something could be done.There were other movies of equal Australian bloke etiquette value like The Odd Angry Shot and The Last of The Knucklemen and it's a shame that one of the mighty lot is missing.
-any time something comes along that can be considered a clichÃ©, the "hero" specifically acknowledges this clichÃ© and says something to the effect of "we're going to avoid this plot development, as it is a clichÃ©".
This is one of the best WWII PS2 games I have ever played.I specifically recommend it to fans of first-person shooters.
Todd Solondze absorbed criticisms about exploitation, showing misery for misery's sake, and just generally being a "meanie", and turned them into the cinematic equivalent of a "dis song"(rap term for song made specifically as an attack or "beef" with another rapper), with Solondz against critics, carefully trying to explain the notions of "Storytelling".
